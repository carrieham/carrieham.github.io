I rise today to celebrate National Teacher Appreciation Week. In particular. I recognize Ryan Berglund who was just named Wake Countys Teacher of the Year last night. A Sustainable Agriculture Academy teacher at Millbrook High School in Raleigh. Ryan didnt always plan to be a teacher. He was a professional welder and equipment fabricator. Today. 64 of his students have become welders. leaving high school with the skills needed to succeed in the workforce. Madam Speaker. 1 week isnt enough to properly thank all of our countrys outstanding educators for what they do every day. Lets keep fighting for better pay for teachers in North Carolina and across the country. Ryan wisely says: I always will put as much as possible as I can into it. but I need them to put in more than I am. and when they are doing that. you will see true success."},{"1":"2023","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chair. I think it was the National Labor Relations Act. and I think it may have been Franklin Roosevelt who dealt with the National Labor Relations Board. Do you know how many union elections--I will tell you about one in the city of New Haven. The graduate students at Yale University. who I worked with for several years. were shot down by the NLRB year after year after year. maybe for 6 or 7 years. until finally last year. they were able to be able to form the union. Now the issue is how are they going to be able to deal with the first contract and bargaining. It has been a slow walk to get unions recognized and give people the opportunity to be represented by a labor union. It only takes grit and tenacity to get through it in order to be able to get the opportunity to be represented by a union. Mr. Chair. I oppose this amendment. and I yield back the balance of my time."},{"1":"2022","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Madam Speaker. I rise in strong support of H.R. 7694. the Strengthening Subcontracting for Small Businesses Act of 2022. This legislation would amend the Small Business Act to ensure that companies awarded government contracts utilize small businesses in their subcontracting plans. H.R. 7694 would ensure that small businesses are not excluded from the government contracting process. which is an important concern in Congress. With more than 65 percent of small businesses having experienced at least a moderately negative impact from the COVID-19 pandemic according to Statista Research. it is more vital than ever that we continue to strengthen small business. This legislation will provide that urgently needed support. As small businesses account for 44 percent of U.S. economic activity. they are the powerhouse behind the American workforce. creating two- thirds of the new jobs over the last 15 years. Small business is vital in times of crisis. giving our economy the ability to be more flexible. innovative. and productive. In my home district in Houston. there are over 600.000 small businesses engaged in industries across the spectrum. Many of these small businesses received subcontracts following the devastation of Hurricanes Ike and Harvey. and their work helped rebuild Houston as well as restore local economic growth. Just this week. there was a briefing on the COVID-19 pandemic response that underscored how important small business subcontracts were. and continue to be. to our capacity for COVID testing. quarantine. and much more. Small businesses are always serving our communities. and this legislation on subcontracting will allow them to do more of what theyre already doing: improving life for us all. We need legislation that reinforces the value and capability that small businesses provide to the American economy. especially through contracts with the federal government. I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 7694. the Strengthening Subcontracting for Small Businesses Act."},{"1":"2021","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"First. Mr. President. it was good when I walked in--it felt really good when I walked in a few hours ago as we were voting. and I saw Mr. Carper. Senator Carper. the chairman of the EPW Committee. sitting here and Senator Capito. the ranking member. sitting there. working together to make sure that this bill passed and working together to defeat some amendments that might have hurt the whole bills chance of passing. That is how it used to be around here all the time. and it is good to see it. And I thank both the chair and the ranking member for doing that as well as the whole Senate as well. including Leader McConnell. We are trying to work in a bipartisan way whenever we can. and this bill is a classic example. First. its importance. of course. is paramount--and I will get to that in a minute--but. second. the fact that we can come together on an important bill that is a part of the Build Back Better plan is something that I think Members on both sides of the aisle can be very happy about. and Americans should be happy about as well. It doesnt mean that we will be able to do the whole thing bipartisan. but we will do as much as we can--as much as we can. And this bill is an important one. Clean water is vital to the American people and to their health. and for too long we have tolerated lead in the water of too many. When lead gets into the water of young people. it can certainly cause health problems in later years. All too often. it occurs in poorer communities and communities of color. This bill. in a bipartisan way. says we are going to come together and get the lead out--get the lead out of our pipes. get the lead out of our faucets. get the lead out of our water. That is an important part of this bill. And the second part of the bill is. you know. water is very. very important to bringing businesses. Upstate New York. we are trying to attract businesses. One of the first things a business will ask is: Do you have some land available that has water and sewer? When you can say yes. you have a much better chance of attracting businesses to those communities that definitely need new jobs. And. finally. of course. we all depend on water in our daily lives. and many of the systems are old. They are a century old. Many of our local governments no longer have the dollars to do this on their own. So having a bill that is robust. that helps them. is very. very important. I would finally note that the bill that we are voting on today is very much--is very similar to the proposal made by some of the Republican leaders when they put together a proposal to President Biden. So. again. closing on the note I opened with. the happy bipartisanship that marks this bill is a very good thing. and I hope it can continue. I yield the floor. and I ask unanimous consent that the rollcall vote begin now."},{"1":"2020","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Speaker. as a cosponsor and a member of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian Americans. I rise in strong support of H.R. 5517. the Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act. which establishes an exchange initiative between the United States and India to study the work and legacies of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. First and foremost. I wish to express my gratitude and fondness for my former colleague and dear friend. John Lewis. who passed away a few months ago. for introducing and leading this vital piece of legislation. By passing this bill today. we authorize the U.S. Department of State. in cooperation with the Indian Government. to incorporate three new programs: the Gandhi-King Scholarly Initiative. which creates an annual educational forum for scholars from both countries that focuses on the legacies of Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King. Jr. the Gandhi-King Global Academy. a United States Institute of Peace (USIP) program tasked with developing a professional development training initiative on conflict resolution based on the principles of nonviolence. and the United States-India Gandhi-King Development Foundation. which establishes a foundation to address social. environmental. and health priorities in India. Mr. Speaker. Congressman Lewis was a giant among us mere mortals. Not only was he the conscience of the Congress. widely beloved and revered on both sides of the aisle. but he was also one of the Original Big Six. a pillar of the Civil Rights Movement. and a lifelong warrior for a more just. equitable. and better America. Like Gandhi and Dr. King. Congressman Lewis shaped the world through his actions of nonviolence. and it is in his honor that we gather here today to vote on a bill he championed. To quote Congressman Lewis. Both Gandhi and King were inspired human beings who believed deeply in the power of nonviolent resistance to injustice as a tool for social change. It is because of their courage. commitment. and vision of a more tolerant and equitable world that we are all able to enjoy and practice our most fundamental democratic freedoms. As the worlds oldest and largest democracies. the United States and India have long traditions of upholding these shared values of nonviolent revolutions championed by figures like Gandhi. King. and Lewis. But as we have seen over the past few years. both countries have experienced significant affronts to the fundamental democratic principles. which threaten to erode the values that these men and many others have given their lives to protect. Mr. Speaker. the Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act seeks to apply the philosophies of Gandhi and Dr. King to conflict resolution efforts and current policy challenges. With this legislation. we seek to embody the best of what we saw of Gandhi. Dr. King. and Congressman Lewis in their fight for equality and justice as well as seek to preserve these values so that future generations are empowered and able to continue the fight against injustice. Just a few months ago. the world was reminded of the power nonviolent resistance has to effect positive change in the face of grave injustices. In the wake of George Floyds murder. millions of people across the world and in all 50 states within the U.S. gathered together to peacefully protest against police brutality. People of different races. socioeconomic classes. ethnicities. genders. and sexual orientations came together to demonstrate in the most democratic way possible. Mr. Speaker. those marches. which were. without a doubt. inspired by the marches led by Gandhi and Dr. King. have resulted in a genuine dialogue about institutional racism in this country and have awakened efforts to reform the system. so that it truly benefits all people. I am honored to be a leader on this bill. and I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 5517. the Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act."},{"1":"2019","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize Honda Manufacturing of Indiana for reaching the milestone of 2 million vehicles built in Indiana. This accomplishment is a testament to Hondas commitment to Indiana. the Sixth District. and to Greensburg. It is also a testament to the strength and capabilities of our workforce in the Sixth District and across Indiana. With employment of more than 2.500 Hoosiers and investment exceeding $1 billion. Honda Manufacturing of Indiana now has the capacity to produce 250.000 vehicles a year. In 2018 alone. Honda purchased more than $2.2 billion in parts from 51 suppliers located in Indiana. On behalf of the people of Indianas Sixth Congressional District. I want to congratulate Honda in Greensburg on achieving this incredible milestone. Recognizing Hoosiers Attending Military Service Academies"},{"1":"2018","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I thank Ms. Jayapal for participating in the Special Order. What does climate change have to do with poverty? Well. today we face accelerating extreme weather events. such as intensifying hurricanes that displaced and impoverished hundreds of thousands of citizens in Louisiana. Mississippi. Puerto Rico. the Virgin Islands. New Jersey. Here is another way that climate change affects people in poverty: through healthcare events that take them out of the workforce. Here is the testimony from Liz Betty-Owens from Vermont. She writes: I am 26. a home care provider and a bartender. Just over a year ago. I was diagnosed with Lyme disease and began a lifelong battle with not only this crippling disease but also the healthcare industry and my struggle to access the healthcare I need. At 25. I was incredibly ill. attempting to continue my work as a healthcare provider and making all of my healthcare decisions not based on a doctors recommendation. but based on what my health insurance at the time would cover and what I could afford with my meager out-of-pocket expenses. I realized that BlueCross BlueShield of Vermont had more power over my health and wellbeing than me or my doctor. I accumulated several thousand dollars of debt. and then. in April. I was booted off my moms insurance plan because I turned 26. I began the 3-month process of registering for my States Medicare. I was unable to go to the doctor for months while I was still showing symptoms and recovering from initial treatment. I was held up in the process of trying to prove I made such a small yearly income that I was in fact eligible for the States Green Mountain health plan. And ever since I was finally accepted. I have had to try and tread a careful line making sure I dont make too much money and get booted off the State plan. risking fines from lack of health insurance and. yet again. not having access to the care that I need as I fight this debilitating disease. It is devastating to experience the exhausting and harmful approach of a healthcare system controlled by insurance companies. Big Pharma. and hospital monstrosities that care more about the bottom line than the needs of healthcare workers and patients. rather than living in a society where everyone can get the care they need and have it be solely based on decisions between the individual and the doctor. It is exhausting to know that I am already struggling with this at the age of 26 and that I live in a rapidly aging State where an entire generation will have to fight to get the care they need. And home care providers like myself will be caught in the crossfire of providing care services with working people who are not allowed the resources to compensate for the care that they actually need. It is also terrifying being diagnosed with Lyme disease. which is transmitted by a tick bug that is infected by a bacterium. As weather patterns continue to hit new extremes because of climate change and the northeast continues to warm. the number of infected tick bugs is only expected to grow. The people at the greatest risk are those of us who work outdoors growing food or working on farms. maintaining State and Federal lands. and our heightened risk to this disease is made even more terrifying by the continued threat of our already limited access to healthcare. We need universal healthcare as a human right and a public good. and not a commodity to buy and sell. We need this Poor Peoples Campaign to unite the poor and dispossessed. and indict the immoral status quo that produces poverty and is ravaging our communities. Mr. Speaker. with those words. I yield back the balance of my time."},{"1":"2017","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I support this amendment. This amendment simply requires that the high-quality evaluations include measurements or how many recipients participated in an apprentice or career pathway program. and any credentials earned along the way. Earn-and-learn models--those where an individual is getting on-the- job experience. earning a wage. and learning new occupational skills-- are one of the best types of workforce development models the government can support. Apprenticeships. in particular. provide a combination of occupational on-the-job training and related instruction. helping to improve worker training and address critical skill gaps that align with the needs of industry. We know that the best way out of poverty is through work. and apprenticeships provide a pathway to obtaining a successful career. Mr. Chair. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment as well as the underlying bill. and I yield back the balance of my time."},{"1":"2016","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. tomorrow the U.S. House of Representatives will vote on a piece of legislation that many in this body on both sides of the aisle have worked on and that the majority leader of the Senate has described as the single most important piece of legislation that will pass this year. We call it the 21st Century Cures Act. and it includes three mental health reform acts--the most significant reforms in mental health programs in 10 years. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks the more than 200 organizations from all across the country supporting the 21st Century Cures legislation. Why would the majority leader say it is the most important legislation the Senate might act on--because we do a lot of important stuff around here. whether it is Defense authorization. whether it is cyber security. whether it is the bill to fix No Child Left Behind that we passed in a bipartisan way last December. I think it is because this legislation will affect virtually every American family because we are entering the most exciting period of medical research in our country. That is the first part of it. The second part. which has to do with mental health. affects so many families. We know that about one out of every five adult Americans suffers from some form of mental illness. This concentrates a large amount of money we actually spend on mental health programs every year from the Federal Government and spends it in a more effective way to actually help people. In the next few minutes. I would like to acquaint the Senate again with how we have gone about this and remind Senators of how many of us have had a hand in this legislation. It is a remarkable 2 years of work that has involved many. many. many hearings. dozens of meetings. and that has been done in a large committee of 22 Senators of very different points of view in a largely bipartisan way. I will summarize. The first thing I would mention. the legislation includes $6.3 billion of funding and $1 billion of that is for State opioid grants. Whether it is Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island or Senator Ayotte and Senator Portman. probably most Senators of this body have seen on the front pages of their newspapers the tragedies of opioid abuse. I know that is true in Tennessee. This bill helps in two ways. The most immediate way is to provide State grants--Federal dollars to go to States--over the next 2 years to help States fight opioid abuse. The other way it helps. when we get to the part about 21st Century Cures. is that Dr. Francis Collins. head of the National Institutes of Health--Dr. Collins calls it the National Institutes of Hope--says that one of the groundbreaking discoveries we expect to happen in this country is a non-addictive pain medicine. The problem with opioids is. they are addictive. Now. people need it. If you have a back surgery or if you have terrible pain. opioids can help people. We know that. but it is addictive and it is causing problems. What if we had non- addictive pain medicine? So this bill helps that in two ways. There is other funding in this legislation: $4.8 billion to the National Institutes of Health. The first 1.8 billion of that is for Cancer Moonshot. This is Vice President Bidens initiative. He is motivated for many reasons by it. His son died of cancer. Many of us have family members or friends with cancer. There are startling discoveries going on in cancer today. This is $1.8 billion in support of the Vice Presidents Cancer Moonshot. Then there is $1.4 billion for the Precision Medicine Initiative. This is one of President Obamas most important initiatives. I know he has said that very realistically he expects it to happen anyway. but he would like to move it along. This helps move it along. What this means is that if the Senator from Oklahoma and I each have a disease. that because of our genetic background. the medicine we might get for that disease should be different. If we know that genetic difference between the two of us. the doctor can prescribe for it. That is called personalized medicine or precision medicine. Then there is $1.6 billion for the BRAIN Initiative. This includes groundbreaking research in Alzheimers. for example. I talked to one drug manufacturer that has spent more than $1 billion trying to develop a medicine that will help identify Alzheimers before it shows symptoms and then another medicine that will slow the progression of Alzheimers. Imagine what could happen in our country if. for the tens of millions of Americans who are going to suffer with Alzheimers. we could find that out before they actually have the symptoms and we can then slow down the progression of Alzheimers. Think of the suffering that would help avoid. Think of the billions of dollars it would save. This is for that kind of research. Dr. Collins says that during this next 10 years. he expects that we will be able to identify individuals at high risk for Alzheimers before any symptoms appear and provide them with effective medicines to slow or prevent the disease. It also includes $500 million for the Food and Drug Administration to help pay for the extra work we are giving the FDA. One Senator was on the floor talking about this bill and suggested this isnt enough money. Lets talk about money just a minute. The United States spends more on biomedical research and development than Europe. Japan. and China--almost as much as those three put together. There has nevertheless been a real need for increased funding for the kinds of things I just mentioned. but the way we do things here is. we have authorization bills. which this is. where we decide what our policies and our programs are going to be. Some of us are on those committees--like the committee I chair. and of which Senator Murray of Washington is the ranking Democrat. the Health. Education. Labor. and Pensions Committee in this case. Then we have Appropriations Committees that decide how much we can afford to spend on that. We do that separately. Last year. this Congress. a Republican majority. I would point out-- but Senator Blunt. chairman of the Appropriations Committee for the Senate. would quickly give Senator Murray. the ranking Democrat. full credit--added $2 billion to the National Institutes of Health budget for 1 year. That means $20 billion over 10 years. This year. the same Republican Congress. with the cooperation of the Democratic Members. added another $2 billion to the National Institutes of Health budget. That is another $20 billion over 10 years. The Cures legislation that I have just described is another $5 billion. So that--20. 20. and 5--adds up to 45 billion new dollars approved. The first $20 billion is law. the second $20 billion has just been approved by the Appropriations Committees--hopefully it will become law--and the $5 billion I just described. Now. that is real money. It is unusual to find an appropriations bill stuck on an authorization bill. but we have done it this time because this is an unusual opportunity. and we have done it in a way that Speaker Ryan and the House of Representatives believe is fiscally responsible. That means it doesnt add any new mandatory spending. That kind of spending has the budget going through the roof so it doesnt do that. It means it is paid for. That means we have reduced other spending to pay for it. When we look at the entire budget. it doesnt add a penny to the entire budget--we call it the discretionary plus the mandatory part--because it is paid for by reducing other spending. We have set priorities. we have done our job. and the Appropriations Committee has done its job in consecutive years. approving $20 billion more over 10 years for the National Institutes of Health and will add another 5 here just to the National Institutes of Health. Lets talk about the bipartisan nature of this bill. I am going to go through this fairly quickly. but for those watching. I think it is important to see this because sometimes when bills are popular--and I think this one will be popular. Everyone says: Well. that is easy. Tomorrow. the House of Representatives will vote on the 21st Century Cures bill. It includes the mental health bill--that I will describe in just a minute. I think it will be on suspension. which means they expect a big vote over there. I expect a big vote over here because I dont expect many Senators would want to vote no on a $1 billion grant program that will fight opioid abuse in their home State. I dont think there will be a lot of Senators who want to vote no on more money to fight cancer and to help the Vice President with the Cancer Moonshot. I suspect there will be a lot of Senators who want to vote yes to help the President advance his precision medicine legacy. I know there are families affected by Alzheimers all over the country who hope Senators vote yes on the BRAIN Initiative. I imagine we will get a big vote when it comes up next Monday and Tuesday. after the House passes it tomorrow. but as we put this bill together. there was plenty of controversy. there was plenty of conflict. but virtually everything we did was bipartisan. The money I just described is certainly bipartisan--the Presidents initiative. the Vice Presidents initiative. the opioid initiative. That is bipartisan. but look at the bills we are talking about. Here is one called the Advanced Targeted Therapies. which allows researchers to use their own data from previously approved therapies to help find a faster treatment for serious genetic diseases--Senator Bennet. Democrat. Senator Warren. Democrat. Senator Burr. Republican. Senator Hatch. Republican--and it passed by voice vote. I am very quickly going to go through 19 different bills that are the core of the 21st Century Cures legislation. They came out of our committee which has 22 Members. and the largest number of recorded votes against any one of those 19 bills was two because every single one of these bills had a Democratic sponsor and a Republican sponsor. except for one. and that was Senator Murrays bill. and she is the ranking Democrat on our committee. So dont let anyone suggest that a bill that has $6.3 billion of appropriations. that include Democratic priorities and bipartisan priorities. and the core of it is 19 bills of FDA and NIH reform that has a Democratic sponsor for every single bill and that was approved by a 22-member committee and only had two recorded votes against it--was the most that was against it--dont let anybody say this is not a bipartisan bill. Anyone who says that simply hasnt spent the time to be involved in the process. Lets go to the next one. Burr and Franken. Republican and Democrat. FDA Device Accountability. It will bring innovative devices like artificial knees and insulin pumps to patients more quickly by getting rid of unnecessary regulations. One of the major things we need to do--and we do it in this bill--is to bring cures and discoveries through the regulatory process more quickly and at less cost. All of us are concerned about the price of drugs. One factor contributing to that cost is that it takes a billion dollars and 13 or 15 years to take a new discovery through the process. We would like to shorten that process as long as we can do it in a way that ensures that it is safe. The next one is called the Next Generation Researchers Act--Senator Baldwin. Democrat. Senator Collins. Republican. It improves opportunities for our young researchers. It was passed by voice vote. That means there was no objection. The next one is called the Enhancing Rehabilitation Research at the National Institutes of Health--Kirk. Republican. Bennet. Democrat. Hatch. Republican. Murkowski. Republican. Republicans Isakson and Collins. Enhancing Rehabilitation Research was passed by voice vote. Neurological Diseases Research. Here we have Isakson and Murphy. Republican and Democrat. advancing Research for Neurological Diseases. The next one has do with superbugs and protecting patients. You know about these. You get an infection. and you take a medicine to treat it. but the medicine doesnt work because the infection is a superbug. This bill will clarify that the FDA requires cleaning and validation data for reusable medical devices. In other words. this will make it less likely that will be a problem. That is Senator Murrays bill. Improving Health IT. This is about electronic health records. The government has spent a huge amount of money on that. over $32 billion. including hospitals and doctors to adopt electronic medical records. It is very important to precision medicine. to personalized medicine. because if you cant use all this data. a doctor is not going to prescribe something for the Senator from Oklahoma that is different from something for the Senator from Tennessee. We found that the electronic medical records system was a mess. We had six hearings on it. and we worked with the Obama administration because they could do some things to fix it and we could do some things to fix it. I thank Secretary Burwell in the Obama administration--I thank her and Andy Slavitt at CMS for the efforts they have made to do what they could do. And these are the things that we could do. Senator Murray was involved. Senator Cassidy. Senator Whitehouse. Senator Hatch. Senator Bennet. It was a bipartisan effort to reduce physician documentation burden--electronic health records to make it more interoperable and to get this system moving again. Advancing Breakthrough Medical Devices. One of the great successes we have had in legislation was a few years ago when Senator Bennet and Senator Burr. among others. introduced a bill and made it law that brought breakthrough medicines through the Food and Drug Administration more rapidly. More than 49 have been approved and 464 requests for breakthrough designation in about 4 or 5 years. We are applying that same breakthrough strategy to medical devices. Of course. we have bipartisan support for that. The Advancing Hope Act. If you are a parent of a child with a rare disease. such as brain cancer. this increases the opportunity that the drugs will help. Medical Electronic Data Technology. We had Senator Bennet. Democrat. Senator Hatch. Republican. Medical Countermeasure Innovation Act. This is very important. Senators Burr and Casey have been real leaders in dealing with medical countermeasures. These are in case there is a bioterror attack. anthrax--some kind of man-made or naturally-occurring problem like that. Are we ready to deal with that? This helps to do that. There are just a few more. Some will say: Why are you going on for so long? Because I would like for people to know when it happens that this Senate is capable of taking a great big. complex subject. and Democrats and Republicans are capable of working together to produce a result that deserves a big vote. The Combination Products Innovation Act. This helps to bring to the market a products that are made up of medical devices and medicines. There is a bill by Wicker. Bennet. Collins. Klobuchar. Isakson. and Franken on Patient Focused Impact Assessment. There is one to modernize the FDA workforce. Dr. Califf told us that his biggest problem at the FDA is that he cant hire all the people he needs to deal with all of the exciting things going on. This gives him new authority to do that. Everybody thinks that would be an important thing to do. It was approved by voice vote. Advancing Precision Medicine. This is legislation that I introduced and supported the Presidents Precision Medicine Initiative. which I have talked about before. There is other legislation that went through. The point of all of this is that 19 different bills are the core of this 21st Century Cures Act. The most recorded number of votes against this bill was two. and every single one was sponsored by a Democrat as well as a Republican. except for one. which was Senator Murrays bill. She is the ranking Democrat on the committee. In conclusion. we are fortunate to be able to add to the bill the Mental Health Reform Act. Actually. we include three mental health bills. and together they make up the most significant reform of mental health programs that we have had in more than a decade. I want to give particular credit to Senator Murphy. Democrat. and to Senator Cassidy. Republican. for working together through some real landmines to get this to a place where it can pass the House almost unanimously and where it will be a part of the bill that we will vote on next week. I want to thank the majority whip. Senator Cornyn. who also added an important judicial part to this legislation and helped us navigate some difficult issues. In other words. these Senators showed that they know how to legislate. They could have stood up and made a speech. They could have insisted on doing things exactly their way. but they said to look for the area where we might agree on 80 percent of the policy and lets agree that. This is one of those bills. Look at the number of Republicans and Democrats who have passed that. Here is the second mental health bill we are talking about. You can see the number of Senators. I have taken some time to go through the legislation that will be coming to the Senate early next week and that will be voted on tomorrow in the House of Representatives. I do think it likely represents. as the majority leader has suggested. the most important piece of legislation that we could act on this year. Because it affects virtually every American family. Forbes magazine reported that 78 percent of the American people favored Congress taking action on medical innovation because they have heard people like Dr. Francis Collins. the head of the National Institutes of Health. talk about within the next 10 years having a Zika vaccine and HIV/AIDS vaccine. identifying Alzheimers before symptoms appear and slow its progression. an artificial pancreas for those with diabetes. and a non-addictive type of pain medicine. These are magnificent opportunities for us. We have strong leadership at the National Institutes of Health. We have put our money where our mouth is. It is true that we will have to approve it every year. and it is true that we had to reduce other spending in order to have this spending. but that is the way we are supposed to do things. What we have done is take a bipartisan core of bills. we worked hard for two years in a bipartisan way and produced a result that had very few no votes along the way. It includes Democratic priorities as well as Republican priorities. It has the avid interest of the Democratic President of the United States. the Democratic Vice President of the United States. It is a part of the agenda forward in health care for the Republican Speaker of the House. and the Republican majority leader in the Senate says it is the most important bill we are going to act on. I would think that would get a big vote tomorrow in the House. and I would think it deserves a big vote in the U.S. Senate next week. It has been my privilege to work with Senator Murray and the other members of the Committee on Health. Education. and Labor to produce the bill. I yield the floor.

Even though discharge petitions have rarely been invoked in modern history. they nevertheless embody democracy and its fundamental principle of majority rules. a principle that the gentleman has already talked about earlier. This discharge process offers the only means by which a majority of House Members can secure a vote on a measure that is opposed by the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction and House leadership. What makes the gentlemans remarks a few minutes ago particularly ironic is the fact that the discharge rule evolved from a precursor rule adopted in 1910 as part of the Cannon revolt. The Cannon revolt was a revolt against Speaker Joseph Cannon. It was a remarkable event in the history of this House and is relevant today in more ways than one. Speaker Cannon was. at the time. the longest-serving Republican Speaker in the history of the House. serving as Speaker from 1903 to 1911. Referred to as Uncle Joe. Speaker Cannon ruled with an iron fist. Historians have not painted him as a great legislator. No. Historians have painted him as a great obstructionist. He blocked legislation. including child labor laws and the right for women to vote. What was his reasoning for blocking this progressive legislation? I am tired of listening to all this babble for reform. he said. Several times. Republicans tried unsuccessfully to curb Speaker Cannons broad powers. which included his chairmanship of the Rules Committee and his power to dole out committee assignments. among other powers. But that changed in March of 1910 when 42 Republicans joined with the Democrats introducing a resolution containing a rules package that would strip Speaker Cannon of his many powers. Speaker Cannon tried to filibuster this revolt. speaking from the chair for 26 straight hours while allies tried to round up additional allies who were out celebrating St. Patricks Day. but it didnt work. Speaker Cannon finally ruled the resolution out of order. but the House overruled the Chair. thereby adopting far-reaching reforms. including the precursor of todays discharge rule. I ask my colleagues to join me in returning power to rank-and-file Members by voting on the motion to discharge and supporting American jobs. With that. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time."},{"1":"2014","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I would like to share some of Senator ALEXANDERS observations about Senator Baker because. as I said. I think they are important. timely lessons about the purpose and potential of our service. One of the things that stands out in all the tributes to Senator Baker. including Senator ALEXANDERS. is the way in which he embodied the rare trait of taking himself lightly even as he took his duties seriously. I will give you an example. One of the timehonored traditions around here is for new Senators to labor over their maiden speeches as if Pericles himself were standing in judgment from the Presiding Officers chair. Senator Baker was no exception. His maiden speech was long. thoughtful. and denseso much so that when he asked his fatherinlaw. thenSenate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen. for his reaction. Dirksen is said to have remarked: Howard. Howard. perhaps you should occasionally enjoy the luxury of an unexpressed thought. It was the kind of comment that might have stung a lesser Senator. but as Senator ALEXANDER pointed out in mentioning that last week. Baker was a quick learner. About a week or so later. Howard rose againthis time to challenge one of his Democratic colleagues to a game of tennis. The Senator in question had just taken a swipe at the vigor of his Republican colleagues. particularly the new ones. and Senator Baker decided to rise to the challenge. tongue firmly in cheek. It was a star performance. The Senator that Baker challenged even interrupted him at one point to suggest that it was one of the best maiden speeches that has ever been delivered in this chamber. Evidently he had missed Bakers actual maiden speech. But Senator Bakers legendary ability to adapt was now firmly established and it set the tone for a twodecade run in which he would be called upon to deploy his many other talents and skills to defuse tensions. resolve conflicts. repair trust. build consensus. and. frankly. just to put people at easebecause sometimes in this business there is nothing more important than just that: to just keep the bearings oiled. We have all been recently reminded of how Senator Baker put his own ambitions aside to help rebuild the Reagan White House after IranContra. It was a great testament to his values and to his feel for priorities. What Senator ALEXANDER reminded us last week was that these former political rivalsBaker and Reaganstarted every day in the White House together telling each other a little story. They had no problem putting their past disputes behind them and building a close working friendship based on mutual respect. common purpose. love of country. and of course good humor. They were adults. busy about serious business. and they conducted that business with dignity and with grace. The larger point is that while people talk a lot about the importance of having political skill in Washington these days. the importance of temperament cannot be overstated. The way Senator Baker conducted himself here and in the White House is eloquent testimony of that. It is not that he was laid back. As Senator ALEXANDER put it. behind Bakers pleasant demeanor was a restless ambition that would propel him to the heights of American politics and government for 40 years. but he could subordinate that ambition when he felt the moment or the country needed him to. He was persistent about achieving a result but never insisted that his way was the only way to do it. It is a quality that required an ability to listen. In Bakers case that meant being an eloquent listener. a trait Senator ALEXANDER put above all the others in Bakers formidable arsenal. Here is how Senator Baker himself once put it: There is a difference between hearing and understanding what people say. You dont have to agree. but you have to hear what theyve got to say. And if you do. the chances are much better youll be able to translate that into a useful position and even useful leadership. Senator ALEXANDER pointed out Howard Baker had courage. He helped round up the votes to ratify the Panama Canal Treaty even though he must have known it would not help him much in a Republican primary for President. to put it mildly. When the integrity of our politics was at stake. he did not hesitate to take on a President of his own party in a very public wayan impulse that one hopes lawmakers in both parties could muster today if the integrity of our system called for it again. But perhaps most important of all. Howard Baker was grounded. He had an important job to do. and he did it well. but he also kept a healthy distance from his work. His photograph of President Reagans inaugural in January 1981 illustrates the point. Just behind the new President we can spot the Speaker of the House Tip ONeill and the new Vice President George Bush. Then right there between them is a man holding up a camera to capture the moment. It is the new Senate majority leader standing there like an ordinary spectator with a very good seat. It was Howard Baker. Senator ALEXANDER summed up Bakers groundedness this way: Howard Baker never stopped sounding like where he grew up. Senator Baker was a fixture here for decades. but Huntsville was always home. Perhaps that is also why Senator Baker took his stewardship of the Senate so very seriously. He knew he was not going to be around forever and that meant he had a duty to make the Senate work and to preserve it as a place where disputes and disagreements are sifted and sorted out and where stable. durable solutions are slowly but surely achieved. It is how he earned the nickname the great conciliator. When Dan Quayle was a Senator here. he used to say: Theres Howard Baker. and then theres the rest of us. Over the past week. we have been reminded of why that was. and I thank Senator ALEXANDER for helping us remember why his friend and mentor meant so much to this country and this institution. May the memory of Howard Henry Baker inspire us to be our best selves and even better Senators."},{"1":"2013","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Madam President. I rise today to mark a significant event in Alaskas history as we commemorate the 100th anniversary of the convening of the Alaska State Legislature. Compared to the States that my colleagues represent. Alaska is a relatively young State. so it is remarkable that our legislature has existed for only 100 years. However. creating our States legislative body was not an easy process. Secretary of State William H. Seward acquired Alaska from Russia for $7.200.000 on March 30. 1867. The First Organic Act of 1884 established the District of Alaska and provided us with a Governor and judicial branch but no legislative body to be the peoples voice. It was not until after several petitions by Alaskans of all backgrounds that Congress passed the Second Organic Act giving Alaska territorial status and a legislative body. Our first elections were held November 12. 1912. They produced the first of many civil servants who would have the honor to serve in the Alaska Legislature. We did not yet have a capitol building. so eight senators and 16 representatives convened at the Elks Lodge in Juneau. AK. That year. the first territorial legislature passed 83 lawslaws that began building our State and uniting us as Alaskans. While Alaska may have been just a territory and seen by many as a vast wilderness separated from the rest of the country. our territorial legislature led the Nation in passing the first law in the Nation giving women the right to vote. This was 1913. The 19th amendment wouldnt be ratified for another 7 long years. The great Nell Scott was the first woman to serve in the first territorial legislature. way before other daughters of this country would. The territorial legislature also led the nation in the civil rights movement as it passed an antidiscrimination bill providing for full and equal enjoyment of public accommodations for all Alaskans. It is noteworthy that before statehood. Alaskas Legislature acted in response to the passionate advocacy of Roy and Elizabeth Peratrovich long before Congress would on Dr. Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks advocacy. Before a territorial referendum in 1946 that began the legal quest for statehood. the Alaska Legislature had been advocating admission as early as 1913. This past January. the 28th Session of the Alaska State Legislature convened. consisting of 20 senators and 40 representatives. Under house speaker Mike Chenault. and senate president Charlie Huggins. they continue to provide representation to an estimated 731.449 residents of Alaska. The Alaska Legislature has worked for the past 100 years to give Alaskans the opportunity to enjoy life. liberty. and the pursuit of happiness. and they will continue to do so for the many years to come. I extend my congratulations and heartfelt appreciation to the senators and representatives as well as all support staff to our legislature on this special anniversary.."},{"1":"2012","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. today I recognize Taylor Kloustin. a fall intern in my Washington.

Mr. Speaker. I rise today in fierce opposition to this bill which is going to adversely affect more than 34 million National Public Radio listeners through 900 local stations across our entire country. My Republican colleagues have declared an emergency to rush this bill to the floor without any hearings whatsoever to examine the proposal. I think thats a bad way to do business. We have many emergencies to deal with in our country. but attacking and crippling NPR is hardly an emergency. And it does it in a very sneaky backdoor way. What the bill does is it cuts off the use of all Federal funding to NPR by preventing any grants to it. It prevents any support to NPR by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. and it prevents support to NPR programming from public radio stations across the country. In other words. it cripples it. it hobbles it. which is really what the majority is seeking to do. This proposal is not going to do anything about reducing the deficit. The CBO has weighed in. It doesnt cut any Federal spending. In fact. the bill doesnt produce one penny in savings. Whats very clear is what it does do. and its really purposeful. And that is to hobble NPR. threatening 9.000 jobs at stations across the country. Why? I think the motivations behind this effort are quite clear: They are rooted in an ideological view about what NPR broadcasts. and it capitalizes on recent headlines involving Ron Schiller and Juan Williams. This attack on NPR strikes at the core of a wide array of NPR programming that Americans enjoy every single day. all week long across the country. from The Diane Rehm Show to Morning Edition and two of my favorites. Car Talk and World of Opera. I acknowledge that our Nation faces threats. but Car Talk is hardly one of them. and neither is Diane Rehm. Silencing what some disagree withmake no mistake about itis a threat to our democracy. A great democracy does not silence voices. We want many voices to the many. NPR programming reaches more than 900 independently owned and operated stations across the country. from San Franciscos KQED. the most listened to public radio station in the country with more than 740.000 listeners each week. to small rural stations like that of the chairman of the subcommittee. KCUW in Pendleton. Oregon. These stations provide an important public service to the local community. and people trust it. and they enjoy it. They want it. They like it. This is national programming with local listenership. And NPRs listenership has increased. unlike other stations. by 72 percent over the last 10 years. A recent national survey foundand thats why I think this is an illbegotten proposal by the majority. You say you listen to the American people. I think you have to take the plugs out of your ears. A recent national survey found that almost 70 percent of all voters across the entire political spectrum oppose terminating the funding for public broadcasting. including 56 percent of Republicans in the country. So I think its time to stand up for NPR. I think that this is a phony emergency measure. and I dont think NPR deserves to be treated this way. I urge my colleagues to vote to preserve really what I think is a national treasure. It provides in very tough times very clear and important news and information to instruct our country and listeners in local communities around our Nation. I reserve the balance of my time."},{"1":"2010","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. toiling on Americas farms is no easy job. Few people are willing to endure the heat. cold and misery of stooping in the fieldsor the low wages. Today. an estimated 75 percent of the farming workforce is undocumented. This is bad for everybody. Undocumented workers are easy prey for exploitation and are unable to assert their rights. Farm workers talk of unbearable heat. poor living conditions. even abuse. and they have no one to turn to for help. Growers complain about the labor shortages that can spoil their crops. I have heard how farms struggle to maintain reliable."},{"1":"2009","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. earlier this week the Senate Finance Committee. by a vote of 14 to 9. reported out its version of health care reform. That makes now five committees that have acted on this issue. five committees of jurisdictionthree in the House of Representatives and two in the Senateall of which have now at least put out their products. But I say that loosely because what emerged from the Senate Finance Committee was not. in fact. legislative language. it was a concept paper. It is yet to be reduced to legislative language. That will take some time. I suspect. because many of the concepts that were included in the concept paper are pretty complex. So what is happening now on the issue of health care reform. at least in the Senate. is in the leaders office. The chairman of the Health. Education. Labor. and Pensions Committee is meeting with the chairman of the Finance Committee. and I suspect a number of the members of the White House to hammer out what will eventually be the bill I suspect will come to the floor of the Senate. I say that only because the process has been very much flawed from the beginning. It is not one that is inclusive in terms of allowing ideas from our side of the aisle to be Incorporated. It has not been a bipartisan process. to say the least. My guess is that at the end of the day. what comes out of the leaders office will be a very different bill than anything we have seen so far. But I think there are certain characteristics in that bill that have been in all of the bills. I think we know a few basic things about all of the bills so far that are consistent. those things that have not changed. The first one is it will lead to higher premiums. The second one is it will lead to higher taxes. The third one is it will include cuts in Medicare. So those three basic characteristics are the same with regard to all of the bills. the three that have emerged from the committees in the House of Representatives and now the two that have emerged from Senate committees and are currently being married up in the leaders office. I predict when that bill comes to the floor of the Senate. the American people will have the same thing to look forward to that they have now with all of these various bills: higher premiums. higher taxes. and cuts in Medicare. Why is that significant? It is significant for this reason: Health care reform. at least as stated in terms of its purpose. is to lower costs. For the past decade and beyond we have been talking about health care costs in this country and how we have to do something to rein in the escalating costs people deal with every single year for health care and doubledigit increases in health care costs for many of those years. So the whole purpose of health care reform. at least my understanding of it. and I think as stated by the President and others. is that we need to rein in and get control of health care costs in this country. That is why it is ironic that of the five bills so far that have emerged from House and Senate committees. none bend the cost curve down. All increase premiums for people in this country. increase the costs for health care coverage. In the Senate Finance Committee billthe most recent version. which. as I said earlier. was reported out this week by a 14to9 votethere wasnt a direct assessment or estimate of what that increase in premiums would be. There were simply generalized comments by the Congressional Budget Office that. yes. these increased taxes in the bill would be passed on generally dollar for dollar. In other words. the taxes that are imposeda 40percent excise tax on some of these insurance companieswould be passed on in the form of higher costs or premiums to health care consumers in this country without being more specific or quantifying in any more precise way what those increased costs would be. Nevertheless. they said basically the same thing we have seen in all of these various bills. and that is that health care costscoverage. premiums--are going to go up. We are going to have higher premiums. In the last week or so we have now seen two studies where independent analysts have looked at this and concluded the same thing. In fact. the PricewaterhouseCoopers study from a few days ago went so far as to say if you are an individual buying in the individual marketplace. you are going to see your health care premiums go up about $2.600 if this bill becomes law. That would be in the year 2019 at the end of a 10year window. which Is what the people who analyze these things look at. So it is about a $2.600perperson increase in premium if you are buying on the individual market. If you are a small employer who is employing 50 or fewer employees or an individual who is employed at one of those small businesses. you would see premiums increase $2.100 if you are an individual. If you are a family. you would see premiums increase $5.400 under the bill that was produced and emerged from the Senate Finance Committee. So whether you are an individual buying on the individual marketplace or whether you are getting your insurance through your employer. you will see higher premiums. higher health care costs according to this analysis. If you are a family. it is the same thing. It is just a varying difference in the amounts. but it is anywhere from $2.100 up to $5.400 of increased premium costs. according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers study. This week there was a study released by Oliver Wyman which came to the conclusion that if you buy your insurance on the individual marketplace. you will see a $1.500 increase for single coverage and $3.300 for family coverage annually. That is exclusive of inflation. That doesnt include the normal inflationary costs that we deal with year in and year out for health care in this country. This study concluded the same thing the PricewaterhouseCoopers study did. that is. whether you buy on the individual marketplace. whether you get it through your employer. if you are an individual or you are a family. you will see higher premium costs. As I said. in this particular study. it is $1.500 for single coverage. $3.300 for family coverage annually. They also broke it down State by State. which is important because I think everybody wants to know how this is going to impact our constituents. including my constituents in South Dakota. In this particular case. if you are someone buying on the individual market and you are an individual buying a single policy. you will see your health care premiums go up 47 percent. If you are someone who has a family buying on the individual marketplace. buying a family policy. you are going to see your premiums go up 50 percent. If you are in the small group market. if you have the good fortune of being in a larger group. you will see. if you are an individual. your premiums go up 14 percent. If you are a family in a small group market. you will see your premiums go up 15 percent. exclusive of inflation. So those are two recent studies where independent analysts have looked at the bill produced by the Senate Finance Committee and concluded there would be significant increases in premiums and in what people would pay for health care in this country. So it begs the question: How is this reforming health care? The stated purpose of health care reform is to lower costs. to drive down costs for individuals and families. As you can see from these studies. that certainly isnt the case. Of course. the Congressional Budget Office. as I said earlier. indicated in response to questioning about the Senate Finance Committee that although they hadnt drilled down and figured out exactly what those premium increases would be. that inevitably you would have higher premium costs simply because the taxes imposed under the legislation would be passed on to health care consumers. and everybody who is buying health care out there would see their premiums increase. generally speaking. dollar for dollar. That was the conclusion of the Congressional Budget Office. So higher premiums. that is the first thing we know about all of the health care reform plans so far that have been put forward. The second thing we know as well. with certainty. is that they all include higher taxes. The House versions of this legislation used payroll taxes. They have an employer mandatewhat we refer to as a payorplay mandate. There are additional. I guess you would say. addon taxes for people who are in higher income categories. so they finance it with different forms of taxes. The tax increases proposed by the Senate Finance Committeeas I said earlier. there is an individual mandate. so if you dont have insurance. you will pay penalties. That will be a certain tax or fee on individuals in this country which will hit a lot of lower income individuals. But the insurance companies which would be hit with these tax increases. of course. would then pass those on to health care consumers. So. again. we see increases in taxes. What the Congressional Budget Office did with respect to the issue of taxes is. it did go so far as to say where that tax burden would lie. Under the Congressional Budget Office estimate. 89 percent of the higher taxes in this bill produced by the Senate Finance Committee would fall on those wage earners. those taxpayers in this country earning less than $200.000 a year. They went so far as to say that. I think it was 71 percent of thoseand that was in the year 201971 percent of that tax burden would fall on those earning under $200.000 a year when the bill initially kicks in. So we are going to see significantly higher taxes on people making under $200.000 a year. according to the Congressional Budget Office. The Joint Committee on Taxation has also analyzed this issue. and they came to some conclusions earlier this week as well. one of which was that. similarly. we would see almost 90 percent of the tax burden under this bill falling on those households with incomes under $200.000 a year. They went so far as to say that more than half of the tax burden would fall on those households with incomes under $100.000 a year. So almost 90 percent of the tax burden falls on wage earners. taxpayers with incomes under $200.000 a year. and over half of the tax burden falls on those wage earners. those taxpayers with incomes under $100.000 a year. That is according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. So what does that mean? Well. that means the Presidents promise that health care reform would not impose taxes on those earning less than $250.000 is just a bunch of hot air. It just doesnt add up. We have the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office all saying that the disproportionate share of these taxesthe tax burdenabout 90 percent is going to fall on $250.000 and under and over half. over 50 percent of the tax burden. falling on income earners. wage earners. taxpayers in this country with under $100.000 in income. So the whole idea that somehow working families are going to be spared from the higher taxes under this bill just doesnt hold water. So what we are going to see in this bill is not only higher premiums that are going to affect people across this country who are expecting. because they have heard that health care reform is supposed to lower their health care coststhey are going to see higher premiums. Premiums are going to go up. They are also going to see their taxes go up. and go up significantly because if you look at the Joint Committee on Taxationand this is a letter that was written in response to questions that were raised by members of the Senate Finance Committee. and it says: Subsidy phaseouts raise marginal tax rates because for every additional dollar you earn. you are eligible for a smaller subsidy. imposing potentially high effective tax rates on that additional dollar and reducing your incentive to earn that additional dollar. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation. families earning 150 percent of the Federal poverty lineand that is $32.200 of income in this country. that is. 150 percent of the Federal poverty linewill face an effective marginal tax rate of 59 percent. meaning that for every additional dollar these taxpayers earn. they are losing 59 cents of it in foregone subsidies in taxes: Effective marginal tax rate. 59 percent on a wage earner who is makingthat is 150 percent of the Federal poverty level or $32.200. So there are lots of higher taxes in this legislation and lots of higher premiums. Of course. the final point I will mention. and the other point we know is consistent in all the bills. is significant cuts in Medicare. Under the Senate Finance Committee. there is almost a half trillion dollars worth of cuts in Medicare in the form of Medicare Advantage. which is about $133 billion that will be cut out of seniors who are receiving benefits under Medicare Advantage: hospitals. home health agencies. hospices. pharmaceuticalseverybody gets a haircut under this proposal. all of which I would argue is unlikely to happen. Here is why. Anytime Congress has enacted changes in Medicare that were designed to achieve savings. they inevitably go back and reverse course. We have lots of history to support that assumption. But. nevertheless. lets assume for a minute these taxes did occur. A $500 billion. or $h trillion. cut in Medicare that impacts seniors and health care providers in this country will be one of the results of the reform legislation that is being proposed by the Democrats in the Senate. The Finance Committees version of that is the most recent. So that is $2 trillion in Medicare cuts. $2 trillion in tax increases. and $1.8 trillion in new spending when it is fully implemented. There was sort of a smokeandmirrors approach used to shield the true cost of this by having the revenues kick in immediately. The tax increases kick in right away. but the actual costs under the plan dont kick up for about 4 years. You have all these tax increases hitting people right away. and so the 10year cost of this is understated significantly. CBO said $829 billion over the first 10 years. I think the important number to look at is what is the cost of this when fully implemented over a 10year period. It is $1.8 trillion. That is $1.8 trillion in new spending. which is financed with higher taxes. cuts in Medicare. and. ironically. no savings to health care consumers because every analysis done says it is going to lead to higher premiums. I argue as well. in addition to higher premiums. there will be higher taxes and Medicare cuts. You are also going to see a significant reduction in the quality of service in this country. as you have more and more government expansion in Washington. DC. more and more government involvement in the decisions that are made. The government will now put mandates on what types of policies meet their threshold. their standard. I think. inevitably. in every model around the world where you have that level of government intervention. it leads to a rationing of care. denials of care. and delays with respect to care. I argue that the whole idea of this being characterized or labeled as reform is completely mislabeled. There is nothing that is reform about this. It raises premiums. raises taxes. and cuts Medicare. I think you are going to see. in addition to that. diminishment in the services that are available to people in this country through many of these programs. What is the alternative? We believe that rather than throwing the entire health care system overboard in this country. we ought to be looking at what we can do on a stepbystep basis to improve it. Republicans have offered a number of alternatives. We can allow buying insurance across State lines. We believe interstate competition in buying insurance would put downward pressure on prices in this country. That is a good solution. We can have small business health plans. allowing small businesses to join groups. Group purchasing power will bring downward pressure on insurance prices. By the way. that is something a number of us voted for many times here in the Congress. It has always been defeated. Also. we can deal with the issue of medical malpractice reform. which. according to CBO. has significant sayings-$54 billion. That applies to the government side of health care. If you extend that to private health careI think there are estimates that defensive medicine in this country costs $100 billion to $200 billion annually. So if you could address that issue that deals with litigation costs and defensive medicine. you would see savings grow over the estimates of the CBO. Having said that. those are several things. just off the top right there. that we think are stepbystep improvements in our health care system in this country. That doesnt throw overboard everything that is good about American health care. It doesnt move us toward a government plan or a singlepayer system like they have in Europe. Canada. or someplace like that. It preserves the competition we have in the marketplace today and a marketbased delivery system for health care in this country. We will continue to talk about those ideas. as well as many others. including providing tax credits that will give access to health care for those who dont have it. There is a way to do that that is very simple. By the way. the Baucus bill. the Finance Committee bill. still leaves 29 million people in this country without health insurance. In spite of $1.8 trillion in spending. new taxes. higher premiums. and everything that goes with that. you are still not getting many of the people who dont have health insurance covered. We think the bill that will be brought before the Senatewe dont know what it is at this point because it is being written behind closed doorsis the wrong approach. and the correct approach is a stepbystep process that addresses the shortcomings. the flaws. and attempts to fix those in a way that doesnt bust the bank or the budget. that doesnt raise taxes on consumers and raise premiums for health care consumers. and that doesnt cut Medicare for seniors across this country and for many of the providers that are out there. Mr. President. I hope that as the American people listen to this debate. they will engage on this issue. that the billwhatever comes out of the discussions going on in the leaders office. I hope there is an ample amount of time for the American people to analyze it and for Members of the Senate to digest it. This is literally onesixth of the American economy. We are talking about reorganizing onesixth of our entire economy. We should do it with great deliberation and great diligence and with a great amount of care and. I argue. not by throwing the current system overboard and wrecking it but by taking a stepbystep approach that improves the system we have today and provides access to those who dont have health insurance and does something to bend the cost curve down and drive health care costs down rather than raising them. like all the bills that have been produced by the Democratic majority in the Congress. I yield the floor."},{"1":"2008","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Speaker. I hate to have to come to the floor today to talk about how bad this bill is. but its impossible not to do that. This bill gives millions of dollars. billions of dollars in farm subsidies to millionaires. This bill takes all budget discipline in this Chamber and throws It out the window. It sweeps PAYGO under the rug. Ninetyseven percent of the worlds consumers dont live in this country. Theyre overseas. And the way we help farmers Is to open up markets to their products overseas. This bill shuts that down. This bill makes it next to impossible for us to be able to open up markets for our farmers. A farm bill ought to help the family farmer in tough times. This doesnt do that. This is corporate welfare. This is subsidies for multimillionaires. In fact. you can still live on Wall Street. make half a million dollars and get farm subsidies under this bill. This bill is not going to help agriculture. This bill is going to help corporate agriculture. not family farmers. I believe that we should sustain the Presidents veto. And this is not always good to say its bipartisan. And I hope. on a bipartisan basis. we support this veto and pass a farm bill that actually helps the family farmer and takes away these exorbitant subsidies to multimillionaire corporate farming operations. We ought to protect conservation. We ought to help the Third World raise themselves out of poverty. and we ought to open up markets for our farmers so they have more people to sell their products to. Thats what a farm bill ought to look like. Thats not what this farm bill does. I urge a sustain of the veto."},{"1":"2007","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I thank the gentleman from Michigan for his motion. Mr. Speaker. as the gentleman from Michigan has already said. the provisions that are in the legislation on the House side. section 416 and 417. are two provisions that relate to illegal immigration. The first of those provisions is one which states that no funds in this act can be used to provide homeownership assistance for illegal immigrants. The second. section 417. says that no funds may be used to employ workers who are illegal immigrants. The first of these sections applies to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. the second one applies to the Department of Transportation and relates to people who might otherwise be employed in construction under the Department of Transportation. As the gentleman from Michigan has pointed out. those were adopted unanimously by voice vote here in the House during the passage of this legislation.

Mr. DINGELL. to protect water quality. This amendment reverses the harmful policy of EPA and the Corps of Engineers that empowers regulators to allow the pollution of waters and destruction of wetlands but eliminates the authority of local regulators to protect waters from such pollution and destruction. Since January. 2003. EPA and the Corps have restricted the ability of their own personnel to implement regulations that have been in use since 1986. These regulations are valid. understood in the regulated community. and are the method we use to protect some 20 percent of the Nations waters. The Nations ponds. streams. rivers. lakes. and wetlands can be no healthier than the headwaters and runoff that feed them. Since EPA guidance was put in place in 2003. regulators have allowed the pollution and destruction of these critical waters. imperiling the health of the entire aquatic system. This amendment is not about stopping the direct pollution of our great rivers such as the Mississippi or the Trinity River. which flows through my home city of Dallas. It is about protecting the waters that feed into these systems and that serve as the origins of these great rivers. When we fail to protect smaller bodies of water. we lose the flood control. water supply. water filtering. and habitat benefits that these waters provide. Waters that may appear isolated on the surface tend to be interconnected with the ground and surface waters elsewhere. We cannot simply ignore the connections among and the values of all of the Nations waters.

It is not only by the provisions. the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act. it is not only the payment. but it is also the equal payment. Second. there have been different rules with regard to retail workers. There was the overall figure of $1 million that was used on retail workers. That was reduced to $500.000 and even down to $250.000. So we have been dealing with this for many times. The point of the matter is. under the Santorum amendment. the way it is constructed. there will be millions and millions and millions who will be outside the coverage of the Fair Labor Standards Act. That is plain and simple."},{"1":"2004","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. the pension security measure that we have before us is of great urgency for American workers and their employers. and that is because the 30year Treasury bond that is used to calculate the contributions and obligations for employers for singleemployer defined benefit systems are so low that it is causing companies to have to take money that they would invest in their business. that they would invest in more jobs. and put it into their pension plans when. in reality. they do not need to put that money there. Mr. Speaker. this issue of what we do with defined benefit pension plans is a very difficult path that we must follow. On one hand. we want to protect the obligations and the rights of employees who have been offered these plans and to maintain the retirement security that they have been promised and that they are expecting. At the same time. we need to find a way to make these plans work more smoothly so that employers do not continue to leave these plans in droves. as they have over the last 15 years. That is why the bill we have before us today was intended to fix this discount rate for singleemployer defined benefit plans. and we go from a 30year Treasury bond to a blend of corporate bond indexes that we believe more appropriately reflects the marketplace in terms of what the discount rate should be as they calculate these obligations. Yesterday. the House and Senate reached an agreement on a shortterm bill that is good for the economy. it is good for American workers and the overall health of the Nations pension system. I should say temporary. This is a 2year bill. As the gentleman from New Jersey pointed out. the people who are opposed to this bill do not have funding obligation problems for 5. 6. 7 years. and for those multiemployer plans who do have problems here in the short term. over the next 3 years they will in fact. by and large. get the relief that they need. The measure that was adopted by the conferees yesterday. I think. is a fair and responsible proposal that meets all of the goals that the conferees started with when we had the conference. The most critical urgent measure is the 30year Treasury bond fix. It also includes limited relief from deficit reduction contributions for airlines and integrated steel companies. and it targets funding relief for multiemployer pension plans that we believe are most in need. It is also a bill that the President of the United States has agreed he will sign into law. It is important to note that the interest rate provision really is the sole reason that we are here. Last fall. when we passed this measure on a 397 to 2 vote. everyone voted for this bill except two Members from the other side of the aisle. There was never any discussion about multiemployer relief. and we worked with our Senate and Republican colleagues on both sides of the aisle. both sides of the Capitol. Mr. Speaker. I want to thank the gentleman from California . Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. for his willingness to work closely with us. and the gentleman from Ohio on our side. along with the gentleman from Ohio . the gentleman from Texas . and the gentleman from California . and I guess that would be it on our side. along with the gentleman from New Jersey and the gentleman from California and the gentleman from New York . We worked together very closely in an open and bipartisan process that I think speaks well of how we should legislate here in the House. I think we have come an awful long way. and we need to get this bill finished. and we need to get it finished today. These funding obligations for employers are due on April 15. and if this conference report is not passed by the House and Senate and signed into law before then. companies will be making contributions that they really are not required. we believe. to make. Beyond thanking all of the Members who have worked on this. I want to take a moment to thank all of our staff. As we all know. Members are only as good as the staff we have around us. and we have staff on both sides of the aisle who have done really an awful lot of hard work to get us here today. From my own staff. I want to thank Paula Nowakowski. Ed Gilroy. Stacey Dion. JoMarie St. Martin. David Connolly. Jeff Dobrozsi. Kevin Smith. Greg Maurer. Dave Schnittger. Linda Stevens. Kevin Frank. and Deborah Samantar. I would also like to thank Shahira Knight and Lisa Schultz from the staff of the gentleman from California . Kathleen Black from the staff of the gentleman from Texas . Kurt Courtney from the staff of the gentleman from California"},{"1":"2003","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. September 11. 2001. taught us that the Nation is vulnerable to terrorist attacks on our own soil. In Massachusetts. almost 200 families lost loved ones on that day. and they bear an especially heavy share of the burden of that vulnerability. Here in Congress. we are each committed to do all we can to see that 9/11 never happens again. We need to work together to provide the resources to prevent terrorists from attacking the cities. the towns. the villages. and the communities we all care so much about in our States and across this country. Yet we failed to live up to our responsibility yesterday during the debate on Senator HOLLINGS needed proposal to strengthen the protection of our seaports. It would have provided $1 billion to begin to protect our Nations notoriously porous and vulnerable ports. Yet during the debate on the amendment. opponents questioned where will it end? as if this was such an extravagant investment. It was defeated. and I cannot understand why. One billion dollars was proposed to secure our seaports against sabotage. dirty bombs or worse in cargo containers. Was that really too mucheven though the President has pledged $9 billion in aid to other nations to help them protect their own citizens? These entryways into the United States are responsible for 95 percent of all U.S. international trade. but only about 2 percent of all cargo is now being inspected. An urgent proposal to do more. and do it now. should certainly get a unanimous vote in the Senate. The stakes are too high. September 11 taught us what can happen. Obviously. we dont have unlimited funds. Obviously. we cant make ourselves 100 percent free of the terrorist threat. But can we really say that we are doing all we can when the overall bill before us provides only $2 billion to help State and local governments meet their new security requirements? Facing serious budget reductions of their own. the Nations cities are spending an additional $70 million a week on direct homeland security costs. and tens of millions more in indirect costs. But can we really say we are doing all we can when Federal assistance for homeland security has. to date. provided the entire State of Massachusetts with only $11 million. the entire State of Pennsylvania with only $18.5 million. and the entire State of California with only $45 million? Can we say we are doing all we canlet alone all that we shouldwhen the bill before us provides the grand total of only $100 million to protect all the highlevelthreat urban areas in the country? How many of these highlevelthreat urban areas are there? Is $100 million enoughor is it only a drop in the bucketwhen we are talking about the security of Atlanta or Austin or Baltimore or Boston or Charleston or Cleveland or Chicago or Dallas or Denver or Detroit or Houston or Las Vegas or Los Angeles or Miami or Milwaukee or Minneapolis or New York City or New Orleans or Philadelphia or Phoenix or Portland or Pittsburgh or Seattle or St. Louis or St. Paul or San Diego or San Antonio or San Francisco or Tampa or Washington. DC. or dozens of other American cities that can legitimately be called highthreat areas. Mr. President. $100 million for highlevel urban threat areasjust for the 29 cities I mentioned above. that works out to $3.3 million for each city. That wont go very far in New York City. where the mayor is spending $5 million a week. It wont go very far in Boston. which is struggling to meet its security obligations while confronting a potential 2year Stateaid cut of $153 million. As a result of these cuts. and declining tax revenues brought about by the recession. there will be no incoming class of police officers for Boston this year. No incoming class. when the threats to the city are unprecedented and when 18 of Bostons officers are serving their country in Iraq. Is Boston supposed to take on these new challenges. with only token financial support from Washington? Apparently. Boston is to go it alone in its efforts to prevent a terrorist attack on any of the 61 hazardous material storage facilities that dot its waterfront. Boston alone is supposed to protect the home heating oil depots along its expressway. And Boston alone is supposed to prevent terrorists from commandeering any one of the hundreds of cruise vessels that stop in our port every year. Instead of wondering where it will end. a better question for us to be asking ourselves today is: How can we go back to our States without doing all we can to protect our communities? Last week. half of the Senate had no problem voting for a massively excessive tax cut for the wealthiest Americans on the flimsiest of economic justifications. Yet now we have voted down $1 billion to protect our seaportseven though their vulnerability could have immediate and devastating effects on our economyand we are reluctant to add another $2 billion to secure our communities. The amendment before us is modest. It does not try to change the fundamental fiscal relationships between the Federal. State. and local governments. It simply says that we can do more. We can do more than the bare minimum that the Presidents Budget Director says is absolutely necessary. We can do more so that our Nations homeland security isnt entirely dependent upon property taxes. lottery revenues. and car washes. The amendment before us would increase assistance to first responders by $1 billion. provide a total of $1.05 billion for assistance to high threat urban areas. $155 million for firefighters equipment grants. and $130 million for staffing and overtime expenses for COPS Program activities. In the context of an unprecedented supplemental appropriation request of $74.8 billion. and with the backdrop of heightened domestic security. can anyone really pretend that these investments are unwise or unnecessary? Today. I spoke to 17 mayors in Massachusetts by conference call. all of whom are struggling to meet the challenges of postSeptember 11 securityand none of whom know how they can go on bearing these costs alone. Their obstacles are impossible to overcome. Mayor Fred Kalisz of New Bedford. a city of 94.000 people and home of the Nations highest value commercial fishing fleet. has incurred $500.000 in specific homeland security expenses to date and has come up with list of $3.4 million in essential capital security requests to protect his citys port. its commercial fishing fleet. and key public facilities. He has no way to pay for these costs. He recently had to suspend drug and alcohol prevention programs for New Bedfords youth. Mayor John Barrett of North Adams. a city of only 14.000 people. has to deploy his small town police force to secure two nuclear powerplantsincluding 533 spent radioactive fuel rodsagainst terrorist attack. In Everett. a city of 38.000 people located just outside Boston. Mayor David Ragucci spends $10.000 a day to secure facilities containing 685.000 gallons of propane. 95 million gallons of jet fuel and a 1500 megawatt powerplant from terrorist attack. In the wake of a $4.5 million budget cut. Mayor Ragucci deserves a combat medal for his efforts to protect these facilities which are within 5 miles of nearly 1 million people. Mayor Bill Whelan of Quincy. a city of 88.000 people. has been hit with over $300.000 in overtime and other personnel costs responding to over 300 anthrax and hazardous materials calls since 9/11. He also has had to begin patrolling the citys 27 miles of open coastline. and begin providing 24hour police protection for a Muslim place of worship. And he is staring at $4.3 million of State local aid cuts in the face. In Fall River. with 92.000 people. Mayor Ed Lambert has done a good job so far balancing a very difficult situation. With a reservoir that serves 200.000 people and the States largest bridge within city limits. Mayor Lambert has had to dramatically increase security at both these critical sites. But. he has had to do it while cutting back his police and fire forces in response to difficult budget shortfalls. Over the last 18 months. Fall River has lost 15 percent of its police force and 10 percent of its firefighters because of budget cuts. In Brockton. Mayor Jack Yunits has been trying to meet the challenges confronting his city of 94.000 while dealing with the loss of 17 police officers. Another six will soon be retiring. and there is no funding to replace them. Among the mayors chief homeland security challenges is the safety and wellbeing of the 6.000 students and faculty who attend Brockton High School each day. the largest high school this side of the Mississippi River. His difficulties will soon be compounded if the proposed State cut of $2.9 million from his budget becomes law. In Lowell. with a population 105.000. six of its police officers and a fireman have been sent to Iraq. With a police force of 220. Lowell may have to insist on 30 early retirements this year to meet its budget constraints. City Manager John Cox tells me that for the first time in recent memory. there will be no new recruits from the police academy. Worcester is Massachusetts second largest city. and Mayor Tim Murray tells me that he has lost over 80 police officers and 86 firefighters due to budget difficulties. All these mayors have their backs against the wall. They are trying as hard as they can to protect their security. but they are not being given the help they need. I think Mayor Yunits from Brockton said it best Our first responders are fighting for their jobs. while they continue fighting to protect us. They will keep at it. I am sure. because they care about this country. They care about their city. They care about protecting their citizens. They care about doing every last thing possible to prevent another disaster on American soil. Shouldnt we in the Senatewith our responsibility to protect the American peopleat least try to help ease this burden? I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. and send a message to the Governors and mayors of America that they are not alone. that they can count on Congress to provide more than mere photo opportunities as they confront the threat of domestic terrorism in their communities."},{"1":"2002","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. the Federal Government must be the role model for civil rights. not for civil rights violations. For far too long there has been little accountability which Federal agencies discriminate and retaliate against their employees. I am happy to say that this is about to change with the enactment of the No FEAR bill. a bill that I introduced. together with the gentlewoman from Texas . and the gentlewoman from Maryland . after a yearlong investigation. That investigation. as well as several General Accounting Office investigations. indicated a serious problem in the Federal Government. The congressional investigation found evidence that a Federal agency was allowing discrimination and retaliation against its employees. This evidence was supported by the GAO reports that investigated discrimination in the Federal workforce during the 1990s and found that complaints of discrimination by Federal agencies grew tremendously. In fact. by 1999. the number of such complaints to the EEOC increased by almost 130 percent over the number of complaints in 1991. The GAO reported that complaints alleging retaliation against employees who had participated in the complaint process also increased. The problem in the Federal workforce is threefold. First. because of inadequate notification requirements. many employees are not aware of their rights and many managers are not aware of their responsibilities. Second. Federal agencies and Congress cannot assess the extent of the problem due to inadequate reporting. Third. Federal agencies are not accountable for the misdeeds of their employees. because they simply tap the general Treasury to pay for court judgments and settlements in discrimination cases. The No FEAR Act targets these 3 problems. The bill will require agencies to pay for all court settlements and judgments for discrimination and retaliation cases. instead of allowing the agency to use a governmentwide slush fund. This will make agencies more accountable. The bill has a notification requirement aimed at improving workforce relations by increasing managers and employees knowledge of their respective rights and responsibilities. The Act also has reporting requirements that will help determine if a pattern of misconduct exists within an agency and whether that agency is taking appropriate action to address the problem. The GAO testified on May 9 that such tracking of complaints. cases. and costs are not occurring. but that it is critical to understanding whether a problem exists. As the National Taxpayers Union stated in urging Congress to enact the legislation. The No FEAR Act promotes the virtues of fiscal responsibility and accountability in government. And. as Jack White of Time Magazine stated. the No FEAR bill is the first new civil rights law of the 21st century. The No FEAR Act passed the House back in October of 2001 with a 420 to zero vote. The Senate. after 6 months. finally passed the bill and sent it back here with a few minor changes to the reporting requirements and 2 new GAO studies. In closing. Mr. Speaker. this bill never would have happened without the hard work of Dr. Marsha ColemanAdebayo. the Federal whistleblower who brought this issue to the forefront. Mr. Leroy Warren of the NAACP. and Steven Kohn of the National Whistle Blowers Center. Mr. Speaker. the Federal Government should be a model of the best practices for a fair and open work environment. That was not the case in the 1990s. but must be the case in the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time."},{"1":"2001","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I thank the Chair and appreciate the Senator from Washington giving me the time to speak on a matter of great importance to the city of Chicago. and actually it is probably of some interest to the Presiding Officer. as she grew up in the city of Park Ridge which is right next to OHare International Airport. I hate to say it. but since the Presiding Officer grew up in Illinois we have had problems at OHare. OHare has been at capacity since 1969. In fact. it was in that year that the FAA first put delay controls in at OHare Airport. Unadvisedly. I think 2 years ago. Congress lifted the delay controls at OHare and LaGuardia. and delays went up exponentially. That has kind of renewed and intensified the crisis we have in aviation in this country. Madam President. I have filed an amendment I will discuss later that I am continuing to work on with my colleague from Illinois. Senator DURBIN. I hope we will be able to work out some arrangements. but my amendment would restore a Chicago supplemental airport to the National Plan for Integrated Airport Systems around the country. the socalled NPIAS list. For 10 years. Chicago had a supplemental airport on the NPIAS list. It was taken off in 1997 by the FAA. I think it is time we put the Chicago supplemental airport back on that nationwide plan for airports. There are several reasons that I say that. I want to first point out exactly where we have our airports in Illinois for those who are following this debate. I show you a map of the Chicago area. We have OHare International Airport on 7.000 acres on the northwest side of the city of Chicago. It is also bounded by the cities of Park Ridge. Des Plaines. Elk Grove. Wood Dale. and Bensenville. We also have Midway Airport that prior to OHares opening in the late 1950s. early 1960s. was the worlds busiest airport. if you can believe it. I think President Kennedy appeared at OHares grand opening in 1963 and by 1969 OHare was at capacity. But if you look at where these airports are located. you see that in order to get more capacity to expand these airports we are confronted with a lot of problems. Midway Airport is right in the middle of a congested area within the city limits of Chicago. In fact. I have never heard the mayor of the city of Chicago suggest expanding Midway to have longer runways. The runways are only 6.000 feet at Midway. so it is very difficult to do a longhaul flight out of that airport. Recently. Southwest Airlines. and also ATA. have been doing very well at Midway. Midway is almost back to where it was in terms of capacity before OHare was built. It is pretty much full right now. Then. of course. we have OHare. OHare has seven runways. I will show you a map of those seven runways. This is a blowup of OHare Airport. All of this land in the interior shown on the map is filled with runways. In fact. OHare has more runways. as far as I know. than any other airport in the country. It has seven runways. It does about 908.000 flights a year. But when you get into expanding OHare. you are met with some real logistical challenges. There is the TriState Tollway on the eastern boundary of OHare. You have the Northwest Tollway on the northern boundary of OHare. and you have Irving Park Road to the south. and you have York RoadRoute 83to the west. So a lot of people have been saying to me: Why dont we just put down more runways at OHare? Many people thinkand. in fact. some encourage the perceptionthat putting in new runways at OHare would be as simple as laying new sidewalks. But the fact is. it is very difficult to figure out how you get more capacity at OHare. I show you on this map the existing configuration of the runways at OHare. This 7.000acre field goes way back. The planning was started in the 1940s. It came on line in the late 1950s. I gather that the airport has had this runway configuration for many yearsat least 30 years. maybe more. But there are seven runways at OHare. One of them is one of the largest runways in the country. I believe this runway14R32L--is one of the longest runways in this country. about 14.000 feet. The problem with these seven runways. though. is that they are not really laid out properly. In fact. in an optimal configuration that would be done today in a new airport. they would lay these runways out in a parallel fashion so they do not intercept. If you have a plane landing on this runway shown on the map. for example. then another plane cannot be taking off on that runway. So OHares problem isnt that it does not have enough runways but that they are not laid out right. In fact. Atlantas Hartsfield Airport. which only has four runwaysthey are trying to build more nowhandles more flights now than OHare does. even though It only has four runways. That is because those runways are laid out in a parallel fashion. and you can have simultaneous departures and landings on those different parallel runways. In any case. Mayor Daley has recently proposed getting more capacity out of OHare essentially by tearing all of this up and rebuilding it. In fact. I think the mayor proposes tearing up three runways and building four new ones. One of these runwaysI think this runway. the 14.500foot runwaythey would just tear up and demolish it. They would lay new runways all in a parallel fashion. But the problem is. this project gets very expensive. and it would take a very long period of time. This is a diagram of Mayor Daleys proposed modernization of OHare. which really amounts to a tearing up and rebuilding of the airport. He would eliminate this runway and this runway I show you on the map. and he would lay parallel runways. He would leave this runway shown here in place. You would essentially have six parallel runways here. and then two parallel in this direction shown here. Essentially. it is kind of like a quadfour runway system. I think mainly these four parallel runways would be the ones that would be used. In addition. the mayor would add a western access to the airport. The Presiding Officer would be very interested to know that when she grew up in Illinois. it was much easier to get to OHare than it is today. In fact. back in the 1950s and 1960s. there were just cornfields out in that direction. The Northwest Tollway was built in the late 1950s during the Eisenhower administration in 1958. and the development started occurring much later. But now it is very difficult to get into OHare because there is not enough access. In fact. coming from my home in Inverness. which is only 12 miles to the northwest. sometimes it takes an hour to go those 12 miles east on the Northwest Tollway because of congestion. So recognizing that congestion is a problem. the mayor would propose creating a western access to the airport with another major expressway coming into the west to relieve some of the bottleneck that enters now at the airport on the east. Also. he would add a new terminal. I think basically what they have now is the main terminals. which he would redo under a program called the World Gateway Program that would cost $4 billion. or actually $3.8 billion. to be exact. They would give United terminals 1 and 2. and American terminals 3 and 4. My understanding of it is that most of the other airlines would be stuck at a desk out here on the west side of the airport. These are the various elements that would have to be done in order to accomplish Mayor Daleys expansion plan. They would close the 3 existing runways. construct 4 new runways. make an extension of 4 runways. construction of the west terminal. construction of western airport access. acquisition of 433 acres. acquisition of 303 homes. and acquisition of 240 rental units. The costs of this proposal have been all over the map. I think the mayor initially disclosed about $6 billion. But that was pretty much just for tearing up and rebuilding the runways. He did not include the $4 billion he is spending now on the World Gateway Program. That brings it up. even by the mayors cost estimates. to about a $10 billion reconstruction project. The fact is. when you add in the cost of all the ancillary projects. including road building projects. you would probably have to expand the Northwest Tollway and the expressway to accommodate more people. In fact. you can barely get into the airport right now. as I have said. Imagine what it would be like trying to get into the airport after twice as many people are being urged to go into the airport. So it would be a very costly projectprobably somewhere in the $15 billion range. possibly up toward $20 billion. The Chicago Tribune has had estimates ranging from $6.3 billion to $18.9 billion. My thought is this: I believe we have an aviation crisis in Chicago because we lack capacity. We have far greater demand than we have capacity. OHare has capacity for about 908.000 flights a year. Mayor Daleys proposal of spending about $15 billion. and lasting at least 15 years following the approval process. would get us up to 1.6 million operations a year. I favor. instead of going forward with that proposal. building a supplemental Chicago airport. The reason I favor that is because it would bring far more capacity. far more quickly. at far less cost. This is a chart that shows what would be involved in expanding OHare visavis what would be involved in building a third airport in the Chicago area. The cost could range from $13 billion to $26 billion for the OHare expansion. The estimated cost of the third airport. which would have six parallel runways and handle 1.6 million operations a year. would be only $5 billion to $6 billionthe same as Denver International Airport. Mayor Daley proposes adding 700.000 flights. or operations. a year for the money he proposes spending. For a third of the cost. you could get 1.6 million more operations a year. In contrast to the 15yearsplus it would take the city of Chicago to tear up and rebuild OHareand God only knows what the delays would be like while they were tearing up and rebuilding OHarethe State has estimated it could have the first phase of a third airport done in 3 to 5 years following the approval. That would only be with one or two runways to begin with. ultimate buildout would be six runways. There is great community support for the third airport. There is significant community opposition around the expansion of OHare. Also. competition. Surprise. surprise. but United and American oppose a third airport. Well. United and American have at least 75 percent of the operations. In fact. United and American oppose a third airport because they. right now. have 76 percent of the hub gates at Chicagos OHare Airport. If you look around the country. you will see that we have a tendency around the whole United States toward having a local air carrier that has a dominant position at a regional hub airport. If you look at Atlantas Hartsfield. you have Delta with 62 percent of the hub gates. At DallasFort Worth. you have American Airlines and Delta together controlling 84 percent of the gates. In Denver. a brand new airport. United is already up to 57 percent of the gates. At Washington/Dulles. United is up to 65 percent of the gates. So. surprise. United and American oppose a third airport. The reason for that is they would not control the third airport in Chicago. There would be new entrants that would be allowed to come in and compete with them. It seems to me that we should not let that detour us because we are not representing the shareholders of the big six air carriers in the Senate. We need to be worried about aviation consumers. Over the last 20 yearsin fact. since deregulation of the aviation industry in the late 1970soperations in aviation have gone up 80 percent in this country. Yet we havent built a single new major airport. except for the Denver Airport. which was simply a replacement for the old Stapleton International Airport. which got shut down. As you look around the country. big airlines that have a dominant position in their market fight like the dickens to prevent another airport from being built because that would allow new entrants to come into their territory. and it would force them to lower costs and improve services or they lose new business to the new entrants. Because United and American dont want new competitors coming into their marketplace where they have a duopoly should not deter anybody. What I think would be best for consumers in the Chicago area is if we did have another major hub airport and we had other carriers coming into compete with United and American. They are both good airlines. They have wonderful employees and thousands of wonderful pilots. mechanics. and stewardesses. but I believe the consumers in the Chicago area would benefit by having new choices. I think there are possibilities. such as getting a wonderful new startup airline such as a Jet Blue. or even a Southwest Airways. which is competing at Midway Airport in Chicago. but might someday enjoy having the opportunity to run longer haul flights out of the Chicago area and compete more headon with United and American at OHare. To get one of those fine airlines in the new airport would be great for the Chicago area. and it would help decongest OHare for the rest of the Nation. Now. in the few moments I still have. I want to make one final point. In this regard. I want to associate myself with my colleague from Illinois in the other Chamber. JESSE JACKSON. Jr. For many years he has been a strong proponent of a third Chicago area airport. It is the south suburbs and the southern limits of the city of Chicago that he represents in Congress. He makes the point that we should not want all economic activity in our State concentrated in one 7.000acre site. That is perhaps why I disagree with Mayor Daley. the mayor of the city of Chicago. He has a different constituency than I. As mayor of the city of Chicago. he wants to keep as much economic development as possible in the city of Chicago. and Chicago is a mighty fine city. and I hope it remains always strong. Looking at this issue as a Senator with statewide responsibilities and concern for the whole State. I want other parts of Illinois to have jobs. economic development. and an economic engine. too. I want the Rockford area to have their airport used. I want jobs for the people in the south suburbs. and I want some convenience for the 2 millionplus people who live in the south suburbs who have to drive 2 hours or more to get to OHare on those crowded expressways. Yesterday. there was a good column in the Chicago Tribune by a new columnist for the Chicago Tribune. Her name is Dawn Turner Trice. She analogized this issue actually to the G8 economic summit that was just concluded in Europe whereby the big G8 countries were talking about sharing the wealth with the rest of the world. forgiving some of the debts that Third World nations have. turning loans into grants. outright grants to help some of the developing countries. She said: Why arent we looking at this airport issue the same way in the State of Illinois? Why do we allow such a great concentration of wealth in one tiny 7.000acre site and not worry about it anywhere else? She is absolutely right on that and. in addition. those wealthy communities around the airport have said enough is enough. Their quality of life is now negatively impacted by the continual cramming of everything into OHare. The idea of dramatically increasing the number of flights at OHare beyond what they are now presents a real dilemma to the Chicago area. People do not know how they can get there now. They cannot imagine what OHare would be like if the airport was expanded further."},{"1":"2000","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. I would like to recognize Kids Voting USA and its efforts to educate our children about civic democracy and the importance of being an informed voter. The program began in 1988 with three Arizona businessmen on a fishing trip to Costa Rica. They learned that voter turnout in that country was routinely about 80 percent. This high turnout was attributed to a tradition of children accompanying their parents to the polls. The men observed firsthand the success Costa Rica had achieved by instilling in children at an early age the importance of active participation and voting. The three Arizona businessmen took this idea back to the United States and founded Kids Voting USA. Today. this nonprofit. nonpartisan organization reaches 5 million students in 39 states. and includes 200.000 teachers. and 20.000 voter precincts. With voter turnout declining each year. Kids Voting. USA recognizes the need to educate our youth and instill in them the responsibility to be active. informed citizens and voters. Kids Voting USA enables students to visit official polls on election day. accompanied by a parent or guardian. to cast a ballot that replicates the official ballot. Although not part of the official results. the students votes are registered at schools and by the media. This year. National Kids Voting. Week is September 2529. It is a week when Kids Voting communities across the country celebrate this vibrant and important program. I would like to recognize Kids Voting USA and all it has done to promote the future of democracy by engaging families. schools and communities in the election process.*"},{"1":"1999","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. I rise today to offer this amendment to authorize the awarding of the Medal of Honor to Alfred Rascon. Mr. Rascon. a Mexicanborn immigrant. represents the finest tradition of service to this country. This award. after these many years. will correct an oversight and provide Mr. Rascon with the recognition he has earned. I would like to acknowledge the hard work of Representative LANE EVANS. who I am working with on this issue and who has worked to help correct the oversight that prevented the awarding of the Medal of Honor to Mr. Rascon. To best understand the courage exhibited by Mr. Rascon. I would like to quote an excerpt from the study The Military Contributions of Immigrants published by Empower America. the American Immigration Law Foundation. the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. Heroes and Heritage. the Japanese American Veterans Association. and Veterans of Foreign Wars of the U.S. The study describes in detail Mr. Rascons actions on March 16. 1966: Alfred Rascon was born in Chihuahau. Mexico and immigrated to the United States with his parents in the 1950s. He served two tours in Vietnam. one as a medic. and was known as Doc. When Rascon volunteered for the service he was not a citizen but still a lawful permanent resident. He was 17 years old but tricked his mother into signing his papers so he could enlist. On March 16. 1966. bullets flew and grenades exploded. and Rascons platoon found itself in a maelstrom of North Vietnamese firepower. When an American machine gunner went down and someone called for a medic. Rascon. 20 at the time. ignored his orders to remain under cover and rushed down the trail amid a hail of enemy gunfire and grenades. To better protect the wounded soldier. Rascon placed his body between the enemy machine gun fire and the soldier. Rascon turned. He was shot in the hip. Although wounded. he managed to drag the soldier off the trail. Rascon soon discovered the man he was dragging was dead. Specialist 4th Class Larry Gibson crawled forward looking for ammunition. The other machine gunner was already dead and Gibson had no ammunition with which to defend the platoon. Rascon grabbed the dead soldiers ammo and gave it to Gibson. Then. amid relentless enemy fire and grenades. Rascon hobbled back up the trail. snared the dead soldiers machine gun and. most importantly. 400 rounds of additional ammunition. The pace quickened and the grenades dropped. One ripped open Rascons face. It didnt stop him. He saw another grenade drop five feet from a wounded Nell Haffy. He tackled Haffy and absorbed the grenade blast himself. saving Haffys life. Though severely wounded. Rascon crawled back among the other wounded and gave them aid. A few minutes later. Rascon saw Sergeant Ray Compton being hit by gunfire. As Rascon moved toward him. another hand grenade dropped. Instead of seeking cover Rascon dove on top of the wounded sergeant and again absorbed the blow. That time the explosion smashed through Rascons helmet and ripped into his scalp. He saved Comptons life. When the firefight ended. Rascon refused aid for himself until the other wounded were evacuated. So bloodied by the conflict was Rascon that when soldiers placed him on the evacuation helicopter. a chaplain saw his condition and gave him last rites. But Alfred Rascon survived. Today. Rascon. now 50. lives in Howard County. Maryland. The soldiers who witnessed Rascons deeds that day recommended him in writing for a Medal of Honor. Years later. these soldiers were shocked to discover that he had not received one. The men continue to this day to seek full recognition and the awarding of the Medal of Honor for Alfred Rascon. Perhaps the best description of Alfred Rascons actions came 30 years later from fellow platoon member Larry Gibson I was a 19yearold gunner with a recon section. We were under intense and accurate enemy fire that had pinned down the point squad. making it almost impossible to move without being killed. Unhesitatingly. Doc [as he was called] went forward to aid the wounded and dying. I was one of the wounded. Doc took the brunt of several enemy grenades. shielding the wounded with his body . . . In these few words I cannot fully describe the events of that day. The acts of unselfish heroism Doc performed while saving the many wounded. though severely wounded himself. speak for themselves. This country needs genuine heroes. Doc Rascon is one of those. Rascon was once asked why he acted with such courage on the battlefield even though he was an immigrant and not yet a citizen. Rascon replied. I was always an American in my heart. Mr. President. the approach of Memorial Day is a proper occasion for us to reflect on what it means to live in a nation that can attract young men and women who were not even born here to volunteer and. if necessary. die for their adopted country. It is an occasion to reflect on what it means to live in a nation where to this day the children of immigrants volunteer and serve. Today. over 60.000 active military personnel are immigrants to his country. This desire to serve is consistent with our history. More than 20 percent of the recipients of our highest military award. the Congressional Medal of Honor. have been immigrants. Indeed America remains free because in no small part she has been blessed with many American heroes willing to give their lives in her defense. During his last year in office. Ronald Reagan traveled out to a high school in Suitland. MD. Surrounded by students he was asked about America and what it means to be an American. President Reagan looked out at the young people and responded: I got a letter from a man the other day. and Ill share it with you. The man said you can go to live in Japan. but you cannot become Japaneseor Germany. or Franceand he named all the others. But he said anyone from any corner of the world can come to America and become an American. We owe a debt to all those people. wherever they or their parents were born. who have kept our Nation free and safe in a dangerous world. And we owe a continuing debt of gratitude to those today who serve. guarding our country. our homes and our freedom. Like all good things. freedom must be won again and again. I hope all of us will remember those. immigrants and native born. who have won freedom for us in the past. and stand ready to win freedom for us again. if they must. May we never forget our debt to the brave who have fallen and the brave who stand ready to fight. I believe the awarding of the Medal of Honor to Alfred Rascon is richly deserved. This award will demonstrate Americas appreciation of Alfred Rascons valor in combat and recognize his extraordinary service to this country. Mr. President. I yield the floor."},{"1":"1998","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I do not have much time. but I just want to say I spent 71 years as a criminal court judge in Tennessee prior to coming to Congress. trying primarily felony criminal cases. and I rise in strong opposition to the Hutchinson amendment and in strong support of the gentleman from Pennsylvania . Our Government has become far too big and far too powerful. and too many individual citizens are being run roughshod by prosecutors that are totally out of control. We need to defeat this amendment. Mr. Chairman. I think I am the only Member of this Congress who has ever sentenced anyone to the electric chair. I believe in being very tough on crime. and I especially have been a strong supporter of local law enforcementthe people on the front lines who are fighting the real crime. the violent crime that everyone is so concerned about. But I remember in late 1993 reading an article in Forbes magazine. one of the most conservative magazines in the Nation. This article said that we had quadrupled the Justice Department just since 1980 and that Federal prosecutors were falling all over themselves trying to find cases to prosecute. We have had far too many cases where overzealous prosecutors have presented high profile defendants just so that prosecutor could make a name for himself. I remember the totally unjustified case against President Reagans Secretary of Labor. Ray Donovan. in which. after he was acquitted. made the famous statement. Where do I go to get my reputation back? Our Federal Government has become far too bigit is far too powerful. We all have heard how. particularly the IRS is running roughshod over individual citizens. Newsweek magazine recently had on its coverthe IRS Lawless. Abusive. Out of Control. Unfortunately while there are good federal prosecutors. there are far too many who are. like the IRS. lawless. abusive. and outofcontrol. Almost no one. except extremely wealthy people. can take on the Federal Government. To require Federal prosecutors to have to follow the same ethical rules as other lawyers is a very minimal step in the right direction and toward helping to preserve at least a semblance of freedom in this Nation."},{"1":"1997","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. the last time congressional salaries were given a costofliving adjustmentand this is not a pay raisewas in 1993. The pay raise for Federal employees that year was 3.7 percent. the COLAs for Congress were 3.2 percent. In 1992. the costofliving adjustment for Federal employees was 4.2 percent. and for Members of Congress it was 3.5 percent. We are now in a situation where. in my judgment. if we dont take this costofliving adjustment for this year. I am sure we will not take it next year being an election year. That means we will not take it until 1999. Since that is the year before a Presidential election year. we will not take it then either. We will not take it in the year 2000. which is a Presidential election year. I suggest we are going into the next century with this maladjustment. as far as congressional salaries. It does not make any difference to me. It does not make any difference to any of us. We are here. We made our commitment. What about those out there who should come and serve their country by being part of the legislative branch of this Federal Government? We have raised the salaries of the people who are Federal civilians downtown. We have raised the salaries of the Federal employees. We have raised the payments made to Federal retirees. We have raised Social Security recipients. We have not raised for Members of Congress. and I predict we will not do it unless we face up to the problem now. The problem is not ours. The problem is what is going to be the judgment of the people who want to serve in the Congress when they start looking at the income levels here in Congress compared to their own income levels. Now. Mr. President. in 1970and I was here thenmy wife and I had just bought a home here in Washington the year before for $65.000. At the time. our pay was $42.500. That house has now soldwe sold it some time agobut I know that it sold for $450.000. Our pay here is roughlynot quite. but roughlythree times the salary we had then. What I am trying to make people in the Senate think about is. what will be the decision made by young people who are thinking about coming here when they look at the cost of living in Washington. DC. which is the highest now in our Nationthe cost of property here. the cost of renting a home or a condominium. I am talking about family people. When we came down here. we came down here with five children and had to have a home that five children could live in. There is no way a person can come here now at the salary level we have now and buy a home for that. where five children can live with their mother and father. unless they are extremely wealthy. What the Senate is doing. in my judgment. is setting the course to assure that the people serving in this body will either be multimillionaires or they will be the people who are not capable of earning over $100.000 anyway. Now. maybe I am being too tough about this. but I think it is time to get tough about this issue and have people understand that the costofliving adjustment is less than the Consumer Price Index increaseless. In other words. it means for people living here now. we are adjusting their salaries now with a costofliving adjustment. for the cost increase. really. for the period starting 18 months ago until 6 months ago. and we are trying to adjust it now for what the costs were back then. It is not a salary increase.. This is for the cost of living in this area. Now. people talk to me. well. you can live in Minnesota or maybe you can live in Kansas. maybe you can live somewhere else for a lot less money. It happens to be. in my case. my cost of living in Alaska is just slightly higher than this. But as a practical matter. the judgments made by future generations will be: We. as a family member. cannot take that job. Now. we get a lot of demagogic type of lettersthey come in from my constituents. too-You are not worth that money. why dont you come home? The real question Is. what would they do if the people were here that they believe should be here? The people would either work for nothing. because they are so rich they can. or the people that could not make the money that they would make here would come for the pay. Now. Mr. President. we have to make up our mind what kind of a body we want in the Congress. From my point of view. we want people with capabilities who can perform jobs that are needed to be performed. Take my colleague from Wyoming. Senator ENZI. the only accountant in this bodythe only accountant in the Senate. What are we dealing with now? Massive. complex tax issues. complex problems of accounting. The people that are going to come here are going to be motivated by trying to do a job. The ones who cannot come here. despite that motivation. will be the ones who cannot afford to live a family life in this town at that salary. Keep in mind something else. We dont come here permanently. As a matter of fact. most people who would vote for this do not want us to come for more than two terms anyway. But as a practical matter. we all maintain a home in our home States. We have expenses there and we have expenses here. There is no one in the employment scene today that has that situation other than Members of Congress. Now. I votedit was a voice votebut I voted against it and I would vote against it on a recorded vote because we were taking an action to deny Members of Congress. for the fifth time. a cost of living. which is a structural change. What it will mean is. downstream someone will have to have the courage to make the adjustment. Incidentally. we have had three times when that happened. In 1977. the Congress made a 28.9percent change. That was a salary increase. but it was to make up for the fact that in 6 of the previous 7 years Congress had not taken the costofliving adjustment. Again. in 1982. we took a 15percent change. It was because in 3 of the previous 4 years Congress had not taken a costofliving adjustment. In 1987. we again took a change. It was because. again. we had in 2 of the previous. 4 years not taken the costofliving adjustment. Again. in 1991. we had a 27.1percent increase. What I am saying is. you kid yourself as much as you want. the time will come when Congress will have to recognize that this structural change in the salary. visavis the salaries of comparable jobs in the economy. that the salary increase must come. So instead of recognizing this as a costofliving adjustment and treating it as such and providing that we take a minimum amountand by the way. in most instances we have taken less than was available. For instance. in 1979. the Federal employees got a 7percent increase. Federal retirees got 11.1. Congress gave itself 5.5. We kept the cost of living down each time. But when we did it. we did not have the total structural impact of denying it altogether. Now. the structural situation will be. if I am right. that we will not have a costofliving increase next year or the next 2 years. We will go into the 21st century with a salary level of 1993. In that year. again. we had a 3.2percent COLA and Federal employees had 3.7 percent. If you look at my charts that are included in the RECORD. using the CPI in this period of 27 years. which has been 315.7 percent. we have taken a 214.4percent total costofliving change. Social Security recipients had 421.3 percent. postal workers. 370 percent. the military. 360 percent. Federal retirees. 328 percent. privatesector employees. 265 percent. Federal civilians. 334 percent. We are at least 100 percent structurally below the comparable salary base in this 27year phase. What does that say to young people about serving in the Congress? Even if it is on a twoterm basis limit. to be here for 12 years and take a structural level of 15 years to start with and serve with people who will not take the costofliving adjustment while you are here anyway. I think this is destroying the system that we have today of citizens who commit themselves to be part of a great democracy. We have not done this to the people who work downtown for the President. Presidential salaries have changed and so have the salaries of the executives on a Presidential appointment level. We have. by the way. impacted the Judiciary. and I think that is something other people will talk about and I will talk about later. too. because the Federal Judiciary. while it does have a better system in the sense there is no contribution for a Federal judge for his or her retirement. as we contribute. it is lifetime pay. When they retire. they get the full amount of their salary. not a percent as we do based on the number of years we have been here. But as a practical matter. with the three branches of Government. the only part. through selfflagellation. that destroys the future of the body is the Congress itself. It is a great mistake. It is a great mistake. I think we all make sacrifices to come to this job. anyway. I can tell the Senate that when I came to the Senate. I was making more than three times my salary as a private lawyer in Alaska. Many people come here and take a reduction in income. There are others who come here and it makes no difference. because of either their great wealth or their inability to earn the same amount of money before they got here. Many people take a sizable decrease in income to come here. But what we are telling the younger people nowand we are trying to attract younger people. When I came here. the average age was almost 70. today. I think it is down to almost 50. We are still trying to attract younger people. This is a dynamic society and we should do that. But can you do that. Mr. President? Can you look a young man or woman in the eye and say: You can move to Washington. you can afford to live there and serve for 2 years in the House or 6 years in the Senate. or maybe two terms. You can keep your family there. and you can keep your house at home. and you can be able to return to your life when you finish the service. without having lost your future as far as your career is concerned. This is not right. It is not right. I have made this speech before and it doesnt seem to make any difference to anybody. But I am compelled to do it again because I have served here longer than any Member of our side of the aisle on the committee that has jurisdiction on this subject. I cannot believe we would continue to make this error. I believe that Members have left this bodyand there are some leaving it now -not because they have served too long. or they dont like the job. or they havent done a good enough job. but they cannot plan for their future. At one time. I had five children in college. At that time. thank God. there were jobs they could get during the summer. and we were able to help them and they all got through. But. today. a Senator with five children. with the cost of housing. and five going to college. why. that person would have to vote from the poor house. Mr. President. This job ought to pay what it is worth to society. This is the job of the continuity of the American system. We serve for 6 years. We volunteer for that job and we are the institutional memory of the American democracy. I am alarmed that there are not enough people on this floor that realize that. I am truly alarmed at the number of people that. for political reasons. or other reasons. or campaign promises. would harm the future of the Senate. would harm the democracy by telling the American people that you will either turn the Senate over to the very. very wealthy or those who could not earn as much anywhere else. Now. the time will come when we will face up to this. It will probably be in 2001. As I add it up. roughly. the percentage of pay increase then to recover the structural balance will be in the vicinity of 35 percent. How many people are going to want to do that in their first term? How many people are going to want to do that. who are just up for election? I have just mentioned twothirds of the body then. So I say the demise of the American democracy is here. That is why the Constitutional Convention argued about who should determine what Members are paid. They were talking about citizen legislators then. not people who came here and stayed 7. 8 months a year. They are talking about people who could go home. people who lived within the original 13 States. My home is closer to Beijing than it is to Washington. DC. and this is a 50State Union now. My colleague from Hawaii lives almost as far away. If anyone wants to look at costs. they ought to look at the cost of representing those two States. But the main thing is. we think about the structural salary level for the future. I am not going to be around here that longmaybe longer than some people think. But. Mr. President. we will witness the decline in the value of the Congress and the American society if we dont have the guts to stand up to the demagogs and tell them that pay for the Congress ought to be sufficient to attract the most capable people in our society. The capability is what counts. I am disturbed that. once again. we will deny the economic cycle that causes an adjustment being necessary. and we will say. as soon as we balance the budget in 2002. if I am hearing right. it may be 2003 before it is changed. That would be 10 years. How many people will decide not to come because of that. Mr. President? How many brilliant minds will be denied the American Congress because of that? I think it is wrong. I am going to speak at length when the time comes. and I am going to show what has happened to other countries when they followed and pursued this course and how they have deteriorated. The deterioration of America is something that we should worry about in terms of democracy. My predecessors used to go take the train across the country and then take a steamship up to Seward in our State and a railroad up to Fairbanks and go home once a year. I go home 15 to 30 or 35 times a year. It is a different society. I am telling the Senate. unless we are willing to recognize this different society and the dynamic society that needs people who are family people. who must make sacrifices to start with. but should not have to make this kind of sacrifice. to accept a structurally imbalanced salary caused by the inability of each successive Congress to face up to reality."},{"1":"1996","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. included in S. 640. the Water Resources Development Act. is a provision which provides for the reallocation of a sufficient amount of existing water supply storage space in Broken Bow Lake to support the Mountain Fork trout fishery on a permanent basis. The bill also requires releases of water from Broken Bow Lake to be undertaken at no expense to the State of Oklahoma to mitigate the loss of fish and wildlife resources in the Mountain Fork River as recommended by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation (ODWC] began stocking trout in 12 miles of the lower Mountain Fork river in December 1988. I worked on legislation in 1992. Public Law 102580. section 102(v). which authorized the reallocation of unobligated water supply storage for the purpose of maintaining the trout fishery. As a result. it is estimated the trout fishery generates over $1 million annually in aggregate benefits to the economy of southeastern Oklahoma. It is the intention of this bill that water releases be made from the Mountain Fork Dam to mitigate the loss of 28 miles of highquality small mouth bass waters destroyed when the Broken Bow Dam was constructed. A 1960 U.S. Fish and Wildlife mitigation recommendation for a 100 cubicfeetpersecond instantaneous release from Broken Bow Dam is being released approximately 8 miles downstream and gauged 12 miles downstream rather than at the dam. as originally recommended. With slight modification. implementation of the 1960 USFWS mitigation recommendation would provide releases necessary to maintain the fishery in its present capacity. Under a reasonable worstcase scenario. maintaining the Mountain Fork fishery requires release of approximately 38.454 acrefeet through the spillway and 41.259 acrefeet released through hydro generation. It is my understanding that over 90 percent of Broken Bow water storage capacity is uncontracted. Thus. mitigating the loss of the small mouth bass fishery through maintenance of the trout fishery does not adversely affect the water supply needs of local municipalities or hydro generation. Finally. It is not the intent of this legislation to interrupt maintenance of the Mountain Fork trout fishery as it has been maintained since 1992. The purpose of this legislation is to partially mitigate the loss of fish and wildlife resources in the Mountain Fork River as recommended by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Regional Director in 1960. The Mountain Fork trout fishery could not be properly maintained without cooperation between the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation. the Army Corps of Engineers. and the Southwestern Power Administration. I. along with the people of McCurtain County. appreciate their hard work to maintain this project."},{"1":"1995","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. although there are many worthy provisions In this measure. H.R. 1215. I must take exception to the inclusion of title IV. the Congressional and Federal Employee Retirement Equalization Act. It is important to note that due to a lack of consensus by Membern of both parties. these retirement provisions. originally H.R. 1185. never came to a vote in the Committee of Jurisdiction. Now these same provisions are being brought to the floor under a closed rule and as part of a separate legislative package. These actions stand in direct contradiction to the committee process and have in effect. restricted debate on an issue that will affect thousands of hard working families in my district. The inclusion of title IV in a tax reduction bill seems ironic because. in essence. title IV Is a tax increase on Federal workers. Title IV mandates a 2.5 percent payroll tax increase on Federal employees and institutes a fundamental change in the calculation of each workers retirement benefits. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this change will cause Federal workers to suffer a 4 percent decrease in future pension benefits. In this same bill which grants a tax benefit of $500 per child for families with an upper limit income of $200.000. title IV will cost an additional $750 per year for the family of a Federal employee earning an average salary of $30.000 per year. Along with many of my constituents. I believe this Is an unfair burden to place on our dedicated Federal workers. Most importantly. the central issue of the debate over title IV is the issue of honoring the commitments we have made to Federal employees. When Congress restructured the Federal Reurement System in 1986. barely 9 years ago. we set up the FERS system on a selfsustaining basis and established a system for honoring the liabilities of the old Civil Service Retirement System. At that time we pron. ised our Federal employees that this would be the last time we would alter their pension plan. Many hard working families relied on that commitment and planned their families futures based on that commitment. We should live up to the contract we have made with our Federal workers. Title IV of this measure breaks that promise. Regrettably. title IV has been Included within a tax and spending reduction bill which includes many positive proposals. including: A tax credit for longterm care. the establishment of an American dream savings account. relief of the marriage penalty tax. IRA deductions. and capital gains benefits and reductions. These tax cuts are fiscally responsible. Of course that tax cuts as a whole reduce Federal revenues. that Is what tax cuts do. However. families In my district deserve a tax cut and deserve to have Federal spending reined In. Accordingly. this legislation will accomplish both. cut spending that needs to be cut and using those savings to reduce taxes for American families and businesses. Accordingly. I will vote for passage of this measure. despite my objections to the provisions of title IV."},{"1":"1994","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. I want to be very brief. because I have had the cooperation. procedurally. from the two managers. and I see the distinguished Senator from Arkansas. who is the chairman of the subcommittee within which the jurisdiction rests for this proposed piece of legislation. The Senator from Arkansas and I have taken the floor many times in this Chamber to discuss certain historical facts relating to the Civil War. and I hope that we will have a few minutes this afternoon to address this very important amendment. This amendment applies to eight pieces of land. battlefields in the valley of Virginia. fought over by two famous military figures in American historyGen. Stonewall Jackson. one of the most revered men in the State of Virginia. and Gen. Philip Sheridan. These are eight pieces of ground. hallowed ground. ground which is visited each year by literally hundreds of thousands of Americans and other visitors of this country. your constituents. my constituents. Indeed. I had not seen one or more of these battlefields myself until over the past 2 years. I had the opportunity to visit it while we were putting this legislation together. Senator ROBB is a cosponsor with me. My staff assistant. Ann Loomis. and I. and others from the Park Service. historians. have traveled every one of these battlefields. It is fascinating. I urge my colleagues. given the time some day. to go learn for themselves about this piece of history in the 1860s. But it is eight pieces of ground that are going to be donated to the United States of America. to the people of this country. or in some manner integrated into this national park in such a way it does not require the taxpayers to spend the money. Several of these pieces of ground have been held in the same family since that epic struggle. Those families want to continue. but they want to share this property with citizens all across this Nation. This is a unique piece of legislation. Yes. it is a national park. but it is a national park created in cooperation with landowners donating the property or otherwise acceding to certain provisions which enable it to be shared with visitors in partnership with the local communities anxious to preserve this ground against further encroachment from sprawling growth of small towns and large towns in the local area. That is why we call it a partnership. and I think you will find. I say to my colleagues with all due respect. that this can serve as a model for the future to hold down the costs associated with the creation of national parks. The distinguished Senator from Wyoming. the ranking member on this committee. is very concerned and properly so. I supported him earlier today in his amendment to hold down the costs associated with national parks. and I hope that he and other Senators would look at the uniqueness of this bill and consider it on its merits and also as a model piece of legislation to guide other Senators and Members of Congress as they desire to create parks in their own community. The Shenandoah Valley National Battlefields Partnership Act is the product of an indepth study by the National Park Service which was authorIzed by the Congress in 1990. In the draft report issued in 1991. the Park Service conducted field surveys of 15 battlefields in the valley and concluded in their analysis that because of their size and unprotected status. the battlefields of the Shenandoah Valley were its most important. most neglected. and most threatened resource. Mr. President. throughout my service in this body. I have been actively involved in the preservation of several Civil War battlefields in Virginia. One of my first legislative initiatives was to sponsor legislation in 1980 to expand the boundaries of the Manassas National Battlefield Park by 1.522 acres. While some battlefield preservation efforts in Virginia have been accomplished by a consensus of support from local governments. the preservation community and the Federal Government. other battlefield issues have involved a great deal of acrimony. I am pleased today that I bring to the Senate legislation which represents a significant investment of time. understanding. and accommodation by preservation groups and local governments which has resulted in legislation to protect and preserve these treasures of our American heritage. Each party interested in fostering the protection of the Shenandoah Valley battlefields has worked for the past year to craft a consensus proposal that recognizes the limits on the Federal Governments resources to acquire substantial acreage in the valley and balances the needs of property owners and local governments to provide for their economic future. The Shenandoah Valley National Battlefields Partnership Act can be. I believe. a responsible method of preserving unprotected. yet significant Civil War sites. While authorizing limited Federal acquisition of eight battlefields in the valley. the core of this legislation is to foster and encourage an atmosphere of cooperation between the Federal Government. State and local governments. property owners. and preservation groups who currently own some of this historic property. Local governments will benefit from. and have endorsed. the creation of a new national park within their jurisdictions because they recognize that the Park Service can provide technical assistance about the location of Civil War engagements. This assistance will allow local governments to plan appropriately for new growth and development within their borders. Mr. President. specifically. my legislation establishes the Shenandoah Valley National Battlefields consisting of the boundaries of 1.140 acres of 8 battlefields throughout the valley. They include Stonewall Jacksons Valley Campaign of 1862 of the battles of McDowell. Cross Keys. and Port Republic. the Gettysburg Campaign in 1863 marked by the Second Battle of Winchester. the Lynchburg Campaign of 1864 at the Battle of New Market. and Union General Sheridans Valley Campaign of 1864 of the battles of Fishers Hill. Toms Brook. and Cedar Creek. As the Park Services draft report identified more than 33.000 acres as core battlefield engagement areas. I propose the creation of the Shenandoah Valley National Battlefields Commission to make recommendations on which of these core areas should be added to the battlefields. These recommendations will be developed as the Commission discharges its duties of preparing a heritage plan with the assistance of the Park Service and active public involvement. The heritage plan must be approved by the Secretary of the Interior and transmitted to the Congress for approval. The heritage plan will identify the final boundaries of the battlefields and identify which areas are part of the core engagement areas and which areas contributed in a significant way to the historical events that occurred In the valley from 1862 to 1864. Mr. President. there is no question about the value of these properties. They are essentially undisturbed and continue to tell an important story of the military strategy employed during the battles of Thomas J. Stonewall Jacksons valley campaign of 1862 and the battles associated with Union Gen. Philip Sheridans Burning of the Shenandoah Valley in 1864. Approximately onethird of the recorded events of the Civil War occurred in Virginia. Dyers Compendium of the War of the Rebellion records 297 incidents of armed conflict in the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War: 6 battles. 18 engagements. 21 actions. and 252 skirmishes. The Shenandoah Valleyreferred to as the Granary of Virginia-was the richest agricultural region in Virginia. providing provisions to the Confederate forces. In addition. the Confederates used the valley as a natural corridor for invading or threatening invasion of the North. while the Union forces realized the importance of denying the valleys use to the Confederacy. One of the most brilliant and most studied military campaigns in history was Stonewall Jacksons Valley Campaign of 1862. During this campaign. Jacksons army of 17.000 men defeated 3 Northern armies with a combined strength of 33.000 in a single month. winning 5 battles: McDowell. Front Royal. Winchester. Cross Keys. and Port Republic. Most importantly. Jacksons valley campaign created a strategic diversion to draw strength from the Federals advance on Richmond. It was Robert E. Lee who unleashed Jackson in the valley. Lee realized the importance of creating a diversion in the valley to keep Union troops from moving toward Richmond. Jacksons performance during the 1862 valley campaign had transformed this southern. VMI professor into a military legend. As James McPherson recounts in Battle Cry of Freedom: Jacksons victories in the Valley created an aura of invincibility around him and his foot cavalry. They furthered the southern tradition of victory in the Virginia theater that had begun at Manassas * * * Stonewall became larger than life in the eyes of many northerners. he had gotten the drop on them psychologically. and kept it until his death a year later. Confederate advances preceding August 1864including Jubal Earlys victories at the Battle of Cool Springs and the Second Battle of Kernstownled Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to instruct Gen. Philip H. Sheridan to put an end to the Confedqrate threat to the lower Shenandoah Valley. In October 1864. Sheridan introduced the concept of total warfare to the Shenandoah Valleylater to be referred to as The Burning or Red October. In Sheridans own words he described his actions in the fall of 1864 in this way: I have destroyed over 2.000 barns. filled with wheat. hay. and farming Implements. over 70 mills. filled with flour and wheat * * * When this is completed. the Valley from Winchester up to Staunton. ninetytwo miles. will have but little in it for man or beast. Even with the incredible devastation wrought by Sheridan during the Battle of the Opequon. the Battle of Fishers Hill. and the Battle of Toms Brook. the Confederates refused to surrender the valley. even successfully pulling off a surprise attack on Union forces at Cedar Creek. However. Sheridan counterattacked. and as James McPherson states in Battle Cry: Within a few hours Sheridan had converted the battle of Cedar Creek from a humiliating defeat into one of the more decisive Union victories of the war. With the Confederate threat in the Valley eliminated. Sheridan moved on to Petersburg to participate in the final campaign of the Civil War in Virginia. The events which occurred in the Shenandoah Valley during the Civil War deserve a permanent place in history. just as Manassas. Gettysburg. and Antietam. As stated in the National Park Services 1991 draft study of the civil war sites in the valley: Few regions in the United States have experienced the horrors of systematic destruction. and the memories are still close to the surface for many longtime valley residents. Family histories are filled with stories that relate to the hardships of that time. It took a generation to repair the savages of The Burning and another generation before life in the Valley returned to its prewar condition. There can be found there today a fierce pride in ancestors who survived the war and who struggled to rebuild all that was lost. The history of the Civil War in the Shenandoah Valley bears witness to the devastation and waste of warfare. but more importantly. it underscores the irrepressible human will to survive. to rebuild. to carry on. The historic events and the human players of the Valleyheroic and the tragic alikehave contributed significantly to the texture of our American cultural heritage. Mr. President. I am confident that these battlefields will make a very positive contribution to the Park Services preservation of this tragic chapter in our American history. These lands are important to our understanding of the events that occurred from 1862 to 1864 when the momentum and tide of the Confederacys struggle turned and the Union forces began to take hold."},{"1":"1993","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. today Senator BAUCUS and I are introducing a bill to improve the existing Federal Wetlands Regulatory Program. section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Our bill. the Wetlands Conservation and Regulatory Improvements Act. will enhance the effectiveness. fairness. and flexibility of Federal wetlands protectionwithout jeopardizing our remaining wetlands resources. The bill makes it easier for farmers to comply with Federal wetlands regulations and provides for a stronger partnership for wetlands conservation between Federal agencies and the States. The Clean Water Acts Wetlands Protection Program has two major problems. First. it is one of the most controversial environmental programs in existence and it is under serious attack in Congress. Second. it is not as effective as it needs to be in protecting wetlands. This bill is an attempt to solve both of these problemsto address legitimate complaints and to improve the effectiveness of the program. Several months ago. during the debate on Senator BONDs wetlands amendment to the EPA cabinet bill. Senator BAUCUS and I pledged to carefully examine the Federal Wetlands Regulatory Program and work to address the concerns that have been expressed by a number of Senators regarding section 404. I believe the introduction of this bill goes a long way toward fulfilling our charge. The bill is the result of consultations with groups and individuals representing numerous interests affected by wetlands protectionincluding developers. farmers. State agencies. and environmentalists. Our staffs have met with the staffs of Just about every Senator who has expressed dissatisfaction with the current program. We also worked closely with the administrationwhich has recently established an Interagency Working Group on Federal Wetlands Policy at the request of Senator BREAUX and other Senators to examine wetlands issues. We found that many concerns could be addressed without weakening our commitment to maintain and restore wetlands. Frankly. Mr. President. this bill does not go as far as I would like in strengthening the 404 wetlands program. I continue to believe we are losing too many wetlandsan astounding 200.000 acres per yearand it would be wise to significantly strengthen wetlands protection efforts. I recognize. however. that neither wetlands nor the public derive any benefit from the controversy that has plagued our wetlands protection efforts in recent years. By introducing more flexibility and responsiveness into the wetlands regulation program and by emphasizing wetlands and watershed planning. the enactment of this legislation would increase both the level of acceptance and the effectiveness of the section 404 regulatory program. Before discussing the specific provisions of the bill. I would like to review the functions and values of wetlands to explain why it is important to protect them in the first place. Unfortunately. the people of the Midwest suffering from the devastating effects of the summer floods may have learned too late about one important function that wetlands performflood storage. When left in their natural state. wetlands along rivers and streams act as buffers that can catch and hold flood waters. Once the wetlands are destroyed. however. there is nothing to hold the floods back and the water pours out into croplands and developed areas such as our towns and cities. It is important to note that three of the States that have been the most severely affected by the floods had already seen significant losses of their historical wetlands areas: Illinois had lost 8.5 percent of their wetlands prior to the flood. Missouri 87 percent. and Iowa 90 percent. Experts believe the loss of wetlands and their flood storage capacity has exacerbated flood damage in the area. Wetlands are also one of the most biologically productive ecosystems on Earth. They are home to migratory waterfowl and many other species of birds. Approximately twothirds of the major U.S. commercial fishes depend upon wetlands for nursery or spawning grounds. Over onethird of our endangered and threatened species depend upon wetlands at some stage in their life cycle. Wetlands improve water quality and help reduce nonpoint source pollution by collecting and filtering sediments and pollutants--before they reach streams. rivers. and estuaries. Wetlands also act as recharge sites for groundwater systems. In short. wetlands are an essential part of the hydrologic cycle. and thus. critical to achieving the goal of the Clean Water Act: to restore and maintain the chemical. physical. and biological integrity of our Nations waters. Despite the valuable functions wetlands perform. attempts to protect wetlands have been controversialprimarily because most wetlands are found on private lands. In addition. while section 404 of the Clean Water Act regulates wetlands generally. the swampbuster provision of the Food Security Act prohibits farmers who convert wetlands from receiving agricultural subsidy payments. The existence of two different laws affecting agricultural wetlands has led to confusion and misunderstandings about what farmers need to do to comply with Federal law. Our bill will greatly simplify the process for farmers. First. it exempts prior converted croplandswhich are exempt under swampbusterfrom section 404. This is consistent with current U.S. Army Corps regulatory policya policy that has been in effect since September 26. 1990. our bill would simply recognize that policy as part of the law. Second. it exempts wetlands established by human actions in uplands. such as stock ponds and wet areas created by irrigation. Third. it provides for issuance of regulations that generally authorize. through a general permit. under section 404 any activity found by the Soil Conservation Service [SCS] to be exempt under the mitigation and minimal effect provisions of the Food Security Act. Finally. it requires EPA. the Corps. and SCS to develop consistent policies regarding wetlands determinations on agricultural lands under the Food Security Act and the Clean Water Act. These provisions will reduce confusion and lead to better. more consistent wetlands determinations. The bill also contains a number of provisions to improve administration of the 404 regulatory programto help landowners receive quick. consistent decisions and to improve our efforts to protect the wetlands. It requires. in most cases. that permits be issued in less than 90 daysor 60 days for wetlands that are located within an area covered by an approved wetlands and watershed management plan. It establishes an administrative appeals process. and provides wetlands delineation assistance for small landowners seeking a section 404 permit. These provisions will reduce unnecessary delay in the permitting process and provide assistance to small landowners attempting to comply with section 404. The bill also authorizes. with appropriate safeguards. the use of mitigation banks. I realize that mitigation banking has been opposed by many environmentalists as weakening wetlands protection. Nevertheless. the fact is that these banks are allowedand many existunder current law even though there is no legislative language specifically authorizing them. Under current law. mitigation banking is an ongoing practice and there are no apparent limits governing their use. Our bill would authorize them and place appropriate restrictions on their use to improve the operation of the mitigation banks while protecting wetlands values. The participation and cooperation of States is vital if we are to achieve our goal of protecting and restoring the Nations wetlands. The bill increases opportunities for State involvement in the section 404 program without requiring a State to assume the entire program. It authorizes. under appropriate conditions. State program general permits. Local areas with an approved wetlands plan would also be eligible for local program general permits. State and local program general permits already exist under current lawbut are illdefined and are not governed by any legislative requirements or safeguards. These new provisions will change that. They increase State flexibility and accelerate decisions. without sacrificing valuable wetlands. The bill also authorizes and provides funding for State and local wetlands and watershed planning. Adoption of a plan under this provision would not allow States or localities to weaken protections for wetlands. What wetlands plans can do is reduce the uncertainty and cost of protecting wetlands by allowing States to plan ahead and evaluate wetlands in the context of the overall watershed. In this way. States and local governments can work with Federal agencies to protect their vital resources and still allow for economically and environmentally sustainable development. One especially controversial issue regarding wetlandsthe definition and the delineation of wetlandshas substantially subsided since both the Corls and the EPA formally adopted the 1987 Corps delineation manual. Our bill adopts the current section 404 regulatory definition of wetlands and mandates continued use of the 1987 wetlands manual until a new manual is adopted. Any new manual is required to be developed after public notice and comment. and after considering the recommendations of the National Academy of Science [NAS]. The NAS is expected to complete their study regarding the definition and delineation of wetlands some time next year. There is little to be gained by changing the current definition or delineation method until the results of the NAS study are ..nown. Any change would only cause confusion and uncertainty for landowners and the States. Finally. the bill seeks to improveto strengthenFederal efforts to enhance and restore wetlands. It makes the protection and restoration of wetlands one of the explicit goals of the Clean Water Act. The bill expands the list of activities harmful to wetlands which are subject to regulation under section 404. For the first time draining and excavation will be covered by 404. It also calls on Federal agencies and the States to establish a National Wetlands Restoration Strategy. We need to continue our efforts to protect and restore wetlands if we hope to meet the goals of the Clean Water Act. The Wetlands Conservation and Regulatory Improvements Act is an attempt to address the complaints we have heard about the section 404 regulatory program. without jeopardizing our remaining wetlands resource base. and I urge my colleagues to support it.* By Mr. BIDEN (for himself.

These people sacrificed a great deal to maintain the U.S. nuclear deterrent throughout the cold war. and are now facing a very uncertain future. They deserve our support and assistance. In Washington State. we are fortunate to some extent. as the Hanford community has already survived some of the most difficult portions of the transition from production to cleanup. The relationship between the Department of Energy and Hanford workers has been relatively good for the past several years. and our environmental restoration program is beginning to pick up momentum. There are. however. still problems that need to be addressed. One of the most worrisome issues at Hanford has been DOEs announcement that it will Install on environmental restoration and management co.tractor. or ERMC. at the Hanford site. This announcement has caused a great deal of anxiety amongst Hanford workers. who understandably are concerned that their wages. benefits. seniority. and working conditions may not be maintained in the transition from the current management and operations contractor to the ERMC. For this and other reasons I have asked the Secretary to delay the Hanford ERMC. and to include strong worker protection provisions when. and if. the Department does install an ERMC at the site. My efforts. however. involve only one site. The legislation I am cosponsoring today will guarantee continuity of service for workers at all sites that will host an ERMC. and will obviate the need for a great deal of unnecessary wrangling between DOE and current management and operations contractor employees. The bill will also establish much needed health monitoring and health insurance services for certain DOE workers. and provide for better transition planning at all DOE sites. I am pleased to join Senators WIRTH and GLENN in cosponsoring this legislation. and urge the Senate to act swiftly on the bill.*"},{"1":"1991","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Speaker.

They never let us forget what happened there. They never once turned their backs on their buddies. Mr. Speaker. as we once again see the cream of our American youth stand courageously and vigilantly for the cause of international freedom. it is appropriate that today. through this legislation. we recognize once again the sacrifices of our veterans of Vietnam. This legislation is a testimony to their perseverance and their compassion. Mr. Speaker. I urge Members to support this long overdue measure."},{"1":"1990","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Madam Chairman. I would certainly like to begin my remarks by congratulating the chairman of our committee for his leadership and foresight in bringing this to the floor. and of course we all recognize that this is one of his final acts as the chairman and we are going to miss him desperately in the next Congress. I am also happy to stand here today as one of those who worked with our ranking Republican member. the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. GooDLING] back in 1982 to develop the original bill. which I think everyone has recognized today has been a successful bill with a successful record. I am encouraged to see that the majority of the JTPA funds will be expended through training programs administered by businesses -employing trainees that are referred by JTPA. This is part of the act which I refer to as onthejob training and for which I fought so hard back in 1982 that it be included in the originally passed bill. Onthejobtraining programs encourage employers to take a chance in hiring the economically disadvantaged. and open doors that otherwise would be closed. The success of this onthejobtraining program is evident in the fact that 83 percent of participants are placed in employment after their training period ends. Experience like this and success like this has shown that onthejobtraining programs can and should continue to be the most valuable aspect of JTPA. With increased oversight and assurances that training assistance and employer participation does not become merely a form of welfare wage subsidy payments. onthejob and apprenticeship training can be one of the best ways to get the economically disadvantaged back in the job market as productive and taxpaying citizens. Because many businesses in the country are experiencing labor shortages. especially in some of the categories of jobs demanding higher skills. it is more important than ever that these amendments begin to shift the focus of JTPA toward training and educating in some of the most intensive remedial education and job skills training. One example of how these amendments will emphasize education and job skills is the establishment of the Youth Opportunities Unlimited Program. otherwise known as the YOU Program. Secretary Dole should be commended at this point in the discussion. Madam Chairman. because she was the prime advocate for this program and it promises to deliver comprehensive services to youth in high provery communities. not only by providing job training. but by requiring basic education for those without a high school diploma. The YOU initiative will build upon demonstration programs. which successfully have turned around the lives of youth most at risk of failure and of becoming a welfare dependent. These matching grants provided by this YOU initiative will act as seed money to local communities to increase access to training for those most in need of services. Mrs. Dole again should be congratulated for her leadership and her acknowledgment of the economic and social wellbeing of this Nation is dependent upon developing every youth to their fullest potential."},{"1":"1989","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. I rise today as a cosponsor of S. 27. the Onondaga Lake Restoration Act. Onondaga Lake is a 4.5squaremile lake located in Syracuse. It has been claimed that the lake is the most polluted inland body of water in the United States. It got that way after decades of abuse as untreated sewage was discharged on a regular basis into the lake. Pollution in the lake is so bad that fish containing mercury have been declared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be unfit for human consumption. It is time to restore Onondaga Lake to its former beauty. It is almost hard to believe that at the turn of the century the lakes shoreline was sprinkled with all the traps of a tourist spot: hotels. amusement parks. beaches. and restaurants. While there have been improvements to water quality by upgrading some of the waste treatment facilities and by the closure of the Allied Chemical plant. there is much to be done. The city of Syracuse is embarking on an ambitious project which will revitalize the waterfront area of the city. A mammoth shopping mall is currently under construction on the banks of the lake. Federal funding is desperately needed to help in efforts to clean the lake. S. 27 not only authorizes these funds. it also establishes a lake management conference to be comprised of representatives of the U.S. EPA. the Army Corps of Engineers. the State of New York. Onondaga County. the city of Syracuse. a citizens advisory committee and a technical advisory committee. This lake management committee will be responsible for recommending a course of action to clean the lake and will also identify other sources of funding. The restoration of Onondaga Lake will surely be a centerpiece in the efforts to rectify the decades of abuse suffered by hundreds of other lakes across the country. Cleaning the environment should be a major priority as we enter the 1990s. I urge my colleagues to act on this legislation.*"},{"1":"1988","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. it is really disturbing news to learn that this morning Cardinal Obando y Bravo was dismissed. the chief negotiator of the peace process. and that the Ministry of Justice has been abolished. I honestly would not be surprised if La Prensa. Mrs. Chamarros newspaper. is not next on that list. Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition today to the Democratic alternative because. in my opinion. it severely weakens the package of aid to the Nicaraguan democratic resistance which has been brought to the floor today. There are a number of flaws in the Democratic amendment. and my colleagues have addressed these in detail. The bill will not provide the aid that is necessary to keep the Contras as a viable force. and therefore will not aid the peace process as needed. One of the areas where the bill is unlikely to function is its intention to provide aid to the Nicaraguan children who have been injured by the civil war. I am in agreement with the intentions. and they are good intentions. and we should focus assistance on these innocent victims. However. the bill specified that the $7 million in aid which is designated for Nicaraguan children should be a cash payment to internal Nicaraguan organizations which have somewhat credible names but have been ineffective in the past. For instance. none of these organizations. and some of them have had the opportunity. have been allowed to visit the thousands of political prisoners imprisoned in 13 prisons in Nicaragua. 12 of them built in the last 8 years. Make no mistake about it. my friends. we are dealing with a Communist government in Nicaragua. This was a lesson soon learned by my own constituent. President Carter and his administration. which grew disenchanted with the Sandinistas after sending them $120 million in aid to encourage them toward democracy and humanitarian causes. I want to remind my colleagues that the Sandinista government has an inner circle of more than 60 members who received for the most part their education and training in Cuba. in East Germany. Libya. and the Soviet Union. On February 3. I inserted these names in the RECORD and their backgrounds for all to see. Every one of these people. including Daniel Ortega. have sworn to the Sandinista creed. and they subscribe to its philosophy. Let me just quote it. I believe in the doctrines and struggles of Marx. Engles. Lenin. and Che Guevarathe great teachers. and guides of the working class which is the productive force and true driving force of the class struggle. I believe in the building of the MarxistLeninist Socialist society. That is the creed which the Government subscribes to. My colleagues. if we are indeed serious today about voting aid to the Contra forces. then we should pass the very strongest legislation possible. legislation which will keep the pressure on for the next 5 months and encourage the implementation of the ongoing peace process. The strongest and most effective vote is the Michel amendment. The Democratic alternative is a weak initiative. in my opinion. and will simply encourage the Sandinista government to milk the process for all that it is worth. Mr. Chairman. we know there are lobbying organizations for the Sandinistas in Washington. DC. and we know the Sandinistas pay a public relations firm $20.000 per month to lobby for their country in New York City. Simply put. a lot of misinformation is getting out into print which people take as gospel. and they are well intended when they are opposed to this particular aid. But. Mr. Chairman. the Catholic Church. the labor unions. the internal opposition. the La Prensa newspaper. the mothers of political prisoners know the truth. and those people say that they want the very strongest legislation possible."},{"1":"1987","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I take the time this evening to reflect on the debate that took place earlier today on the budget resolution. What I have in my hand is a pamphlet that is put out by the National Taxpayers Union. and it rates the voting of each individual Member in the House according to how they vote on various spending bills. I mention the National Taxpayers Union because it is not a partisan report. it is not a partisan organization. and as a matter of fact there was input to these scores. input from Members of the House on both parties. Again. what I am trying to lay out here is that I think that the National Taxpayers Union is close to a fair analysis of both Democrats and Republicans when it comes to spending. and when I say spending. I do not mean just spending on the domestic side. I am also referring to spending on the defense side. The reason that I am motivated to take a couple of moments to speak about this is because during the debate and for the last several months the attempt has been made by the Democratic Party to implyit has been much stronger than thatthey claim that the reason for the deficits that the country is experiencing comes because of the Presidents failure to become involved in the debate. I would say. and I think that most Americans understand. that there is not a dollar spent that is not appropriated by this House. that is not voted on in this House. While the debate was going on. I took note of each individual Member who came down to the floor of the House to discuss the budget resolution. I have listed each of the Members of the Democratic Party who came down and talked about the budget resolution. Again. what they tried to do was to shift the blame from themselves to the President. Again. not one dollar is spent in this country unless it is appropriated by this House. Without naming the individualsand let me just stop at this point and say that what you ought to do if you are concernedand I guess that is another pointif your concern is that we are spending too much money or that we have raised too many tax dollars on the American worker. if that is your concern. then I would say that you want to look at the National Taxpayers Union guide that rates the Congress. If you feel that more spending is needed. if you feel that all of the different programs in the $1 trillion budget that we now have are programs that should not be touched. then you do not want to look at this. because in essence what you are saying is that you are willing to have the taxes. whether it is in your business or whether on you individually. you are willing to have those taxes increase. That is fine. Then you are not really interested in this discussion. Now let me get to the point. There were 13 different Members of the Democratic Party who came down and said that we ought to pass the budget resolution that is going to increase taxes. increase social spending. and reduce defense to some degree. All 13 of those spoke in favor of this higher spending program and the higher tax program. and a portion of them said that the deficit that we have is because the President of the United States would not control spending. It is up to the Congress to control spending. I have one other thing: What is a good score. and what is a bad score? According to the congressional spending scores as outlined by the National Taxpayers Union. if you had a 28 percent or 28 or below. then you were considered by the National Taxpayers Union as being a big spenderthat is. if you had a 28 or below. I am just going to read down the numbers of the speakers that came out here on the Democratic side: 26 was the first score. 25 was the second score. 27 was the third score. 21 was the fourth score. 21 was the fifth score. 28 was the sixth score. and on. 47. 27. 24. 31. 32. 35. 24. an average of It is no wonder that those Members would come to the floor of the House and try to shift the blame to the President of the United States when they in fact failed."},{"1":"1986","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. this is commonly referred to as the Columbia River Gorge bill which will seek to create a national scenic area for this very unique part of our country. Mr. President. S. 2055. is the culmination of over 6 years of legislative work. Fashioned by my colleagues. Senators EVANS. PACKWOOD. GORTON. and myself. it is the product of countless hours of discussion. debate. and argument. andultimatelyconsensus. This bill is a landmark example of consensus politics at its best. For over 50 years. the Columbia River Gorge has been a central focus in the lives of Oregonians and Washingtonians. It is the location of some of the most wondrous scenic vistas in North America as well as the home of over 44.000 people. The hundreds of millions of dollars worth of commercial activity which occurs there has contributed to the areas attractive livability. Unfortunately. the Columbia Gorge also is in the bullseye for some who would develop it in a way that would destroy forever the very qualities which make the gorge a supremely special place in a land blessed with abundant. but everthreatened natural wonders. The Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act is designed to establish a partnership between the Federal Government. the States of Oregon and Washington. and the nearly 50 units of local government within the Columbia Gorge for the purpose of protecting and enhancing this beautiful part of our two States. This partnership will provide a workable management framework for the gorge among Clark. Skamania. and Klickitat Counties in Washington. Multnomah. Hood River. and Wasco Counties in Oregon. a reformed and strengthened Columbia Gorge Commission. and the Forest Service. I want to address at the outset. Mr. President. a fundamental premise of this bill: The Federal Government will not be forcing Columbia Gorge residents from their homes and businesses. Powers of condemnation by the Federal Government have been restricted specifically. There will be no acquisition in the gorge by the Federal Government of lands which are used for educational. religious. or charitable purposes. or of singlefamily residences. farms. or grazing areas so long as the existing use of that land is not changed substantially. This language is clear. the principle is clear. and I want to underscore it at this point in the record. Perhaps at this time. Mr. President. it would be appropriate for me to summarize the major elements of the legislation. The Columbia Gorge will be managed as a single geographical unit. and this management scheme will reflect the areas economic. environmental. social. geologic. cultural. and recreational diversity. Under this arrangement. three distinct management classifications will be established. There will be four special managment areas (SMAs). containing lands of exceptional scenic. cultural. natural. and recreational values suitable for special Federal supervision. A second classification will contain lands outside the special management areas which are of outstanding scenic and natural beauty. but which balances the needs of the local inhabitants and economies with environmental protection. Finally. there are 13 designated urban areas which are comprised of currently incorporated cities and other areas. and are so developed as to make regulation under the act unnecessary. In Oregon. these urban areas generally were established by following the urban growth boundaries established under the States land use planning laws. Under the National Scenic Area Act. a cooperative management plan will be developed that will include an inventory of resources. land use designations. guidelines for the adoption of implementing ordinances. and a recreation development plan. Land use designations and provisions will be included for agricultural and forest land. open space. scenic and historic areas. and commercial and residential uses. In keeping with our goal of balancing protection of the gorges values with the need to continue appropriate development. industrial development will be restricted to designated urban areas. Major development actions such as subdivisions. short plats. multifamily residences. and commercial facilities will not be allowed in the SMAs. The gorge bill also recognizes and protects the significant qualities of the tributary rivers and streams within the national scenic area. Hydroelectric development projects on tributary rivers or streams in the national scenic area are allowed only if the projects do not adversely affect scenic and recreational resources. S. 2055 designates the lower segment of the White Salmon River as a scenic river and the lower portion of the Klickitat River as a recreation river under the Wild and Scenic River Act. Furthermore. it sets aside for study the upper portion of the White Salmon River to its confluence with Trout Lake Creek and the upper portion of the Klickitat River to the boundary of the Yakima Indian Reservation. In Oregon. the bill prohibits hydroelectric development on State designated wild. scenic. or recreation rivers or river segments that flow through the national scenic area. This will directly affect segments of both the Deschutes and Sandy Rivers which are included in the Oregon Scenic Waterway System. This legislation does not. as some have asserted. require the termination of existing hydroelectric service provided by facilities on the Hood River. although construction of any new impoundments on the segment of the Hood River within the scenic area will be prohibited for a period of 20 years. While I am on the subject of hydroelectric facilities. I want to note that the bills savings provisions specify that the Bonneville Power Administrations ability to operate. maintain. or modify existing transmission facilities will not be altered. provided that such activities do not create visual or otherwise adverse environmental impacts. We do not want to impair the BPAs work in terms of replacing or adding substation equipment. power system controls. system protection. and communications systems. It also is important to provide the BPA with the opportunity to make minor transmission tower modifications. replacements. or additions. so long as such actions do not create significant visual or otherwise adverse problems. I am delighted that the agency has expressed to me its willingness to work with the Forest Service and the new Gorge Commission in applying stateoftheart technology in order to make the BPAs upgraded facilities compatible with the scenic area and the purposes of the act. At this point. Mr. President. I would like to address another issue that has stirred some interest in my home State of Oregon. As my colleagues are aware. the timber industry plays a critical role in our economy. not only in Oregon. but throughout the Pacific Northwest. Over onethird of all Oregonians are employed in primary or secondary jobs by the forest products industry. The question has arisen whether S. 2055 will eliminate hundreds of jobs in Oregon and Washington by reducing the amount of timber harvested in the Columbia Gorge. The answer to that is: No. it will not. As I have said earlier. this bill reflects a careful effort to balance the environmental needs of the gorge with its economic needs. The Secretary is directed to employ multipleuse management techniques in the SMAs in a way that will allow continued timber harvesting which is consistent with the scenic. natural. recreation. and other values being protected. Further. in scenic area lands outside the SMAs. our bill makes clear that the Gorge Commission is to prepare a resource inventory based upon existing land uses and to develop a management plan which provides for the preservation and enhancement of existing forest land uses. The savings provisions clearly state that timber harvest practices in the scenic area will continue to be governed by the Oregon and Washington Forest Practices Acts. or applicable county regulations. and will not be the subject of potential Federal regulations by the Gorge Commission. This provision was specifically included to avoid the imposition of an additional overlay of regulation on timber management practices within the scenic area. S. 2055 does not do all that some would like it to do. and it does more than others would prefer. But. I have said before and I will say again. I regard this legislation as being one of the premier pieces of consensus legislation in the area of natural resource law. It provides the strong protection that this nationally significant area needs to maintain its existing character. it fully and formally recognizes and protects the rights and privileges of the thousands of people who live and work there. and. finally. it establishes a workable partnership between the Federal Government and State and local jurisdictions in order to manage the Columbia Gorge in the best way possible. We want the people of this great Nation to be able to appreciate the breathtaking sunsets seen from Crown Point. to be able to relax at destination resorts in the gorge that may be built. to experience. first hand. the thrill and excitement of sailboating and windsurfing at Hood River or The Dalles. and to provide access for the young. the physically disadvantaged. and the elderly to places previously reached only by the most hardy individuals. Mr. President. I also want to thank the many individuals and groups who contributed to the process which created this bill. from the environmental organizations. the public bodies such as the county courts and commissions. my friends from the Oregon and Washington congressional delegationsRepresentatives AuCoIN. WEAVER. BONKER. and MORRISONthe two Governors. my good friends. Governors Atiyeh and Gardner. and their staffs. and to the other interested groups and individuals who contributed so mightly to this process. Last but not least. I also want to thank my colleagues Senators PACKWOOD. EVANS. and GORTON for their willingness to work together on this difficult issue these past several months. This legislation may mark the beginning of a new concept in natural resource protection. In essence. S. 2055 represents a forging ahead into new and largely uncharted territory in terms of the parameters it provides for the protection of environmentally sensitive areas. The Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area Act of 1986 is a bold and innovative vehicle which recognizes that a median position between little or no Federal protection for a scenically important area on the one hand. and wilderness or national park designation on the other. is both prudent and necessary in this age. Just because a beautiful area such as the Columbia River Gorge is inhabited and its residents are involved in economic pursuits should not automatically exclude it from being considered worthy of strong resource protection. As economic and developmental pressures continue to threaten our important natural areas from coast to coast. it no doubt will become necessary for the Congress to devise and implement new methods of providing strong and effective safeguards which will accommodate the many competing forces which are inherent. Our democratic system allows us to be flexible and respond in an effective way to our changing world. A day hardly goes by in this body where new ground is not broken. and today is no exception to that rule. True progress is made only when we push our ideas and thoughts into new dimensions. and this legislation represents one such example of that creative process. Finally. Mr. President. I want to mention that I fully support the content of the section by section analysis of this bill which was prepared by Senators GORTON and EVANS and will appear in todays RECORD following the printing text of the legislation. This analysis clearly and accurately explains the legislative intent of S."},{"1":"1985","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. the U.S. State Department annually congratulates the Soviet Government and its captive peoples on the anniversary of the Communist seizure of power in Russia on November 7. 1917. This Revolution Day congratulation is made over the Presidents signature. and on behalf of the American people. But because the captive Soviet peoples have little to celebrate. it is totally inappropriate for the State Department to congratulate them or to help celebrate the Bolshevik Revolution. The Soviet Government has never submitted its rule to the consent of the governed in free election. Since 1917. it has relied on secret police terror and forced labor Gulag camps to stay in power. It has killed millions of its subjects. A 1971 Senate Judiciary Committee Report entitled The Human Cost of Soviet Communism. by the respected British historian Robert Conquest estimated a death toll of nearly 35 million human lives as a minimum estimate and 45 million. as a more probable estimate. Solzhenitsyn has estimated a total of 66 million murdered by the Soviet Communists since 1917. Today. nothing has changed. The Kremlin conducts a genocidal war in Afghanistan. it behaves as an international outlaw by attempting to assassinate the Pope and by shooting down KAL007. Why should the State Department consider the anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution a matter for congratulation or celebration? How do the captive peoples of the U.S.S.R. react to the State Departments annual message of congratulation? Vladimir Bukovsky believes these cheers from the State Department are comparable to sending Jews congratulations on the anniversary of the founding of Hitlers Third Reich. Such congratulations are perceived as a cruel mockery by those peoples who resist. suffer. and perish at the hands of the barbarous Soviet totalitarian regime. Mr. President. this amendment requires the State Department to stop congratulating the enslaved peoples of the Soviet Union on the anniversary of their bondage. The amendment instead requires a message to the Soviet peoples expressing the hopes of the American people for their eventual freedom. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. The amendment has been discussed with the managers on both sides of the aisle. I know of no objection to the amendment."},{"1":"1984","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentlelady from Colorado for provid. ing the opportunity for us to set the record straight on the real Reagan. record on womens Issues. The President has tried to claim credit for the recently enacted Retirement Equity Act. He pretends to be the champion of pension equity for women and the leader of the fight to achieve equity. Even the most superficial reading of the record demonstrates the total falsehood of that claim. The Retirement Equity Act was first introduced on February 6. 1981. by our colleague from New York. GoaALwmw FmRAo. the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee. That bill was H.R. 1641. The President didnt put forth any legislative proposals until September 29. 1983. His bill was introduced by Congressman JoHN EnwsoaN as H.R. Not only was the President not the first to propose pension reform. he was not even the first Republican to recognize the need for legislation. Senator Do. the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. introduced S. 19 some 8 months earlier on January 20. Was the administrations bill worth waiting for? Did it provide even greater equity for women than either the Ferraro or Dole bills? Did the adminis. tration put the full weight of its efforts toward moving the bill as quickly as possible? The answer to each of those questions is a resounding No. As far as the bill itself went. it had little new to offer. The administration embraced most of the proposals in the Ferraro bill and a few of the handful of new proposals in the Dole bill which did not appear in the original Ferraro bill. So much for Presidential leadership on womens pension issues. More important than the provisions it embraced. however. are the provisions it omitted. For instance. the Presidents bill did not contain any provision which addressed the most serious question of pension equity affecting widows. Under the law which existed before the passage of the Retirement Equity Act. if a worker died before the earliest retirement age under the pension plan. his widow got nothing. Even though he may have worked for 30 years. she wouldnt get a cent. What did the President propose to do about this shocking inequity? Nothing. Thats right. Nothing. In marked contrast. the Ferraro bill provided that if the worker had 10 years of service when he died. the widow would be entitled to a benefit. Not only did the Presidents pension equity bill fail to address this problem. the public record is clear that the failure to help widows in this situation was no oversight. In public testimony before my subcommittee. the Subcommittee on LaborManagement Relations of the Committee on Education and Labor. on September 29. 1983the day the administration bill was introducedacting Assistant Secretary of Labor for Policy. Daniel K. Benjamin. said: As indicated in the administrations August 2 testimony before the Senate Committee on Finance. we do not support the proposed provisions requiring survivor coverage for the spouses of all participants with 10 years of service. What was the administrations rationale for letting this serious problem go unaddressed? Basically cost. The administration was concerned that if companies were required to provided pensions to survivors. they would cut out life insurance. The problem with the administration position is twofold: .irst the bill continued the authorization under current law which permitted employers to pass on the cost of providing the additional survivor protection in the form of an actuarial reduced benefit. Therefore the total cost to employers could be zero. unless the employer voluntarily decided to absorb the cost. Second. the administration assumed that life insurance is an adequate substitute for a lifetime pension. Ask the widow whose life in. surance proceeds have been exhausted by the funeral bills before the flowers at the cemetery are even dead whether she agrees with the Presidents position. Even the Republicancontrolled Senate adopted a provision addressing this problem: The socalled 10 and 45 ruleif a worker died with 10 years of service and was at least 45 years old. his survivor would be entitled to a benefit. Notwithstanding the administrations strenuous objections. the Congress ultimately adopted a provision in the Retirement Equity Act which provided that if a worker was vestedthat is. had a nonforfeltable right to receive benefits even if he were to leave employmentwhen he died. his widow would get a benefit. So dont be deceived. The next time you hear the President himself. or an administration official. tell you how much the administration has done to help widows. you will know the real answer: Nothing. In fact. If the administration view had prevailed. the Re. tirement Equity Act would also have failed to address this major inequity. Fortunately Congress showed the leadership on this issue that the Presi. dent lacked. As far as whether the administration put the full weight of its efforts behind getting the bill passed. the answer again is No. As a matter of fact. aside from a couple of routine telephone calls from the congressional liaison people in the Labor Department to my staff inquiring as to what we were doing. we never heard a peep from the administration. On other matters of importance to the administration before my subcommittee. I have received calls. letters. or visits from high administration officials. But on the retirement equity legisla. tion. I heard nary a word. Does this sound like something the administration cared about deeply? Or even cared about mildly? No way. When It comes to pension equity for women. the President was like a late passenger running to catch a train. He huffed and he puffed until he caught up to the last car. pulled himself up on the caboose as the train barreled down the tracks. then ran up the aisles of the train toward the engine. When the train finally pulled into the station. he Jumped off and tried to convince the passengers that he had been running the train all the time. The passengers on that train will not be fooled and neither are we. Mr. President. You were no leader on pension equity. You were constantly trying to catch up with the rest of us. And with respect to widows benefits. Mr. President. you tried to derail the train. But we kept it on course. despite your efforts. No matter what the President. the Republican platform. or administration officials say about the role of the President in enacting the Retirement Equity Act. the record is clear. The most courageous act of leadership the President performed with respect to the bill was when he signed it. and even that showed a particular lack of political courage. Considering the importance the President would like us to believe he attaches to the bill. dont you think it is a bit strange that the signing of the bill was not a major media event? The reason why there was no public signing ceremony is perfectly clear. Notwithstanding the Presidents claims of credit. the retirement equity act was originally G mEmnE Psimaos bill. A quick comparison of Public Law 98397 and the 1981 Ferraro bill confirms that. Normally the President includes the original sponsor of the bill in any signing ceremony. Youve all seen the White House photos--a smiling President - signing the bill with a beaming congressional sponsor at his side. If the President had a signing cere. mony and invited OMRAwiuz Fmamo. who happens to be the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee. that would be news. But it would also be an acknowledgment that pension equity leg. islatlon was hardly the Presidents idea. That would never do. That isnt consistent with the Presidents rhetoric. If the President had a signing cere. mony and didnt invite GzwmszN F Rno. that too would be news. But the press would probably report the Presidents failure to include the bills original sponsor. That might give the American public the Idea that achiev. ing pension equity for women was hardly the Presidents Idea. So the President did the politically expedient thing to dosigned the bill quietly and let the White House press releases herald his alleged leadership and initiative. But we know better. So I once again thank my colleague from Colorado. Congresswoman Scumoxmit. for providing this opportunity to set the record straight. The Reagan record on pension equity is not one of strong leadership. It is one best characterized as opportunistically hanging on to the coattails of the Retirement Equity Acts congressional sponsors. I am proud to have played a major part in the enactment of Retire. ment Equity Act and it is about time that .the American public knew the real story of this Presidents commitment to pension equity for women. The Presidents version of the legislative history belongs on televisionas a script for Fanty Island.o"},{"1":"1983","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I am today introducing legislation for the benefit of severely visually impaired. hearing impaired. and vocally impaired persons. to allow them more easily to enter the job market as productive wage earners. My bill would extend medicare coverage to include advanced sensory and communication aids. with the clear provision that the States may cover this technology under their medicaid programs. but would not be required to do so. Mr. President. access to sensory and communication aids would allow disabled persons to perform more effectively in the job market and would significantly increase their opportunity to secure gainful employment. Over the past decade. numerous studies have shown that the use of sensory aids open many new job opportunities for the blind and visually impaired population. This fact should not be surprising when one considers the number of job categories in our labor market dependent upon technology for the storage and display of information. It is estimated that 60 million of the Nations 110 million job stations in the year 1990 will be electronically based. In most of these job stations. the workers will depend upon electronic equipment for the acquisition and manipulation of printed information. The information either will be in the form of computer printouts or CRT displays. The use of specialized sensory aids makes these job situations as accessible to blind and visually impaired individuals as they are to nondisabled persons. Mr. President. it is interesting to note. that during this time of high national unemployment. two of the major job categories with an abundance of openings are those of computer science and word processingtwo fields open to blind and visually impaired individuals when appropriate sensory aids are available. The use of highgain amplification equipment with specially designed FM systems can provide severely hearing impaired individuals with auditory information otherwise unavailable. Such equipment can greatly prolong the competitive employment of many hearing impaired individuals long after the impairment becomes severe. In many situations. these sensory aids can eliminate the need for early retirement of these people. The use of handheld speech synthesizers permit vocally impaired individuals to communicate with others in job situations. Without them. the inability to communicate stands between these people and competitive employment. These are just some examples of devices available to handicapped persons which would allow them to function normally in a work situation. Other equipment. for instance. can produce raised letters from printed words. The primary problem today. however. is the availability of these necessary devices to the potential users. The expense necessary to demonstrate competitiveness is too high. thus. many individuals remain on welfare rather than competing for employment. By underwriting this expense to achieve such employment. we can reduce welfare costs and increase tax revenues to the Government at the same time. Indeed. the anticipated costs of this legislation would be offset substantially by additional revenues and reduced welfare costs. Mr. President. in view of the major cutbacks in disability programs and vocational rehabilitation programs. it is time for Congress to act so that the individual purchase of such equipment can be made feasible for disabled persons. During the 1970s. many blind and visually impaired individuals were able to obtain employment through the assistance of State vocational rehabilitation agencies which purchased for them sensory aids needed in the employment situation. The vast majority of these aids were purchased through funds allocated for the social security beneficiary rehabilitation program and the vocational rehabilitation program. These funds have been reduced severely over the past 2 years with extreme hardship being felt by disabled individuals eligible for these programs. Many State agencies have virtually terminated the procurement and assignment of sensory aids during this period because of the lack of funds. Thus. numerous disabled individuals have not been able to apply for or obtain employment. Mr. President. these persons are talented and capable people who want to work and make their contribution to society. For the sake of our Nations wellbeing and economic prosperity. we must take steps so we may benefit from their significant talents and abilities. I believe my bill. which would make sensory and communication devices more readily available. would have longterm benefits for disabled persons. and for society as a whole. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my bill be printed in the RECORD."},{"1":"1982","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Senator Glenn. Mr. Putnams letter states: The proposed legislationHe is talking about this particular provisionif enacted. would raise serious and perhaps insurmountable obstacles in our path and make it far more difficult for us to reorganize and emerge from chapter 11. If the issues dealt with under the proposed legislation are valid at all. they should properly be dealt with as part of the collective bargaining process and not as a special bill to serve special interests. This legislation. however. would significantly undermine the value of those assets by placing artificial constraints on an airlines ability to dispose of aircraft or to restructure its operation. We believe the public interest would be rnlserved by further hindering the restructuring efforts of a seriously troubled industry. I might add. as to a conversation I had today with Mr. Sam Coats. vice president of Braniff. he said if this legislation was passed. We would probably have to forget about Braniff being able to restructure. being able to sell parts of its rolling stock. and there really would not be protection of their employees but a hindrance of their employees getting back into the marketplace. These pilots would not be able to jump back into those planes and go up in the skies because nobody would be able to buy those planes. Mr. President. in a very short time. this body will be asked to approve the work of a SenateHouse conference committee on H.R. 5930. the war risk insurance extension bill. Unfortunately. the conference committee adopted an amendment to this bill which not only violates the norms of proper legislative procedure but which also set an extremely dangerous precedent for the future. If the Senate chooses to approve the work of the conference committee in this particular instance. I very strongly believe that we will be making a serious error. The amendment that is in question here would codify and make mandatory certain labor protective provisions. known as the AlleghenyMohawk protective provisions. for the commercial airline industry. These provisions had been discretionary and were sometimes used in mergers and acquisitions in the regulated airlines industry by the Civil Aeronautics Board between 1972 and the adoption of airline deregulation legislation in The conference committee amendment would require commercial airlines to pay compensation for furloughed employees at up to 60 percent of salary for 6 months to 5 years. reparation of wage loss if an employee is transferred to a lower paying job. moving allowances. merged senority lists. and binding arbitration. This amendment would require huge payments by commercial airlines to employees who are furloughed as a result of a merger. acquisition or even the sale of assets such as excess planes in their fleet. The Office of Management and Budget recently assessed the impact of these provisions as follows: These provisions are expensive. In severence payments alone. assuming average airline salaries. they could provide $190.000 to pilots. $75.000 to maintenance personnel. $63.000 to ticket takers. and $57.000 to cabin attendants. over a period of 5 years. Similar provisions in effect for the Pan Am/Trans World route swap of 1975. cost Pan Am approximately $4.5 million because 130 employees were severed. These are direct costs. excluding litigation. arbitration. and administration. In addition. the proposed amendment is so broad that it may apply to transactions as minor as sale of aircraft. If so. the cost of severed employees alone. for 747 aircraft. could exceed $6 million over a 5year period. The airlines are currently in poor financial shapeindustry losses for 1981 were $400 million. Braniff has gone bankrupt and several other large airlinesare in serious financial difficulty. Federal imposition of labor protection payments at this time. particularly payments tied to mergers and acquisitions. could prevent airlines from taking sensible steps to restructure themselves in order to compete better in todays market. In short. the Federal Government would be limiting the ability of airlines to compete successfully. Mr. President. I fully agree with these comments which were made by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget in a July 13 letter to Senator PACKWOOD. As Mr. Stockman noted. Braniff has gone bankrupt. The Braniff bankruptcy is of special interest to me because Braniff was a major air carrier in my State of Oklahoma. Mr. Howard D. Putnam. CEO of Braniff. has expressed strong concerns with the labor protective provisions. His statement is already in the record. In addition. the adoption of this amendment would set a very dangerous precedent in the field of labormanagement relations. The issues involved here should be considered not by the Congress but by labor and management in contract negotiations. For us here to intervene at this particular time is both premature and unnecessary. If labor protection provisions are mandated by Congress for airline employees. we will be opening a Pandoras box in which employees in other fieldsthe automobile industry. the oil industry. steel. railroads. electric utilities. the merchant marinewill also be justified in seeking relief from the Congress and not through the negotiating process with management. Such a precedent not only undermines the collective bargaining process but it also grievously threatens the very heart of Americas free enterprise system. Finally. Mr. President. this amendment adopted by the conference committee makes a mockery of the legislative process. The backers of this amendment have chosen to avoid public discussion and debate on this issue by seeking to adopt a rider in conference that has not been considered by the appropriate legislative committees. In the Senate. no hearings have been held on this very farreaching amendment. The Aviation Subcommittee heard only five paragraphs of testimony on this issue a year ago. There have been no other hearings held in either Chamber. To adopt a nongermane amendment. as the conference committee would have this body do. is the very height of foolishness. This amendment should be referred to the appropriate legislative committees so that the necessary groundwork that needs to be done by way of hearings and serious reflection can be accomplished before the entire Senate votes on this issue. Mr. President. what we have here is at its core the mischief of factions. James Madison discussed this entire question in Federalist No. 10. Madison warned that democratic government is seriously threatened and undermined when a minority seeks to obtain and protect its interests at the expense of the national interest. In the amendment we are considering today. a small minority of 33.000 airline pilots are seeking to obtain legislation that will benefit them greatly. I myself very strongly believe that the national interest will be adversely affected if this amendment is approved. Mr. President. I urge the Members of this body to reject this amendment and to stand up and be counted as defenders of the national interest. The time has come for the Members of this body to demonstrate to the Nation that the Senate is a body where the interests of the country as a whole and not the interests of a narrow special interest group are the interests that shape and affect and determine the decisions we make and the votes we cast."},{"1":"1981","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. on August 6. 1981. the New York Times carried an editorial entitled For Bahais in Lian. a �L nreav of Extinction. The author of the editorial is Firuz Kazemzadeh. professor of history and chairman of the committee on Middle Eastern studies at Yale. and also a member of the national governing body of the American Bahai organization. Professor Kazemzadeh warns us that the Bahais in Iran are in danger of extermination. According to himMore than 60 people have been lynched by mobs or executed by revolutionary firing squads. Hundreds have been dismissed from jobs. thousands have lost their homes and possessions. A year ago the entire national governing body of the Bahais of Iran was kidnaped and disappeared. Professor Kazemzadeh points out that the Shiite clergy. as well as the Government in Iran and their representatives abroad. see members of the Bahai faith as dangerous heretics and a political conspiracy serving the interests of foreign powers. Other accusations against the Bahais include. according to Kazemzadeh. the promotion of prostitution. cooperation with Zionism. spying for imperialist powers. corruption on Earth and warring against God. Professor Kazemzadeh further asserts thatThis assault against the approximately 400.000 Bahais is not confined to individuals nor Is it a mere outburst of religious passion. It is a case of wellplanned genocide. The Genocide Treaty. which has been before the Senate for 32 years. declares that whether committed in time of peace or war. genocide is a crime under international law to be prevented and punished. Article II of the treaty defines genocide to be the intent to destroy. in whole or in part. a national. ethnical. racial or religious group. According to Professor Kazemzadeh. numerous atrocities have been committed against Bahais. They include two men being burned alive in Shahmizad. mobs attacking Bahais in Ardistan. houses and stores being burned in Zenjan. and families who refuse to recant their faith being driven out of their villages. Iran is 1 of the 86 countries which has ratified the Genocide Convention. Despite its major role in drafting and rallying support for the treaty in 1943. the United States has shamefully failed to demonstrate its commitment to the prevention and punishment of genocide by ratifying the convention. How are we to judge other countries violations of human rights when we have failed to ratify the first United Nations human rights treaty? The threat of genocide is present today. The need for a genocide treaty does not fade as years go by. Professor Kazemzadehs editorial reminds us that various groups and their existence are now being threatened. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to swiftly ratify the Genocide Convention. I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times editorial to which I have referred be printed at this point in the RECORD."},{"1":"1980","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. this has to be the most sweeping and farreaching proposal of the year. I think Senator HELMS is a delightful man. I agree with him on many things. I think he has done a great job in the Senate this year. I suppose we would call it the Helms Senate in many ways. He has prevailed on many occasions. I am sure in the coming years he will be even more potent as chairman of the Agriculture Committee. and in many other capacities. But. for the life of me. it seems to me if we do this. we might as well close the Department of Labor if they cannot issue regulations. and will have to stop business. I have not heard it proposed for any other department before. There are no hearings. No record. We do not know the position of the Department of Labor. or what regulations they may have. This is very appealing. Frankly. I would like to support something that was discriminating and eliminate about 90 percent of the regulations. But to come on the floor with an amendment to the continuing resolution. and to knock out all regulations to be proposed for almost 2 months. a month and a half. without a hearing or record. without an opportunity to modify regulations. may be very important for the safety and health and protection in some cases of employers. This paralyzes the department. It says that they can do nothing so far as regulations are concerned. So I hope the Senate will be very careful about this regulation. It has a lot of appeal. and many of us would like to support something like this if we could have a hearing on it and have a record and now precisely what we are doing and pinpoint the kind of regulations we would like to prevent. So I have to urge the Senate to resist this and to resist it vigorously."},{"1":"1979","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"I thank the Senator from Connecticut. Mr. President. I represent a steel State. The State of Colorado produces steel. I strongly support the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut. The issue before the Senate is not support for the entire steel industry. It is support for one company. under very special and extraordinary circumstances. This proposal does not have the support of the entire industry. Indeed. the steelproducing company in the State of Colorado strongly opposes it and testified to that effect. It would be one thing if the Congress of the United States or a Government agency intended to support an entire industry. But to assist. in this very direct way. the immediate financial needs of one company is nothing more nor less than a bailout. and it is not even a bailout for an entire industry. it is a bailout for a single company. It is the worst possible form of Government involvement in the marketplace and Government interference. It is. in fact. a form of private socialism. It is to say that if a company cannot manage itself and operate in the marketplace in a competitive manner. the Congress of the United States is going to support a Federal agency which is going to bail out that single company. in discrimination against other companies in that industry. The Colorado Fuel & Steel Co.. of Colorado. has spent $85 million in a plant modernization and overhaul program in the last several years. Essentially. what we are being called upon to do here is to put up public dollars to compete with the private dollars which those farreaching and farsighted steel companies have been able to raise and to manage properly. If we take this step. I think we are taking another step down the road toward more Government involvement in the marketplace on behalf of single companies that happen to get themselves into trouble. The fact is that there is a surplus of steel rail in this country. This loan will help one company provide jobs for 200 or 300 people. at the most. to compete with companies that are producing steel rail to meet the demands of this country. I think it is an absolutely outrageous act by a Government agency and I hope the Senate will oppose it. Mr. President. I support Senator WEICKERS amendment. This amendment would reduce by $13 million the supplemental appropriation for EDAs economic development revolving fund. This is the amount EDA is proposing to use to guarantee loans by the WheelingPittsburgh Steel Corp.. to allow that company to build a new steel rail mill. I support the Weicker amendment because the EDA loan guarantee would subvert a basic principle of fairness. by subsidizing one company at the expense of others in the same industry. The proposal for the EDA loan guarantee is part of the overall Government effort to help the steel industry. on the grounds that the industry is unusually burdened by foreign imports. environmental standards. and other considerations. WheelingPittsburgh has been having serious financial troubles. Under the guise of the administrations general program of assisting the entire steel industry. EDA has proposed using its economic development revolving fund to bail out WheelingPittsburgh. The form of the bailout would be EDAs guarantee of $63.5 million in loans by WheelingPittsburgh. The company would use the loans to build a new rail mill. to produce steel rails. This would be a new product for WheelingPittsburgh. which has never made rails. Only from 200 to 300 people would be directly employed in the rail mill. The hope of those proposing the loan guarantees is that this new product would be successful enough to help turn around WheelingPittsburghs overall financial troubles. I support Government efforts to make sure we continue to have a strong domestic steel industry. but those measures must be based upon the fundamental principle of fairness in any Government intervention in the free market. The proposed EDA guarantee of WheelingPittsburgh loans would be unfair. The Government would be bailing out one troubled steel company. by helping to finance a new plant to manufacture steel rails. Thus propped up by the government. WheelingPittsburgh would compete with the existing manufacturer of steel rails. all of whom financed their own operations without assistance from the Government. One of those existing manufacturers of steel rails is the C.F. & I. Steel Corp. of Pueblo. Colo. C.F. & I. has produced steel rails for many years. and is now just completing a 3year. $85 million expansion and modernization of its rail mill. C.F. & I. undertook this privately financed expansion on the assumption that the Government would continue to treat fairly and equitably all producers of rails. Now. however. EDA is proposing to help another steel company begin making rails in competition with C.F. & I. This is patently unfair. Mr. President. there are a number of other arguments against the EDA loan guarantee. There is substantial question whether the loan guarantee in fact complies with the guidelines for EDA assistance. There is question about WheelingPittsburghs ability to repay the loan. WheelingPittsburghs new rail mill would employ only about 200300 people. The Governmentsubsidized entry of WheelingPittsburgh into the rail business could well create an excess of supply of rails. harming the existing rail manufacturers and WheelingPittsburgh. Senator WEICKER has forcefully presented these and other arguments against the EDA loan guarantee. I endorse his very capable explanation of the many reasons to oppose the loan guarantee. Even without these other arguments. however. I would oppose EDAs plan to bail out WheelingPittsburgh. Putting the taxpayers money behind a single company is an unfair and inequitable intervention by the Government in private enterprise. For that reason alone. even without looking at the other arguments against the EDA loan guarantees. my colleagues should be persuaded to support the Weicker amendment."},{"1":"1978","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Is it not true. I put the question to my colleague. the senior Senator from Hawaii. that in a recent article from U.S. News & World Report of February 7. 1978. it was noted that as many as 200.000 jobs would be lost if the proposal now offered by the Senator from Massachusetts were to be adopted?"},{"1":"1977","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Speaker. In the future. merchants and bankers will make it more difficult for customers to cash checks at places of business without presenting a banks check authorization card. Thus consumers who want the convenience of performing financial transactions while shopping will need this bank service. Check guarantee/authorization terminals are viewed as an intermediate step toward pointofsale terminals which will transfer funds instantly from the consumers checking account to the merchants account. The public will literally be forced to accept electronic banking because there will simply be no alternative. This is a quote from the study released early in April by Peat Marwick Mitchell & Co.. the big accounting firm. Since the inception of electronic funds transfer systems I have expressed this fear about the implications of EFT on our society. This past February I chaired general consumer credit information hearings at which time I warned financial institutions and credit card companies to curb their headlong flight into electronic funds transfer systems. I fear that the situation will develop in the following manner: Financial institutions. with little or no knowledge of the technology involved. are purchasing extremely expensive electronic equipment to keep up with the competition. Suppliers of this equipment stress the speed. efficiency. and reduction of paperwork as benefits of switching to electronics. Because the issue of sharing has not yet been settled. each banker wants to be the first to be established at the local merchants. Bankers see also the new profits and reduction of headaches and buy into the systems only to discover. too late. that the volume of transactions required to make the systems cost/effective is not that easy to reach. Also. the new headaches involved in clearing up webs of computer errorsand do not let anyone tell you that they do not occurbankers find affect not only their institutions. but also consumer confidence in the credibility of the entire system of EFTs. It is true that consumers seem to accept most anything for convenience sake. Some EFT use has been generated for this reason. but when that growth levels off and the bankers still are not realizing their dreams other means will be employed to increase the use of the EFT systems. How? My answer was shockingly echoed by the words of the Peat Marwick Mitchell & Co. study with which I opened this statement. I want to stress that neither my words nor the predictions of the accounting firm are meant to be sensational scare tactics. Instead they are based on what has actually happened in the limited EFT experiments now being conducted. Peat Marwick Mitchell & Co. undertook this survey of EFT experiments and legislation in each of the 50 States at the request of the National Commission on EFT. The study expands on the original mandate of the Commission by offering educated predictions concerning the future of EFT activities. These predictions are based on what the firm found was already happening in areas of the country with older. more extensive EFT experimentsAtlanta. for example. where the Honest Face check authorization/ guarantee program operates. The Atlanta experiment shows that merchants have been cashing checks only of those customers who also can produce an Honest Face card. Other experiments in different parts of the country have shown signs of trouble on the commercial side. Addressograph Multigraph Corp.. a supplier of EFT equipment. announced that it was dropping its line of pointofsalePOS--terminals because of a lack of commitments from banks. Glendale Federal Savings & Loan Association of Glendale. Calif.. announced that it was closing its experimental electronic fund transfer program. The reason being that it did not generate enough new savings deposits to justify operational costs. Twenty POS terminals located in supermarkets were closed. Bell Federal Savings & Loan. Chicago. had placed an experimental network of EFT terminals in Jewel supermarkets. but they recently closed their program. Neither Bell Federal nor Jewel were satisfied with the experiment. Jewels complaint was that the S. & L. had not distributed enough cards to make the system worthwhile. Mr. Edmond Shanahan of Bell Federal said that a year ago he would have described the program as the greatest advance he had seen. but today they have no intention of rushing into another experiment. He said: we are going to just sit back and watch how other systems develop. The S. & L. wanted Jewel to carry out its original agreement and have the terminal manned by a store clerk. while Jewel wanted to eliminate the need for this additional staff person. As Mr. Shanahan put it. Bell Federal was investing in the system to make it easier for the consumer to make deposits. If that consumer also wanted check verification or cash withdrawal services. those would be provided. but they were not the primary aim of the S. & L. No automated terminal has been developed to take deposits in a manner the banks will trust. Therefore. the experiment has ended. From these few examples of what has been happening it can be seen that it is not only the financial institutions who have a stake in gaining the maximum number of EFT transactions possible once an investment in electronic equipment has been made. To assure the volume required. merchants and bankers might try making it difficult for consumers to use any other payment system. The National Commission on EFT recommended in its interim report. released the end of February. thatFair choice among payment methods be preserved. and that unfair or discriminatory methods be prohibited. On the surface that statement sounds reassuring. but consider the existing difficulties of trying to make a purchase with a check these days. It is true no additional charges are attached. but it is also true that the laborious procedures now imposed on the consumer would discourage most anyone. Most stores require identification for your check cashing in addition to a drivers license. usually two credit cards. As was stated before. in Atlanta. merchants are refusing checks unless the customer has an Honest Face card. Some stores in other parts of the country require check users to stand in a separate lineusually a blocklong queue. Some stores even require the check user to go through the timeconsuming and humililating procedure of having a picture taken before the check will be accepted. The National Commission on EFT has stated that cash is the only legal tender and the only form of payment a creditor can be compelled to accept. If one looks at the actual situation in the marketplace today. however. he will see that the use of cash over a credit card has been discouraged. It becomes extremely difficult to rent a car. for example. without using a credit card. When checking into a motel without a credit card the consumer must pay cash in advance as a deterrent. In this way credit card use has been promoted. Now with the introduction of debit cards in our society. merchants are looking to them as a panacea for the problems encountered with credit cards. The Peat Marwick Mitchell & Co. study says: Merchants are becoming reluctant to continue to accept the burdensome use of national credit cards. Making authorization calls. paying transaction charges. embarrassing some customers by refusing check authorizations. and being forced to wait for payments are all typical. unpleasant features of the credit card system. These sources of dissatisfaction may prompt replacement of credit cards with debit cards. Other concerns whAch I have voiced about the emerging EFT systems were also a part of the Peat Marwick Mitchell & Co. study. Concern that as these systems become more advanced and develop into networks. safeguarding of consumer privacy will become more difficult. Consumer information can be circulated more broadly under the emerging networks. Also the information can be more easily retrieved from computers than from the old filing systems and in any form or category desired. Thus fishing expeditions become more profitable. The report cautions businessmen to study the benefits of EFT systems carefully before making expensive investments. They are warned about the disastrous effects of computer errors: Processing errors can be devastating to an EFT project. Once the customer is the victim of an inaccurately processed electronic transaction. he -is likely to lose all confidence in the system . . . in the course of our survey. we have seen more than one instance where this has happened to EFT projects. In conclusion. I want to congratulate Peat Marwick Mitchell & Co. on their thorough report. I sincerely hope the National Commission on EFT will reconsider its recommendations in the consumer area now that they have the benefit of this study. I can assure you that the Consumer Affairs Subcommittee. which I chair. will keep these findings seriously in mind as we proceed with preparations for the coming credit card hearings."},{"1":"1976","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. during the depression of the 1930s. President Franklin Roosevelt ordered the creation of the Civilian Conservation Corps. Those of us who lived during this period remember this project which employed hundreds of thousands of young men in reforestation. soil conservation. and other similar activities. And those who do not remember this program personally can see the results of the CCC from the Skyline Drive in Virginia to as far away as Alaska. From 1939 to 1940 the CCC employed over 1.500.000 youths whose futures were saved because of this program. And this country benefited greatly. not only directly from their labor but from the hope it instilled in these young citizens. Today there are more than 1.600.000 young people 20 to 24 years of age who are unemployed in this country. A number of these young people have become an unproductive resource and a financial burden to society. Many are despondent with their status and have lost faith in their country. While our current economy is not as bleak as it was during the thirties we have with us a similar problem facing the youth of our Nation. We need to find work for these young people and bring them back into the main stream of our society. I am introducing a bill today to establish the Young Adult Conservation Corps. This Corps will be similar to the Youth Conservation Corps created by Congress 5 years ago to employ young people during the summer months. The Corps I am proposing will employ young adults between the ages of 19 and 24 on a yearround basis. There are many jobs that need to be done on public lands. The Forest Service has a reforestation backlog of 3 million acres and these cutover lands must be replanted. The Forest Service estimates that in the Northwest alone 10.000 jobs would be required to catch up with reforestation. The bill I am introducing calls for 100.000 young adults to be hired by the Federal Government in 1977 to perform work such as reforestation. timber stand improvement. forest fire fighting. trail and campground improvement. and insect. flood. and disease control. The bill provides for the hiring of 300.000 young adults in 1978. 400.000 in 1979. and 500.000 in 1980. Each job will last 12 nonths allowing a total of more than a million young people to have a chance for employment. These young people would oso be available for work in city. county. chd State projects through a provision that allows for 30 percent of the appropria.tions to be spent on a grantstoStates basis. It is worthwhile noting that the Youth Conservation Corps. which has provided jobs during the summers since 1970. has turned out to be a good investment. Improvements resulting from this program have provided about an 80percent return on each dollar invested. While we cannot accurately measure the effect this summer program has had on our young people in the past 5 years. based on the results of the Conservation Corps of the thirties. I am sure it is substantial. I know all of us are anxious to see our young people gainfully employed rather than being forced to go on the welfare rolls and I believe this legislation is the step we need to take to halt this trend. This program to provide jobs for our young people is an investment in the future of our country and one that we cannot afford not to make."},{"1":"1975","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I think we are losing sight of one of the major things we have accomplished here. We bring in up to $1.5 billion taxes under this amendmentthe Bentsen amendment that was passed 2 nights ago and voted on by the U.S. Senate. and upon which the Senate expressed its will. But now we are talking about trying to say we need to also have strong competitors to these majors and that these independents must not just have to sell out to the majors and give them all the business. I think. again. using the 3.000 barrel a day figure adopted by the Ways and Means Committee last year for oil. that we are allowing depletion on gross income of a little over $8 million annually. but that is before the mans cost of leasing lands. before his costs of renting drilling rigs. before his costs of buying pipe and drill bits. and before he drills eight dry wells at an average cost of $165.000. Now we are talking about the average depth of a well which is about 4.800 feet and of a cost of $165.000 a hole before he hits one successful well. And that well today is costing twice as much as it did before the embargo of last year. I have given the figures showing that the deep wells are costing well over a million dollars a copy and they can come up just as dry as dust. too. If we want independents to give the majors any real competition for the future reserves of this country. we have to retain depletion allowance for companies big enough to get out there and drill a lot of wells and to drill the deep wells. Let me say this. too. that on those wells below 15.000 feet. the majors are drilling the smallest amount of the exploratory wells by far and that of those wells deeper than 15.000 feet the independents today are meeting them head to head and drilling fully as many wells as the major oil companies. Let me cite an example of what can happen. why we have to have the 3.000 barrels instead of stopping at the 1.000 barrels. I know of an independent operator in the small town of Albany. Texas. Two major oil companies had held a lease on a large tract near Albany for years. When the majors finally dropped the lease. quit trying to find oil. this independent took it over. he drilled 25 dry holes on this lease before finding production. He has now developed the lease and it is producing 1.000 barrels of oil a day and some natural gas. And he is providing a lot of jobs. He has a 1.000 barrels a day but he is still a small operator in an industry as capital intensive as this one. But he is a successful operator and he is making a contribution to this country. Now. do we want to reduce his ability to finance the purchase of another lease from a major company and drill 25 more dry holes. if that is what is necessary. to find another thousand barrels a day and try to find some gas. too? One of the problems the distinguished Senator from California has on his bill is where he does not provide the additional 18 million cubic feet of gas. exemption for natural gas. And because natural gas has a lower price on B.t.u.s basis we will find a lot of these independents trying to drill up the 3.000 barrels on the oil side. instead of bringing on the gas production. I think that is a mistake and a very fatal flaw in the Senators amendment and another reason why it should be opposed."},{"1":"1974","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"I thank the distinguished chairman. and am assured that the project was considered fairly and objectively.

H.R. 6912. a bill to amend the Par Value Modification Act. I oppose this bill in protest to the administrations handling of our international monetary and economic policies. as well as its mismanagement of the domestic economy. No President in the history of this country has presided over within the period of 14 months two major devaluations of the U.S. dollar. At the conclusion of the Smithsonian Agreement. December 1971. President Nixon stated that the agreement which devalued the dollar by some 8 percent was the greatest international monetary agreement that had ever been made. Fourteen months after the greatest international monetary agreement. the President was forced to devalue the dollar again. because of. in my opinion. his total mismanagement of our domestic economy. The complete abrogation of phase II of the Presidents economic policy program of wage and price controls in January of this year caused a massive run on the U.S. dollar and made the gold speculators the international gamblers against the U.S. dollar. Aside from the reason of my protest vote against this bill. I would like to point out the American taxpayer will be forced to provide $2.25 billion in order to maintain the calue of paidin capital subscriptions to various international lending institutions. such as International Monetary Fund and the InterAmerican Development Bank. As our committee report points out. an additional $25 million will be needed as a contingency reserve. since the total of these obligations can only be determined on the date that the aollar devaluation formerly occurred. This is indeed a heavy price for the American taxpayer to bear. particularly at a time when this administration is cutting out and cutting back on numerous muchneeded domestic programs in all areas. As my colleague on the committee from Rhode Island will point out. the administration is abolishing thousands of jobs in unnecessary cutbacks of various Federal defense installations around the country making very little attempt to assist the people so affected by these cutbacks. Domestic economy is experiencing the rampage of inflation. the likes of which we have not seen since -the end of World War II. and nothing is being done to contain this inflation. Interest rates are rising again. Cost of living goes up every month. Food prices are -reaching the point that the average American family will shortly be unable to meet his immediate food bill. Rents are rising all over the country. Construction of new homes is rapidly falling. and yet the administration does nothing. I realize that this bill is a formal approval of the decision already arrived at by the President. but I must use this opportunity in opposition to this bill to protest the utter failure of the Nixon administration to manage our domestic economy and our international monetary affairs."},{"1":"1972","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. the Senate need look no further than the general statement section of the committee report on this bill for the facts which Justify a major Government effort to control and reduce noise pollution. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Air and Water Pollution. however. I am sorry to have to say to this body that the legislation which it now considers will not provide the kind of action that those facts demand. The Environmental Noise Control Act of 1972. S. 3342. was introduced on March 14. 1972 by Senator JOHN V. TUNNEY and myself. That legislation was different than either the Housepassed bill. H.R. 11021. or the administrations bill. S. 1016. in purpose and intent. The bill which we introduced was not primarily designed to relieve product manufacturers from the effect of State noise pollution regulatory programs. Nor was it designed primarily to relieve transportation companies. particularly the airlines. from effective noise regulations. We wanted to establish a means to reduce as rapidly as possible. through the application of available control measures. the exposure of people to noise by reducing noise at its source. by changing the way noisy products are used. by controlling noisy activities. and by such other means that are available. Our bill was an environmental regulatory measure. We recognized that the regulation of noise would have an impact on commerce. but we also recognized that the purpose of regulation must be the reduction in the volume. intensity. and character of noise to which people are exposed in their daily lives from sources over which they have no control. As the third annual report of the Presidents Council on Environmental Quality stated: It is increasingly difficult for any individualin urban or rural Americato escape noise. For many city residents. noise may be the single most pervasive environmental pollutant. The committee report itself notes that noise hasA significant impact on more than 80 million Americans . . . 40 million Americans risk hearing impairment and other physiological and psychological effects . . . 44 million Americans have the ultility of their dwellings adversely affected by noise from aircraft or traffic . . . 21 million Americans are similarly affected by constructionrelated noise. In the face of. these facts. we have no right to adopt any more lenient a policy against noise pollution than we have adopted against air and water pollution. It will not be an easy task. because we will have to give States and localities much more flexibility to impose strict controls in controlling noise within their own jurisdictions than in controlling air and water pollution. Noise is not subject to easy regulation. Unlike the common air and water pollutants. noise does not accumulate in the environment. Noise is not subject to collective treatment and reduction processes. As a practical matter. then. the best method to reduce noise is to apply stringent emission regulations at the source of the noise. so that products and activity will not present a noise pollution problem alone or in combination with each other. To a degree. the legislation reported by the committee moves in this direction. Through the establishment of a regulatory mechanism which permits the Administrator to impose noise emission restrictions attainable through the application of the best available technology. the Administrator will be able to press the limits of our capability to reduce noise from new products. The bill does not. however. provide adequate options in those cases in which the best available technology is not adequate to achieve environmentally acceptable levels of noise. It does not protect adequately the authority of States and local government to safeguard the environment in which their citizens live. It does not give States the opportunity to ban the sale of federally regulated products which. in their jurisdictions. still emit unacceptable levels of sound. And at the same time. it does not expedite Federal regulation. thus holding out the hope of a quieter environment with no guarantee of early improvement. By preempting State authority to restrict sale of noisy products. the bill places the burden on the consumer to take the risk of buying products which cannot be used in the manner Intended at the time of purchase. The preemption provision limits State authority to restricting the manner of use of noisy products regulated by the Federal Government. The Committee on Public Works is not unfamiliar with the problem of preemption. The Air Quality Act of 1967. which I sponsored. provided for Federal preemption of the authority to regulate air pollution emissions from new automobiles. except in California. That policy may have had an effect opposite of that which was intended. It appears that the preemption provision of that act did not cause the auto companies to focus their research efforts and investments on one set of national standards. Rather. the auto companies efforts have been focused on undermining those national standards. Again in 1970. preemption was discussed in relation to regulation of air pollution emissions from aircraft. The Congress decided on a preemption provision effective on enactment and set deadlines for standards to be developed. Section 231(a) of the Clean Air Act requires that the Environmental Protection Agency must begin an investigation of air pollution from aircraft within 90 days of date of enactment. Within 180 days after commencing that investigation. the Environmental Protection Agency is required to report on the investigation and propose emission standards for any class of aircraft or aircraft engines which contributes to air pollution which endangers public health and welfare. Ninety days thereafter1 year after enactmentEPA was to issue final regulations. The proposed standards were due over 1 year ago. September 27. 1971. Today. no report or proposed standards have been published. This is a classic example of Federal preemption leading to Federal failure to protect public health. The Federal Aviation Administration has undoubtedly discouraged active efforts by the Administrator. And the efforts that the Environmental Protection Agency has made have run aground in the Office of Management and Budget. Therefore. when the committee considered the pending legislation. I expressed reservations regarding a broad preemption provision for product and aircraft emission standards. The States have moved actively in this field. Federal noise pollution responsibility is new and little significant authority or responsibility exists. but a number of States have regulatory programs which impose emission controls on noisy products which are enforceable both at the point of sale and at the point of use. I cannot support Federal preemption which protects product manufacturers and the air transportation industry without effective regulatory programs which will enhance the quality of the environment. Substituting Federal law for State law with even less assurance that public health will be protected is poor public policy. My second major concern with the legislation reported from the committee deals with the problem of aircraft noise and regulatory mechanism recommended to cope with that problem. To date. the regulation of aircraft noise pollution has been the sole responsibility of the Federal Aviation Administration. The Federal Aviation Administration has had this responsibility since its inception. It has had a specific legislative mandate for the past 4 years. And its record is wholly inadequate. I understand why the Federal Aviation Administrations response has been inadequate. The FAAs primary mission is not to reduce the environmental impact caused by aircraft noise. Its mission is to promote air commerce and to protect safety. Regulation of noise from aircraft is not consistent with that primary mission. In the proposed rulemaking in January 1969. FAA set forth a noise floor at 80 EPNdB as an objective to aim for. and to achieve where economically reasonable. technologically practicable. and appropriate to the particular design and went on: However. this objective is important because it makes it clear to all applicants that no increment of noise above 80 EPNdB can be considered acceptable. In and of itself. where it can be eliminated practically and reasonably. This figure is proposed as a reasonable boundary between noise levels that are high enough to interfere with communications and to obstruct normal life in homes or other buildings that are not designed with specific acoustical objectives. and lower noise levels which. while not completely benign. nevertheless allow those activities to proceed. Where this goal can be reached in a given case. and can be justified as economically reasonable. technologically practical. and appropriate to the particular type design. the FAA does not intend to ignore this potential reduction. Yet after industry pressure. the FAA dropped this 80 EPNdB objective from the promulgated regulations stating: The FAA has determined that the request to remove the noise floor of 80 EPNdB from the regulatory language is reasonable and should be granted. This noise floor. not beIng currently achievable. could have no immediate legal effect. The attitude of the Federal Aviation Administration as regards regulation of aircraft noise was more clearly spelled out in the following excerpt from a draft report on noise pollution prepared by the Environment Protection Agency: Both directly and by unmistakable inference. a number of important conclusions arise from the information gathered on Federal noise control programs. Most plainly. the control of unwanted sound is not a high priority issue for virtually any Federal agency or department. Only when an Agencys primary mission absolutely requires a commitment of time. manpower and funding to noise control to assume the smooth functioning of that primary mission (as with for instance. FAA and NASA) is even a modest venture into noise suppression undertaken. For the FAA. aircraft noise is only an annoying interference in the basic goal of the Agency: the most efficient. safest and swiftest air travel possible. While this statement was deleted from the final- report transmitted to the Congress. it is indicative of FAAs attitude toward noise from aircraft. Unfortunately. the bill. as reported. would continue the dominance of the FAA. Not only would FAA have veto over safety of noise reduction technology. but neither could EPA make any judgment as to the availability of technology or the cost of achieving noise reductions without FAA approval. Continuation of the Federal Aviation Administration in a role of determining the degree to which noise emissions from aircraft will be reduced is not justified in the record. While the committee bill takes steps to establish the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency as the determinator of those levels of aircraft noise required to protect public health and welfare. EPA will have little authority to enforce standards to meet those requirements. Members of the committee. including myself. recognized that aircraft were unique because of the safety requirements and the interrelationship of safety to the engine system. Therefore. I agreed with the committees judgment and supported the amendments of Senator COOPER and Senator STAFFORD which would retain the Federal Aviation Administration lead role in making any final determination as to whether or not any technology availableto achieve noise emission levels would also be consistent with the highest standards of safety. The assumption that technology might not be available to meet noise emission goals combined with the assumption that technology could be vetoed because of FAA safety judgment. lead to the conclusion that there must be a mechanism to assure maximum pressure to develop safe technology while at the same time reduce the impact of noise in the environments of impacted airports. The committee considered and rejected a provision that would have required achievement of health and welfare protection of noise levels in airport environments. whether or not specific aircraft engine emission control technology was available. Without an actionforcing mechanism such as enforceable cumulative noise exposure levels. neither FAA nor the airlines would have any incentive to press technology and achieve the goals EPA would be authorized to establish. A combination of cumulative noise levels and emission standards would create that pressure. Obviously if technology exists to achieve the levels of noise emission reduction to protect public health. achievement of emission standards would reduce any economic burdens on the airline industry caused by controls imposed to achieve cumulative noise levels. And such local environmental noise requirements would require a reduction in the number and frequency of flights if technology did not exist. The committee considered and rejected a provision which would have required the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to identify any airports in the country with aircraft noise problems of a magnitude to cause a violation of cumulative noise exposure levels. The proposal defined cumulative noise exposure levels as those levels of noise in the environments of airports associated with aircraft operations which were adversely affecting the health and welfare of people around airports. Most importantly. this provision would have imposed a positive burden upon the operator of the airport to exercise responsibility to regulate the number. the frequency and the hours of flight or to impose land use and other controls so as to eliminate noise as an environmental problem in the area of that airport. And the airport operators duty and responsibility to carry out such responsibilities would be established by statute. This concept is not unique. In 1970. the Congress enacted legislation which requires development of a clean car by 1975. That law recognized that reliance on technology alone would not result in elimination of autorelated pollution as a health hazard until existing vehicles were off the roadperhaps mid1985 or later. Therefore. the bill established a procedure to regulate the use of automobiles in areas in which automobilerelated air pollution was unacceptably high to assure that public health would be protected at an early datein this instance. 197576. The combination of emission reduction technology and air quality implementation plans has been a useful mechanism both to improve air quality and to apply pressure on local governments to seek alternatives to reliance on motor vehicles. Also. this mechanism will apply pressure to the auto industry to develop clean cars if they wish to preserve existing markets. This mechanism can and should be applied to aircraftrelated noise problems. It recognizes the limitations of technology. while providing a means to protect the health and welfare of those seven and a quarter million people who live in airport environments and who are adversely affected by aircraft noise. To do anything less in this legislation is to fail to meet responsibly the demands of the American public for a safe. healthful and peaceful environment. Without a provision of this type. I believe the bill to be inadequate. Without a provision of this type. the bill does not address in a meaningful way the real problem faced by people who are confronted now with unacceptable levels of aircraft noise. The reported bill would force these people to wait for emission control technology to be developed and applied to new and existing aircraft. or on the courts to impose sufficient penalties or damage claims against the airlines and the airport operators for creating a public nuisance before relief will be achieved. To turn over to the courts the responsibility of making ad hoc decisions to solve environmental noise problems is equally unacceptable. I think it is inadequate to. rely on claims for damages. penalties against the airlines. and injunctions as a substitute for positive regulatory programs. Mr. President. I think it is inadequate to enact a Federal law which ignores the most basic and most significant problem of noise as perceived by people. These are the major flaws in this legislation as I see it. Mr. President. Even as our environment becomes noisier and noisier. as the physiological. psychological. and property costs of that noise rise higher and higher. and as we develop more and more techniques for reducing that noise. we are not responding adequately to our task. We must protect the public health. The amendments which I and other Senators will propose will not create unreasonable restrictions on potential sources of noise. and they will give this legislation the quality of effective environmental regulation. They will improve our ability to protect the health and welfare of the people of our land. I urge that the Senate support these vital improvements. Mr. President. the two amendments I offer today would get at these points I have just raised. The amendment just reported is designed to determine levels of airport noise which affect public health and welfare and to establish procedures to identify and monitor activities at airports where levels of excessive environmental noise exist. In recent years the primary impetus to develop Federal noise controls has been citizen concern With excessive noise levels in the vicinity of airports. Excessive airport noise may be reduced someday. in part. by controls on aircraft and aircraft engines which are dealt with in other sections of this bill. But simply modifying aircraft and aircraft engines will not alone solve what has become known as the airport noise problemat least not soon enough to help 7 million citizens who face unacceptable noise levels every day of their lives. To solve the airport noise problem. other programs integrated with aircraft controls are necessary. Effective programs will include curfews. controls over operation or aircraft at and around airports. limitations on the number of airport operations per hours. land use. zoning. building construction and ground transportation system regulations in the airport and its vicinity. and other noiserelated control efforts. These controls are immediately more important than aircraft engine controls if airport noise problems are to be reduced. But nowhere in the legislation before us is a mechanism established to determine specific levels of airport noise which will protect public health and welfare. to monitor noise levels around airports. to give advice to airport operators on various approaches they can take to deal with the other aspects of airport noise problems. or to provide technical assistance to airport operators which they may need in implementing such controls. Nor does the bill assure airport operators that interim measures can be taken locally to reduce airport noise and thus the myriad of damage actions pending and anticipated. All that S. 3342 does. in section 502. is call for a study of these matters. This is not enough. Today we are told we are enacting legislation to deal with the aircraft noise problem. not to study those problems but to have a real commitment of Federal action. If that is so. then we must include a real Federal commitment to act against airport noise. The amendment I propose will require that within 180 days after enactment of this act. EPA publish regulations establishing levels of cumulative noise exposure for airports and surrounding areas which are adequate to protect public health and welfare with an adequate margin of safety. Ninety days after publication of these regulations. EPA will be required to publish standards for measurements of levels of cumulative noise exposure. Within 9 months after measurement regulations are publishedabout 18 months after enactment of the lawEPA would be required to identify those airports in the vicinity of which unacceptable levels of cumulative noise exposure exist. EPA would be required to install at those airports devices to monitor. on a continuing basis. levels of noise exposure and make available to the public data which resulted from EPA monitoring activities. This process would establish a single uniform basis for examining cumulative noise levels and determining just what airport noise levels and what airport activities result in levels of noise harmful to public health or welfare. To aid the airports in reducing levels of cumulative noise exposure. the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration. whom we all agree has the greatest experience in airport operations and safety. is directed to develop and publish guidelines with suggested alternatives for reducing airport noise and to provide technical assistance to airports in solving their noise problems. Finally. my amendment would establish a clear. statutory recognition of the duty and responsibility of airport operators to take necessary action to reduce airport noise as determined necessary to prevent damage actions and protect health and welfare. I am particularly concerned that this legislation clarify the role of the FAA in working with airports to solve their airport noise problems. Recently. the FAA has taken the position that airports cannot restrict aircraft operations in order to reduce noise. Thus. under FAA interpretation. aircraft operators must bear the burden of noise damage suits without authority to solve local problems and defend themselves against such suits. I ask unanimous consent that there be included in the RECORD at this point a complaint filed by the FAA against the town of Morristown. N.J.. charging Morristown had violated Federal law and gant agreements by restricting aircraft operations because of noise."},{"1":"1971","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Following this determination. the military departments prepared statements for the 15 projects identified.

The gentleman from New York also says we need time to develop substitutes. I would like to inquire how much time we need during which to develop substitutes. Do we wait until we stop home construction before we commence planning? Mr. Speaker. in 1968 we pledged to build 2.6 million units of housing per year for a period of 10 years. We are now building houses in this country at the rate of approximately 1.1 million per year. If we are to meet the commitments. if we are to meet our housing pledges. we will very shortly be faced with the necessity of building houses at a rate in excess of 3 million. perhaps as high as 3.5 million per year. When you add the enormous demands on the supply of wood that will be created in this housing market. we certainly need a bill of this type and we certainly should have the rule so we can discuss the matter on its merits. Mr. Speaker. I have in my hand an editorial from the Times Standard of California entitled No Lesson From Tillamook? As you will recall there was the incredibly vast Tillamook burn in northwestern Oregon in 1933. That area Is located in my congressional district. Mr. Speaker. I shall read into the RECORD at this point very pertinent excerpts from that editorial: The bill also designated that it would apply only to those areas of national forests already designated as commercial timber lands. and would not alter those designated for wilderness areas. parks or other restricteduse areas. The conservationists countered with assertions that increased timber production would mean the building of more access roads. True. This is a vital part of the intent. in order to speed lumber production to ease the critical housing shortage throughout the United States ... and for another good reason. What the conservationists did not mention is that the incredibly vast Tillamook Burn in northwestern Oregon in 1933 was the greatest natural disaster through fire in American history. Damage caused in this blaze which destroyed billions of feet of prime virgin timber. made the dollar cost of the Chicago fire look like peanuts. The reason why It burned over so many miles and so many days is thatthere were no forest roads to enable firefighting equipment to get in. The bill came as no surprise to anyone. It was the result of extensive Congressional hearings last year in which it was determined that restriction of federal timber production was a direct cause of the serious lumber and plywood shortages and the subsequent inflationary rise in prices. The national forests contain more than half of the countrys saw timber. in California they hold nearly 60 per cent. yet they produce less than 40 per cent of the annual yield. Commercial operators on private lands would go dead broke at that rate. So the conservationists fear roads. We remind them of Tillamook. Mr. Speaker.

Much of the material that is taken used to be left in theforests. but today we take it in. So I think that all of the things that will be provided for in the bill in the way of intensified management will be under the control and jurisdiction of the Forest Service. and certainly they are experienced hands. We have some of the best professional foresters working in the Federal Service that I know of. I know of no supervisor in my area. nor the Regional Forester. nor the Chief of the Forest Service. who have any objection to this bill being brought to this body. and if passed by this body they could administer it in a very fine manner for the betterment of all of our people."},{"1":"1969","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President.

In addition to that. Congress appropriated $53.650.087. for a grand total of $342 million. of which $214.314.808 was distributed among the States. The rest of it was distributed as follows: National Park Service. $78 million plus. Forest Service. $48 million plus. The Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife. $2 million plus. I invite attention to the fact that even though we have a dedication of all the funds to the purchase of land. yet Congress provided. in addition to that. $53 million plus. Under the amendment I am proposing. the $500 million which will be collected under the present law will not be affected at all. It will remain in the Treasury. to be distributed under the provisions of the 1965 law. There is nothing to prevent House and Senate from appropriating more funds. The fact is. the amendment I am proposing would authorize an additional sum equal to $700 million to be appropriated over a period of 5 years in order to buy parks and parkland. That is not changed at all. The only thing my amendment would do is elimination of earmarking revenues. That is about all it would do. I think it should be that way. As I pointed out last week. we have an enormous number of public works and reclamation projects to construct all over this country. Last year. under a resolution passed by the Congress. over $66 million of funds were cut from the appropriation Congress made for the purpose of constructing public works. I further pointed out that. with respect to every project constructed. where there is a dam involved to protect land for flood control or other purposes. recreation facilities are created at the site which are used by everybody in the locality. It seems to me that if we can continue that process. the people as d whole will have more accessible places for recreation than if this huge sum were to be. used to buy large areas of land for park purposes."},{"1":"1967","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. the other day I received a letter which contained the reprint of a speech from a television program. This speech Is not very long but it says a lot. The letter was sent by Jack Webb. star of the new Dragnet television series. It goes a long way toward seeing the other side: The side of the cop. the side of the man who is charged with brutality and who seems to be working much of the time for a lost cause because some courts are soft on the criminals and the side of the guy whom many people apparently despise and deride. until they need him. Mr. Webb states: In view of the increasing disregard for both the law and its enforcement in our society today. it seems to me of vital importance that efforts be made to narrow the gap in understanding which exists between some segments of the public and the policetheir police. In its own small way. the enclosed speech is an effort in this direction in that it attempts to portray a police officers attitude toward his job as simply and as realistically as possible. He goes on to state that the members of the Los Angeles Police Department who have seen the speech unanimously agree that it is a thoroughly accurate reflection of their own feelings about police work and their jobs.

I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding to me and rise to express my opposition to the amendment. I will not impose on the time of the House to discuss the tremendous benefits that have sprung from development of the natural resources of this Nation. Each of you are well aware of the great strides we have taken In creative resources development throughout most of the United States. We have also helped to build huge hydro projects in underdeveloped countries of the world such as the 370foothigh dam on the Volta River In Ghana which provides West Africa with 1 million kilowatts of electricity. Yet. for some strange reason. Maine and New England have been bypassed as the natural resources of other areas of the United States and abroad have been developed. Secretary of Interior Stewart L. Udall has called the DickeyLincoln School project a great water resource project in the classic sense and he also termed it a model for conservation in that it provides complete and comprehensive development of the international St. John River. Two engineering agencies of our Governmentthe Corps of Engineers and the Department of Interiorparticipated jointly in preparing the engineering and economic feasibility studies of this project. The Federal Power Commission considers it the finest hydroelectric site in New England. President Johnson personally transmitted the report on the project to Congress to demonstrate his strong support of the DickeyLincoln School project. And finally. Congress in the last session authorized its construction. Now another feasibility study will be undertaken. and while the proponents do not believe it is necessary. we hope it will serve to reassure those still with doubts. Mr. Chairman. the DickeyLincoln School project has impressive credentials as a resource development project. and I am at a loss to understand the continuing attempts to block the legitimate interests of the people of New England. New England suffers from the highest cost electric power in the continental United States. In Maine. electric rates for the average consumer are 21 percent higher that the national average. In fact. the average monthly bill for the same amount of electric power increased from 1964 to 1965while it was decreasing throughout the rest of the Nation. Now. when a solid promise of help is offered to the people of New England. selfish privateinterest groups continue to seek to obstruct it. Secretary Udall has called upon them to cooperate in this great endeavor. citing the advantages of mutual cooperation. but they refused. The gentleman from Maine. Congressman HATHAWAY. and I have sought their cooperation without avail. Instead they hold out only promises designed to confuse the issues and thwart the will of Congress. The private power companies have two approaches. In New England they say that construction of the DickeyLincoln School project would prevent them from going forward with their socalled nuclear alternative. In Washington. however. they say that the DickeyLincoln School is unnecessary because of their firm intentions to construct their nuclear alternative. The Federal Power Commission. following the presentation of these utilities before the House Public Works Committee last year. reviewed their socalled nuclear alternative. The Commission concluded that it was not. in fact. a cheaper alternative. They found instead that power produced under this socalled alternative was 41.8 percent higher in terms of cost per kilowattyear and 52.6 percent higher in terms of capacity costs. The small municipal systems and rural cooperatives in Maine pay these utilities 15 to 20 mills for electric power. Power from the DickeyLincoln School project would be sold at 8 mills. Think what this will mean in Calais. Maine. for example. where the streets are illuminated by 25watt bulbs. You have no idea what this project means In terms of area redevelopment in Aroostook and Washington Counties where nearly half of the people live on incomes clearly below the poverty level. For those who are apprehensive over the cost of this project. let me remind them that for every dollar of Federal investment an additional $2 of private business transactions will be generated. A study made by the Department of the Interior of electric power needs in the region showed that 36 million kilowatts of generating power would be needed in New England and Canadas Maritime Provinces by 1980. After deducting existing capacity and planned additions. the Federal Power Commission estimates there will be a deficit of 17 million kilowatts. I think prudent men would agree that New England needs both nuclear plants and the DickeyLincon School project. It is not a case of one against the other. actually. substantially more lowcost electric power is needed in New England than both can provide. I hope that my Republican colleagues will join in bipartisan support of the Maine project. I would remind them that this project has the support of Republican Gov. John Reed. Senator MARGARET CHASE SMITH. and the last Republican State convention in my State. Mr. Chairman. in nearly 16 years of public ifehere and in MaineI can think of no single project which is more important to the future of my State. In my 6 years in Congress. I have consistently supported the development of water resources of this Nation no matter where they were located because I am convinced that prudent investment in our resources is also a prudent investment In the future of our country. I ask only that you do for the people of Maine that which they have willingly supported for the citizens of other States for many years."},{"1":"1965","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"The Senator is talking in terms of keeping American industry where it is today.

There are qualifications for service as a Member of the House of Representatives. We lay down certain qualifications by law for various public offices which require peculiar skills.

July 17 President Kennedy announced that the final figures for the fiscal year ending June 30 showed an administrative budget deficit of $6.2 billionor $2.6 billion less than estimated in January 1963. The administration cited increased sales of Governmentowned financial assets. expenditure reductions. and increased Federal tax collections as the three primary reasons for reduction in the size of the deficit. However. neither the Presidential statement nor the joint statement issued by Treasury Secretary Dillon and Budget Director Gordon the next day. made any mention of the original fiscal 1963 budget estimate made In January 1962. It should be recalled that at that time the administration predicted a 1963 budget surplus of $463 million. Contrasting the final results to the original estimates casts an entirely different light on the administrations fiscal performance over the past year. I have had a table prepared comparing the original budget estimates with the final figures for fiscal 1963. I ask unanimous consent that this tablebe includ d in the RECORD at the conclusion of my remarks. The table shows that despite the administrations claim to have made widespread expenditure reductions. spending actually increased $53 million over the original estimate. The major increases were in the Agriculture Department. which.spent $1 billion more than originally estimated. Post Office expenditures increased by nearly a half a billion dollars. Interest on the public debtwas $9.8 billion. $600 million more than estimated in January It is interesting to note that military and space expenditures. which the administration generally cites as the primary reason for higher overall spending totals. were actually lower than originally estimated. This means that domestic spendingprincipally for- agricultureincreased sharply over the year. Also. the Presidents report emphasized increased tax collections. Although the amount of revenue collected during the second half of the year Is in excess of January 1963 expectations. we should note that receipts for the entire year were $6.6 billion below the January 1962 estimate. Mr. Speaker. the original January 1962 budget figures should be borne in mind when evaluating the administrations budgetary performance during the past year. On this basis. the administration turned a predicted surplus of half a billion dollars into a $6.2 billion deficit. and this would have been worse except for large sales of Governmentowned financial assets.

I rise in support of the bill. H.R. 10904. making appropriations for the Departments of Labor. and Health. Education. and Welfare for the fiscal year 1963. I rise. too. Mr. Chairman. to commend and congratulate the gentleman from Rhode Island and members of his subcommittee for the fine job that they have done on this bill and for the fine job that they do year after year as they bring this annual LaborHEW appropriations bill to the House. I find the work of this subcommittee is always scholarly and factual. As the author of a substantial portion of the legislation funded by this bill. I would like to comment upon certain aspects of the bill. I was glad to see that the committee forcefully and correctly stated on page 7 of the report. with reference to the Rural Library Services Act that This program has developed into one of the best programs of the Federal Government. The bill carries $71/2 million for the library program which is the total amount authorized for this year. This is a far cry from the day in 1950. when we failed to pass the Library Services Act by a record vote in the House. It is a far cry from the early years of the act when we could almost -never get anything like the full authorized appropriations. Yet. the rural library services program has. in fact. developed into one of the best programs of the Federal Government. and it is one that the House of Representatives itself can be proud of. Library programs in the Nation are. of course. growing and I agree with the committee that it is now time that the legislative committee look into the needed library situations that exist in other areas all around the country. I. myself. was very surprised to learn just a few years ago that library facilities in American junior and elementary schools are almost nonexistent. There is much that yet needs to be done in connection with providing books for the American people. I often like to think that man has built nothing that has outlived books. When television came on 10 or 15 years ago. there were many who said that television would supplant the use of the library. Such is not the case. The American people are using their libraries much more now than they did 10 or even 5 years ago. I have always supported and worked for vocational education. and I am happy to see that this bill increases the practical nurses training program from $4 million to $5 million. which is the maximum amount authorized by the basic legislation and thereby adds $1 million to the overall appropriation for vocational education for this year. The bill before us includes about $230 million for educational activities under the National Defense Education Act and among other things adds about $15 million to the amount appropriated for loans for college students. This student loan program has been eminently successful. Just a few days ago. it was called to my attention that a study had been made of 30.246 borrowers. and the study found that in about 90 percent of the instances the loans to students of ability and ambition had meant the difference of whether or not they could obtain a college education. I am happy to note that the committee took note of the fact that eminent witnesses before the committee stated that the National Defense Education Act has contributed more to education in this Nation than any other recently enacted program. The bill also carries funds for the expansion of teaching in the education of our mentally retarded children and expansion of teaching in the education of the deaf and an increase of about $81/2 million for grants to the States. on a matching basis. for rehabilitating the physically and mentally handicapped -people of America. As one of the authors of Public Law 565 in 1955. I am proud to see that we as a nation are proceeding to our goal of doubling the number of people who can be rehabilitated to employment. My recollection is that in the year 1955. we were rehabilitating 60.000 in this country. With the money provided by this bill. it is estimated that in the year 1963 we will rehabilitate about 110.000. This is a program in which the Government receives approximately $10 in return for every $1 spent on the program itself. There are other programs with which I have been closely associated that are included in this bill. I again want to congratulate the committee on the fine job it has done. This very afternoon the Alabama League of Municipalities is meeting in Mobile. Ala.. and I was one of the speakers invited to attend that meeting. I wanted very badly to be in Mobile. but my deep concern for these programs with which I have been so closely connected throughout my congressional service impelled me to be here this afternoon and to make this statement about them. and in their behalf."},{"1":"1961","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I have been concerned about the income of our Wisconsin farmers for a long time.

In deference to the President of the United States and other responsible American officials. who were charged with the safety of this visitor while he remained in this country. the Members of Congress had preserved the dignity of this House by restraining themselves from commenting too freely on Mikoyans visit. But lest our silence be interpreted as tacit approval of the chicanery which Mikoyan practiced during his tour through the United States I have asked permission to discuss Mikoyans visit. and this the House has graciously granted. In viewing his whirlwind trip through the United States in retrospect. perhaps it is just as well that we withheld our comment. for it was not until the last day of his stay here. when. he finally reached the full realization that he had failed in his mission of deceit. that we saw the real Anastas Mikoyan emerge. We can now judge his visit more objectively. The American press. radio. and particularly television afforded millions of Americans an opportunity to see firsthand how this master of deception parried questions put to him by newspapermen. who time and again merely attempted to establish the true motives of the Soviet Union in the cold war. I had some serious misgivings about Mikoyans trip to this country. He started out very strong. and it appeared that this Machiavellian monster was making a great impression on the American people. But as his hypocrisy began to show through. as he became increasingly aware that demonstrations which greeted him all along the route. protesting his visit. were not isolated acts of hostile refugees. but were. in fact. an expression reflecting the sentiments of a major segment of the American people. his composure began to diminish. It reached its lowest ebb on his final day here when. obviously irritated because he had failed in his mission to ease trade barriers and renew credit to the Soviet Union. he assailed the U.S. State Department for refusing to end the cold war. - Mikoyans criticism of the American press. and in particular his verbal attack against members of the television panel who had so successfully exposed him for the faker that he really is. clearly indicated how unyielding is the mind of a Communist. Perhaps the crushing blow to his deception was the stern warning from a great former President. Mr. Truman. who cautioned against tourist diplomacy. Mikoyan was particularly bitter toward Mr. Truman because he realized that this great American. who had personally experienced considerable Soviet treachery. reminded the American people that the Kremlin mob has used the same bunk. which Mikoyan tried to peddle in America. for the past 14 years purely to feed its Soviet propaganda mills. It must have been very clear to Mr. Mikoyan. when the time for his departure arrived. that he had not fooled all of us in America. I think that even those misguided industrialists. who for reasons best known to themselves wined and dined Mikoyan. today realize the sweet talk he dispensed at their elaborate luncheons and dinners was nothing more than a facade to soften American resistance against communism. These American industrialists need only be reminded that Mikoyan wanted relaxation of trade barriers and renewal of substantial credits to Russia so that the Soviet Union may again compete with American industry for world markets. How long do these American industrialists think this Nation can survive economically with our high standard of living when the Communists build their industrial potential through the use of slave labor? In his final interview. Mr. Mikoyan tried to create the impression that. based on the pleasant reception he received in many quarters. the people of America do not agree with their Governments decision not to be pushed around by the Soviet Union. There may be honest differences of opinion among many Americans as to the real value bf Mikoyans visit to this country. but I believe it would be a tragic mistake on the part of this Soviet charlatan to interpret the traditional good manners of most Americans as a sign that they do not agree with the policy makers both in this Congress and in the executive branch. This man. who had engineered the blood bath in Hungary and miscalculated the dedication of the heroic Hungarians to the principles of freedom. this man. who continues naively to believe that the Communists ultimately can crush the traditional ties to liberty in Poland. Czechoslovakia. Lithuania. and other satellite countries. would. indeed. be making a tragic mistake if he left this country thinking that we Americans are divided on the question of firm resistance to Communist intrigue or aggression. As one Washington newspaper put it in a recent editorial. Americans who saw Mr. Mikoyans performance on television Sunday will know that no words will make any impression on him if he has so confused our traditional friendliness. curiosity. and courtesy for softheadedness. But courtesy does not mean that Mikoyans lies during his tour of the United States should go unanswered. It is within the framework of Mikoyans deception that I sometimes find it difficult to understand how those who want a greater exchange of Soviet tourist diplomats believe we can find a solution tc the cold war. Let us examine some of Mikoyans lies and attempt to set the record straight. Benignly. Mikoyan told one American audience that the Soviet Union is suspicious of the United States because Russia is surrounded by American military bases. He added. obviously for dramatic effect. Your guns are pointed at us. The answer to this Soviet deception is simplethere were no United States nor NATO bases pointing at Russia before the Kremlin ordered the scuttling of all wartime agreements. before Russia tried to drag Turkey and Greece behind the Iron Curtain. before the Communist coup in Czechoslovakia. before the Red hordes raped our gallant wartime alliesPoland. Lithuania. Estonia. Latvia. Hungary. Rumania. before the Soviet division of Germany. before the Sovietsponsored war in Korea. Those American bases can be liquidated overnight. and our $10 billion defense budget can become only a tragic dream anytime the Kremlin gangsters decide they want to conduct themselves in accordance with standards accepted by civilized nations. Another Mikoyan statement: Could we forget the past and start all over? The brazen audacity of this butcher of Hungary in making such a suggestion is actually overpowering. Does he want to forget the millions of innocent people now living in Communist slavery? Does he want to forget the 20.000 Hungarians massacred on his own orders during the Hungarian revolt? Back home we have an old saying: Fool me once. shame on you. fool me twice. shame on me. Bringing it closer to home. here in Washington. those two monuments in front of the Archives building tell the story: One has the inscription. What is past is prologue. and the other states Study the past. I regret that Mikoyan did not stop to ponder this message during one of his walks along Pennsylvania Avenue. Perhaps he would better understand why we Insist that any new agreements with the Communists must be selfenforcible. This Nation has demonstrated repeatedly we are ready to start toward a just end of the cold war any time the Russians are willing. But we will never submit to the principle that peace must be gained at any price. Finally. there is one aspect of Mikoyans visit to this country which I am particularly anxious to call to the attention of my colleagues regarding cultural exchanges. or. as in the case of Mikoyan. tourist diplomacy: This is the respective coverage that we in America. in keeping with the highest tradition of a free press. have given to Communist visitors in the United States and the coverage our American visitors have been getting in the Soviet press in Moscow. A study which I hope to complete soon indicates that for the most part these socalled cultural exchanges are a oneway street. I should like to call your attention to how the Communist press treats our American visitors who go to Russia. We had had in recent months some very capable observers who went there in the hope of getting a firsthand view of the Soviet Union and to perhaps convey to the Russian people Americas traditional dedication to peace. It might interest the Members of the House to know that only those statements which could be construed as friendly to the Soviet Union were reported in the tightly controlled Soviet press. Mikoyan. in his television interview. said the reason Soviet newspapers do not give the same type of extensive coverage as does the American press is because their papers are much smaller. I submit. ladies and gentlemen. that this is brazen hypocrisy. Mikoyan. better than anyone else. knows the Kremlin would not dare to tell the Russian people the truth about Americas peaceful aims. A study of Soviet newspapers regarding recent visits of outstanding Americans to the Soviet Union presents perhaps the best proof of how the Moscow rulers fear to tell the truth to their pepole. The Soviet press gave 25 words to Mr. Stevensons visit with Gromyko. 125 words on Mr. Stevensons visit to the U.S.S.R.. 100 words about Mr. Stevensons visit to Novosibirsk. and only 3 lines describing Senator HUMPHREYS 8hour visit with Khrushchev. Not a word was mentioned about the Minnesota Senators statement regarding Americas sincere desire to end the cold war. I might add. Pravda has yet to print the article Senator HUMPHREY submitted regarding Americas efforts to end the cold war. Copies of Soviet papers that have arrived here indicate many of Mikoyans statements in the United States admitting mistakes of Soviet leaders are being carefully screened from Russian readers. obviously to avoid destroying the myth of invincibility of Soviet leaders forced upon the Russian people. The Soviet press has very carefully avoided reporting President Eisenhowers appeal that Mikoyan be treated courteously in this country. This omission obviously was designed to keep the Russian people from knowing that not all Americans greeted Mikoyan with enthusiasm. It is obvious from studying the Soviet press that Russian newspapers report only those speeches made by Americans in Russia which are favorable to the Soviet Union. and whenever there is a particularly good story favorable to the Soviet Union. the papers do not hesitate to increase their issues to six pages. instead of the usual four. Mikoyans rejoinder that this blockout of true American expression is due to the lack of space is most unconvincing. In my 20 years as a journalist. I have frequently had to boil down a story to three or four paragraphs and still get the true and pertinent facts into that limited space. I submit that those who argue so convincingly for extending cultural relations with the Soviet Union give some serious thought to this problem. We can. at least. seriously question the real value of these exchanges when the millions of Russian people are being kept in the dark about what our American visitors are saying in Russia. and I think that perhaps until the Soviet Union is willing to agree to permit our American visitors access to the Soviet press. just as we in this country give Russian visitors full access to our press. there shall always remain a shadow of doubt about the wisdom of this entire program. I submit. my friends. that Mikoyans visit to this country was a failure. and it would not surprise me to see him drawn into the limbo of fallen Soviet leaders. simply because he could not beguile the great American people. Entertain them? Yes. that he didbut beguile them? I doubt it. At least. I feel reasonably certain that he did not fool the people of the llth District in Illinois. About the only conclusion that can be drawn from Mikoyans visit to the United States is that the road to a lasting peace is still a very difficult one. At least by seeing this master deceiver firsthand the American people have had an opportunity to judge for themselves how utterly impossible it is to even try to do business with the Communists."},{"1":"1958","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the last word. Mr. Chairman. it has become evident during the course of debate that few major changes in this bill are likely to be adopted this afternoon. The sad truth seems to be that we must rely on the conferees to strengthen the bill. By failing to make changes on the floor we are in effect abdicating our responsibility. but it is obviously impossible to reach agreement on controversial issues. In fact it is impossible even to discuss all these issues. some of them highly agreeable. adequately in the time allotted. For that reason. Mr Chairman. I should like to call attention to certain serious weaknesses in the bill. There is. for example. nothing in the bill now to indicate that reports must be true. accurate and complete. There are no penalties for giving false reports and nothing to compel publication of accurate reports. True. the reports must be sworn to. and perhaps also section 1001 of title 18 of the United States Code may be applicable. Nonetheless I should prefer to see this omission of language corrected. So too there is no provision for penalties for embezzlement. stealing. or unlawful conversion of funds. If we are to protect the beneficiaries of these funds from large embezzlements such as have occurred we obviously need to supplement State statutes in this field. So too. it seems to me. it should be made a felony to give or receive kickbacks. gifts. or things of value. in an effort to influence action of key officials in these plans. In section 7 of the bill there is a technical deficiency which needs to be corrected. As now drafted administrators must furnish certain information regarding insurance and trust fund operations which they may not have. They might nonetheless be penalized for not furnishing this information. Surely. it should be provided. as it is over in S. 2888. that any insurance carrier must submit information within a fixed period which an administrator must report. Finally. Mr Chairman. I should like to mention again the need for defining a reasonable and responsible rule for the Department of Labor. Surely. the Secretary could help Congress by evaluating reports which come to him. Surely he could provide real assistance to beneficiaries if he could proceed against an administrator upon the written request of the beneficiary that there has been a violation of the regulations. So too it might be advisable to consider the value of authorizing the Secretary to conduct investigations with respect to violations of the proposed legislation. As it stands now the bill has. no adequate remedy from the standpoint of effective law enforcement. I feel also that the Secretary should be authorized to prescribe the forms on which the required information is to be submitted. Without some uniformity the very protection which the bill is designed to provide will be protected."},{"1":"1957","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. perforce as a Member of the legislative branch of the American Government I can entertain no legal objections to the meeting of the President with any head of state of any foreign country. but in the light of King Sauds visit next Tuesday to the United States. it might be well to point up at this seasonal time the Senates previously enacted resolution which called on the various friendly nations not to discriminate against any segment or nationality of American citizenry. The record indicates that American Jewish soldiers in the American forces have been separated from the regiments to avoid possible humiliation when their groups became stationed in Saudi Arabia. Second. American Jewish visitors and business people have been arbitrarily deprived of the right of entry to that country. King Saud. in paying respects to our country should pay them to one and all. His visit should not be at the sacrifice of any American principle and it occurs to me that this would be an appropriate moment for our great President of the United States to implement in his conversations while working with King Saud. the nobility of the American tradition and the American stand for fair treatment. The finest possible way for us to demonstrate our way of life is to insure his meeting representatives of all our peopleJews. Catholics. and Protestants. labor as well as business. We are proud of the fact that we can live together. in the United States. as a whole people striving for ever greater racial and religious harmony. We have before us a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate that fact. I trust that the State Department. in its concern for the antiSemitic sensibilities of our royal visitor. will not instruct its employees of Jewish faith to stay home from work so as to avoid offending King Saud during his visit. It would be a national disgrace if American honor was compromised in this instance."},{"1":"1956","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I wish to serve notice that -when that resolution comes up I shall discuss it in some detail.

I shall not undertake to discuss the technical provisions of the pending bill. They will for a long time and at length be incorporated in the decisions that will emanate from the tax and other courts of the country. I should. however. like to devote just a few moments to refer to an obvious omission in the pending bill. an omission that I might point up by reading a few paragraphs from the very learned decision of Mr. Justice Radish in the mythical case of Haddock and others against the Board of Inland Revenue. written by A. P. Herbert. English barrister and onetime member of the House of Commons. in Mr. Herberts Uncommon Law. Mr. Justice Radish first sets forth the Issues in the case as follows: The appellant in this case is a Mr. Albert Haddock. a pertinacious litigant whom we are always glad to see. And let me say that it gives me pleasure to see the Commissioners. so often and for such poor cause the initiators of litigation. for once upon their defense. Mr. Haddock asks for a declaration that he is. and has been for some years. entitled to certain allowances or deductions for incometax purposes under the heading of (a) expenses and (b) wear and tear of machinery and plant. and on the assumption that he is right he claims that a considerable sum is owing to him in respect of past years in which the Commissioners have refused to grant him such allowances. Mr. Haddock appears on behalf of the whole body of authors. artists. and composers. and the position of a large number of creative brainworkers will be affected by our decision. His disposition of the wear and tear Issue appears then in the following statement: Next. as to wear and tear. One of the constant disadvantages of the authors trade is that he is a oneman business. at once his own employer. designer. technician. machineminder. and machine. Once the soap manufacturer has equipped and organized his factory he may relax. a weeks holiday. a months illness will not suspend the output of his soap or the growth of his income. But when the author stops. the machine stops. and the output stops. He is unable. on holiday. in sickness. or in age. to depute his functions to any other person. Here is one more reason why a hundred pounds earned by the author should not be treated and taxed on the same terms as a hundred pounds accruing as profit to the soap manufacturer. Yet. says Mr. Haddock. since this is done. let it be done thoroughly and logically. The authors machinery and plant are his brain and his physique. his fund of inventiveness. his creative powers. These are not inexhaustible. they are seldom rested (for the reasons given above). the strain upon them increases as the years go by. and in some cases. I understand. is aggravated by late hours and dissipation. If it Is proper for the soap manufacturer to be relieved in respect of the wear and tear of his machinery and the renewal thereof (which money can easily buy) how much more consideration is owing to the delicate and irreplaceable mechanism of the writer. Under this head Mr. Haddock has repeatedly appealed for relief in respect of sums expended on doctors accounts. on sunlight treatment. on nourishing foods and champagne. and upon necessary holidays at Monte Carlo and Cowes. The Commissioners have refused. and I find that they were wrong. Under both heads. therefore. Mr. Haddocks appeal succeeds. He estimates that if his expenses be properly calculated on the basis already explained he has never yet made a taxable profit. for at the end of every year of his literary operations he has been a little more in debt than the year before. In every year. therefore. he has been wrongly assessed and unlawfully taxed. and I order the Commissioners to reopen the accounts for the past 7 years and repay to Mr. Haddock the very large sums owing to him. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Haddocks plight is the plight of every professional and selfemployed person in this country. the great body of millions of people who either cannot by law or who chose not to operate under the corporate form of business. Pending legislation before the great Ways and Means Committee embodied in bills introduced by the gentleman from Ohio . the gentleman from Georgia . and the gentleman from Alabama . would cure the obvious defects that are apparent in our existing tax law and continued under this proposed revision bill. affecting a body of 10 million people who represent one of the most important segments of our American economy. I sincerely trust. Mr. Chairman. that this legislation will soon be at the top of the agenda of our great committee. Mr. Chairman. meaning not to add to the discomfort of the sponsors of the pending bill. I think it fair that I remind them that in October of 1952 in a very strong and unequivocal statement the then candidate. the present great President of the United States. endorsed the principles of this legislation that would forever correct the sad. sad plight of the Mr. Haddocks of America. the men and the women who deserve consideration in their efforts to obtain legislation which would permit them to set up restricted. taxdeferred. voluntary retirement systems. For the quotation from Justice Radishs opinion. I am indebted to John E. Laughlin. Jr.. of Pennsylvania in his article. Tax Treatment of Retirement Plans which appeared in the National Public Accountant. the organ of the National Society of Public Accountants. for November 1953."},{"1":"1953","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. as a freshman Member of Congress I want to commend the author and cosponsors of this most praiseworthy legislation. When I came to Congress on January 3 I did not know. as I am sure most people in the Nation still do not know. that there is no place in the Capitol Building where one can commune in holy solitude with his Maker. I was told that the reason was the fear that the establishment of such a place would contravene the traditional American concept of separation of church and state. To my mind that fear is wholly unfounded. The concept of separation is based on the maxim that the Government should not either champion or oppose any particular religious faith to the exclusion of the others. and. conversely. the church should not attempt to dictate the political structure of the Government. The sanctuary which this legislation will establish will be completely nonsectarian and nondenominational. It will not be. and should not be. a large assembly hall through which demagogues and hypocrites can parade their religion. Rather. it will be a small. simple. sanctified retreat. midway between the Senate and House Chambers. to which the elected Representatives of the people. in the discharge of their sometimes awesome and bewildering responsibilities. may repair for meditation and prayer. Except the Lord build the house. they labor in vain that build it. except the Lord keep the city. the watchman waketh but in vain."},{"1":"1952","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. the purpose of this amendment is to increase this appropriation by $200.000. If that is done it will complete the floodcontrol project at New Albany. Ind. I was very pleased to hear Mr. Davis state during general debate that it was the policy of the committee that when a project had been started they considered it good business to allocate sufficient money to finish that project. It will take $331.000 to complete this project. The committee has allocated only $131.000. That means that $200.000 more is necessary to complete it. With this $131.000 and what has already been appropriated. the sum of $5.800.000 will have been appropriated for this project. and. as I said before. it will take only $200.000 to complete it. Let me hasten to state that this project has nothing to do with the generation of electric power. and there is nothing in it for the housing of defense workers or other people. the only thing that is involved is a floodcontrol wall around the city of New Albany. a city with a population of 35.000 situated across the Ohio River from Louisville. This project was started 3 or 4 years ago. Large delegations have come down here from Indiana interested in this project. I hope the gentleman from Michigan will not accuse me of being parochial. but we have only two projects in Indiana. We somehow feel that this is our new land. We feel rather bad. to have this one project taken away from us. especially when it is so close to being completed. I know the Government Is not going to spend the sum of $5.800.000 and then not complete the project. That would be expensive. The project has been started and it is scheduled to be finished this fall. Taking the men off the work. taking the machinery away and bringing it back. and letting new contracts. will cost more money. Possibly the cost of materials and labor will go up by that time. So it would be good economy. I think. when the men are on the job and they have gone as far as they have. to complete this project. This extra $200.000 will buy pumps. I know that. if a flood should come. the Government will bring in portable pumps and pump the sewage and flood water out of there if the necessity arose. However. that would mean you would spend more money on this proposition. still without building permanent protection. The budget request for this project was $631.000. The committee has allowed the sum of $131.000. Even with my amendment to add $200.000. I am asking that $300.000 less than the budget estimate be appropriated. I understand one of the reasons that the committee cut this down was because $500.000 already appropriated has not been expended. but that money will be expended within the next 2 or 3 months. as I understand. That amount of money. together with what I am asking to be appropriated. Is necessary to carry out this project. It would not save any money to deny this sum because I know the project is going to be completed in future years. It is sound economy to go ahead and finish this project now. and it is in accordance with the plan of the engineers. I hope that the committee will agree to this amendment. I am certain that an amendment of this kind will save money and that it is good business. There has been some talk about letting the Senate complete the work. but I do not know why the House cannot write Its own bill. Mr. Chairman. I hope my amendment will be agreed to."},{"1":"1951","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. section 601 of H. R. 3880 will require that all Federal employees who receive 26 days annual leave use this entire amount during fiscal 1952 or forfeit the unused portion. A similar provision appeared in the omnibus appropriation measure considered by this House last year. Following its enactment. we have now had an opportunity to observe during the past year the effect of this provision on Federal employees and the results of the restriction on the operations of various Federal agencies. All of us are aware of the tremendous speedup in the activity of Federal Government agencies as a result of the present international situation. Difficulty in recruiting personrl combined with the rapidly increasing workload has required many supervisors to refuse their employees the 26 days annual leave permitted by law during fiscal 1951. The result is that many of these workers are approaching the end of the current fiscal year with the prospect of forfeiting at least several days of the 26 allowed. This is particularly true in those agencies most closely identified with the present vital defense effort. It should be emphasized that approximately 50 percent of all Federal employees are today contributing to the defense effort as employees of defense agencies and that their services are absolutely indispensable to the success of this effort. In some instances. the spirit of devotion exhibited by the employees has resulted in their failure to request the 26 days permitted In order to accomplish the work at hand. For this they are now and if section 601 Is enacted. will continue to incur a penalty for such devotion to their jobs. The inequity developing from this position is further emphasized by the fact that employees working in agencies whose normal workload continues as heretofore. can afford to have their workers take the full 26 days leave during the designated 12month period. Agencies. on the other hand. which cannot afford such a policy because of their spiraling workload must penalize their faithful employees by requiring them to lose completely the unused portion of their annual leave. There is currently pending before the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of this body a bill to repeal section 1212 of Public Law 759. Eightyfirst Congress. which section is identical with that under consideration today. It is certainly appropriate that the committee charged with the cognizance of compensation for Federal employees. including their annual and sickleave benefits under the official rules of this House. should be given an opportunity to consider fully the legislation before it and to report thereon before this body takes final action on the proposal contained in section 601 of H. R. 3880. Furthermore. the chairman of the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service during the early days of this session appointed a special subcommittee on Federal civilian manpower and employee utilization. Included in the scope of the committees work is a study of the necessity for revising current annualleave laws of Federal employees. The work of this subcommittee is progressing. It would be highly inappropriate for this body to enact section 601 of the present bill without first having received the benefit of the considered judgment of the special subcommittee charged with this responsibility. In this connection it is significant to note that a similar investigation is currently under way by the Post Office and Civil Service Committee of the Senate. It is my considered opinion that favorable action on section 601 of H. R. 3880 should be deferred until the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service has had an opportunity to present a complete report."},{"1":"1950","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself 25 minutes. Mr. Chairman. this chapter deals with annual appropriations for the Department of Labor. the Federal Security Agency. the National Labor Relations Board. the National Mediation Board. the Railroad Retirement Board. and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. for the fiscal year 1951. The subcommittee in charge is composed of my distinguished colleagues. the gentleman from West Virginia . the gentleman from New York . and the gentleman from Wisconsin . and the gentleman from Kansas . We started hearings on the estimates of appropriations on January 9. 1950. and we sat for about a month and a half nearly every day. listening to the testimony of the various officials who appeared in support of the requests. asking questions. seeking information as to the basis of and need for the funds sought. I do not believe that in my 10 years in Congress I have ever worked with a more conscientious or a more industrious group of Members than we have on this particular Subcommittee on Appropriations. Their attendance at the committee meetings was 100 percent. They were there at all times. We met at 10 oclock in the morning and sat until 12:30. we resumed again at 2 oclock and sat until 4:30 or 5:30 every day. After we had completed the hearings. we sat down and marked up the chapter now before us today. With two or three exceptions. I think we have done a good Job. It was a job that took a great deal of time and a job that was not an easy one to do. I know it would have been more difficult to come to you today with the recommendations in this chapter if we had not had the services of what I personally believe is one of the best clerks in the House at the present time. that Is our clerk. Mr. Paul Wilson. assigned to this subcommittee. I think this is one of the most difficult chapters of the appropriation bill to handle. It has more public appeal. in my opinion. than any other part of the appropriation bill. I know it is one of the most difficult chapters in which to show economy. for out of total budget estimates of $2.462.072.500. $1.794.000.000. or about 72 percent. appropriation is involved in just two items. One item. $1.200.000.000 for publicassistance grants to States. we have no control over at all. The basic statute controls this appropriation. The other large amount over which we have no control is $594.000.000. representing the net appropriation of specific railroad retirement tax collections to the retirement trust fund. Then there are certain other grants to States in the Federal Security Agency over which we have practically no control over at all. About 93 percent of the estimates for the Federal Security Agency are for grants and benefit payments of one kind or other. So you can see by analyzing the makeup and nature of the items and then comparing the amounts with the total recommended reductions. as set out in the report. that this subcommittee was very economyminded in reporting this chapter of the bill to the House. In fact. I must say that it was so economyminded that the committee cut more out of the bill than I as chairman liked. I know that amendments will be offered this afternoon. or tomorrow. to increase certain items under the Public Health Service. I shall support these amendments. because in good conscience I cannot go along with the cuts that the majority of the committee made in the markup of the bill. When these amendments are offered to the Public Health Service it is my intention as chairman of the subcommittee to support them. The first part of the chapter is the Labor Department. The totals for this Department show a rather large increase over a year ago. but the responsibility for that increase rests on the action of the Congress in transferring the Bureau of Employment Security from the Federal Security Agency to the Labor Department. This accounts for about $184.000.000 of this chapter. The budget estimates for the Department of Labor for 1951 total $220.014.700. The committee has seen fit to cut this total by $11.441.600. The largest item of appropriation in this particular section of the bill deals with grants to States for the Bureau of Employment Security. The bill includes $178.500.000 for these grants. which is a reduction of $9.500.000 below the estimate of $188.000.000. but it is an increase of $10.500.000 above the present 1950 appropriations. This. however. is something over which we have practically no control. As you know. a Federal tax of threetenths of 1 percent is levied on the pay rolls of covered employers to finance the administration of the employment security system in the States. This tax more. than covers the appropriation recommended. in fact. since the program has been in existence the Federal Government had made a profit of over $800.000.000 on this tax of threetenths of 1 percent on all pay rolls covered. I believe the figures this year will be that if we appropriate the $178.500.000 recommended. there will still be a profit of perhaps $20.000.000 to $30.000.000 or so accruing to the Federal Treasury from the tax. depending of course on the amount collected. The reason for the appropriation increase allowed is because of the steady trend of unemployment throughout the country. The covered and eligible unemployed have to be paid. and it takes personnel to pay them. In States like Rhode Island and some other New England States especially that have been hit by unemployment in the past year we are finding difficulty now in keeping our funds solvent because of the tremendous unemployment that we have in that region. In a case like that where we have a lot of unemployment. it means at times that the Employment Service s neglected because they have to take some of the personnel from the Employment Service and use them in the unemployment insurance part of that program. Excluding the employment security grants the bill carries only about $30.000.000 for all the other items of the .Department. Several of the new proposed programs that were initially approved and presented by the budget the committee has refused to go along with. These other items are about $6.639.000 above the comparable amount appropriated in.1950. Approximately 70 percent of that increase is attributable to the 1949 amendments to the Federal wageandhour law and approximately 7 percent is due to increased cost arising from the last payraise law. The other large item of increase is $874.000 or about 13 percent of the total. for the comprehensive revision of the costofliving index undertaken with a special appropriation that this committee granted a year ago. I may say in that regard that the price index revision is only a 3year program. We gave the initial appropriation a year ago. They are asking for their second years appropriation this year to continue that revision program and we have assurances from the Secretary of Labor that the program will come to an end in the fiscal year 1952. For the Office of Secretary we are allowing $1.382.000. or a reduction of $38.000. There were two new jobs requested for the Office of International Labor Affairs and these two new positions were refused. It seems to be the consensus of opinion of this committee that we are getting too much into international affairs. Practically all through this appropriation bill we have cut down the budget estimates for any increase that deals with international affairs. The Office of Solicitor shows quite a large increase. but the vast majority of that increase is due to the amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act passed by this Congress last year. We have cut those increases in the neighborhood of 25 percent. We have cut the overall increase for the Wage and Hour Division that administers the Fair Labor Standards Act by that overall amount of about 25 percent because this is the first year of operation under the new 75cent minimumwage law. They asked for an increase of practically 100 percent. The committee has seen fit to cut the increase by 25 percent. The Bureau of Labor Standards remains practically the same. We cut $35.000 from their request. There is no change in the request for the Bureau of Apprenticeship. Two million seven hundred and eightyeight thousand dollars has been allowed. The Bureau of Employment Security. as I said before. asked for an increase of $20.000.000 over the present appropriation for grants. The committee did not see fit to go along with all of this. as I have indicated. As you will no doubt recall. a year ago this committee instituted something new in the Bureau of Employment Security. We set up in the bill a socalled contingency fund to deal with unforeseen salary raises in the various States and unavoidable and unforeseeable employment work loads. We set up a 5percent contingency fund. The Bureau of the Budget this year allowed a 10percent contingency fund. but the committees thought that. in view of the fact that they were not able to work for a full fiscal year under this new program. that we would cut the contingency fund to a basis of 5 percent of the total appropriation. so we have cut that part of the appropriation by $8.500.000. As to the Bureau of Labor Statistics we show a reduction of $270.000 below the budget request of $5.990.700. We have cut out practically every new program or expansion that was requested for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the Womens Bureau we have allowed an increase of seven positions. not to reestablish the various field offices that were cut out 3 years ago. but we have in effect allowed these positions here in Washington so that the various sections of the country could be serviced by these five or six representatives going out into the various regional districts in the country for the next fiscal year. That is one of the smallest units in the Department of Labor. and it only employs 65 people at the present time. One of the largest increases. which I referred to before. is in the Wage and Hour Division and arises from the amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act. They asked for practically a 100percent increase in this appropriation. and the committee has cut this increase by about 25 percent. As to the Federal Security Agency. we have cut practically every item in it. and this is one of the agencies of Government that we do not have a unanimous report on from our own subcommittee. especially in the Public Health Service part of the bill. I think many Members who were here 4 or 5 years ago know the program that was initiated by my colleague. the ranking Republican member of this committee. the gentleman from Wisconsin . because of his interest in the health of the people of our Nation. in initiating construction activities. in initiating construction of the research center out here in Bethesda which has cost the Government in the neighborhood of fiftyfive to sixty million dollars. but will be completed in July of 1952. and when completed will be. without a doubt. the best and the most modern research clinical facility in the world. It will be something that every person in our country can well be proud of. and this is a program that. even though the gentleman from Wisconsin and I have differed on various other matters in this bill. we have seen eye to eye for the past 4 years on all of these appropriations dealing with the Public Health Service. This committee. under the direction of the gentleman from Wisconsin . also 3 years ago instituted a new program for appropriating money for research facilities and building laboratories and clinical facilities in aiding medical colleges and research institutes throughout the country in trying to make progress in the fight against the two leading causes of deathheart disease and cancer. Also. the program of trying to make some progress against mental illnesses which afflict millions of our people. We have seen those programs progress for the past. 3 years. and in my humble opinion this is one of the best programs that this Government has ever initiated because it affects nearly every man and woman in every walk of life in our country in one degree or another. I do not believe there is a more popular program existing in our Government than the program which was initiated by this committee 3 or 4 years ago in these three fieldsmental health. heart. and cancer. The results are tremendous. To my mind. the results are something I cannot adequately produce to you today because I do not have the words available to express my opinion on the good these programs have accomplished for all the people. not only of this country but all the world. and the tremendous strides that have been made since this committee instituted this program only three or four short years ago. It is in view of this that an amendment will be offered to restore to the hospital construction program the $75.000.000 cut out by the committee. I will support that amendment. and I hope the House will agree to it. I know there will be three or four other amendments to continue the program on which this committee without fail during the past 3 or 4 years has been practically unanimous in its decisions to carry on the great work. especially in the construction of facilities that deal with mental health. heart. and cancer. When those amendments are offered. I will support them. I sincerely hope the House will see fit to carry on the work this committee has been initially responsible for. I will guarantee you that it will be money not wasted. because I am sure that if you talk to any medical scientist or any medical doctor they will all agree that we cannot do anything about these killers of humanity such as heart. cancer. and mental health. unless we find -the cause. In order to find the cause. we have to take the lead and appropriate money for research. It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to take that lead. because in taking that lead they are interesting various private groups all over the country to get together and raise money on a private basis and to work as a team. I honestly do not know of any other program of government that has such responsible agreement and wholehearted cooperation between the medical associations. private agencies. and the Federal Government. There are no areas of disagreement in the carrying out of this program. I sincerely hope the House will not allow this program to be stopped in its tracks as it is at the present time. I hope the House will in its wisdom and judgment see to it that we are allowed to carry on this program. and we will in that way be doing something for humanity not only in this country but in all the world. When we were considering the markup of this bill there were some items in the Federal Security Agency that I personally went along with cutting. because I hoped we might work out some agreement within the committee to carry on these health programs. There are such items as the vocationalrehabilitation program. I think that is one of the best programs of the Government. They paint a beautiful picture. and I think they are right. where they maintain that. for every dollar we appropriate for vocational rehabilitation. the Federal Treasury receives back $10 because of the rehabilitation of these people into useful work. They asked for an increase of $2.500.000. which we did not allow. I went along with that cut because I know thatin the overall program. with the necessity for economy. we have to cut down here and cut down there. and we try to come out with a balanced program and at the same time show some economy. As I say. that increase for vocational rehabilitation was not allowed. If I had thought for 1 minute that we could not have reached an agreement on these other items I for one would not have gone along with that cut and with cuts all along the line. There was a budget request of $7.300.000 to establish a research institute in Alaska which is going to be our fortyninth State. I think that is a responsibility of the Federal Government. We should do something to help that area of the country. But I went along with that cut in the name of economy in an attempt to work out an overall agreement on the bill. But all in all1 I believe we bring to you this afternoon a real showing of economy in the cuts we have made in this particular chapter. As I said in the beginning. the cuts in my estimation were too deep where they affected certain publichealth programs. To repeat. I will support the amendments which are going to be offered to increase the appropriations for the publichealth programs. not to increase them very much but to keep going a program which was begun and which has shown results. a program which every person who. is interested in the health of the people of our Nation should support. My feelings regarding these publichealth items are supported by testimony of some of the best medical scientists and doctors not only of America but in the world who testified for the need of carrying on the research on heart. mental health. and cancer. Upon their testimony and upon theiP background knowledge of the subject I am willing to rest my case and go along with the increases."},{"1":"1949","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I am very familiar with the Wagner Labor Relations Act. I say to you that I do not recall a piece of legislation passed by the United States Congress that has brought about more confusion. It is seldom that I find myselfI do not know that I ever dofind myself in agreement with the gentleman from New York . certainly. not for the same reason. even though we might vote alike occasionally. But I must say that the gentleman from New York is consistent. he proceeds on the theory that there is a class war on in this country. I do not proceed on that theory. He proceeds. secondly. on the theory that confusion will weaken the adversary. and. thirdly. the thing that he thought would accomplish that more quickly and probably more adequately than anything else was the reinstatement of the National Labor Relations Act. and he offered such an amendment. The gentleman has the right to do that. he has the right to his opinions. and I want to say right here there is not a Member. whether on the right or on the left. with whom I have shown any impatience concerning their conscientious convictions. To every man I certainly would accord the privilege of being absolutely sincere and standing by his convictions. and I believe the American people do the same thing. The responsibility. nevertheless. rests upon us to pass this bill. to pass legislation. If amendments be necessary to the TaftHartley Act. and I subscribe to the theory that they are. then let us work them out. but. in the name of high heavens. not the Sims bill. for at one stroke of the pen by referring to statute number and page number of the United States statute law it reenacts about 4.500 words of statutory law that is not printed in the Sims substitute. and the Members are called upon to vote upon approximately 4.500 words of Federal law that does not appear in the language read by the Clerk as the Sims substitute. Mr. Chairman. I hope we vote down the Sims substitute and that we continue to use the Wood bill as a basis for writing this law. Let the House continue to work its will in an orderly legislative manner and perfect it in a manner that will be acceptable. I do not believe you can take the National Labor Relations Act and jumble it up with the Sims substitute and come out with an answer that will be satisfactory to anyone. That is my honest opinion. because I have been through the hearings on the National Labor Relations Board. It would be most interesting and enlightening if some of you were to take up the hearings on the National Labor Relations Act and read them. So. as my best Judgment. I think we should continue to consider the Wood bill and vote down the Sims proposed substitute bill."},{"1":"1948","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. at the outset of my brief remarks. I wish to express my appreciation for the action of the committee in having approved the total amount of money recommended for the construction of the Watauga Dam and the South Holston River Dam. As Representative from the First District of Tennessee. I am happy that the committee has seen fit to approve the amount of $15.142.000. which Is necessary for the continued construction and furtherance of the two dams which are located in the district which I have the honor and privilege to represent. The Tennessee Valley Authority Is a corporation created by act of Congress on May 18. 1933. It was established to improve navigation and to provide for flood control of the Tennessee River. to provide for reforestation and the proper use of marginal lands in the Tennessee Valley. to provide for the agricultural and industrial development of the valley. to provide for the national defense. and for other purposes. The Tennessee Valley Authority has accomplished these purposes by developing dams and reservoirs in the Tennessee River Basin and its tributaries. It has engaged in the generation of hydroelectric power. I have had an opportunity to observe the advancement and progress that has been brought about by the development of the Tennessee Valley Authority. There has been some question raised on the floor of this House concerning the power of the Congress to appropriate money to build a steam plant for the development and sale of power. In the early history of TVA many cases were brought into the courts of this country touching on different phases of the power program. The legal authority for the TVA has been established long ago by the Supreme Court of the United States. The legal battles have been fought out in the courts of America. and there is no question about the legal authority for the existence and continuity of the TVA. The constitutional authority to promote the general welfare in the interest of national defense is well established by the courts of this country. The original act was established for the purpose of flood control. navigation. soil conservation. national defense. and other powers incidental thereto. Under the Constitution. by implication and my implied powers. it follows that a Government corporation can do the necessary things that are incidental to the carrying out and completion of the program as provided and set out in the original act of Congress. It would seem to follow that it has long been recognized that TVA can sell surplus power to commercial establishments. and therefore. in order to keep a continuous flow of power. the erection of a steam plant within the area of the TVA is a logical. necessary. implied power of the TVA Act. It is necessary to have a secondary source of power in order to adequately supply the needs of the people of that great area. A steam plant will guarantee a continuous flow of power during a time when hydroelectric power may be curtailed in production because of dry weather or a drying up of the source of power of water in the dams which produces electric power. There is no new departure in this procedure. The Congress from time to time has appropriated money to develop the great highways of this country. We have developed the forests and waterways of America. The Congress has appropriated money to develop the rivers and harbors and canal service to accommodate the commerce flowing from the great cities. not only on the eastern seaboard. but throughout America. We as as a nation have encouraged the development of the great reclamation service of the West. which has produced fertile soil where fruits and vegetables and farm varieties now grow. which was at one time a place of poverty and wastelands. These great areas have been turned Into intensive and productive agricultural areas. all of which has added to the wealth of the West. Likewise I have seen great development in agriculture. soil. progress and happiness of the people In the Tennessee Valley. More than 5.000.000 people depend upon the TVA for power. A great area consisting of approximately seven States is affected by this great national development. We cannot. as a Congress. allow this great number of citizens to be deprived of the necessary power to run their industries. operate their factories. furnish power for their municipalities. for their farm organizations. nor should the people be denied the necessary amount of electric power to supply light and power in every rural home. Since the TVA Is situated in the general area where the TVA operates. then there is no other source of electric power. and It is up to the Congress to appropriate the necessary money to build and develop power facilities. which will guarantee a constant flow of power to meet the needs of the people in question. We are not dealing with a local problem. but it is one of national concern to everybody throughout this Republic. The Congress recently appropriated the necessary funds to create a 70group Air Force. We are living in a day and time when the maintenance of a large Air Force which can be supreme in the air is the best guarantee to our national security and proper defense. Electric power Is necessary to build up a strong Air Force. We must not forget that in this general area we have the atomicbomb plant at Oak Ridge. together with the aluminum plant at Alcoa. Holston Ordnance. and Tennessee Eastman at Kingsport. as well as the North American Rayon and Bemberg corporations at Elizabethton. Tenn. All of these industries played a vital part in the production of war material during World War II. We must not allow our supply of power to be depleted. and then at some future date find ourselves in need of a source of electric power. which we may not have if we do not take the necessary precautions now to produce power. The national defense of this country is not a sectional problem. It is true that some sections of America have more industries and more taxable property. and because of their ability and prosperity there naturally falls a heavier burden of taxation upon these people. but this Republic must be maintained and saved. and must be built strong and powerful. In time of danger men and women from Alabama. Kentucky. Tennessee. North Carolina. and other States fall in line alongside the people from New York. Connecticut. Illinois. Massachusetts. California. and Texas. as well as every State in the Union. to answer the call of our country. and rush to the defense of this Republic. There is no private utility in this great area that can give to the people the necessary power. and it is my conviction that -it is the responsibility of Congress to see that in the interest of the national wellbeing. that there is not a ceiling placed upon the progress and advancement of this great area in America."},{"1":"1947","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"If in the law we require substantial evidence on the entire record. then it seems to me that we not only meet the abuses of the past against employers. but make it infinitely more difficult to use the law improperly against the labor unions.

I am afraid I have worn my illustration threadbare talking about it. so I will only mention the valley in which I live. but Uncle Sam put about $12.000.000 into that great project. Today it is worth at least $70.000.000. What did it do 2 years ago? In 12 months it produced $30.000.000 worth of food and fiber. and in the following 12 months it produced more than that. going up on an average from $130 to $165 per acre annually in cash crops. That project has repaid most of its debts to the Government but is 5 years ahead in its repayment schedule. The people who live in Phoenix. Ariz.. and in the surrounding community based on this project pay in income tax every year more than Uncle Sam put into that investment in the beginning."},{"1":"1945","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. when mothers go into my Lowell office and cry because their sons have gone back to duty after they had come home on furlough because they could not get fed at home. it is a very tragic situation. These mothers and fathers have not seen the soldiers for a long time. yet they begged the men to go back where they could be fed. Mr. Chairman. it does not seem to me that legislation is going to be the solution of this whole food problem if the distribution of that food is not properly handled. I have talked with various officials in numerous departments of Government handling the food situation. and I have asked them no. to give me statistics. not what they are going to do some months from now. 6 months or a year or even 3 months from now. but I want act!on. I want food distributed to my district and to New England immediately. It is generally conceded that New England has been unfairly dealt with as far as the proper distribution of food is concerned. The people of Massachusetts are very bitter and they are very rebellious. Mr. Chairman. I want to read part of a letter that came to me today. which is a sample of other letters I am receiving. In part this letter states as follows: Last night a young dairy herd in Groton was stolen. and evidently loaded into trucks and spirited away. and 2 days ago six beef steers in this vicinity were stolen and taken away. Tonight and from now on the dairy herds in this vicinity will be protected by armed guards. The shooting will start at any moment now. There is stated something to the effect that it was planned. I am not going to say anything on that subject because I cannot think a rebellion has been planned. But people will have food. The people realize that in Canada you can buy meat. and all the meat you want. oil. fats. fish. and all the products that are needed to sustain life. while in our own country. in Lowell. Mass.. in my district. that cannot be done. For instance. my secretary told me that he went to a combined butchergrocery shop and tried to secure meat. He asked for eggs and for poultry. but could not get them. He tried to get fish and oil and butter and other fats. He could not get any of these commodities in that shop or in other shops. He could not get any sugar either. Then he thought he would have plain boiled potatoes. He could not secure potatoes to boil. I am informed that there were a thousand persons in a small shop in Lowell recently trying to secure food. In Canada they have all they want when our people are going hungry. England has taken better care of her people in distribution than has the United States. and Canada has done much better. There is no excuse for the faulty distribution of food in the United States. It must be corrected. and corrected at once. We are prohibited. I understand. from importing food from Canada while we are exporting or have been exporting meat to other countries. I understand that for 3 months now they are going to stop the exportation of meat. Why not bring in meat from Canada? I am told that in London I would be horrifiedand this comes from our own Americans who are thereif I could see the quantity and kind of food that is being sent over there. Canada is sending great quantities to UNRRA. and UNRRA does not function properly. We want to help the starving people of Europe. but I do not feel that it is our responsibility alone. Certainly we must prevent the people in our own country from starving. In my own district the people working in industry are becoming weakened because they are not receiving the proper kind of food. Certainly legislation will not help if the bungling in reference to the distribution of food continues."},{"1":"1944","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I might say I have inquired. since we secured our beachhead in Normandy. of 75 or 80 Members. and I assume perhaps 50 percent of them feel that the war will close before Labor Day. and all but 4 expressed the opinion that the war would come to an end in Europe this year."},{"1":"1943","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"I agree with what the gentleman said in reply to the gentleman from Tennessee but let me get this straight: It is not the gentlemans contention. is it. he is not arguing. is he. that incentive payments or soilconservation payments should be considered in the fixing of the parity formula?"},{"1":"1942","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Certainly. and the Senator has some bad examples.

I maintain that the majority of labor. the rank and file of labor. want something like this to protect them from the labor racketeers who have control of them today. I maintain that they are as loyal as the average young man who goes into the armed forces to fight the battles of his country. The gentleman from Illinois says that those who advocate this legislation have voted against all labor legislation. I challenge that statement. I say to the gentleman from Illinois that there is no man on the floor of this House. not excepting him. who has a better labor record than I have. I have never voted against a piece of legislation. the wagehour law not excluded. that was for the benefit of labor since I have been on the floor of this House.

I include the following address by General Markham. Chief of Engineers. United States Army. before the National Rivers and Harbors Congress. April 27. 1936: Mr. President. ladies. and gentlemen. it is again a privilege to appear before the membership of the National River and Harbor Congress and to describe briefly the progress and developments in waterway improvements since your last annual meeting. It is gratifying to appear before your Congress. as its influence has ever been progressive in the development of a comprehensive and intelligent permanent policy and improvement program for the utilization of our national water resources in the interest of the people as a whole. During the past 3 years. with the exception of an item of $10.000.000 provided in the second deficiency appropriation of 1935. the funds for new work on river and harbor improvement have been provided entirely from the several emergency appropriations. and the regular departmental appropriations have been for maintenance operations only. These emergency funds have permitted an augmented program which has made possible the accelerated rate of progress in the completion of authorized projects. They have totaled $483.000.000. and have provided for the average direct employment of 55.000 persons. and for the indirect employment of at least that many more. In addition to the emergency funds. approximately $128.000.000 has been made available during the same period from regular appropriations for maintenance operations. making a total of $611.000.000 in 3 years. or more than $200.000.000 per year. The total waterborne commerce of the United States averaged more than .414.000.000 tons annually in the period. We are particularly pleased that permanent worthwhile improvements have been accomplished with these funds which. at the same time. have provided a substantial measure of employment relief. and have been of effective aid in stimulating the heavy construction industry. We have recognized the desirability of undertaking our operations by contract whenever practicable and when satisfactory prices could be obtained. In spite of the difficulties in undertaking relief work by contract to meet the requirements of the relief program. we succeeded in preparing a form of contract for such work. with the approval of the Works Progress Administration. which has enabled the major portion of the relief work entrusted to our Department to be successfully executed by contract. In obtaining exemptions for certain skilled positions. and other minor adjustments necessitated by the relief requirements. we have had the full cooperation of the Works Progress Administration. During thepast year 66 percent of the new work on river and harbor improvements was undertaken by contract. as compared with 34 percent with Government plant and hired labor. This represents almost a direct reversal of the percentage which obtained some 20 years ago which has been made possible by the cooperation of the contractors and their willingness to meet the requirements of the Department and at the same time to submit reasonable bids for the work in view. The exigencies of the relief program during the past year again necessitated the prompt advertisement of work to provide immediate employment. Many important projects were completed. to include the Delaware River from. Philadelphia to the sea. the final completion of the last link in the intracoastal waterway along the Atlantic coast providing 1.360 miles of protected inner passage for small boats from the Delaware River to Miami. Fla.. the 25foot channel in New Haven Harbor. the Raritan River to Arthur Kill Cutoff Channel in New York. the 32foot Houston Ship Channel. and the Brazos Island Harbor entrance channel. Substantial progress was achieved at Boston Harbor. in the completion of highway and railway bridges across the Cape Cod Canal. and the enlargement of the canal dimensions. the Improvement of the New York State Barge Canal. the New York and New Jersey Channel. the extension of the Delaware River improvement to Trenton. extension of the canalization project on the upper Mississippi River. the completion of the stabilization works on the Missouri River practically to Omaha. the replacement of six old dams on the Ohio River by two high dams with movable crests located at Montgomery Island and at Gallipolis. the extension of the breakwater at Los Angeles. the improvement of Tampa Harbor. Fla.. and a number of other important projects urgently needed in the interests of navigation. The upper Mississippi River improvement has advanced to a point where 3 years should witness its full completion. the Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River is well ahead of schedule. There has been no period in our history which has witnessed a comparable attainment in the development of our rivers and harbors. During the next fiscal year there will be a return to the established system in which the new funds for river and harbor improvements are to be provided from the annual War Department appropriation. This will permit the selection of work to meet the urgent needs of navigation without prime importance being given to relief requirements. although. of course. that factor must be taken into consideration in the allocation of funds. It is understood that the conferees have agreed on a total appropriation of $161.670.899 for the preservation and maintenance of existing navigation works and new improvements. of which $115.000.000 will be available for new improvements. A large portion of those funds is required for the continuation of work now under way started with funds from the relief appropriations but not utilizable in its present condition. A smallbalance will be available to start work on new projects. and should suffice to meet the more pressing needs of navigation. The maintenance funds appear sufficient. with rigid care. to maintain project dimensions as required in the Interests of commerce. Until the appropriation is definitely established the program for the next fiscal year cannot be definitely prepared. but its preparation will be governed by the requirements of navigation. The Emergency Relief appropriations have also provided funds for a small number of floodcontrol projects to include the continuation of work on the Mississippi River and on the Sacramento River. authorized by Congress. a comprehensive program in the Muskingum conservancy district under cooperative agreement with that district. the construction of the joint navigation and floodcontrol dams at Fort Peck on the Missouri River. and near Grafton on the Tygart River. the Conchas Dam in New Mexico. the Sardis Dam in Mississippi. and a number of small levee and dike projects which were found to meet the requirements of the relief program. The tremendous increase in flood damages throughout the United States which has Inevitably resulted from the industrial development of our river basins. and the growth in population with corresponding increase in land values. has created a strong sentiment throughout the United States for participation by the Federal Government in floodcontrol work. The Constitution of the United States has conferred on Congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States and with the Indian tribes. In the early days of the Republic. there was serious doubt whether this power to regulate included the right to improve. but the enlightened decision of Chief Justice Marshall in the case of Gibbons against Ogden established clearly and indubitably the exclusive power of Congress with respect to the interstate waterways of the country. and marked the birth of a permanent Federal policy of river and harbor improvements which has been expanded and more clearly defined from year to year with the advance of population and the Increasing need for commercial transportation. While the Constitution clearly gives Congress the power to authorize the National Government to improve waterways for navigation and interstate commerce. it has not been determined that the Government has responsibility for constructing flood works generally. and a Federal policy with respect thereto has never been enacted legislatively. although Congress has authorized the construction of protective works in certain specific cases to include the Sacramento River. the Lake Okeechobee project. and the Mississippi River project. Public opinion. now realizing the magnitude and extent of flood losses. appears to recognize that destructive floods. together with contributory conditions of land misuse. erosion. and accelerated runoff of rain water. the resulting siltation of streams and reservoirs and impairment of the navigability of rivers. which combine to upset orderly processes and to cause losses of life and property and the destruction of national resources. constitute a menace to national welfare. A strong public demand has developed for floodprevention measures and the coordinated control of erosion and runoff to ameliorate soil erosion and to conserve water resources. The investigation and improvement of rivers and other waterways by the Federal Government for flood control and other purposes are under the jurisdiction of. and are prosecuted by the War Department. Coordinate studies and construction activities on drainage basin lands and small headwater streams. including the construction of small ponds and check dams involving incidental flood control. but primarily for the purpose of silt control and soil and water conservation. are under the jurisdiction of. and are prosecuted by the Department of Agriculture. There has been in the past no conflict. nor is there any occasion for conflict in the future. in the execution of the works charged to the two Departments. The theory has been advanced that a large number of small dams forming reservoirs with minor storage capacity far up on the headwater streams. together with check dams still farther up such headwater streams. will form a substitute for the major structures and great Impoundments proposed for the control of floods on major streams. Headwater structures are of great utility in the conservation of soil. in reducing minor floods. and in subsidiary benefits to include the reduction of siltation in major reservoirs. However. they would not prevent the cataclysmic floods which have so dramatically impressed themselves on the country at large during recent months This great downpour of waters may be controlled only by major engineering structures providing great impoundment areas. or by the construction of suitable works for the direct protection of definite areas. The Investigation developed by the War Department in its surveys authorized by Congress have found some 1.600 waterway projects. with a total construction cost of $8.000.000.000. including approximately 600 floodcontrol projects. with a construction cost of $1.160.000.000. More than onehalf of these projects would not appear economically warranted at the present time. in that the estimated construction costs exceed the benefits derived therefrom. In many projects the advantages which would result from their construction accrue to the people in the immediate vicinity. and it would certainly appear that a proportion of their expense should be borne by the interests immediately benefited. Where localities directly benefited by remedial works cannot meet in full the cost of such works. the Federal Government might well participate generously. However. complete responsibility for such protection should not be placed on the Federal Government. We shall always have flood and drought. heat and cold. earthquake and wind. lightning and tidal wave. which are all too frequent in their afflictions. The Government cannot be an Insurer of its citizens against the hazard of elements and cannot undertake to reimburse them for loss and damages incurred under such conditions. although it is chargeable with the rebuilding of public works and the humanitarian duty of relieving its citizens from distress. General floodcontrol legislation is now receiving the consideration of Congress. although the policy of Congress with respect to the participation of the Federal Government has not as yet been indicated It does seem axiomatic that States and other local authorities should supply all lands and assume financial responsibility for damages that may result from the construction of floodcontrol projects. It would be a farreaching precedent for the Government to buy the land and property requisite for protective works to the end of increasing the value or security of the private lands and properties to be protected and most inadvisable for It In generously helping a given section of the country to render itself liable for consequential damages. There are many Federal activities which contribute to the general welfare of the country through the improvement of lands and streams which are more or less distinctive in character and are now being planned or prosecuted by a separate department or agency of the Government. Most of these activities differ to such a degree in their conception and their prosecution as to require very little coordination between the several agencies to make them effective and efficient. The Army Engineers of the War Department are concerned with public improvements for direct and immediate control of floods which may be accomplished by th2 construction of levees. the enlargement of the discharge capacity of the natural channels. the provision of means of escape by diversion from the main channels into emergency channels or excess flood waters. and the construction of reservoirs to withhold from the natural channels in excess of their discharge capacities these flood waters. General plans are available for projects for the direct control of floods over the United States. costing more than any amount which can reasonably be devoted to that purpose. including the rivers and localities where the recent devastating floods have caused such damages and disorders as to attract widespread public attention. Our organization is prepared to Initiate and prosecute vigorously any floodcontrol measures which may be authorized by the Congress as the necessary funds are provided."},{"1":"1935","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"There is no doubt about that. and let me tell you something else that has occurred. Dr. Morgan. in the newspaper article that I read this morning. stated that this Chickamauga Dam is going to cost $25.000.000. This astonished the gentleman from Tennessee . because he says that previous estimates only call for $15.000.000. And he was further astonished at Dr. Morgans statement because the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors. in whom every American has confidence when it comes to construction work. had stated that this dam in all its ramifications could be built for $11.000.000. That shows to what extent these men. in whose hands we have placed this trust. have studied what they have undertaken. Take. for further example. the town of Norris. They started out to build the town to cost $2.000.000. It cost them $3.500.000. and when asked how that came about they said it was due to the increase of labor cost and the increased cost of material. and said that the matter of allocating the cost had not been studied. but they were going to do so after a while. It has been my effort to bring before you what I consider to be important things in the conduct of affairs of this Nation. The success or failure of the Tennessee improvement is the success or failure of the Congress of the United States. If you allow this thing to continue in this irregular. uncertain. unbusinesslike manner in which it is now being carried on. it is destined to failure. and the people to whom you have to answer will hold you responsible long after the Tennessee Valley Authority. those who are your agents. and who are creating the situation. have passed out of the picture. My appeal to the Congress of the United States is to say to the Tennessee Valley Authority. Stop. you have sufficient money to build what you have undertaken. Congress will meet again shortly. and when Congress meets we want before us your comprehensive program under which you are operating. When we have that comprehensive program before us we will give it the consideration it deserves and the Congress of the United States and not these agents and creatures of Congress will be the supreme legislative body of the land. Mr. Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time."},{"1":"1934","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I was unfortunately unable to be here during the latter part of last session. Early this session. however. I asked the Chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departmentsand I have requested him to be present todayif he would not call a meeting of that committee in order that I. the ranking Member on the minority thereon. might know what bills or resolutions had been referred to it. Last year it was suggested that as I had had 11 years of service in the Congress I should have some more important committee assignment than heretofore and that I be placed on the Committee on Expenditures. which was no longer to be a merely dormant one but would probably sit much of the time. I accepted this assignment willingly since it appeared to be an important one. When I courteously suggested to the chairman of the committee that a meeting thereof be called. so that I might obtain some information as to what was in prospect. there was an apparent unwillingness on his part to accede to my suggestion. A few days later I repeated my request and his reply was What do you want to do. uncover graft and corruption?  I answered. No. indeed. the country cannot stand that sort of thing. but I do wish to question the advisability of some of these current expenditures. and the methods used in making them. He demanded to know what I had in mind. I said.  Well. whether or not it really is sound policy to continue giving more of the Federal funds to wealthy States and wealthy towns which should be able to provide for their own. When interviewed by representatives of the press. I suggested that they talk personally with the chairman. for whom I have real personal liking and a great deal of respect. He is indeed a lovable man and I believe that he would make a remarkable investigator if allowed to act in that capacity. To them he stated in effect that I was looking for a cheap show. In reply to that insinuation I would ask those who have served with me for 11 years when I have ever forfeited their respect by seeking for notoriety. No. it is not that. but as ranking minority member on this committee I certainly feel some responsibility to those who placed me there and to the country at large to see to it. if possible. that these current huge expenditures be fairly examined. It is a fact that towns with tax rates of less than $20wealthy towns with not a dollar of indebtednessare taking money from the Federal Treasury. which is faced with a debt of $32.000.000.000. and last Saturday I had to vote to split the dollar in half and for other features of the monetary revaluation bill because I must needs back up the President. lest the bankers whom he has excoriated fail to help in the great financial operations now in prospect. When is a nation bankrupt? Just how much can we owe? With more than $3.000.000.000 of ordinary expense every year and with less than $3.000.000.000 of income. after having killed the goose that laid the golden egg and gave us $2.250.000.000 in income and corporation taxeshaving locked the barn door of banking and business after the horse had been stolen. and. as a friend wrote me the other day. locked it so tight that we cannot use the barn any more what is our present situation? We courageously voted that our President should have all the money which he demanded for relief. namely $3.300.000 last year. When November arrived he found that the same thing existed as had existed under the former administrationthat organization. planning. governmental red tape. and all that sort of thing had prevented the spending of all but a comparatively small amount for actual relief of unemployment. I recall that on January 25 of last year I made a brief speech on the floor of this House and cited the failure of the Home Loan Bank. whereupon the gentleman from South Carolina said to me with much emphasis. as you may recall. After March 4 things will move. After March 4 that same gentleman was made chairman of the new Home Owners Loan Corporation Board. Things were certainly supposed to move then. Did they? Oh. what a record. Up to the middle of Decemberand I have figures available to prove itscarcely any relief had been given to distressed home owners. There was more organization. there were more rules and regulations. and more and more delays. but foreclosures went on and on. The actual results of most of these relief measures were most disheartening. Federal banks bursting with money. but member banks not daring to borrow. The chairman of the R.F.C. tells the banks to loosen up. the Comptroller of the Currency travels about making speeches and urging banks to do business. even advising the making of loans on good character. It has been stated that the failure of the recovery program of the N.R.A.-or the proportion of its failureis to be laid to the banks because they have not properly cooperated. But just visit your own banks after the nationalbank examiner has been there. putting the fear of God into them by such instructions as this:  Dont you dare to lend another dollar on real estate as security or to that person whose credit is based on real estate. and after they have been subjected to criticisms which have actually resulted in banks withdrawing from business because they did not dare to carry it on. Agencies of the Government are working at crosspurposes. gentlemen. Within the last few days I have once more learned that banks in my own district have still borrowed nothing from .the Federal Reserve bank to help business in their communities. When is the fear which has restrained them from doing so to disappear? Not so long. as these governmental threats and this spending spree continue. . Then I look over the P.W.A. program. for which I voted last year. I was very willing to .vote a grant of 30 percent of the cost of municipal projects which would result in local improvements and be worth while in future years. But last November came and the P.W.A. had woefully failed to function as it was intended that it should function in all those many. many months. Someone had to think of something. else at once. Perhaps if Mr. Hoover had proposed it he would have been reelected President. that is. if the Democratic Congress could have been persuaded to back him up. They thought of practically giving away a huge sum of money-$400.000.000and giving it away in a hurry. Some of it must reach the peoples pockets by Christmas. You and I have many letters from constituents praising Mr. Roosevelt because their Christmas was made happier. and I rejoice with those who received this needed aid. There is no question of that need in countless instances. But that is only one side of the picture. Many wealthy communities and units promptly jumped in and grabbed a lot of this relief money. spending it on things which they. as municipalities. should never have spent it for.* The same is true of individuals. Possibly a million men have been placed on C.W.A. pay rolls who would not have had a job even in good times. It cannot be denied that in countless instances the deserving have failed to secure help because those who were not deserving got it. Canned music had thrown many musicians out of employment. That they needed work is unquestionable. but many have been given jobs simply to furnish entertainment for the public. Shades of the Caesars. That is what happened in Rome in the days of the public circuses."},{"1":"1933","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. throughout my term In the Senate I have been under the constant inspiration of contact with the late Mr. Shuey. to whom the Senator from Arkansas has so notably referred. I recall that only a few weeks ago it was my pleasure to rise in the Senate and refer to the fact that in no other life within our purview did the gulf stream of youth run so warm and so strong in the Arctic circle of the years. The gulf stream now is the gulf stream of his memory. but it will always be as warm in death as it was in life. Our affections and our respect and our veneration for Mr. Shuey will respond to the roll call of his memory even though he no longer responds to the roll call of our service. Public service never had a more capable and faithful trustee. The Senate never could have greater loyalty and competence and character in those who labor with it for the national welfare."},{"1":"1932","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment. Mr. Chairman. it is with a great deal of reluctance and hesitancy that I would oppose anything suggested by the distinguished gentleman from Texas. my own chairman and one of the greatest chairmen of the great Committee on the Judiciary in the history of this country. The gentleman from Texas never comes on the floor of this House unless he has given the subject matter a great deal of thought and study. but in this instance I want to point out that this is a board about which there was a great deal of comment the other day. If the Members of the House would only stop to consider that this entire Board of Mediation costs but $152.000 a year and looks after the welfare of over 350.000 workers in this country and the entire transportation system of the country. it would realize the importance of its purpose and the real public service it is rendering. It was said that their activities were not very great. That is the very purpose. not what they do. but what they prevent others from doing. Since the enactment of the HowellBarkley Railroad Labor Act we have .had absolutely no labor disturbance in the railroad industry. There are many crafts in railroading. and this board is in constant touch with them all of the time. Hundreds and hundreds of little disputes are settled. and we hear nothing whatever about them. yet many of these small disputes could have developed into a general strike. One of the greatest strikes we ever had in this country. known as the Pullman strike. in which Federal troops were called out. started. I believe. in the linen shop of the Pullman Co. It developed into a nationwide strike on all of the railroads. I submit that the salary having been fixed by law it would be hardly fair at this time to single out this commission for salary reduction. I am sure- the gentleman from Virginia is not in favor of the amendment."},{"1":"1931","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"But what is the situation we find ourselves in today? After various Members of this House have agreed to support the legislation. then within a week or 10 days of the adjournment of this Congress you come in with an entirely different proposition. a new bill. and ask us to surrenqer on the Wagner bill and support this new bill which the Committee on the Judiciary has just reported. I want to call attention to the position of labor on the Wagner bill. Mr. William Green. President of the American Federation of Labor. is an honest. kindhearted. and efficient labor leader. There is no more capable. honest labor leader in the world than William Green. Do you suppose he would be in favor of the Wagner bill if he thought it would be a detriment to the workingmen of the States. or even of the States themselves? He is wholeheartedly back of the original bill and I am going to support the Wagner bill when it comes to a vote this afternoon."},{"1":"1930","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. reserving the right to object. the bill itself is very vague. and it has an interesting cracker at the end. that the Department of Labor shall not conduct any of the inquiries specified in the bill where they are now being conducted by anybody else. If it is necessary to create this division. that division should have authority to conduct the investigations that are germane to its field of activity. That could be amended by dropping out that proviso. But the report of the committee does not carry any report from the departrfrent. There is a quotation from some statement or other rrmade by the Secretary of Labor. but there is no sort of report that the House is entitled to have. There is nothing showing that this has been referred to the Bureau of the Budget. I believe the House is entitled to that information. and I reiterate that in these days when the Executive is confronted .with the possibility of calling for new. taxes to meet our expenses. we ought not to set up new jobs. create new agencies. that will cost money. without any reference at all to the Bureau of the Budget. In view of that I shall be obliged to object to the bill. but I shall ask that it be passed over without prejudice in order that the gentleman. before it comes up again. may have an opportunity to get a report from the Department of Labor. I reserve my objection for the benefit of the gentleman from Indiana."},{"1":"1929","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Air. Chairman and members of the committee. I want to take a few minutes to talk over the naval situation. The gentleman from Idaho . who gives more liberally of himself to his work in the House than almost any other Member here. has covered the ground thoroughly. There are a few items here that I would like to emphasize. First. there is a general situation in the Navy. There has been a tendency to keel) every ship in the Navy afloat and to make in(reasing demands for personnel for the ships we have and to increase the expenditures that way regardless of the condition of the fleet or the yards and their general equipment. They tell us now that they have increased the desired complements of the different ships of the Navy which were In commission by about 3.500 for the year 1930 over 1929. And this after taking into account the new ships coming in. All this in spite of the fact that in almost every instance the complements of our ships exceeds those of Great Britain. and that we now within the last two months have added over 2.000 marines to the personnel of our fleet at sea. These have just been withdrawn from China and Nicaragua. where they have completed their service. There are about 11.350 in the Air Service. of whom over 6.000 are at sea and 2.000 were without any definite assignment. Considering these facts and the five old cruisers. which should be taken out of commission. your committee felt that increase of personnel was not the first need of the Naval Establishment. and so when we finally agreed to recommend an increase of 500 for the authorized personnel of the Navy. making a total of 84.500 to be maintained throughout the year 1930. we thought we had been liberal. Engineering repairs as of July 1. 1929. will show of repairs undone about $2.000.000 and needed alterations $3.200.000. Repairs and maintenance to hulls will run about $2.000.000 behind. and perhaps more. No attempt was made in the Budget estimates to take care of these items or to permit the department to catch up with its uncompleted repairs. We have been carefully into the situation and have provided a program covering two years. 1930 and 1931. for the expenditure of $3.000.000 to replace the antiquated tools and machinery in the yards. so that we can get more work out of the same money. This we estimate will materially reduce the overload of uncompleted repairs and alterations if we have the cooperation of the navy yards and their employees. The engineering repair overload will be reduced over $1.000.000. In construction and repair workthat is. work on the hulls of the ships--the expense will be reduced upward of another million dollars. This new scheme will in large part take care of and correct the condition of the machinery in our navy yard. which has been spoken of here by the gentleman from Massachusetts . And while on this subject I wish to talk about the socalled Dallinger amendment. How much better for the navyyard employees it would be if the alleged friends of the yards would devote their great energy and eloquence to an effort to put some pep into the yard workers and give us more efficiency out of our workers. They now receive more pay than the employees in the private yards in that they have 15 days leave with pay and 15 days sick leave with pay which is not given in private yards. Now. we are face to face with a cruiser construction program of a very considerable extent. The trouble with the Gallinger amendment is that it prevents competition between the yards and the different private shipbuilders. It tends to take awaybecause they know they are going to get half the ships that come inall incentive for real honest work on the ships which they are building. We have had a lot of trouble with this sort of thing in the past. I have here.with me a statement in the hearings had before the Committee on Naval Affairs in 1922 and in 1926 which shows the cost of the different ships which have been built by the Navy down to and including the year 1926. It shows the cost of the ships in the navy yards to have been almost entirely higher than in private yards. until you get down to the war time when they began to let costplus contracts. And then when we get into the period after the war we find this. that out of eight cruisers. which are now under construction without any requirement on the part of Congress. the navy yards have bids submitted to build cruisers and they have been allotted and are now building three. But in addition to those cruisers they have been building and are now building six Vboats. submarines of large type and large size. as against none in private yards. And what has been the history of these V boats? I am only going to consider three of these. because they are fair samples. The VI. which is a submarine urine layer. was originally estimated by the department and the yard to cost $5.300.000 in 1924. A little later the cost by a supplemental bill that came here was increased to $6.150.000. and it has now been raised to $6.500.000. so that the cost of that one ship is now practically up to the point of the cost of the battleship Florida and the battleship Utah. more than the cost of one of those ships that was built by private contract in a private yard. The V5 and the V6 are now under construction in the navy yard at Portsmouth. N. H. The original limit of cost of these ships was $5.300.000. That was then extended to $6.320.000. and it has now been extended to $6.650.000. and no one knows how much higher we will have to go before they are finished. Now as to the fleet cruisers that are being built in the navy yards. the bids of the navy yards upon the last cruisers which were to be constructed were lower. substantially lowerupward of $2.000.000 each lowerthan the private yards. but the past perforamnce of the navy yards does not justify any feeling of confidence that this situation will or can continue. or that they can possibly get their ships out within the estimates of their yards. or within the bids of the private yards. The bids upon the Pensacola and the Salt Lake City were practically the same in a navy yard and in a private yard. One contract was awarded to the Brooklyn Navy Yard and the other to the Cramps at Philadelphia. As I say. the bids were approximately the same. being only about $100.000 apart. with the advantage a little bit in favor of the private yard. when you come to consider the engines and all the equipment which goes with them. The navyyard ship has not been completed. so that we have nothing but past performance to go on as to cost. Now. we have another thing to consider on this navyyard proposition at the present time. If we are going to build cruisers and aircraft carriers in the navy yards. very considerable items must be met for renewals. replacements. and extensions. And let me say to you that in figuring the cost of ships in navy yards these renewals and replacements are not taken into consideration at all. They simply take into consideration the actual cost of things that can be directly traceable to the one ship that they are building. they allow no depreciation and no maintenance on the ships or the ways on which the ships are built. They simply take into consideration such things as the blocks and tackles which are used for the individual ship. as well as the light. power. and heat properly chargeable to that proposition and a few other upkeep items which are absolutely chargeable to the particular construction LXX- 191 in hand. Nolv. if we are going to build ships in navy yards. here is our situation: We have just one yard which Is now equipped and able to take on the construction of more ships than it already has. That is the New York Navy Yard at Brooklyn. It is equipped. in so far as physical equipment is concerned. to take on the construction of two ships at the present time. but its commandant reported at the time bids were received last spring upon the cruisers which were then. under construction that they could not expand the personnel of the navy yard efficiently or economically so that they ought to bid upon more cruisers than the one they were then building. so they did not bid. Mare Island has one ship under construction. which will be out of the way in about a year. so one ship could be put there at that time. Puget Sound has one ship under construction in the building dock at that place. and no more can be placed in that dock until the one that is now in is taken out. Two could be built at once. but -when one is under way it is impossible to start another there efficiently. Boston can do nothing without the expenditure of $250.000 for the lengthening of a way. and a very large expenditure along other lines. Philadelphia and Norfolk each have two ways which are available. but each of those ways will require the expenditure of $500.000 to put them in any kind of condition to work with. So much for the navyyard situation. I want to talk for just a minute or two about the proposition that has been made to expend a lot of money at Charleston for the construction of a large addition to the Charleston dry dock. Our good friend who represents the Charleston district has asked us to make an appropriation of $300.000 for the construction of a large addition to the dock. This is an item which has not been presented to the Bureau of the Budget by the Navy Department. and one which your committee never heard of until the gentleman from South Carolina took the floor. The dock is now long enough to take the Florida and Utah and the 10 light cruisers of 7.500 tons. and all of our destroyers. It is away down on the list of projects which the Navy Department would like to present to Congress. There is about $7.000.000 in more important projects ahead. and it does not seem right to adopt such a large item when it is so far down the list. and this committee has had no chance to investigate it. The necessary.work on all ships of the fleet when in the Caribbean is performed at the Canal Zone. where we have a 1.000foot dock. Much interest has been shown on the floor about a German ship in process of construction. and I would like to put in the REcoaD what I have found oift about that. This ship is a capital ship. supposed to be comparable to a battleship. which Germany is allowed to construct under the treaty of Versailles. It is of 10.000 tons and it is supposed to have a speed of 26 knots and a steaming radius of 10.000 miles at 20 knots. It is supposed to be driven by Diesel engines which are to weigh 17% pounds per horsepower and to mount six 11inch guns. How much armor it is to carry we do not know. The Diesel engines of this type are experimental and whether they will be successful or not we do not know. The lowest successful type that we know about at the present time in actual service weighs something like 68 pounds per horsepower. The Diesel engines on an ordinary commercial ship weigh 200 pounds per horsepower. This ship. if a success. will undoubtedly have a marked effect in revolutionizing methods of propulsion. Its gun range of 30.000 yards is said to be a little below that of our best battleships and our new 10.000ton light cruisers. which have a range of from 33.000 to 35.000 yards. At long range the 10.000ton cruiser would be nearly as effective. because of the greater speed and the speed of firing. but probably at short range the 11inch guns would outmatch the 8inch guns of our cruisers with their armor. I have made this little statement of some of the features of the Navy and the naval appropriation bill which I believe deserves a good deal of thought and a good deal of attention. I have felt all along that the bill which we have brought here marks quite a radical departure toward something which will force the Navy Department to adopt the policy of presenting a more balanced budget to us in the future. because I believe the first thing we must look after is to keep our ships in proper engineering and mechanical condition and to keep our yards up and not try to have so many old ships in commission which we can just as well get along without. and try to keep the unnecessary expenses down. One of our cuts was in the item of fuel. It has been developed.since we came on the floor with our bill that the price of fuel oil has gone down 25 cents per barrel. If this price continues as it now is long enough. so that our Navy Department can take advantage of these prices in letting its contracts for fuel next year. there will be an excess in our appropria-"},{"1":"1928","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. regardless of tile terms of the old McNaryHaugen bill. it presented. in substance. a proposition to secure farm relief by a certain definite plan. and the Rainey amendment in effect proposed to attain the sanle object by another plan. just as the present bill offers relief by a definite plan and tire amenldment offered by tile gentleman from Texas proposes relief by another plan. Now. it has been repeatedly held that to t proposition to effect a purpose by a specific method an amendment to achieve the same object by another unrelated method is not germane. It will only be necessary to cite one such decision. 1r 1918. in tile second session of the Sixtyfifth Congress. the House was considering a bill providing for the conservation of foodstuffs. The method proposed for conservation of food was by educational and demonstrational methods.

I thoroughly agree with my colleague from New Jersey that there has been no debate of any account on this question that has had cloture applied to it. I wish to outline as briefly as possible my views on the measure now the special order in this body. but before I do this I desire to pay my respects to the junior Senator from New York . who yesterday saw fit to ridicule and belittle me for making vigorous protest qgainst the action of socalled wets of the Senate in joining the camp of the drys in forcing through the upper Chamber a measure which has never been adequately debated. The Senator from New York sarcastically and insultingly quoted me as saying  that two incipient presidential booms caused cloture to be placed on the prohibition reorganization bill. and that  when professional Senatorial wets vote for dry measures. of course. it is useless to expect any encouragement from Senators who are neither wet nor dry. Cloture on this measure was decisively defeated until some presumably wet Senators cowed before the Wheeler lash and forsook wet leadership. Mr. President. I did make this declaration. and I meant what I said. and I mean what I say now. The only reference to the Senator from New York which can be questioned as to its truthfulness is that wherein I referred to him as a wet. This is not true. and I beg the Senators pardon. The Senator from New York bombastically and with loud blowing of trumpet exclaims. I am for la.v enforcement. Mr. President. if the assurances of the Senator from New York as to his ardent desire for law enforcement are as counterfeit as was his promise that he would vote against cloture on the reorganization bill. God help law enforcement! The Senator from New York has never been in sympathy with antiprohibition campaigns. He has straddled and wabbled on prohibition ever since he has been a Member of this body. and he is straddling and wabbling today. and this in the face of an overwhelming referendum of his own State against Volsteadism and all that it implies. and still he has the temerity to attack my motives when I speak the truth about the real friends and the bogus friends of the  wet cause. Mr. President. the junior Senator from New York further says. I am for law enforcement. I should like to have the Senator from New York point out one Senator in this Chamber who is not for law enforcement. I am for law enforcement with a great deal more positiveness than is the Senator from New York. and he knows it. My fight against the reorganization bill has not been against law enforcement. it has been against the tactics and trickery of the dry forces In this body to railroad a bill through this Chamber without adequate debate simply because Wayne B. Wheeler cracks his lash. If that Is the kind of law enforcement the Senator from New York is for. I am against him 100 per cent. The trouble with the Senator from New York is that he is trying most unsuccessfully to play both ends against the middle. and thereby ensnare both wet and dry votes. He has never yet taken a positive and determined stand on the prohibition question. and I do not expect that he ever will as long as he Is a Member of this body. His caustic comment and innuendoes cast at me have no more effect on my judgment or my determination to continue my fight against prohibition than have the wallings of Wayne B. Wheeler. The Senator from New York further states. We [meaning the people of New York] do not share the views of the New Jersey Senator. No. and the Senator from New York does not share the mature and intelligent views of anybody else. Mr. President. I should like to ask the Senator from New York when and for how long he has been commissioned to speak for Gov. Alfred E. Smith. of New York? I make this inquiry because I believe I am as familiar with New York State politics as is the Senator from Manhattan. It was not so very long ago that the Senator from New York was working with the HearstHyland faction of the Democratic Party in New York to ruin Governor Smith. In fact. the Senator from New York referred to the Governor of New York as no Apollo. and did all in his power to thwart the governors ride to power. With what credentials does he now presume to speak on the floor of the Senate for Governor Smith? The New York Senator has seen fit to deride me for wishing to make this Nation as wet as the Atlantic Ocean. Let me say to the Senator from New York that if I can make it as wet as New York City I shall be perfectly satisfied. If the Senator from New York wishes to tie his fortunes up with the AntiSaloon League crowd. let him go his way. God forbid that the antiprohibitionists will ever crave his help! If they do. they will never get it. I sincerely trust that the junior Senator from the Empire State will broadcast his remarks to his home State. because when he announced to the world that he was in favor of cloture on the reorganization bill he declared himself in favor of gag rule in the Senate and against the right of free speech. If he thinks such flimsy and untenable argument as he has put forth will fool the people of the State of New York. I can assure him that he is mistaken. I know the people of New York quite as well as does he. So much for the Senator from New York. This reorganization measure on its face appears innocent enough. but when provisions of the bill are carefully digested and analyzed it will appear to many impartial and unbiased minds that if this measure becomes a law the Sixtyninth Congress will have gone on record as favoring further centralization of government and the setting up of a bureaucracy which is bound to cause embarrassment to every legislator who votes to cause this bill to become statutory law. This measure is known as H. R. 10729. and was introduced in the Senate April 19. 1926. and referred to the Committee on Finance May 17 of last year. On December 10 last. the Senator from Utah reported this bill to the Senate with certain amendments. It was recommitted to the Committee on Finance December 17. and now we are confronted with it on the floor of this Chamber. It has already passed the lower House. Mr. President. before I attempt to analyze this measure I want to assure my dry friends on both sides of this Chamber that it is with no thought of filibustering or delaying a final vote on the Smoot bill that I now address the Senate at some length. I want to say right here that if the Senate would take up either of the two most important bills. in my estimation. before the Senatethe public lands and buildings bill or the alien property billI would relinquish all right even to make my own position known in the Senate. My only purpose is to bring before the country the real and underlying reasons which prompted the sponsors and advocates of this measure to insist at this late day of the session that it be railroaded through the upper House without allowing fair and just debate. This measure has been pending on the Senate calendar since last year. Why have no serious attempts been made to call it up? Day after day and night after night when the Congress has been In session. and bills on the calendar have been in order. the Smoot bill has been passed over without the slightest efforts being made by my dry friends to ask for its consideration. except In the last week or so. For the past two or three weeks the reception room of this Chamber has been alive with paid lobbyists of the AntiSaloon League and the Methodist Board of Public Morals organization. buttonholing both wet and dry Senators to jam this reorganization bill through when EDWARDs and BRUcE are not looking. The AntiSaloon League has not approached me. because its members know that I would not listen for a fraction of a second to their unAmerican. entirely selfish. bigoted. and intolerant appeals. I try to represent in this body. first. America. and secondly the intelligent and fairminded thought of the State of New Jersey. Let me inquire again: What is the real purpose behind this measure? The purpose is not to stiffen prohibition enforcement. not to combat more urgently prohibition corruption and fraud. not to make America free of poison liquors. not to strengthen Volsteadism. The real purpose is to create some 10 or 12 new jobs for Wayne B. Wheeler. who is now engaged in rounding up dry delegates for Mr. Coolidge in the 1928 convention."},{"1":"1926","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"To the members of the class of 1920. now that you are about to be graduated from the high school of your city. it Is well to make an appraisal of the situation which has enabled you to come thus far on the road of life. and it is well also to analyze the facts and the philosophy upon which your future success and happiness may be builded. Here is gathered a great crowd of friends and admirers and wellwishers to see you honored. as you deserve to be honored. after having successfully completed the prescribed course of study leading to this graduation. While they are honoring you in this public fashion. you in turn must honor those peaple and those forces of human progress which have made this great event possible. Twentysix years ago it was my privilege to live through the same great emotions and the same exultant animation which you are experiencing. It is. so to speak. like standing on a majestic mountain looking out upon a glorious world.. It is an achievement distinctly worth while. It is a high honor worthy of noble people. It Is indeed a victory of patient effort and high purpose. But. my dear young friends. back of this magnificent spectacle are the devoted parents. most of whom have made real sacrifices for your sake. Throughout the years when you have come from childhood these parents have dreamed great dreams for you. They have wished for you and have given you. with whatever sacrifice was necessary. the best equipment for life that the great publicschool system makes possible. Few there are who can think in terms of an education without in simple justice thinking also in terms of the unselfish and devoted parenthood that made the opportunity. In order to make a fair appraisal. we must look even back behind the parents themselves and there we find a great enlightened citizenship. stretching from end to end of this wonderful country. that is continuously willing to tax itself for the building of great educational structures. for the best and most complete equipment. and for the adequate training of the teachers who guide us on the path toward education. It would be most ungrateful of us if we should fail to give full and lasting credit to the teachers themselves who represent the highest standard of efficient and consecrated public service. Back of all these things. great and fine as they are. is a more important and fundamental thing. and that is the Nation itself. which was born in the spirit of a new philosophy of government. We wilt not here concern ourselves with the foresight and the tremendous sacrifice and suffering that constituted the price paid by the founders of this Republic for the institutions of which we are the fortunate beneficiaries. Volumes could be written on that phase of the subject alone. but I am thinking now in terms of the institutions themselves. one of the greatest of which is the guaranty that all the blessings of America shall be open in equal measure to the children of all people within our borders. This philosophy of equal opportunity. equal liberty.. and equal. advantages of education is the very foundation of America. It is the philosophy which proclaims that the child of the most lowly shall have no barrier placed In his way by law or caste or custom. It is a living invitation to everyone. no matter how humble may have been his origin to rise to whatever heights of success and fame that he is able to attain by virtue of his natural endowments and his determined effort. Perhaps one difficulty is the fact that it is really hard to appreciate those things which we have always known and which are familiar facts in our lives. Things are strong by contrast. Here in America. that Is blessed as no other nation in the history of the world has been blessed by a form and philosophy of government which makes all of these things possible. it is really difficult to comprehend the meaning and the magnitude of the great publicschool system. universal education. Try to imagine. if you can. the situation in other lands where intelligent people grow to maturity without any education at all. or very little beyond what may be picked up. There are hundreds of millions of people. naturally intelligent. in the world even today for whom there is no educational advantage. Gradually and by slow progress some other nations are beginning to provide their people with some of the educational facilities which America has provided so rapidly and so fully. It Is not an Idle boast to say that everyone Is richly blessed who Is born or reared in this our America. We must not forget. however. that even this great America. granting that we have gone very much farther on the road of progress and have been vastly more favored than other nations. is the fruit of an advancing civilization that has been in progress over a period of centuries. And what is this civilization of which we boast as our own. For nearly 2.000 years there has been working In the world the Christian philosophy that caused man to think in terms of human values and a higher level of life. Gradually. as this Christian philosophy permeated the world. there developed with it a desire for knowledge. But more important still was an awakening aspiration for human liberty. It took long centuries to develop. but gradually. very gradually. these three grew into the human consciousnessthe Christian philosophy. the desire for education. and the thirst for liberty. And so there was finally established here in this New World a great new form of government. an experiment that represented the high hopes and lofty ambitions of a people dedicated to human progress. Ours is a government the product of a great and wonderful philosophy that was designed to be the servant of its people as distinguished from those other forms of government hitherto known in the world. which were designed to serve the masters only. And think. if you will. of that tremendous force which America has let loose in the world that has stimulated the thought and actions of the people in many other lands. America has made a really great contribution to the democratic thought and the spirit of liberty in the world. This. it seems to me. is a brief appraisal of the things which have made possible this great and significant occasion. Now let us turn to the future for a little while. because after all the things which you have achieved up to this time are only a preparation for those which are to come. You want success and happiness. of course. These are the common goal of mankind. May I suggest to you some simple fundamental things that seem to me prerequisite to success and happiness. No success is possible in anything that you may choose to follow unless you are willing to pay the price. America guarantees you an equal opportunity with every. other Americanand nothing more. Of course. It would be foolish to assume that everyone has equal ability. and that everyone is capable of rising to the same heights. because there Is bound to be as wide a difference in human capacity. But in so far as your natural endowments permit you can reach any goal that you are willing to pay the price to reach. You can not succeed by merely wishing to succeed. because success is a coy maiden that must be wooed and won by persistent. determined. and sustained effort. I should say that the degree of success which you attain. in keeping with your natural endowments. will depend upon how much sue cess really means In your life. and how determined you are to achieve It. If you really want It you must be willing to make sacrifices of pleasure and convenience and luxuries. You must avoid the soft places and battle against the human tendencies to seek the easy road. to cut corners. and to belittle hard work. Work Is a blessing when viewed in the right light. It is the thing. and the only thing. by which human beings can grow. It develops strength and courage and confidence. and the very capacity to do things. The best proof of this is the fact that the idle eons of the idle rich never amount to anything. We have It demonstrated over and aver again in America that those who are forced by circumstances to labor and to strive. or who of their own volition choose to do so. are the only ones who amount to anything at all or are worth considering In American life. In an overwhelming proportion of the cases. the men of success today were the children of adversity yesterday. And now for happiness and the broader phase of success. You may not believe me when I say that the measure of happiness Is to a large extent the degree to which you can forget self. I am speaking now In the broader sense of the term. because it would not be humanly possible to forget ones self entirely. but it is the attitude of mind which Is all important. The world is a mirror which reflects with amazing accuracy what we give to the world. If we give friendship. we get friendship in return. If we give sunshine. then there comes back to us sunshine to bless our own lives. If we give earnestness and sincerity and nobility. we are judged by that standard and very largely treated on that basis of human relationship. It has seemed to me that the best guide of life is to be what you admire In other people. If you admire friendliness. then be genuinely friendly. not gushing and superficial. but really friendly in a fine. sweet sense. If you admire earnestness. then be earnest. not stiff and intolerant. but sincerely earnest. If you like honesty. then be honest. not merely as a policy. but as a life principle. If you admire courage. then be courageous. not foolhardy or for purposes of show. but courageous in a noble sense and as a matter of steady purpose. If you admire energetic workers. then be a worker yourself. not with the idea of shutting out of your life every pleasure and enjoyment. but as a means of attainment and happiness. If you admire thrift. then be thrifty. not penurious or foolishly inconsiderate. but thrifty in the sense of saving a portion of your earnings as an evidence of a life work worthily done. If you admire nobility and fine character. then strive to be all that those things represent in your best philosophy. It is well to remember that the world judges us for what we are. Merit finds its own level just as water does. Bluff can not raise us much higher than we deserve to go. because human instinct will one day find us out and cast us down to that low plane where we belong. Merit. real. honest merit. will bring us very largely that: recompense and recognition which we really deserve. Luck plays a relatively unimportant part in the scheme of life. It has its place. perhaps. but it can not drag us down. as a rule. beyond the plane where we deserve to be. You create the causes and you need not worry very much about the results. because they will flow just as naturally as anything can be from the causes which you have created. Forget yourself. Keep your mind and your heart on the things you are striving to do. Forget the results that you seek to attain. as far as possible. and concentrate upon the causes that will produce those results. Success and happiness both will come to you very largely in the measure that you merit them. You can not pluck the fruit of life unless you plant the right kind of trees properly and nurture them through the years until they are ready to bear fruit. The future is very largely in your hands to make it what you will. America gives you a great opportunity. Our philosophy of life and government provide the inspiration. Civilization beckons you with outstretched hands to make use of a glorious background and magnificent instrumentalities for our own good and the welfare of the race. Do not be ashamed of your ideals. You need them and the world needs them. I can not close without one other great appeal to you. You and I are more fortunate than we may realize to have been privileged to live under the magnificent blessings of America. to be the beneficiaries of her unmatched institutions. to be educated in her great publicschool system. and to imbibe the philosophy of her civic and spiritual life. America has made you and me possible. America has given us our all. We owe an everlasting obligation to help preserve all that is best in this our native land. Here we have a country more richly blessed than any land in the history of the world in a material. moral. and spiritual sense. But America Is only 150 years old. It is indeed a very young nation. representing in that century and a half only two normal lifetimes. As we glance down over the long span of history. we see countless nations rise and fall. We see kingdoms and principalities and powers. almost without number. come and go. History represents a striking and varied picture of rapid changes in human affairs and in nations. Viewed over the long span of time since history began the changing world presents a warning and a challenge to America. When we received these great blessings. we received them as a priceless heritage. We do not own America. It is ours only for a lifetime. It came to us from the generations that are gone. We hold it in trust only so long as the breath of life is in us. and then we must pass it on to other generations that are to come. All these great and manifold blessings that came to us as a priceless heritage brought with them an equally great responsibility to keep this land of freedom and opportunity as great and as wonderful and as worth while as It was when we received it."},{"1":"1925","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Speaker. although continuously before Congress for the last four years. no solution of the Muscle Shoals problem has yet been reached. The delay is worth far more than the cost. After the first impression and rush for solution has come sober reflection and judicial reconsideration. What the Panama Canal is to our defense in permitting a unition of our naval forces and facilitating our commerce. so Muscle Shoals will be in furnishing us nitrates for our defense In time of war and. to a limited extent. fertilizer for soil building and increased production. It is as closely related to our defense as the canal. At present we are wholly dependent upon Chilean nitrates for our defense. Since 1867 we had paid our producers of nitrates the enormous stum of $821.183.624.12. and in addition we have paid export duties amounting to $163.647.780.63. It has been a ease of the mouse freeing the lion. That a big. powerful Nation like ours should be so wholly dependent upon another is almost iunbelievable. To say the very least. it is gross negligence. Should Chile not be favorable to our defense in case of war. how easily she could render us helpless by simply quietly passing out the word to cease the production of nitrates. Of such universal importance is it to the Government in time of war. the question very naturally arises whether or not. in order to develop a capacity and thus be able to manufacture a quantity sufficient for our defense. the ownership and control of Muscle Shoals should not be retained in the Government and operate it as it does the Panama Canal. Private enterprise would not have built the canal. neither would it construct Muscle Shoals. All the offers have been on the basis of our paying the cost of construction. We have already expended $165.000.000too much to throw away. The operation of the Panama Canal by the Government has been a conspicuous success. The postal system with all its defects is another example. It carries a letter from Maine to California for 2 cents. whereas a telephone company. privately operated. charges 5 cents for the shortest local call. Being so vitally necessary to our defense. there is a growing feeling that it should not be intrusted to privatphands. Tile development of hydroelectric power is another big factor in the Shoals problem. We stand upon the threshold of a period of electric development unapproached by all the progress of the past. when the transmission of electric power will be as successful as the transmission of tile voice. when we will save 98 per cent of waste now taking place in our electric bulbs. when we shall see each other face to face over the phone. and the movies by radio. While the business sense and judgment of the American people are against government ownership and operation as a general business proposition. yet the importance of Muscle Shoals to our defense is causing many to favorably consider such in this case regardless of the objection and our recent sad experiences in the ownership and control of the railroads. The publicly owned electric power plants have universally cheapened tile cost and returned a profit. Privately owned and operated companies have been compelled to reduce their rates 50 per cent or more when faced witi public competitioh. The consumers at Kitchener. Ontario. were paying 11 cents a kilowatt hour until public ownership and operation came ill causing a reduction finally to 1.7 cents per hour. Canada. through 1er publicly operated company on the Canadian side. furnishes tile same light for the bridge across Niagara. which the privately owned and operated company o the American side does. but at onsixth tile cost. Our conservation of the national resources for all the people would seem to require. at least. a retention of the ownership and control of Muscle Shoals for at least a sufficient length of time for us by actual experiment to determine the best course for us.. to pursue. To start ont upon a conservation policy with private ownership of a war necessity would set a precedent for its defeat. With such a mammoth problem aind with such an uncertain course we should  make haste slowly. The pending resolution authorizing the President to appoint a comimission to further investigate the question should be enacted. Let the problem be probed from every angle. Let all the information possible be obtained. Let its report to tile next Congress be carefully considered il order that we may bring to the solution of this questibn the very best judgment of which we are capable. The farmers of the country should not be deceived by the extravalgant claims made for a cheaper fertilizer plroduced by this plant. the capacity of which is generally conceded to be limited to 200.000 tons a year. Our annual consumption of nitrates for fertilizer purposes is between seven and eight million tons a year. The Muscle Shoals fertilizer contribution therefore wonld be but a drop in the bucket. and this capacity of only 200.000 tons it year could only be attained after the expenditure of an additional $50.000.000. So far as cheap nitrates for fertilizing purposes is concerned. the plant would be local in its benefits. It would be so limited in its quantity of production and in its transportation. the high freight rates. as to probably not reach out farther than two or three hundred miles in its benefits to the farmer. In no event could it compete with the natural existing nitrate plants of the Oklahoma farmer. sweet clover. cow peas. soy beans. and tile many other legumes native to tile soil and climate fixates and furnishes nitrogen for soil building at a much less cost than Muscle Shoals could ever hope to furnish it. This. however. should not prevent such all experiment being made. If cheap fertilizer call be manufactured and distributed profitably for a distance of between two and three hundred miles to the farmer. it will demonstrate the practicability of the utilization of other waterpower sites for similar purposes. and by the increased number and favorable location we may be able to make up il quantity and in proximity to consumption that which we lack at Muscle Sloals. Second only in importance to the conservation of our water power for our defense is the storage in- time of peace of necessary wardefense supplies which we do not now produce. The scientific and systematic elimination of waste by reclamation nud salvage will do much in this direction. It is a new field. one of conservation and economy. We must inaugurate and establish a policy of production which will finally include all our needs for preparedness and adequate defense. so that we will in time il fact becmne what we ought now to bean absolutely selfsustaining Nation il time of peace and war. Ours is the responsibility to safely transmit that which we have inherited. The civil institutions of tills Republic have only been evolved out of the experience of the centuries and the wyars of the past. We owe it not only to future generations but to the world to see that our institutions of civil liberty shall be preserved and this great Republic continued so that Its benign benefactions may continue to bless the inhabitants of the earth. To be prepared is not war. It is the cheapest insurance against war. As one of the most valuable contributions of recent years to the thought herein suggested. I herein incorporate a thesis by Col. Howard Oursler. a recent attendant at our War College. an able student of the questions and an executive of recognized ability in the subjects presented: Tian Anms WAn CorLGio. WaslOngton Barracks.

I shall refiain from: making some of the observations I had! intended to make. be-. cause the distinguished gentleman from Texas has very ably covered the tariff situation in the South. to which I had intended. to devote. a part of my time. I am. not a native of the gteat State of Texas. but I am a native of what until the very recent past has been considered one of the leading Democratic States of the South. namely. Tennessee. and. I know something of the Democratic doctrine of free trade: I have no doubt whatsoever as to the absolute sincerity- and integrity of the gentlemen who come from .south of the Mason. and Dixon line. who happen to sit upon the Democratic. side! of this House. so far as theiir pretentions in respect to the tariff are concerned.. but I feel that. sincere though. they be. they have a very misguided conception of what protection really means. The gentleman from Texas observed that the average southern Democrat seems to think that protection means an absolute monopoly. Tomy mind the whole policy of protection is intimately involved with the principle of Americanism. The people- who live in this country. who pay thetaxes and who gain their daily bread. in- the fields of American endeavor. are certainly entitled to prices for tlieir products! which will permit them to maintain American standards: of living. There is no questi6n in my mind. that every American. producer. has the absolute right to demand in protection toi American industries the difference in the cost of produtton in this country and the cost of production abroad. So far as the present tariff bill is concerned. nd. I believe. it to be the greatest tariff bill ever originated. in the. Congress. of the United States. there is no question but that it involves: a series. of Compromises. There never was. and never will be a piece of legislation passed in either House of Congress which. will fulfill all the desires and wishes of the. individual Member.. and I think it is right and proper that it should be so. Legisla-. tion is like life. it involves the principle of give and take. and compromise is the watchword of. all progress. I believe that this great committee. which has had this bill under consideration for months. who have devoted. themselvesi most assiduously to the consideration of every angle. of the momentous situation confronting the Nation in the revision of the tariff. have done the very best. that could be done under the circumstances. California. far removed. from Washington. far removed from the centers of consumption. like many of the other west coast States has unusual and peculiar conditions: which it would like to have covered and met so far as possible by this tariff bill. To a great degree our ambitiols and. interests have been met. We are not absolutely satisfied. it is true. but I dare say that there is not a Member of this House who is absolutely satisfied with every provision of the bill so far as it affects his own particular district. but. in that very fact. in the fact that the average Member on the Republican side of. the. House: admits it is: not absolutely perfctand in admitting. this I am. sure: they are sincereI am all the more convinced: that the bill is the best tariff bill that has ever- been put out in any Congress. and. the fact that they are not albso.lutely pleased: with every provision. together. with. the fact tllat the majority of our Democratic friends oppose it.. is the :very best argument. in my mind. that the interests of the consumer as well as. the interests. of the producer have been taken care of. on the. whole. in a most satisfactory manner under existing circumstances.- and the- people in general will approve of the measure. Great strless has. been: laid by some- of my colleagues on the fact that the rates were either above or below those of the PayneAldrich bill or of the Underwood bill. b for one realize that the bills to which I have referred- have to. a certain extent been held up as yardsticks or as precedents in the i consideration of this bill. but I am. not disposed to: pass upon the .wisdom of this great committee in having so acted.. I believe that the conditions. which this country faces today as the outcome of the great World War have turned things really upside .down. and I do not. believe that. in all cases! the. schedules .should have been measured or that even an attempt should have .been made to. measure. and enact schedules in: harmony with the PayneAldrich bill as a yardstick. But that is a mere question of opinion. Other opponents of this bill have said. that we could not expect to collect tlhe money which the foreign Governments owel us unless foreign. exports I were permitted. tol come into. this country at no duty or at a low rate of duty. Personally I think and! believe that the country is. with. me. when I say that charity should begin at home. The American producer is- the -man whom we should first protect or otherwise in our attempt to look after the. peoples ofEurope and. to. see that their indebtedness is paid we shall. neglect our own people and those basic industries which are the very life of the Nation will be .left to perish. Then. when we are again in the hands: of the European importer. we will find ourselves as we were 10: or 5 years! ago in the. matter of lemons. There was a time. when we paid from one to two dollars a dozen for lemons in this country. which would beequivaelent today in terms of the relative purchasing power of money practically to from two to .four dollars a dozen. and this is what alvays happens: when the basic. industries. of a country are throttledin an. effort to aid !the foreign exporters and domestic importers. It is inevitable. Let us look after- our own peopre first and the rest of. mankind Swill! probably take care of: themselves. At least let us not perish that they may flourish at our expense . [Applause 01 the Repub.lican side. Il do. not desire to take up the time of this committee unduly with exhibits. but I want to show you a few bona fide pictures: of rottinglemons that you may know sotething of what happened in California under a Democratic tariff. Last year in California 10.000 carloads of lemons. the product of 17.500. acres of lemon- groves. were thrown into tle waslies because the coipetition- of Italian importations into thin country was such that -we could notm meet it. But when you stop to consider.. my friends. that those people- in California are American citizens. and it is estimated that the average.grove in California consists of about 10 acres. there being 50.000. acres in lemons owned by 5.000 American. families. each family composed of an average of live members who are dependent upon this. industry. who have invested all their savings in an industry which they assumed was right and. proper for them to engage. in. it is convincingly patheti cyes. even tragic. We now find we face- postwar conditions. in Europe. One. gentleman today held up before us the unfortunate condition of the peoples of Europe. In very pathetic tones lie told us of the condition they were in. In a very pathetic plea he told us how we should give them an. opportunity to arise from the condition in which. they find themselves. He did not mention. the fact that these- peoples are perfectly willing today to work for practically nothing. and that in permitting them to. bring the products of cheap labor into this country we put our- own people in a worse condition than the. peasants of Europe. because immediately our living conditions would dropto the lowest levels ever known and from whicth Amlerican industry would not recover in a. generation. No doubt can arise. in the mind of any man who takes the Fordney tariff bill quietly. without any sentimental or political. bickering. and. analyzes and reads it from cover to cover. but that it is the greatest tariff bill that we have ever had placed before us for passage. These gentlemen have not been hidebound in their hearings. Every man who has had a desire to present his proposition before them. has had ample opportunity to do so. And their liberality was shown lere the other night in caucus when they permitted certain articles upon which the committee had not been =355 able to agree to be submitted to the House where there is going * to be an opportunity to vote upon those schedules which have been most debated. Beyond that. every Member has an opportunity to go before the committee as a whole and present his argument. to there repeat the arguments which were presented tb the subcommittees. and I am sure that under the chairmanship of the able gentleman from Michigan of the. Ways and Means Committee. each and every man will ibe given a legitimate and ample opportunity to further press his claims. And If he can sustain his contentions on the basis of the protection theory of the Republican Party. a tariff which will equalize the difference in the cost of production in this country and abroad. on those articles produced In this country. I am sure that he will be given In large measure that for which he asks. The people of Californiaand I hope the House will pardon the reference which I am going to make to a certain sectionare of your own flesh and blood and kind. The people of my great State. and I include in this reference all those great States west of the Rocky Mountains. have little by little. down through the last 75 years. percolated out to the western shore. of America. On the shores of the Pacific the East meets the West. for beyond lies Asia and its teeming millions of coolie labor.

I do not wish to say that I have all of the good people from every constituency in the United States. but I do say without fear of contradiction that I have some of the best people. former residents of your constituencies. within the bounds of the district which I represent. And those people are looking to this House for a square deal. and I feel confident they will not be disappointed In this most.legitimate of expectations. The Republican Party in California is a party upon which the people of that State have seen fit to place their reliance. During the recent presidential campaign we had the distinguished gentleman who was a candidate on the Democratic ticket. Mr. Cox. of Ohio. come into my own State and plead the protectionist principle as reason for our vote. but the people of California did- not see fit te cast their votes for the party represented by Mr. Cox or his party candidates. and the first Representative from my district for a period of six years to sit on the Republican side of the House was overwhelmingly elected. I am glad to know that there is no partisanship in this bill. I am glad to know that where the gentlemen from south of the Mason and Dixons line have seen fit to present their requests. and where they have bean able to justify the schedules for which they have asked they have been in a large measure granted. and I sincerely hope that the gentlemen who are asking for a duty on hides will get that duty. I do not care from what section of the United States a man may come if he can show to me that a majority of the people in his section producing an essential article can not continue to produce that article in this country without an equalizing tariff I am in favor of giving it to him. I believe that this House in its wisdom will unquestionably pass this tariff bill by a greater majority than any tariff bill which has ever been passed in the history of the American Congress. and I expect to see a great number of my good friends on the Democratic side foting for the bill when the final count is taken. You gentlemen can not afford to vote against it. You can not go back before your constituencies and give any logical. tenable reason for having vote�t against an equalizing duty on the products of your country and protection for its free citizefis. land you know it.

There has been. as I say. so much discussion about it that it seems to be necessary to know whether or not it has been pr operly attended to under the terms of the reclamation act.

Mr. A. MITCHELL PALMER. Mr Chairman. I will come to that in a few moments. if the gentleman will permit me. I make no criticism of the President from a legal point of view for sending to the Congress the drafts of his bills. I recognize his constitutional right to send to the Congress. if he chooses. the drafts of measures which he desires Congress to act upon. but that power given by the Constitution has been honored since the foundation of this Government. in the breach rather than in the observance. for the very obvious reason that under our systemn of government the President has no power to appear. in Congress. either personally or through the heads of his departments. to defend such. measures as he communicates to the Houses of Congress. and to most minds it would seem to be proper that it should continue to be honored in the breach. for undoubtedly the framers of the Constitution did not -intend that the power of the President to recommend to the Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient should result in a practical reversal of the method by which legislation was to be framed under the Constitution. for. carried to.its logical conclusion. .this cotirse on the part of the President means that we shall have the veto power over such legislation as the President shall prepare. whereas. .in fact. the Constitution intended that the President should simply have the negative over the legislation which the Congress should enact. But I do not quote these sentences in the Presidents message for the purpose of discussing the always interesting and important questions which cluster about the line of cleavage which divides the powers and prerogatives of the legislative branch of the Government from those which pertain to the executive branch. but rather to offer some comment upon the apparent. if not the transparent. motive of the President in thus departing from a custom which has been sanctified by the usage of a century. The President was for many years a judge. Like.all judges. he is devoted to precedent. and it seems to me that the reasons which must have actuated the present Chief Executive in thus departing from the precedent laid down by his predecessors for one hundred years or more must be. whether considered from a patriotic or partisan standpoint. strong. cogent. and powerful.... It may be properly observed in passing that the welcome which these bills received when they came to this House .was not such as was calculated to encourage the President to repeat the process. if. indeed. the political exigencies of the occasion ever require that he shall place before the men elected on the same platform with himself such another plain and unmistakable test of party loyalty. The interstatecommerce bills for instance had no sooner landed in the Capitol than they were met by a substitute promptly prepared and introduced by the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. and the nine conservation bills. the measures which were designed to show the American people that the pre.ent administrations brand of conservation is the only simonipure. dyedinthewool. nameblowninthebottle. datestampedonthelabel kind of conservation in the market. with what a thundering welcome they were received!

Oh. yes. he said. he would Introduce them if the President would kindly put his name on the back and say Please. Mr. Chairman.  he would carry out the Presidents policies. and it looks as if he had carried them out into the bonfire behind the Public Lands Committees back yard. When the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means introduced his usual resolution for the distribution of these messages.. when I saw the homeless condition of these unfortunate bills prepared in such travail by the members of the Presidents Cabinet. when I observed how they wandered about the corridors of the Capitol. with no committee chairman so poor as to do them the honorof a decent burial orrespectful interment. when it was borne in upon my mind that they were in their character as pieces of promised legislation utterly useless and nugatory. I was tempted to suggest that in order to be consistent with what is the real programme of the oragnization leaders of this Congress the resolution ought to be amended so that these. bills should be referred to their logical abiding placethe committee on the distribution of useless executive documents.

No. Mr. Chairman. the thing was too transparent. The trick of concession. where legislation is threatened. only to be conceded. is as old as legislation itself. To say that the American people were deceived by the double play of a rather pliant Executive and an extremely astute organization leader in Congress in the last inning of the tariff game is to charge the people of this country with a lack of intelligence for which there is no warrant in the prompt punishment that they have meted out heretofore to parties recreant to their trust.

I hardly hope to add anything of value to this prolonged discussion. We are in council here as representatives of a great people and a great Nation. and while I believe in the efficiency. power. and potency of political organization. to my mind it is gratifying that so little partisanship displays itself in this debate. I shall offer my unpretentious counsels at this time for whatever they may be worth. I am not going into great detail on schedules. I am going to offer a few general observations in criticism of this bill. for now is the time for us to do it. if at all. I share with many other gentlemen who have spoken on the question in my appreciation of the patient labors and the able services of the great committee which has reported this bill. Every Member of the House Is indebted to their long service and their faithful serviceto the entire membership) of that committee both Republican and Democratic. It may be before we shall conclude this discussion that we shall be led to believe that this committee has gone further and deeper into the subject than we who may criticise it have had an opportunity to do. Every criticism that I make I make in perfect good feeling. by way of suggestion. simply for what it may be worth. Not only do I appreciate the services of this committee. but for myself personally I sympathize with them. They have seen humnan selfishness in its worst form. They have seen the very tooth and claw of human selfishness. Men of fortune and power have pleaded before them for their particular interest or their particular industry. Sectionalism. locality. special interests. and selfishness in every form have piteously plead before that committee for months. until it is a wonder to me the committee does not doubt the virtue of the human family itself. I am glad to say. and I can say it freely. that I stand here as an advocate of no particular interest. and certainly the enemy of no legitimate industry. I am from the West. I represent a people who feel disappointed at this bill. They believed. from the professions made and the party platform adopted. that the country would have a radical reduction of tariff duties in the interest. generally speaking. of the consumer. and they feel that this bill does not come up fully to their expectation. I may be verdant. but I believe that even in politics we should practice such a degree. at least. of honesty as may be compatible with this wicked world in which we live. and that we should act in good faith. I said over and over again that I fully and thoroughly believed in the promises made in the platform of this great party of liberty. of protection to American industry and American labor. and I felt that the great standard bearer of that party. who has come to the office better equipped. perhaps. than any man in our Nation. meant every word that he said as to a thorough revision of the tariff. Not a revision that it requires hairsplitting and close reasoning to discern. but a revision which the people would recognize at once as one that would be beneficial to the interests of the entire country. I give the committee the full benefit of every doubt. I am warranted in presuming that they understand better the general effect of this bill than I do. From the discussion in the case. if I were to find from the evidence. I should say there is some preponderance of evidence on the side of the proposition that the bill is an improvement upon the present law as it now stands. but I want it so that the layman. so that the common mechanic and the common workman and the small tradesman and the farmer will feel and know that this is what the great platform promised. and will welcome it as a thorough revision in the interests of all the people of this country. The subject underlying a discussion of this question is one which pertains to the general welfare of the American people. Among the powers granted to Congress are those of laying duties and imposts. collecting revenue. paying the debts of the country. providing for the common defense. and the general welfare of the United States. and I take it that the judiciary branch of our Government. speaking from the highest tribunal. has approved and sanctioned import duties that are laid along the lines of protection to American industries. on the ground that they are for the general welfare of the American people. I might take as a text for my remarks the general welfare of the United States. not section. not selfish personal interest. but a discussion and a determination of the question by men who shall. at least for the moment. rise above those selfish considerations and those sectional and special interests which may be back of them. to the general welfare of all. We have a great country and a great people. and whatever I may say tonight. I want to leave the impression of optimism and the impression of faith in this splendid Republic of oursthe grandest under Gods blue sky. With a vast population of eightyfive or ninety millions of people. energetic. enterprising. inventive. progressive. with a vast and mighty industrial and business machinery. complicated and delicate. such that you can not injure it in one part without communicating the injury to all parts. with a vast and mighty wealth. with the most efficient labor in the world. we deal with a great and mighty question. If we multiply idleness. we multiply want and misery and wretchedness. but if we touch with friendly and wise hand the springs of American industry. multiply production and keep the American hand and the American brain at work. we will have solved the problem. it seems to me. for the hour. and solved it well. Mr. Chairman. I am a protectionist. born in the Republican party. of abolition stock. I have been reared in the school of protection. and I want in connection with whatever observations I may make on this bill. to refer to some of the arguments. old indeed. in order that we may consider how far the conditions of today make them effective and vital now. We have always believed. and I guess almost everybody is coming to believe. that so far as an industry is an infant industry. it is wise statesmanship to protect it. For my part I am glad that a great statesman and patriot like Henry Clay has lived and left the impress of his great mind upon the industries of this country. It was urged in the days of academic discussion upon this great question by those who favored free trade. that we should allow perfect freedom of exchange of commodities between the nations of the earth in the interests of the consumer. and that we lost nothing by purchasing abroad. and that the duty levied would naturally be an added burden to the consumer. Friends of protection answered that perhaps a burden would result temporarily. but that it was their belief that when the industry was started natural competition would spring up and in a short time the price would fall below even that which obtained before the tariff duties were laid. and time and again in the history of this country has this prophecy and this theory been verified. Today. while I do not claim everything for the protective theory. and while I do not claim everything for any political party. I believe that the stupendous wealth. the vast and diversified industries of our country. its prosperous condition on the whole. and its general advancement. have been largely due to a wise policy of protection to American industries and American labor. It was the thought. however. that the creation and establishment of the industries would by the processes of competition result in general benefit to the American people. and today I say that none of us can afford to be blind to the fact that by reason of the evolution in commerce and trade and business in this country. the vast and mighty combinations and trusts. competition has been suspended and almost wholly throttled. so that we are dealing with an entirely different condition and with new factors in the great industrial problem. It matters not whether you call them combinations or trusts. I am not making any violent tirade against trusts and combinations. I believe it to be a natural evolution. I believe that if combinations and trusts were just and wise and humane. and if they shall be properly controlled and regulated by wise legislation. they may prove. and I believe will ultimately. beneficial to the great American people. If you could combine all the wealth and all the industries of the world. perhaps. under one head. and that head should be wise and just and humane and kindly to all men. I doubt not it would be a boon to the human family. Millions of the hungry would find bread. millious who were cold would find shelter. The evils are not in the combinations which result from the evolution of our day. Their general tendency to multiply the power of production. eliminate waste. and narrow the margin of profits are beneficial. The evil is founded upon the idea of the infinite possibilities of the indithe same old evil. the enemy that has stood since the morning vidual man in America. high and low. rich and poor.

Such men are never sensationalists. though unwaveringly intolerant of private or public wrong. Such men attribute. as a habit of thought. honest motives to others. are in the habit of restraining and governing themselves. and believe therefore in the capacity and right of selfgovernment as inherent in others. are sticklers for the limitation of the powers of political government so as to forestall and prevent the tyranny of majorities and so as to secure the right of individual and local evolutionary progress in freedom. unrestrained except in so far as is necessary to prevent one man or one community or one nation from committing aggression on another. In the family. as in society. they are charitable in nonessentials. while inculcating essentials of character and outgrowing conduct more by example than by precept. leaving much to the childs enlightened sense of duty and individual development. not attempting to mold other human beings in their mold. believing that wife and child. like each of Gods creatures. has a supreme right to live its own life in an atmosphere of guiding and guarding love. Such men. being just and kind. firm of purpose and conduct as well as tolerant and considerate. moderate in all things. not extreme. selfrestrained. not selfassertive. deserve and are sure to have loving and faithful wives. trustful and confiding children. loyal friends. willing servants. few enemies. and the sincere respect of all men.

I think I had shown that rates which are really reasonable rates can not be established� and enforced without first ascertaining the true value of the property of the railroads as a basis for fixing the -reasonable rates which will yield a fair return upon the property of the railroad company. I now propose to show. sir. that railway rates in this. country are at the present time excessive. I know it is urged on all sides that rates are reasonable. that no reductions of importance will be necessary under any law which we may enact. that the important consideration for this body is to frame legislation that will insure equality of rates rather than reasonable rates. that no reductions of importance being required. there will be no necessity for a provision in this bill for the valuation of railway property and no necessity of expending the money and the labor necessary to secure that valuation. The President has been quoted as saying in at least one public address that there has been comparatively little complaint to me of the railroad rates being actually too high. Members of the Commission have been quoted as saying that complaint is made against unequal rather than against unreasonable rates. and Senators upon both sides of this debate have repeatedly declared that there is little complaint as to unreasonable rates. but that the chief complaint is against disqrilnination. Granting this. it establishes nothing except the wide prevalence of complaint as to unjust discrimination. It does not seem to have occurred to anybody that this proves nothing with respect to the reasonableness of existing rates. Can anyone fail to see that there is small chance for the public to know whether rates are reasonable or extortionate? The whole matter is in the hands of the carriers. They have the facts upon which to predicate any approach to exact knowledge. If anyone knows the actual value of their property. they know it. They know the actual cost of operation. and they make the rate without check or hindrance. Is there any reason to suppose that they do not charge all the traffic will bear? We have complaints on all sides of discriminations in violation of law and at the risk of heavy penalties. The railroads can make rates unreasonably high without fear of any punishment. Is it to be believed that they are guilty of violating the law against discrimination by rebates and otherwise. riking all the penalties it imposes. and that they fail to ch.arge all the traffic can bear when there Is not the slightest daoger of punishment for so doing? Ah. but why. then. is it that we have complaint of discrimination in almost every community. and no complaints of unreasonably high charges? It seems to me that the reason is so obvious as scarcely to require statement. There is a standard of comparison in one case. There is none in the other. Complaint is made of discriminations because the rate paid in one instance can be compared with the rate paid in another. There is some basis for comparison. and strong incentive for complaint. But what standard have we for comparison by which to test the question whether rates are too high? What information has the shipper. the producer. the consumer. upon which to base complaint? He does not know what profit the carrier is making. All of the facts essential to form a judgment and lodge a complaint are beyond his reach. Because he formulates no complaint. prosecutes no action. proves neither that he is satisfied nor that he is without cause for complaint. Give the public some criterion. based upon the rules laid down by the Supreme Court. then it will know whether itg rate is just and reasonable. then it will be prepared to resist wrong. Make it the bounden duty of this Commission. arm it with full authority. furnish it ample assistance and money necessary to ascertain the actual value of railroad property. the actual cost of operation. and all the facts upon which to base a standard of reasonable rates. If complaints do not follow. it will then mean something when the President. the Commission. or anybody else says that there are  few complaints with respect to high rates. But. Mr. President. I venture to say that rates are unreasonably high. and that if the opportunity is ever presented to ascertain the value of railroad property. it will result in markedly reducing transportation charges generally throughout the country. Before offering the direct evidence that rates have enormously advanced throughout the country in the last few years I wish to offer some significant testimony. dating from the Granger legislation. Illinois established a warehouse and rhilway commission with authority to fix maximum rates in 1873. The commission appgointed under this law established and has maintained a schedule of transportation charges. Iowa. in 1888. enacted a law creating a commission authorized to make rates. This commuission promulgated a complete schedule of railway charges for that State. No effort has ever been made to amend this legislation. and the railway companies have acquiesced in the rates established by the commission. Under the law the carriers could have gone into court in Illinois or Iowa. attacked and set aside the rates fixed by these two commissions. if it had been possible for them to make it appear that such rates were unreasonable and that they did not afford just compensation for the services rendered. That the rates established by this commission have stood unchallenged by the railroad companies in both States through all the years. must be taken as an admission on the part of the railroads that the rates are not open to complaint on their part. Wisconsin lies immediately north of Illinois and east of Iowa. In 1874 a law was enacted in Wisconsin fixing maximum rates and creating a commission authorized to make changes in the same from time to time. Two years later the railroads secured control of the legislature and repealed that law. From that time until 1905. or for a period of twentynine years. these corporations have been powerful enough to defeat all legislation to regulate trausportation charges in that State. We have. therefore. an opportunity to compare rates in Wisconsin. where the railroads have controlled for twentynine years. with rates in Illinois and Iowa. where they have been controlled and established by State authority. This comparison offers. therefore. I submit. a most excellent test as to whether railroad companies may be trusted. when left without supervision and control. to make rates with due regard to the public interests. The two principal railroads in Wisconsin are the Chicago and Northwestern and the Chicago. Milwaukee and St. Paul. These railway lines likewise run through the States of Illinois and Iowa. With a view to instituting comparison between the railroadmade rates of Wisconsin and the Statemade rates of Illinois and Iowa I arranged all the stations on the St. Paul road and all the stations on the Northwestern road in Wisconsin in tables. showing the number of miles to each station from the principal market. From the published schedules of the railroad companies I obtained and placed in the tables opposite the name of each station the cost of shipping in and out every class and kind of freight. whether in carload lots or less than carload lots. including commodity rates. between each station and its principal market within the State. I then placed side by side with the Wisconsin rates. Iowa rates. fixed by the Iowa commission. for the shipment. in like manner of an equal quantity of the same kind of freight the same distance in that State. The rates for a like number of stations in Illinois. equally distant from market in each case with the Iowa and Wisconsin stations were next obtained and incorporated into the table. I was then in a position to ascertain the exact difference between the socalled reasonable rates established for Wisconsin by the railroads without State regulation with the reasonable rates established under State control in Iowa and Illinois. The comparison thus worked out clearly demonstrated that the railroad companies were exacting from the people of Wisconsin from 20 to nearly 70 per cent higher.rates than they received in Iowa and Illinois for a like and equal service. I may add that the rates in Illinois have been considerably reduced by the commission of that State since these comparisons were made. as is shown by the following telegram recently received in response to an inquiry which I addressed to Governor Deneen: SPRINGFIELD.

I have very great admiration. indeed. for the gentleman from Alabama who makes this motion. I feel perfectly confident that if there is anyone in the House who could give a good reason for the passage of this bill the gentleman from Alabama could have given it in his remarks. I have read.this bill over several times. and I will confess my inability to understand just what is intended to be accomplished by the bill. and the gentleman from Alabama in his remarks did not enlighten the House. He told us the various department officials of the Government were in favor of the bill. Why. of course. Mr. Speaker. the bill was prepared by the head of the MarineHospital Service. who wishes to be the head of the United States health service. and he obtains the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury and the other department officials over him. But we have had presented to us protests from people employed in the MarineHospital Service against this bill. and while it is true the bill comes before the House without a minority report. it is also true that the bill was opposed by almost onehalf of the members of the committee which reported the bill. I do not know to what scope the bill may reach. I do not know from reading the bill just how far it is intended to change the law now in existence in reference to quarantine regulations or health regulations. I defy any member of the House to read this bill through and understand what is intended by it. unless the proposition is to leave absolutely within the control of the new health department the whole subject of health regulations in the United States. Yesterday the House voted down a proposition to pay Hawaii $1.000.000 for stamping out the bubonic plague. but under this bill. I suppose. if it should be enacted into law. the United States health department would have the power to stamp out the bubonic plague and do all the work done by Hawaii wholly at the .expense of the United States Government. But I will confess my inability to understand what was intended to be accomplished by the bill. It is for that reason that I think that this bill properly should be considered by the Committee of the Whole House before it is passed. I want to call the attention of the House to one provision of the bill which probably exemplifies the entire bill. Mr. Speaker. we have recently created a permanent Census Bureau. which has the duty of collecting statistics. There has been a proposition pending before Congress during the present session which may be before the House in the form of a bill at the next session of Congress for the purpose of drawing together in one department the various branches of the Government now engaged in the collection of statistics. The permanent Census Bureau proposes to collect vital statistics. We passed through the House a few days ago a resolution giving that Bureau power to print the vital statistics which they collected. Here is a section of this bill proposing to again duplicate the collection of statistics. The Census Bureau. on the one hand. will collect vital statistics. and the new health office. if this bill passes. on the other hand. will be collecting and publishing the same statistics in another branch of the Government. Section 8 in this bill providesThat to secure uniformity in the registration of mortality. morbidity. and vital statistics it shall be the duty of the SurgeonGeneral of the Public Health and MarineHospital Service. after the annual conference required by section 7 to be called. to prepare and distribute suitable and necessary forms for the collection and compilation of such statistics. and said statistics. when transmitted to the Public Health and MarineHospital Bureau on said forms. shall be compiled and published by the Public Health and MarineHospital Service as a part of the health reports published by said service. I protest. Mr. Speaker. against constantly building up new branches of the Government for the purpose of duplicating the collection of statistics or duplicating the work to be done by some other branch of the Government. For what purpose do we have a Census Bureau. engaged in the collection of statistics. engaged in the collection. compilation. and publication of vital statistics. and then pass a bill for the purpose of duplicating this work in the department of health? I have been unable to find in this bill a specific requirement covering any. other subject of importance. But of course if the bureau or department of health shall have the power to collect vital statistics. that means the building up of another great census bureau of the Government. The collection of mortality. morbidity. and vital statistics is a work of importance. It is also one which requires a great number of employees. In every branch of the Government. in every county and town almost of the country. it would be necessary to have employees of this new department of health engaged in the collection. of these vital statistics. and side by side with their collection and publication would be the Census Office engaged in the.same work. Mr. Speaker. we now have a Bureau of Statistics in the Treasury Department. We have a collection of statistics in the Labor Department. We have a Bureau of Statistics in the State Department. We collect statistics in the Agricultural Department. We have gone so far that today there are two branches of the Agricultural Department collecting and publishing the same statistics or statistics upon the same subject."},{"1":"1901","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"No. I fully understand the Senator. I am only sorry that with the weight of his name and influence his amendment had not gone further. I fully understand the Senators position and am very glad to do so. I hold here a paper published in Manila containing a pretended legislative bill. These five men set themselves up as a legislature and they go through all the forms of legislatures. They introduce bills and they read them the first. second. and third time and pronounce them passed. just as if they were a legislative body. the only difference being that instead of being in the name of the Government of the United States. as is set out in the Taft report. they are all of them by authority of the President of the United States. Here is a harbor bill which appropriates a million dollars in gold out of the revenues of the people of the Philippine Islands to improve the harbor of Manila1.000.000 at one time. and they set up and go through the form of legislating with a presiding officer and a man getting up and making a speech as if he were in a legislative body. Now. Mr. President. I care not how honest the Taft Commission is. that million dollars is a part of the prey that these harpies will succeed in taking to themselves. I am toldI do not know whether it is a myth or notthat one of the old grayback sharks will sight an Atlantic liner at SandyHook and follow it to Queenstown to take the plunder that may fall overboard. I have no doubt that when the Taft Commission sailed for Manila there were other sharks who sighted the prey and followed them there. Mr. President. if the Philippine amendment to this bill had passed as it was introducedas it was reported by the committee and before the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts had been attached to itthere would have been in the Philippine Islands the greatest orgie of plunder. of jobbery. and of spoliation that the world ever saw. With 68.000.000 acres of land. with rich mines. with fertile lands. with gold and copper and iron and coal. there would have been an inconceivable amount of plunder. Oh. Mr. President. plunder is not the word. It is loot. They would have looted the island. and they would have come away from there so heavily laden with prey that they could scarcely have borne the burden of their spoil. Now. Mr. President. the Philippine amendment has been very much improved by the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts. but I do not think it goes far enough. I do not suggest it because it was offered by myself. but I think the amendment offered by myself goes further and is better adapted to the situation. It did not originate with me. I copied it from the Porto Rican law that this Congress passed in reference to franchises in Porto Rico. I quoted it literally. only changing it so as to make it adapted to the situation there instead of Porto Rico. I will read first the provision in the Porto Rican law: Provided. however. That all laws enacted by the legislative asscmbly shall be reported to the Congress of the United States. which hereby reserves the power and authority. if deemed advisable to annul the same. To that extent the amendment off ered by me is a literal verbatim copy of the Porto Rican law. Then the other part of it in the Porto Rican law is as follows: Provided. however. That all grants of franchises. rights. privileges. or concessions of a public or quasipublic nature shall be made by the executive council with the approval of the governor. and all franchises granted in Porto Rico shall be reported to Congress. which hereby reserves the power to annul or modify the same. As they have no executive council there I changed the additional proviso in my amendment so as to read as follows: And provided further. That all laws enacted by any governmental authority created under the powers conferred by this act shall be reported to the Congress of the United States. which hereby reserves the power and authority. if deemed advisable. to annul the same. I desire simply to call attention to this. Of course. if the Senate thinks the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts goes far enough. I have nothing more to say about it. I would be glad. however. to have him personally examine it. Now. Mr. President. the point to which I want to call the attention of the Senate in this connection is this: When the original Porto Rican bill was presented to the Senate. it contained a provision in it exactly like that the Senator from Massachusetts has put in his amendment. to wit. that the franchises should be approved by the President. and after full examination and discussion the Senate struck out those words and put it. as the Senator will find it in the Porto Rican law. that they should be reported to Congress. which reserved the power to annul the same if they deemed it advisable. It is true. as I say. the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts is a vast improvement to the bill. and I anticipate that these harpies. these plunderers. these exploiters. who have already in imagination grown fat on 68.000.000 acres of public land and on all the mines and fertile lands. will lose much of their interest in this act when they find that to that extent they have been robbed of their prey Mr. President. I have but a few more words to say. and as there will not be time for me to speak separately as to the Cuban matter. I desire to say a word in reference to that without its discussion. I can not vote for the Cuban amendment. and I will state my reason for it. I believe that the future of Cuba is necessarily identified with the future of the United States. and it is not in antagonism to that view that I decline to vote for this Cuban amendment. I do so on two grounds. In the first place. I do not think that the amendment is in harmony with the pledge which we made when we went to war with Spain. I think that we are bound by that pledge. Mr. President. That pledge is not consistent with the pronunciation by us of an ultimatum to the people of Cuba. saying that we will not release them from military control until they comply with that ultimatum. I know that it is common for people to disparage the action of the Senate in the adoption of the clause recognizing the independence of the people of Cuba in the resolution declaring war against Spain. which says: Fourth. That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty. jurisdiction. or control over said island except for the pacification thereof. and asserts its determination. when that is accomplished. to leave the government and control of .the island to its people. I know that some who were not then members of this body are disposed to ridicule that resolution as a piece of silly sentiment. But. Mr. President. it was not a sentiment. That declaration was made under very solemn circumstances. at a time when we thought it was prudent and good policy to make the declaration. At the time we went to war with Spain we did not know but that we had entered upon a worlds war. At the time when we stripped ourselves for the conflict. when we flung down the gage of battle. we did not know but that the whole of Europe would be at the back of Spain. That was then a serious apprehension. Mr. President. I recollect very well the language to me of the President of the United States at the time when there was great travail. great doubt. great labor and trouble in the effort to determine upon what was a wise course then to be pursued. The President of the United States invited expressions of opinion not only from Republicans. but from Democrats. and I remember distinctly that on a day I received an invitation with another Democratic Senator to go to the White House and confer with the President about the then serious and difficult situation. I am happy to do here what I have done. I think. heretofore in this presence. if not here. certainly elsewhere. on every occasion. to do the justice to say of the President that he was most earnestly opposed to war. that he most earnestly desired the preservation of peace. and I remember. distinctly as we parted in the Cabinet room. the last words he said to us were. Senators. remember if we have war it may be a worlds war. Now. Mr. President. in the presence of such an emergency as that. in the presence of so great a danger as that. we deemed it proper to stand before the whole world. when we did not know but that we had chalenged their hostility. and say to them. We desire no aggrandizement by this war. we do not go to war for the purpose of acquiring Cuba. we want you to understand it is our desire that you shall hold your hands off. that our only desire is to do justice to these people and produce a peaceful situation in that country. Therefore. under that solemn. under that serious condition of affairs. with the utmost good faith and for the purpose. not of highflown sentiment. but for the purpose of our personal protection against a threatened danger which we apprehended. we said to all the world. Our purpose is simply to produce a condition that is tolerable there. to stop this inhumanity. and to bring about peace in our own home sphere. and when we shall have done that. we pledge ourselves we will make no attempt to take this island. when we have pacified those people we will withdraw and leave their affairs to them alone. We declare solemnly before the world that they are. and of a right ought to be. free and independent. and we will be true to that declaration. Now. I say that was not a matter of sentiment. It was a great and a solemn asseveration made for a high purpose. deemed essential to our own safety. Mr. President. if I desired above all things the acquisition of Cuba I would do nothing which would be in conflict either with the letter or with the spirit of that asseveration which we then made under those trying circumstances. Therefore. Mr President. while I have the utmost deference and respect for the committee which have brought in this amendment. according to my view the amendment is not consistent with the obligation which we then solemnly took in the presence of the world. Cuba can not be free and independent if we can enforce these restraints upon her. If we are determined to violate our pledge. why stop half way? In that case we should go the whole way and take the island without reservation. Mr. President. I will state another reason why. with the utmost respect for the committee. I must decline to vote for the amendment. I believe. as I have already said. that the future of Cuba will certainly be identified with that of the United States. It may take a little longer time to bring about a proper understanding. but I think the future relations of the Cuban people with ours should be so carefully guarded that they will not be affected by any irritation which might result from an ultimatum presented by us to them at this time. I am in favor of assisting them in the effort to bring about a condition of good government in their island. I am in favor of assisting them in all proper ways. but Mr. President. I am not in favor of irritating their spirit of love for independence by now flaunting in their faces the demand that they shall agree to that in the very inception which is the acknowledgment that they are not an independent people. but that they are a subject people. who must do whatever we demand of them. There is one provision in the Cuban amendment in which my section is deeply interested. That is the provision to insure the sanitation of the island. That is of extreme importance. and I have no doubt that will be carefully guarded. whatever plan of settlemuent is adopted. I am confident that more can be accomplished through a plan which does not irritate the Cubans. for at last we must largely depend upon their willingness to make this sanitation effective. Mr. President. this much I thought proper that I should say concerning Cuba. To return to the question of the Philippine Islands. I want to repeat that I regard this as the most vicious and pernicious legislation which the country has ever known to be proposed in these legislative halls. for while. as suggested by the Senator from Wisconsin. the question of union or disunion was a more serious one. it was not a legislative question. I want to repeat that there is no bill in this Senate. or which can come to the Senate. the passage of which I would be willing to secure by in any manner or in any degree withdrawing the slightest of all the opposition which I have to this bill. I want to say further. Mr. President. that while there is no bill which I would secure the passage of by withdrawing my opposition to this bill. there is no bill to which I am so opposed that I would secure its defeat by withdrawing opposition to this bill. I repeat what I said beforethat while I am utterly opposed to the subsidy bill. I would rather see ten subsidy bills passed than this bill. If Senators on the other side think that Senators on this side arc relaxed in their opposition to it or in their desire to see its defeat. let me say to them that they will see in this vote a more unanimous Democratic party than has ever showed itself in any vote that has been cast in this Chamber in the present Congress. Mr. President. I again repeat. an extra session has no terrors for me. I would be willing to resort to any of these devices if anybody could show me they would result in a permanent defeat of this amendment. I am ready to follow anybody or anything that will show that permanently we can defeat thils measure. which. I think. in all respects is a most iniquitous measure. I was speaking just now of the commercial question. I was trying to express the idea that there was something higher than commercial considerations in this great question. and in discussing that idea I want to read something from a man who. while lie belongs to a different political party from myself. has my unbounded admiration as a man of ability. a man of integrity. a man of great learning. a man of unsurpassed patriotism. one who was once an honored member of this body. and who now. in dignified retirement. has the honor to be an exPresident of the United States. Indima not only should be proud of him. but the whole country. Republicans not only should be proud of him. but every true American citizen. In an article published in the North American Revitw of January of this yeara most instructive article. one of great logic and powerthis great and good man concluded with these words: One who has retired from the service. but not from the love of his country. must be pardoned if he finds himself unable to rejoice in the acquisition of lans and forests and mines and commerce at the cost of the abandonment of the old American idea that a government of absolute powers is an intolerable thing. and under the Constitution of the United States an impossible thing. The view of the Constitution I have suggested will not limit the power of territorial expansion. but it will lead us to limit the use of that power to regions that may safely become a part of the United States and to peoples whose American citizenship may be allowed. It hs been said that the flash of Deweys guns in Manila Bay revealed to the American people a new mission. I like rather to think of them as revealing the same old misason that we read in the flash of Washingtons guns at Yorktown. God forbid that the day should ever come when. in the American mind. the thought of a man as a consumer shall submerge the old American thought of man as a creature of God. endowed with unalienable rights."},{"1":"1900","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"No. I do not think that is true. I think the gentlemen of the committee that had the bill in charge did their very best. and used a good deal of labor and intelligence in trying to frame that feature of the bill so that it would not interfere with any legitimite trade transaction. or with these secret societies. I do not think it is amenable to that objection."},{"1":"1899","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Speaker. I think I am not unduly sensitive in regard to reflections in the public prints. and if this were an ordinary disparaging remark it would be of no earthly consequence. but it is not only disparaging. it is incriminating. It not only involves the mind. but the morals as well. If it is true. I ought not to be here. if my constituents believed it. they would not and ought not to send me here. It implies total insensibility to the obligations of duty as well as of propriety of conduct in this House. and it is calculated to injure. if the bad pen of a bad man can ever harm anyone. And that it may be identified in the future. wherever it may appear. I here and now brand it a baseless falsehood. a cowardly and brutal calumny. You will remember that since the time of the Long Parliament it has been regarded as more or less scandalous for members of deliberative bodies to sleep in their seats while business was in progress. It will be remembered that in that celebrated Parliament a member moved that such scandalous members as slept in their seats when business is in progress should be put out. Later. showing the disesteem in which Parliament held sleeping members. an honorable lord. voicing the sense of the scandalous conduct of such members. in the midst of a speech exclaimed. referring to another noble lord. Even in the midst of these perils the noble lord is asleep. Now. my observation is that the men who are employed as correspondents of the newspapers of the country from this House are. as a rule. conspicuously able. honest. fair. and generous. and it has been my singularly good fortune to have received uniformly at their hands not only conspicuous fairness. but more than generous kindness. But I find. Mr. Speaker. that there are two classes of correspondents. One of them consists of the honorable members of that noble guild. the other consists of the dastard who penned the lines which have just been read by the Clerk. It is easily seen that employment of that kind enjoys the obvious advantage of requiring neither genius nor knowledge. neither industry nor brightness. to prosecute it. There are those who eke out a precarious livelihood by bearing false witness against a brother. and this man may dishonor a noble profession with his pen. He has done so in this instance. The qualification that he requires consists only of insensibility to truth and contempt of shame. and these qualifications can be quickly acquired by a short apprenticeship to the father of lies and a brief novitiate in the study of villainy. I do not think. Mr. Speaker. that this man had any malice against me. The paragraph seems to indicate that. for he lied without any discrimination. he lied in my favor as well as against me. for he gave me credit for being constantly in my seat. He did not seem to be aware of my forced absence from my seat during a considerable part of the last session. and my attendance has been intermittent during this session. frequently on account of the state of my health. So that if his wickedness was general. his malice is quite mistaken. and it fell in this instance upon me by the merest accident. and illustrates. Mr. Speaker. the caprice of chance. that his wild firing of this blunderbuss of lies happened to strike one who not only for the last ten months could not. if he would. have slept in his seat in this Chamber. but who has not been able in that time to sleep in his bed. where all the surroundings woo to slumber. but a small fraction of the hours that nature allots to that sweet. restoring function. I have said enough. Mr. Speaker. If I desired for motives of public good to admonish this individual in the future not to take up his pen except in veracious intervals. however infrequently they may occur. if I desired to incase him in a frame that would exhibit his character for picturesque lying in suitable impressiveness. I would borrow the verbal setting employed by another. under like provocation to characterize a similar moral delinquency. and say. that if this individual had been born a beast. he would have been a panther. if he had been born a bird. he would have been a buzzard. if a fish. he would have been a mud cat. if a reptile. he would have been a iizzard. if an insect. he would have been a bedbug. but being born of the human species. he could only be a vicious liar."},{"1":"1898","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. this bill. which was prepared by the chairman of the Committee on Labor. was. it will be observed. introduced on the 27th of January. 1898before there was any war going on outside of the House of Representatives.

I wouldathousandtimes rather take the chances of the Government being reimbursed in that way than take the chances of a successful recovery through a lot of lawsuits to be instituted in courts in different parts of this country. suits involving transactions thirty years old. when parties and witnesses are dead. when evidence is lost. and when the Government of the United States can not go into court with any greater or higher privilege or right than any citizen of the country.. That is the distinction I make. and if the gentleman from Louisiana or anybody else on this floor chooses to differ with me. I have no controversy with him. My judgment is that this bill is the best remedy that can be proposed at this time. that this is what Congress ought to adopt. and if an adjustment can be made upon any such terms as are proposed in this bill. I repeat what I said before. that it will be a subject of congratulation for both the Govermnent and the people of the United States. Now. Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the House. your committee has done its part. it has given to this great question most earnest and painstaking considerationits best labor and efforts. The bill as reported represents the unanimous conclusion of the committee. as to the only lines upon which a settlement would be recommended. I do not wish to violate the confidence of the committee room in statingwhat the gentleman from Louisiana. if he was present at the meeting of the committee. will confirmthat a condition imposed upon these companies requiring them to extinguish this first mortgage and to give the Government a first lien as security for its indebtedness would be a solution of this problem which would meet the approval of the judgment of the committee. and which they would agree to report to the House in preference to recommending foreclosure proceedings or proceed: ings looking to the ownership of the road by the Government. Such is the measure before you. As I stated a moment ago. the Union Pacific Company has been fifteen months in the hands of receivers. That road embraces a great railway system with a mileage of over 8.000 miles running through and developing all that great expanse of Western country. The financial situation of the last two years has affected it. It is now in the custody of receivers appointed by the United States courts. and I should like to know how. until there is some reorganization of this company. until it makes some adjustment of the indebtedness due the United States. anybody else can take possession of that property."},{"1":"1894","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"I have referred somewhat to the supposition that there are in New England certain men who desire free raw materials in order that they may manufacture more cheaply and by retaining protective duties upon their products make moreimoney. That has been the motive at the bottom of every New England argument for free raw materials. but the true protectionist and Republican disavows and scouts any such argument. The doctrine of free raw material is. as was intimated. perhaps said. by the Senator from Massachusetts this morning. concentrated selfishness. The- man who thinks that by destroying the industry of mining ore in this country and transferring it to Spain. Africa. and. Cuba he can make a little more on his product has an idea of bisiness. of morals. and of ethics which I can not entertain and which I can not understand. Protection is based upon that old motto which ought to be dear to every American.  Live and let live. The manufacturers of New England and the workingmen of New England. though they suffer many disadvantages as compared with other sections of the country. are quite content that other persons. other manufacturers. and other workingmen in other sections of the couantry..and all persons engaged in any industry. in any occupation. shall have the same rights. the same protection from the Government. the same opportunity for advancement which they desire for themselves in New England. If it be true that a duty of 40 cents a ton is such a revenue duty as will triple the importations of iron ore. as has been suggested here. and practically give away a half or a third of our industry. then it simply means that a half or a third of the men engaged in mining occupations in this country are to be turned out upon the cold charities of the heartless world. It does not mean that they are to. tke lower wages. When you reduce by onehalf or onethird the mining of iron ore in the United States. you thrust out of employment. and the opportunity of employment. onehalf or onethird of the men engaged in that occupation. it is no. longer a question with the miner whether he can. get remunerative wages or higher wages. it is this result. that the work which he has been doing is transferred to Spain or Africa or Cuba. and is done there. I believe that is to be just the result of a duty of 40 cents a ton on iron ore. That is why I am opposed to it. I do not know what the rest of the Senators upon this side of the Chamber may do. I donot know how farImay conform my will to their judgment if they should decide to do otherwise than what I think is right and just in this matter. but for myself I do not want to vote for a duty of 40 cents a ton on ore any more than I want to vote for free iron ore. Thereason why I do not wish to so vote is because it is possible that under a duty of 40 cents a ton the industry may struggle along in some way in this country. but it will be at the expense of turning out of employment from a third to a half of the miners who are engaged in. it and the reduction of the wagesof the rest of them to a basis which will enable the mineowner to compete with the industry in Cuba and elsewhere. A letter was read here showing how our people are investing their capital and have invested their capital in foreign countries in the mining of iron ore. Let a duty of only 40 cents a ton be put on iron ore. and. you transfer not only labor. business. and. industry but capital from this country to countries where iron ore may be more easily and cheaply mined. For that reason. unless I should find a disagreement between myself and the other Senators upon this side of the Chamber. I propose. if the amendment. fixing the duty at 60 cents a ton which I propose shall not be adopted. to vote against the duty of 40- cents a ton. It is a revenue duty. it is a revenue duty at theexpeuse of American industries. American capital. and American labor. The pending bill is constructed just along the lines I have indicated by reference to this duty. I am out of patience with the talk that the bill is a protective bill. The bill proceeds upon two lines scarcely denied. really confessed. and that is that where aggregated capital has been able to make itself felt in Democratic councils. it has obtained in some instances protective duties and. in other instances duties with which the industries can struggle along. but where aggregated capital has not been able to make its voice felt. the industries are to be slaughtered and the workingmen are to be ruined. Irn a paper Which was read. here this morning something was. said to the effect that Mr. Rockafeller is behind the duty of 40 cents per .ton on iron ore. He is a man of great wealth. I understand. but he does not seem to have had the success with the committee that the greater wealth represented by the sugar trust has had. They have got practically what they wanted. If Mr. ilbekafeller is back of the iron industry. he has got far less than he needs in order to carry on the business in successful competition with the business of other countries. I could not help recurring to the old story in the school books of Lord Chief Justice Hale in England. to whose information and understamding it came that down in a remote town in the eastern part of England justice was not properly administered. and a younger son. destroying his fathers will. had seized upon the estate of the elder brother. and had so worked upon the court and the judge. and corruption and bribery were so prevalent that it was quite probable that he was going to succeed and thus oust his brother out of his rights. The attorney in the case complained to Lord Chief Justice Hale. and the lord chief justice went down there and putting on a complete suit of the millers best. disguised himself as a miller I think I will read this account of his actions. It is very interesting. Armed with a millers hat and shoes and stick. away he marches to Chelmford. and procured good lodging. suitable for the assizes that should come on next day. When the trials came on. he walked. like an ignorant country fellow. backwards and forwards along the county hall. He had a thousand eyes within him. and when the court began to fill. he found out the poor fellow who was plaintiff. As soon as he came into the hall the miller drew up to him. Honest friend. said he. how is your cause likely to go today? Why. replied the plaintiff. my cause is in a very precarious situation. and if I lose it I am ruined for life. Well. honest friend. replied the miller. if you will take my advice I will let you into a secret. which perhaps you do not know. Every Englishman has the right and privilege to except against any one juryman through the whole twelve. Now. doyou insist upon your privilege. without giving a reason why. and. if possible. get me chosen in his room. and I will do you all the service in my power. Accordingly. when the clerk had called over the names of the jurymen. the plaintiff excepted to one of them. The judge on the bench was highly offended with this liberty. What do you mean. said he. by excepting against that gentlemen?. I mean. my lord. to assert my privilege as an Englishman. without giving a reason why. The judge. who had been highly bribed. in order to conceal it by a show of candor. and having a confidence in the superiority of his party. said. Well. sir. as you claim your privilege in one instance I will grant it. Whom would you wish to have in the room of that man excepted? After a short time. taken in consideration.  y lord. says he. I wish to have an honest man chosen in. and looking round the court.  My Lord. there is that miller in the court. we will have him. if you please. Accordingly. the miller was chosen. As soon as the clerk of the court had given them all their oaths. a little dexterous fellow came into the apartment and slipped 10 guineas into the hands of eleven Jurymen. and gave the miller hut five. He observed that they were all bribed as well as himself. and said to his next neighbor. in a whisper. How much have you got? Ten pieces. said he. But he concealed what he had got himself. The cause was opened by the plaintiffs counsel. and all the scraps of evidence they could pick up were adduced in his favor. The younger brother was provided with a great number of witnesses and pleaders. all plentifully bribed as well as the judge. The evidence deposed that they were in the selfsame country when the brother died and saw him buried. The counselors pleaded upon &his accumulated evidence and everything went with a full tide in favor of the younger brother. The judge summed up the evidence with great gravity and deliberation: And now. gentlemen of the Jur . said he. lay yourhoads together and bring in your verdict as you shall Keem most just. They waited but a few minutes before they determined in favor of the younger brother. The judge said. Gentlemen. are you agreed. and who shall speak for you? We are all agreed. my lord. replied one. our foreman shall speak for us. Hold. my lord. replied the miller. we are not all agreed. Why. said the judge in a very surly manner. whats the matter with you? What reasons have you for disagreeing ? I have several reasons. my lord. replied the miller. the first is. they have given to all these gentlemen of the jury ten broad pieces of gold and to me but five. which. you know. is not fair. Besides. I have many objections to make to the false reasonings of the pleaders and the contradictory evidence of the witness.es Upon this. the miller beganto discourse. which discovered such penetration of judgment. such extensive knowledge of law. and was expressed with such enegetic and manly eloquence. that astonished the judge and the whole court. As he was going on with his powerful demonstrations the judge. in a surprise of soul. stopped him. Where did you come from. and who are you? I came from Westminster Hall. replied the miller. my name is Matthew Hale. I am Lord Chief Justice of the Kings Bench. I have observed the iniquity of your proceedings this day. therefore. come down from a seat which you are no ways worthy to hold. You are one of the corrupt parties in this iniquitous business. 1 will come up this moment and try the cause. all over again. If Mr. Rockefeller is really interested in this matter he is in the position of the miller on the jury. He has received only five pieces of gold while the sugar trust has received its ten pieces of gold. and he ought to remonstrate. Mr. President. I wish to say one word about this matter of aggregated capital. We who desire that the protective system established in this country. under which the country has grown up and been developed. shall be continued have been told that we were trying to favor the trusts. that protection was controlled by trusts. that it had no reference to and no care for the people. that it was building up the few. the great robber barons. with their concentrated capital and their combinations. and the Democrats carried the election of 1892 because they made some people.believo that their charges were true. when they were untrue. I believe in protecting every industry. I would not discriminate against capital engaged in industry. nor would I discriminate for it. That has b)een the position of the Republican party. but the things whi6h the Democrats have charged against us have come true in the preparation of the pending bill. It is a bill to protect and foster accumulated capital and concentrated business. and to destroy capital which has not greatly accumulated or combined. It is a bill to protect and enable the great corporations and the great industries. with their great accumulations of capital. to go on making money rapidly or in some instances to go on by the reduction of labor. but when it comes to these small industries. which are the stay of our business society as of our social order. they have no consideration in the bill. The greater the concentration of capital. the stronger the capitalistic influence. the more perfect is the protection proposed by the bill. It can be graduated by the extent of the capital invested. Capital has been able to make itself heard here. When you come to a man with $10.000 capital or $100.000 capital. he has no consideration whatever in the bill. Mr. President. the great aggregation of capital in business and the dwindling opportunity. as it appears. for a man to emerge from the ranks of the workingmen and by commencing in a small way build up a business which shall be profitable and brine- him a reasonable accumulation of capital. is one of the thinks in this country that may well engage the profoundest thought of the political economist. That thing has been changing. not only here. but all over the world. Thu time used te be when the manufacturer employed a few hands. met the man who wanted to come and labor for him. met him personally. sat down and k to him. went. perhaps. outside of the door and sat down on a log. and. like the Yankees. whittled a little. and came to a conclusion and made a contract. their minds met. There was the aggregatio nentium of the contract. and a certain social relation was established between the employer and the employed. The employer felt an interest in his employ6. saw him every day. took an interest in his family. The employ6 took an interest in the welfare of his employer. aid so there grew up between them that mutual understanding derived from mutual acquaintance and personal contact which. as it seems to me.-was the best foundation of civil order. But in these later days that is all changed. Manufacturing and all other business has been concentrating more and more into the hands of the few. Immense capital has taken up all kinds of business. whether it be manufacturing. or mining. or transportation. or merchandise. or even farming. The capitalist no longer meets the man who desires to be employed. There is no longer any mutual relations between the two. The capital perhaps is furnished by many men. The establishment is directed by an agent. and a man is employed by a foreman. He never sees the man who is carrying on the business. and so there arises friction. The interests of the two are not supposed to be identical. The employ6 thinks that his interest and the interest of his employer are diverse. The employer does not stop to see whether his interest and the interest of the man whom he employs are the same. So there spriigs up disturbance between them. And the Demeratic party that has been out of power has been seeking to ferment that disturbance by appealing to the prejudice of the man who is employed. It is unfortunate to my mind that this condition of things became necessary. Aggregated capital carrying on business of any sort is not the result of protection. There is no protection in silver mining or gold mining. there is no protection in wholesale or retail merchandise. there is no protection in transportation. there is no protection in telegraphs. there is no protection in a large portion of the business which is carried on in this country. Yet capital combines. England is the home of combinations and trustsfreetrade England. That is the di. rection of the age. It has many advantages. but it has this one thing to be dreaded and feared. and that is that the workingmen will not respect the interests or the rights of the capitalists. Now. the Democratic party. which has been trying to foment disturbance between the workingman and the capitalists and has been promising the workingmen that if he will put the Democratic party in power and elect its Presiddnt and give it both Houses of Congress it would regard him rather than the capitalist. has prepared a bill here the inevitable tendency of which must be still further to blot out the minor industries and still further to augment the great capitalistic enterprises of the country still further to concentrate capital. still further. if we were to use the langtuage which we hear so often. to enslave the workingman. Is not that true? A duty of 40 cenfs a ton on coal is but an illustration of this whole bill. an illustration which will drive out the small mines. which will concentrate the business into a few hands. There have been a few free raw material men in New England. there are so still. They are Democrats and Mugwumps. but they are men who believe that with free wool they can crush out all the smaller woolen mills and practically control in one combined capital the woolen manufacturing business of the United States. That is just what this bill is framed to bring about. I repel the charge that protection has been to enable combined capital and trusts to make money. with the assertion that this bill if it passes will compel the smaller industries to combine in order for selfpreservation. and it will be lucky if by further combinations of capital among the small and struggling establishments of the country they keep from bankruptcy. But this great aggregation of capital will go on under the bill with increased rapidity and with constantly increasing deleterious effects upon our social order. How the Democratic party have come to this. how they have abandoned the professions of their lives. we may not inquire. but we may take the confessions made on this floor and we have the astonishing condition of things. the admitted condition of thines. that here is the Democratic party. with a majority of Democratic Senators on this floor who desire free iron ore. surrendering to the few who will not have it."},{"1":"1893","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mir. Speaker. I comefrom a district. the largest in area and population of any within the Empire State of the Mississippi Valley. and from its plains in the east to its mountain tops in the west comes to me but one voice. that of earnest. solemn protest against the passage of the bill introduced by the distinguished gentleman from West Virginia . I should be untrue to myself. Mr. Speaker. untrue to the constituency I represent. and untrue to the people of that great State. did I not. here and now. oppose this measure which so vitally affects their interests. Sir. I do not believe. in the entire history of our Government. a question so important has ever engaged the attention of Congress. The discussions of 1860. indeed. had their full and momentous space. but after all they related simply to a contest which was to be decided by the sword. and the result of which in no event involved AngloSaxon slavery. But today we are confronted with a proposition. in the farreaching effects of which. as I stated in the last Congress. may be seen the financial serfdom of the American people. All history shows that individual and political bondage follows financial subjection. The debtor is the slave of the creditor. and where conditions are created by law that make impossible the abolition of such relation. then indeed is despotism supreme and perpetual. We had as well look this question squarely in the face. The people will not. this time. be deceived by any catch phrases and glittering generalities. Whoever shall in this contest by his vote strike a blow direct or indirect against silver. will be branded as a monometallist in letters that will stick to him as long as he lives. In season and out of season. in the darkness and in the light. in the populous city and the lonesome forest. he will feel and know that he has arrayed himself against silver as a money of final redemption. . Mr. Speaker. for more than eighty years prior to 1873 we were on the bimetallic standard. Silver was as good as gold. Hand in hand marched the two metals on their beneficent mission. Gentlemen have undertaken to show that during this reriod sometimes silver was worth a little less. sometimes a ittle more. than gold. but all their herculean efforts have simply resulted in demonstrating that the relative value of the two was not only practically equal. but that the standard was automatic and equilibratory. Why it seems to me as plain a proposition as can be. that the value of money is determined entirely by the demand for it. and if for example the value of gold should rise superior to that of silver. there would then be no demand for it. but for the other metal. and vice versa. This is that constant automatic action which tends to form an equilibrium between the two metals at the ratio fixed. spoken of by Sir Guilford Molesworth. On the other hand. a single standard is an impossibility. How shall a thing measure itself by itself ? But it is not my purpose to theorize. A few plain facts and practical suggestions are worth more than all the systems of finance in the world. This bill proposes a simple and unconditional repeal of the purchasing clause of the Sherman act. It proposes not only to stop further silver purchases. but also further silver coinage. No substitute or measure of relief is offered in its place. Indeed. its open and avowed advocates plainly tell us that its intention is to place the country upon a single gold standard. That this is the full determination of the President is clearly gathered from the message he has sent us. True. gentlemen on this floor. whose sincerity I do not question. and whose acumen I certainly recognize. have told us that the President is a bimetallist and the fast friend of silver. He was elected upon a bimetallic platform. he could have been elected upon no other. but this message. I repeat. is an unequivocal declaration of war on silver. It is an Executive pronuneinmento that the time has now arrived when this Government should adopt the monetary system of Europe. A more straightforward document in the interest of gold as the sole monetary standard could not have been penned and sent out from Lombard or Wall street. It will bring joy and gladness to the financial vampires that are ever sucking the life blood of the people. and sorrow and despair to the toiling and producing millions. Mr. Speaker. the provision in the measure retaining the present silver circulation in our currency will deceive nobody. Gold will be the sovereign standard to which all other values must bow. The tremendous power now lodged in Wall street at its pleasure to contract the volume of money. thereby proportionately decreasing all property and labor values will be multiplied many fold. Push but the veil aside. and the abyss meets our vision. Mr. Speaker. I have before me a statement from the Treasury Department showing the amount of gold and silver coins and certificates in circulation in the United States up to the first of the present month. from which it appears that our stock of gold is $604.000.000 and our stock of silver $615.000.000. The per capita circulation of gold and silver combined. therefore. is in round numbers $18. and of gold alone $9.01. It is. then. proposed to put this nation. with a population of 67.066.000 upon a per capita circulation of $9. For again let me repeat. all other kinds of money will be measured by gold. There will not then be even a Sherman law to protect silver from utter annihilation. Mr. Speaker. I will not lend myself to this unholy scheme. To the already fastmoving march of the classes over the masses I will not by my vote add the momentum of law. Sir. I am no defender of the Sherman act. It is. indeed. as characterized in the Chicago platform. acowardly makeshift. But. sir. it is the only law within the statute books that at all recognizes silver as money. Sir. I shall vote for all of Mr. BLANDS substitutes. first. for the ratio of 16. and then on to 20. These all failing. I shall vote to restore the Bland act. Still failing. I shall vote first. last. and all the time against unconditional repeal. believing that the President will veto any subsequent measure favoring silver. and shall rely in confidence for approval upon my constituents. to whom alone I owe allegiance. Sir. what reasons are given for this tremendous change in our monetary system? Gentlemen glibly tell us that this step has become imperative by reason of the excessive silver production relatively to gold. It is on a par with other statements sent out by the enemies of silver. The silver production of last year was less in this country than in the preceding year. and the commercial value of all the silver produced in the whole world last year was only $2.000.000 greater than the value of all the gold produced. Here are the figures: Gold production in 1892. $130.816.600. Silver production in 1892. $133.054.000. Where is that cataclysm of silver which is to bury the world deeper than plummet ever sounded? But this is hardly half the truth. The production of silver. relatively to gold. is now smaller than it was at any time from 1801 to 1840. The following is the average production of both metals for each year of the present century: 18011820. 4 of silver to 1 of gold. 18211840. 2 of silver to 1 of gold. 18411860. 2J of gold to 1 of silver. 18611880. 2 of gold and 1 of silver. 18811889. more silver than gold. Or. to put it in another form. for the first twenty years of the century we had in this country 300 per cent more silver than gold. the second twenty years 100 per cent more. and now only 16 per cent more. Let us not be blind to facts. The crusade that has been waged in the interest of gold has been a crusade of slander and misrepresentation. But we are told. Mr. Speaker. that our silver coinage is becoming every year relatively greater than gold. This also is a misrepresentation. For thirtythree years after 1806 we coined more than $47.000.000 in silver and less than twentythree millions in gold. We had then more than $2 in silver for every $1 in gold. Today we have less full legaltender money in silver than in gold. and counting all kinds of silver money. including the seventyseven million limited tender. our silver stock is only eleven millions greater than our entire gold stock. Thus this claim of the monogold metallist falls to the ground. But it is said. sir. that the silver is a debased and depreciated dollar. In 1873 silver was worth more than gold. It commanded a premium in the money markets. What struck down its value? The fiat of law. the demonetization act of 1873. a measure that was passed clandestinely through Congress. that was signed by President Grant in ignorance of the poisoned chalice contained in the cup. and that received the careful revision and supervision of Ernst Seyd. a London banker. as evidenced in the report submitting that bill to the House. The law can create a demand for money and thereby give to it a value. or it may destroy that demand and thereby destroy its value as money. Sir. who does not remember. when the clouds hung dark and threatening in 1860. gold. true to its cowardly and unpatriotic instincts in all times of need or peril. fled and deserted the country. and the mighty power of law created a money which furnished the sinews of war in the most gigantic internecine strife of history. No. it was the act of 1873 that first depreciated silver as money. Afterwards. when the BlandAllison and Sherman act respectively sought. as it was then supposed. to restore it to partial coinage. its price immediately rose. but almost as immediately fell when it was discovered that those measures were being executed in a way to discredit silver. Mr. Speaker. I have no disposition here to quote the freesilver utterances of the present Secretary of the Treasury. they are a part of our history. they are recorded in the official proceedings of Congress. and they will stand there to confront him as long as he lives. But I want to say right here. from the day Mr. Carlisle entered upon the duties of his great office down to the present time. no act of his has been friendly to silver. or has varied in the least from the policy of his Republican predecessor. Our silver dollar is selling today at a premiumnot because it is redeemable in gold. because there is not enough of that commodity in the world to redeem onetenth of the tokens behind which it impudently pretends to stand. No. that silverdollar valuation is not based upon gold as its redeemer. nor. Heaven knows. upon any confidence in bankers. but upon something stronger. greater. and more honest than all these. the wealth and credit of the people of the United States. Had Mr. Carlisle recognized this fact. and known. as he must have known. that every dollar coined from the bullion purchased under the Sherman act could and would have maintained its parity with gold. if paid out for such purchases. by reason of the pledged faith and credit of the nation. we should never have heard of a gold scare. That mysterious gold reserve would not have been rising and falling like a thermometer with every pulsation of Lombard and Wall streets. Mr. Speaker. remove the restrictions from silver coinage. make it a full legaltender. debtpaying money. and it will immediately bound into new life and give relief to a people who are now suffering from a circulation contracted simply because under our suicidal policy we permit a few gold gamblers to bring on panic and business depression at their own sweet will. You can not relieve the people by making money still scarcer. You would strike down onehalf our money metal. what. then. would follow? You increase twofold every form of indebtedness. Where the debtor now owes $100 under this policy he would have to pay $200. Sir. the load of indebtedness is already weighing down the farming and laboring classes. How much greater do you intend to make it? Will nothing but the absolute ownership of the earth satisfy you? Take heed you do not go too far. The gradual absorption of all wealth in the hands of the few presaged the fall of Assyria. Egypt. and Rome. But remember we are an AngloSaxon race. who can not and will not be enslaved. But. Mr. Speaker. as I have shown. the unconditional repeal of the Sherman act means a ruinous contraction of our currency and a fall in the price of all products of labor. Since 1873. since silver has gradually fallen in value. the staple products of the farm havekopt pace with it in its downward course. The following table will show the relative depreciation of silver. wheat. and cotton since that period: Year. Wheat. cotton. Silver. Year. Wheat. Cotton. Silver. 1872 -------- $1.47 $19.3 $1.32 1883 -------- $1.13 $10.8 $1 11 1873 --------- 1.31 18.8 1.29 1884 ........ 1.07 10.5 1.01 1874 ------- 1.43 15.4 1.27 1885 --------.86 10.6 1.06 1875 ......... 1.12 15.0 1.24 1886 ---------. 87 9.9 .99 1876 ......... 1.24 12.9 1.15 1887 ---------. 89 9.5 .97 1877 --------- 1.17 11.8 1.20 1888 ........ 85 9.8 .93 1878 --------- 1.34 11.1 1.15 1889 --------- 90 9.9 .93 1879 --------- 1.07 0.9 1.12 1890 ........ .83 10.1 1.04 1880 ......... 1.25 11.5 1.14 1891 ------- .85 10.0 .90 1881 ......... 1.11 11.4 1.13 1892 ---------. 80 8.7 .86 1882 --------- 1.19 11.4 1.18 1893 ---------.50 7.2 .75 These figures are eloquent. Let every farmer in the land study them. He will understand why it is that he is now selling wheat. corn. and cotton at ruinously low figures. He will find the reason to be in the steady appreciation of gold. What will the future of the farmer be if this system shall long continue? Gentlemen. these ai e the breadwinners. the hope and salvation of our country. destroy them and you destroy the country. But. Air. Speaker. it is said that we are lagging behind in the race of nations. that vll the civilized governments have adopted the gold standard. and that we should adopt it as ameans of selfpreservation. Sir. this is an insult to the American people. We have the greatest country on earth. out resources are practically inexhaustible. and our independence unquestioned. Buried in our mountains lie more silver and gold than in any other country on the globe. and yet. withal. we must receive our financial lessons from Europe. Could toadyism go farther? Why. sir. we are no more dependent on England. France. or Germany than we ate upon the Sandwich Islands. What is there. Mr. Speaker. in the economic conditions of England that we should envy? True. they have a landed aristocracy. privileged classes. and gilded royalty. There may be seen in its full perfection the extremes of wealth and poverty. But let usfor a moment. if we can. withdraw our attention from her money center in Lombard street to her rural population. Let us see how the single gold standard has bestowed its blessings on that class. I read from report of Consul Howard. Miscellaneous Document No. 109. for the months of January to April last. inclusive. page 82: Of all the industrial classes In Great Britain the tenant farmer is the most worthy of consideration and sympathy. Incredible as it may seem to American farmers. who are paying from $18 to $25 per month. with board. to a common farm hand. the agricultural laborer in England is paid on an average about $12 per month. out of which he boards himself. shelters and feeds his family. and provides them with the alleged comforts of life. The rate of wages has saved the farmer from bankruptcy hitherto and made it possible for him to till the soil and pay the rent. but it has at the same time driven. and is driving. the agricultural labor to city and town. where it swells the constantly increasing current of common labor to a disastrous flood. While the English farmer and laborer are thus striving to keep soul and body together. a gentleman of the same realm. not entirely to fortune and to fame unknown. Mr. Alfred do Rothschild. in his speech at the International Monetary Conference at Brussels. says: I hold that Wheat at thirty a quarter instead of fortyfive is rather a blessing than other wise.-Senate Executive Docurent No. 82. page 69. Here is a man with the courage of his convictions. This Napoleon of Napoleons of finance boldly and characteristically states the delires and purposes of the money power to be financially to enslave the laboring people in order that the drones may live at their expense. Let us look for a moment at Germany. another goldstandard country. I read from the same consular reports. pages 96 to 98: The earnings of the average wageworker are pitiably small. It is certain they do not allow him any luxuries. it may well be doubted whether In many cases they are sufficient for the barest necessaries. It will beseenthat the wages paid weavers and those engaged in the textile industries are among the lowest in the scale. The condition of this class is indeed most hopeless. Long hours in illventilated and close quarters. and a minimum allowance of the plainest food. have so reduced the majority of artisans as to make them physically incapable of outdoor work of any kind. The usual fare for a weaver is a breakfast of thin coffee.with dry bread broken into it. Dinner consists of potatoes. potato soup. or meal soup. with dry bread. For supper there is either thin coffee. with dry bread. or soup. Meat is purchased in small quantities on Sundays and holidays by the better paid. for the great mass it is a luxury beyond reach. The character of the food never varies from year to year. winter and summer. it is always the same. From twothirds to threefourths of the incomes of small wageearners is spent for foodfood little in quantity and inferior in quality. In a community of 8.000 factory hands the weekly expenses for food in a family of two (man and wife) were apportioned thus: Bread and meal. 181 pfennigs. potates. 35 pfennigs. vegetables. 13 pfennigs. biscuits. 12 pfennigs. milk. 6 pfennigs. butter. 110 pfennigs. bacon. 6 pfennigs. meat. 30 pfennigs. herrings. 8pfennigs. salt. etc.. 7 pfennigs. sugar. 11 pfenngs. chicory. 5 pfennigs. total. 426 pfennigs. or 609 pfennigs per day. This Is cited as a typical case among those whose average income is 400 marksabout 42 per cent of the entire population. In another instance the average yearlyincome of twentyfour families was 295.37 marks. Reckoning two children and one adult dependent upon this amount. the share falling to each would be 98.46 marksin other words. a daily allowance of 27f pfennigs. Less than 7 cents a day is thus represented to be the limit to be expended by 46 per cent of the weaving population. But. as abject. as is the misery and privation revealed by such figures. the privations imposed upon those working in their own garrets are still greater. These unfortunates are for the most part women and young girls. In Lelpsic. according to a recent monograph on social studies. the wages paid for a weeks work of from eleven to thirteen hours daily in making paper lanterns is 4.50 to 9 marks. men receive from 10 to 12 marks. Women working for umbrella factories get from 5 to 8 marks weekly. The weeks wages of a man and wife working together twentyfour hours daily in the making of felt shoes amounted to 12 marks. Sewing girls working for dressmaking establishments receive from 4 to 8 marks per week. Instances of this sort might be multiplied. In many cases the average annual income is not over 150 marks by reason of the enforced idleness at certain periods. The very lowest weekly sum required to exist is estimated at 6.50 marks. This affords a suggestive commentary. One more instancethat of France. which since 1873 has been under the single standard. From the same authority. page 11. I read as follows: In spite of what official statistics may state. I am able to say that in this very large and important industrial community the average skilled workman earns less than $400 per year. In round numbers 1.800 francs is What an expert weaver owning his own loom can earn. Unskilled labor is paid by the municipality 58 cents per day. and it is no uncommon thing to find scores of skilled laborers out of regular employment seeking work from town to town at 58 cents per day. How can a man support a wife and two or more children when his total earnings. assuming that he works three hundred days in the year. aillounts to $174 per year? Yet this Is the task thousands of human beings are called upon to face annually in France. When one considers that in a population of 38.000.000 the number of people engaged in agriculture. commerce. and other industries exceeds 30.000.000. and that there are only about 2.000.000 persons of independent means. it is not difficult to see how the majority may get the impression that they are oppressed by a very small minority. These instances. Mr. Speaker. will give to the farmers and laborers of America an idea of what their condition. already bad enough. will be when they are placed upon this great commercial plane of the civilized nations of the earth. Evidently. so far as they are concerned. the monometallic gold standard is not a dispenser of all blessings and the allinall savior of nations. What would gentlemen have? Would they relegate our agricultarists of the West to the condition of these in England? Do you want still further to reduce the prices of agricultural products. and. therefore. all labor in that department of industry? Do you. with Mr. Rothschild. clamor for still cheaper wheat and cotton? Sir. these are the natural and inevitable results of a monoluetallic gold standard. because the quantity of gold in the world. being confessedly insufficient to do its business. it follows. as a matter of course. that such scarcity appreciates its value. and that therefore they who control its supply likewise control the value of all labor or property and can depreciate it at their pleasure. Now. under the bimetallic standard such a condition of affairs is not so easily brought about. Where you have the free and unlimited coinage of both metals. silver ever has been and. from the nature of things. ever will be the peoples money. and will circulate among them. and thus make it harder for those who desire to corner the gold to do so. and thereby to control all other values. But we are told that this will be cheap money. I want to repeat. that whenever the law creates a use for a given article. thereby causing a demand for its use. value is added to it by reason of such use and demand. That is just as plain as anything on earth can be. Take. then. your silver bullion. if you please. stamp it with the Government stamp. declate that it is a dollar. that it is 100 cents. that it is a legal tend er for the payment of all debts. and that silver dollar will march on side by side with your gold dollar. and hold its own in the race of business in this country. I want to call attention to another point. We are told that the Sherman law is the cause of the present panic. I have just about come to the conclusion. sir. that the people who assert that hardly believe it. If they do. I am almost tempted to say that they are not only monometallic men. but that they certainly must be monoidea men. You had read to you. gentlemen. the other day. a passage in which was depicted the fall of the Roman Empire by reason of the contraction of the currency. Did the Sherman law have anything to do with that? Again. in 1816. England adopted the single gold standard. The ssme merciless depression that has always followed the effort to conduct the business of a country on a gold basis. followed there. It is graphically described by Alison. as follows: The effects of this extraordinary piece of legislation were soon apparent. The industry of the nation was speedily congealed. as a flowing stream is by the severity of an Arctic winter. The alarm became as universal and widespread as confidence and activity had recently been. The country bankers. who had advanced largely on the stocks of goods imported. refused to continue their support to their customers. and they were forced to bring their stocks into market. Prices. in consequence. fell rapidly. that of cotton. in particular. sank in three months to half its former level. * * * The effects of this sudden and prodigious contraction of the currency were soon apparent. and they rendered the next three years a period of ceaseless distress and suffering in the BritishIslands. * * * Theeffectupon prices was not less immediate or appalling. They declined in general within six months to half their former amount. and remained at that low level for the next three years. Distress was universal in the latter months of 1819. and that distrust and discouragement were felt in all branches of industry. which are at once the forerunner and the cause of disaster. Did the Sherman law have anything to do with that? Again in 1836 was the currency contracted in England. The same historian describes its consequences. as follows: On. however. the tempest came. and fearful was its violence. With the steady contraction of the currency by the Bank of England. which began in July. 1836. prices fell during the whole of the ensuing winter. and in the sprin.. of 1837 the panic was universal. Many bankruptcies took place. though fewer in Glasgow than might have been expected from the severity of the pressure. owing to the amount of solid wealth which had been made in the preceding five years. But as prices of all sorts of manufactured produce had sunk nearly a half. the manufacturers were under the necessity of lowering wages. and this soon induced strikes in nearly all the branches of skilled industry. Why. sir. to contract the currency of a country is opposed to even the teachings of Alexander Hamilton. the father of the Republican party. He says to annul either of the metals as money is to abridge the quantity of circulating medium. and is liable to all the objections which arise from the comparison of the benefits of a full with the evils of a scanty circulation. And. coming down to 1873. De LaIvelaye tells us that prices fell. and industry. losing money. limitad its operations. Why. sir. in 1873. the criminal period of the centuries. almost universal depression reigned over England. the Continent. and the United States. Mr. Bright. in 1679. referring to the condition of England. said. I believe the agricultural owners and occupiers of land have lost more than �150.000.000. He attempted to attribute the misfortune to poor crops and seasons. But. sir. those poor crops and seasons have been lasting for many years. with no signs of abatement. Deeper with each succeeding year has sunk the farmer in the scale of poverty. while the mortgage. daily growing more gigantic. swoops down upon his devoted home. and. like the bird of evil omen. casts its shadow on the floor. Ah. the Sherman law had nothing to do with these depressions. Only the other day the Australian bank failed. So dire was the distress resulting that the newspapers stated. in order to preserve existence itself. the crown of womanhood was placed on the auction block and sold to the highest bidder. Why. we are beginning now to find out the whole truth about this panic. It belts the civilized globe. The Continent is not exempt from its bineful touch. Only a day or two ago nine stockholders failed in London and two in Liverpool. It is criminal in such a calamity to falsely assign the existing evils to a cause in no wise responsible for them. simply as a pretext to place the country upon a gold standard. It is that and nothing more. A cruel. heartless conspiracy on the part of the banks. They have the country by the throat. and refuse to loosen their grip. unless they are given still further power over the people. But the Sherman law is responsible for it all. Why. Banker Clews sings a different tune in his financial review of He gets up off of the Sherman law and the fool people who are hoarding their money. and jumps onthe Chicago speculators. He says their withholding of grain and other kinds of produce from the usual course of export for several months was largely the cause of the heavy drain of gold. He says the stringency which they so largely helped to create has at last compelled them to realize at ruinous losses. The distinguished gentleman from New York . a national banker. to whose able speech I had the pleasure of listening the other day. says in relation to it.  Why. God Almighty himself could alone bring about such a condition as involves the whole globe today. No. this war on the peoples money commenced in 1873. The present attack is the final onslaught of the enemy. It is Plutocracy vs. Democracy. It is Lombard and Wall street united for a common purpose. For my part. as a humble Representative on this floor. I shall cast my lot with the common people. To all influences that would hold me back. I say with the Seminole. Blaze with your serried columns. I will not bend the knee. Mr. Speaker. for years and years has Congress legislated in the interest of the select few. The creditor alone receives attention. Let us now do the debtor justice. Let us not add to his burdens. One more word and Ihave done. We have been told. Mr. Speaker. that this question rises superior to party. If by that declaration it is meant that the issues involved in this discussion will reich to every fireside in this land. then. indeed. it is true. If it is meant that we are brought face to face with a prqposition to impose the financial slavery of Europe upon the American people. then. again. is it true. But if by that declaration it is meant that it is the duty of Congress to legislate upon these lines. then it is not true. but beneath party. For. Mr. Speaker. the behests of the money power are seldom tempered with mercy or with justice. From the day when Dives lifted up his eyes in hell. down to the present time. has this unrelenting oppressor of mankind marched steadily on. croshing. as a modern Juggernaut. all within his reach. And he is marching on now over mercantile and manufacturing interests and even over his allies and confederates. the banking institutions. Nor would he halt here -appalled at new fields of conquests. He would invade every home in this fair land. yes. he would trample upon the prostrate forms of despondentfathers and weeping mothers. woman in her beauty. man in his strength. budding childhood and prattling infancy. on all. to accomplish his end. But it may be well. Mr. Speaker. for these men to remember that there is a time when forbearance ceases to be a virtue. They should not become oblivious of the fact that a new light has dawned upon the western world. The spirit of intelligence is there abroad. As the children of Israel in their weary march of old were guided by a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. so we in this struggle of the centuries shall have as our pillar of cloud by day the Constitution of our fathers and our pillar of tire by night the patriotism of the people. Nor shall we reckon without our host. We are not .epresenting Old World constituencies. but a people br. ve.. itel i.ent. and patriotic. who have solved this probem. and who w.. ii be quick to act upon the maxim.  Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. Mr. Rothschild. at the international monetary conference at Brussels. said: So far as agreeing upon a universal standard is concerned. no twonations are alike as regards their individual wealth. resources. and expenditure. and therefore no universal agreement can be made with respect to a general currency. Then. sir. let this Congress declare. when this discussion shall have ended. that Mr. Rothschild for once at least in his life spoke the truth. Let it legislate upon the same independent line of policy and action. Let it declare. in language unmistakable. that the United States. the central star of the nations of earth. shall not be plucked from its proud eminence to become a satellite of England. but rather. on the other hand. moving along its appointed course. aloof from the jarring elements beneath. it shall continue to perform its great revolutions within the orbit of national independence. Now. Mr. Speaker. in conclusion let me say this. and in no spirit of threat or of prophecy: If the highest duty of this Congress shall consist simply in repealing the Sherman law. then let the tidings go forth. as assuredly they will. that on this proposition the Republican party and the Democratic party are one. If the issue upon which the last campaign was fought and won be a delusion and a snare. again and again let the tidings go forth. as assuredly they will. that on these two propositions the Democratic party and the Republican party are one. If the condition of the tariff. as suggested. is by no means critical. and in the sweet by and by it may possiblyreceive homeopathic treatment. again and again. and again let the tidings go forth. as assuredly they will. that upon these three propositions the Democratic party and the Republican party are one. But if. as I believe. the Democratic party is still the party of the people. if it would remai n true to its traditions and its teachings. if it would go beyond the narrow confines of the moneychangers office and listen to that voice. deep toned as thunder. coming from the teeming millions of this broad land. then indeed shall it rewrite. but this time in letters imperishable as our mountains of silver and gold. resistless as our rivers rolling down to the sea. and majestic as the grandeur of our free institutions. that old. old Democratic doctrine. The free and unlimited coinage of silver at the ratio of 16 to 1.

I brought this matter before the attention of the Commissioner of Labor. and he said that it ought to be investigated. but that he had no means to have it investigated. I went then to the Director of the Geological Survey. and he made the same reply."},{"1":"1891","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"It is now nearly two years since the present Administration came into power. It is a fitting time. midway of its service and at the close of the Congress in harmony with its views during that time. to review itsoperations and their effect upon the country. The President came into power not wholly unused to public life. His service in the United States Senate had given him familiarity with public measures and acqnaintauce with the leaders upon either side. His series of short but most admirable speeches.made during his campaign. in each of which lie. with conciseness. and yet with great clearMAI~dl 2. nes. discussed some one important subject of national concern. had prepared the country to expect from his inaugural address and his annual messages an earnest. thoughtful. and statesmanlike expression of views upon the questions of national policy confronting us for solution. Nor has the country been disappointed. Whether agreeing with the conclusions reached or not. all will admit the force and clearness with which the argument is conducted. It has been preeminently a clean Administration. The members of the Cabinetwere all men in whose integrity the nation had full confidence. and whose character and ability were unquestioned. Almost without exception they were called from the successful conduct of large business enterprises to be the executive heads of their several Departments. and it is but simple truth to say that to a larger extent than has been hitherto the case for a long time. have practical business methods been introduced into the conduct of departmental affairs. The large Treasury deposits in a few favored banks have beencalled in and together with the idle surplus applied to the payment of the bonded debt. The collection of the revenues has been performed at a less relative cost and the percentage of loss has been reduced to an insignificant amount. The frauds upon the revenue by undervaluation of importations have been a subject of careful attention. and so far as human watchfulness and skill can provide they have been suppressed. The laws regarding immigration and the importation of contract labor have been enforced with vigor and thoroughness. The enforcement of the law at New York. the principal port. has been placed entirely under Federal supervision. The laws have been faulty in some of their provisions. and for this reason the bureau has been hampered in its operations. Business methods have been applied to the conduct of the Post Office. The heavy mails which come to us by every steamer from Europe are now landed in bulk. taken to the New York office. and there the regular force of clerks. barely sufficient to transact the current business of the office. are taken from their routine duties and set to work sorting out the steamer mail fortransmission to the inland offices. This necessarily occupies some hours. and by that much tifhe the letters for Pittsburgh. Chicago. and St. Louis are delayed. The Department is now engaged in negotiations looking to the placing of a postal clerk on each steamer to sort the mail in transit. saving this delay and this extra strain upon the seaport office. This arrangement has already been concluded with the German authorities. and with other countries the matter is well in hand. In the transportation of the inland mail. rearrangement of railway time tables has been secured by which delays have been lessened or avoided. Thus the morning mail from New York now reaches Boston at 12 m. instead of 3.30 p. m. as formerly. thus not only giving Boston her New York mail during business hours. but allowing for earlier connection for points east of that city. Chicago receives her New York mail now at 10 a. m. instead of late in the afternoon. A similar reduction of time has been made between St. Louis and Kansas City. Five hours have been gained between Chicago and New Orleans. and a large reduction has been made in the time between New York and San Francisco. The 58.000 transportation schedules have been carefully studied. and every practical readjustment made to secure closer connection and greater dispatch. The starroute mileage has been increased the past year over 5. 000.000 miles and the railway mileage over 11.000.000. (Of course this refers to additional miles traveled. not additional aggregate length of routes.) This makes over 16.000.000 additional miles traveled by postal cars and mailcarriers in one year alone. In the past year the gross revenue has increased nearly $5.000.000. and almost 5.000 new post offices have been established. With this large increase in the service the number of pieces sent to the deadletter office have been decreased by 2.000.000. In fact. business energy and business methods have been infused into all its operations. and were it not for the dead matter carried for the other branches of the Government and the rapid extension of lines through sparselysettled communities. it would more than pay all its expenses and make 1cent postage and the extension of the free delivery to the smaller cities a near possibility. To one who has given only casual attention to the matter the Department of Justice may seem to be but of little importance in the affairs of Government and yet under recent legislation it has become of the greatest necessity that careful. honest. faithful. intelligent men should be intrusted with its work. Tie establishment of the Court of Claims. in which parties having real or pretended claims against the Government can bring suit. and obtain judgment against the Government. has made it necessary that the men who there represent the interests of the Government and who are practically without a client possessed of knowledge of the facts and of ability to secure his witnesses. should be men learned in the law. shrewd in investigation. and of an integrity beyond the power of a bribe. In another class of cases constantly being referred to that court for investigation. relating to property used or destroyed in the late war. and in which the loyalty of the claimant is a point to be proved. there is wide opportunity for the Government counsel to quietly accept whatever proof the claiman.p may produce on this point. and make no effort to find any proof to the contrary. When itis remembered that these claims sometimes mount up to the hundreds of thousands of dollars each. it will be readily understood that counsel of sluggish nature. with not too nice a sense of duty. may be enabled to retire after a few years in affluent circumstances. Ithas become apparent during the debates in this Congress that under the last Administration. at least in some cases. due inquiry was not made. It is gratifying to be able to state that AttorneyGeneral Miller has taken every measure to secure the interests of the Government. and has called about him a corps of assistants who are intelligent and loyal in the discharge of their duties. and during the past year cases involving claims against the Government aggregating $2.034.240 have been disbursed. The same officer. finding grave abuses existing in some judicial districts in the matter of fees. called the attention of Congress to the matter. An investigation was ordered and bills reported by the Judiciary Committee designed to remedy the evil. Preventive legislation has also been placed upon the appropriation bills. and the practice. now improper. will soon be also illegal. Prosecutions for the infractions of the election laws and for the assassination of Government officials have been instituted and carried on with vigor. although in some instances under very difficult circumstances. To give a better idea of the work of this Department and its successful issue I append the following extract from the annual report of the AttorneyGeneral:"},{"1":"1890","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I desire. before the further consideration of this amendment. to call attention to what is known as Miscellaneous Document No. 198. presented yesterday by the Senator from Vermont to the Senate and ordered to be printed. the titleof which is: Letter of the Acting Commissioner of Labor. transmitting an analysis of cost of one ton of steel rails made in the United States. etc. The purpose of this communication of the Commissioner of Labor to the honorable Senator from Vermont evidently was to arrive at the laborcost in the production of a ton of steel rails in the United States. You will find in this document language to which I shall allude. The writer also presents a fable to which I will refer later. In the table which he presents he says: This table has been worked out by using averages based on six establishments in the northern district of the United States. producing material suitable for rails. as exhibited in the preliminary report. The result would not differ materially if any other six were used. We must assume. therefore. that the six establishments that he has selected are representative establishments. Now. sir. turn to page 3. and you will find a comparative statement in which he gives the laborcost of production and other costs for the production of 4.137 pounds of iron ore. which I assume is the amount o iron ore in this particular test that makes a ton of steel rails. He follows that with a certain number of pounds of limestone and goes through all of the grades of manufacture from a ton of ore to a ton of steel rails. He assumnes the cost of a ton of steel rails tobe $25.7771. From this statement it appears that the expenditures for direct labor were $l1.5983. I assume that the Senator from Vermont desired this statement in order that he might be able to show some excuse for imposing a duty of $11.20 protection upon a ton of steel rails. Now. I do not know that there has been any contention upon this side of the Chamber in opposition to such a statement as this. The contention has been that labor in the United States in the production of a ton of steel rails was not greatly in excess of the laborcost in Europe for the production of steel rails there. and. as the Republican party claim that the tariff is for the purpose of protecting American labor. I want to show how fallacious it is. and therefore I have examined the subject. and I wish to say that the statement I have prepared is taken Irom the statements you will find in the preliminary report of the Commissioner of Labor. and if you will look in that report you will find a verification of every one of my figures. I will take up first. Mr. President. the cost of the manufacture of steel rails on the continent of Europe. and Great Britain as well. and as I follow the report I include Great Britain. According to the Acting Commissioner of Labor. as per Senate Miscellaneous Document No. 198. page 3. the total cost of producing 1 ton of steel rails in the United Stateslabor. supplies. repairs. transportation. taxes. salaries of officials as well as clerks. in fact. everything includedamounts to $25.777 per ton of 2.240 pounds. In the preliminary report of the Commissioner of Labor on the cost of production of steel rails in various establishments on the continent of Europe and Great Britain. House Miscellaneous Document No. 222. pages 34 and 35. the total cost of producing 1 ton of steel rails is given. namely: Total cost. including everything same as in the United States. Mill. Per ton of I Mill. Per ton of 2.240pounds. . 2.240 pounds. No. 3... ..... ............. 619.576 No. 8 .............................. $23. 743 No. 4 ........ .............. 22.184 No. 9 .............................. 27.025 N o. 5 .............................. ..25.652 No. 10 ............................. 21.907 N o. 6 ................................ 23.121 N o. 11 ........................... 18.588 N o.7 ................................. 23.190 These. I presume. are representative mills or establishments in Europe. because that is what the report states them to be. From the above it will be seen that the cost of production of %teel rails in Europe varies all the way from $18.588 to $27.025 per ton. Now we will come down to the comparative statementCompiled from the preliminary report of the Commissioner of Labor. House Miscellaneous Document No. 222. and compared with the report.

He was. as much as any one man could be. the founder and builderup of that prosperous Commonwealth which sits so proudly amid our northern inland seas. He foresaw with the instinct of a statesman the coming glory of his country. and at the beginning as at the close of his career he advocated the principles and supported the public policy upon which our liberties and independence as a nation depend for preservation. If I were to select one characteristic in his public life which dominated all his thoughts. words. and actions. it would be his intense love of country. No matter how dark and threatening was the outlook. our enemies might be many and their hatred bitter. yet his heart never quailed. but with pen. voice. and sword he battled for the rights and honor of his country. for the general welfare. and for the melioration of the human race. When Burrs mysterious conspiracy was hatching in the then wilderness of Ohio. Thomas Jefferson detected and exposed the treason before it got beyond control. and Lewis Cass. then a young lawyer and memher of the Ohio Legislature. drafted legislation whichhad the effect to destroy the projected expedition and restore public tranquility. When appointed superintendent of Indian affairs his unsurpassed mental and physical energy was tested and strained to the utmost. Throughout Michigan Territory. of which he was second Territorial governor. wandering bands of Indians were a constant menace to the peace and growth of the white settlements. They had in two wars been employed by the British against the Americans. and they were regular pensioners on British bounty. He made seventeen treaties with the Wyandotte. Seneca. Delaware. Shawnee. Pottawatomie. Ottawa. and Chippewa tribes of Indians. won their respect and confidence by honest dealing and firm and resolute administration. and from a position of hostility made them our good and fast friends. He explored the whole country. and in his birch canoe traversed thousands of miles unvisited before. save by the Jesuit fathers or the hunters who pursued the valuable furbearing animals of that region. He communicated to the North American Review at the time some of the ablest articles which have ever been written on the Indian languages. character. and history. He was amongst the first to appreciate them and improve their condition. He was a man of sword. pen. and voice. and in all his varied career won renown in each and every position. At the breaking out of the war with Great Britain he served with distinction. as might have been expected of the son of Major Cass. who had fought in the Revolutionary army for seven bloody years to help win our independence. He afterward took part in the campaigns of Harrison. which ended in the destruction of the British army in Western Canada. the killing of Tecumseh. and the flight and disgrace of Proctor. Cooley. in his Michigan: A History of Governments. sums up this part of Casss public life as follows: There was some feeling of Territorial pride that Jackson had looked to this distant region for a member of his Cabinet. but the people of the Territory parted with the governor with great reluctance. He had not only managed the public affairs with ability and unquestioned integrity. but his example had been excellent and his influence of the best. Governing frontier settlements. where rough characters abounded and roystering habits prevailed. he was always in his own deportment courteous and complacent. always abstemious. alwaysselfr specting. and as unexceptionable in his private character and in all his domestio and social relations as he was in his public capacity and doportment. Permanent American settlement may be said to have begun with him. and it was a great and lasting boon to Michigan when it was given a governor at once so able. so patriotic. so attentive to his duties and so worthy in his public and private life of respect and esteem. As Secretary of War in Andrew Jacksons -Cabinet. he was pronounced. vigorous. and emphatic in his hostility to the doctrine of nullification of the laws. and long afterward. in his old age. when Secreiary of State in Buchanans administration. in 186061. he spoke with no uncertain voice in favor of the maintenance of the Union at all hazards and at every cost. He lived to see the civil war brought to a successful close in behalf of the Union. and to see the country out of hAr evil days start upon a career of prosperity and greatness which is the marvel of the age and without parallel in ancient times. When Great Britain delayed. upon one pretext and another. to turn over to the United States the fortifications within our lines. and harassed our border with threatened Indian forays. contrary to the stipulations of the treaty of peace. and when upon the high seas Great Britain assumed the right to visit and search our ships. as minister to France he drew up an impassioned appeal to that country. which had much to do in exposing the arrogance and injustice of the claim. Whenever the way was to be cleared for the future which he saw so clearly opening up for hi4 country he was anongthe first to set to work and was among the most able and successful leaders. He denied the doctrine of perpetual allegiance. assisted in making our flag respected on every sea. stoutly defended the Monroe doctrine in respect to the American continent. and so far as one man could. promoted the peace. happiness. and glory of his country. In 1850. when the slavery agitation pervaded the whole land. and the wisest and most fearless stood aghast at the threatened danger to the Government. in that hour of great peril Lewis Casss name was put second by a solemn resolve of the Senatesecond only to that of Henry Clay. the great pacificator. in behalf of honorable adjustment. Nothing could better display the confidence then reposed in his ability and sense of justice. While he was resolute and exacting for his country. he was in his private life retiring. unostentatious. frugal. sympathetic. and considerate in his relations with those he came in contact with. Let me close by repeating two sentences from General Casss writings. which give a good insight into his character. He said: For myself. I have no belief in that greatness which is too great to mingle with the details of life. In another place he said: He who occupies the loneliest cabin upon the very verge of civilization has just as important a part to play in the fate of our country as the denizen of the proudest city in the land. These utterances I commend heartily. both in spirit and letter. as a guide to all in public life."},{"1":"1888","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"In reply to a remark of the gentleman from Iowa . who was very broad in his statements.

There is no one on this floor that has impugned the motives of any gentleman that has had aught to do with the preparation of this bill. And yet there is abundant occasion for an inference of selfishness in the preparation of that bill. There are eleven gentlemen members ofthe Committee on Rivers and Harbors. whohave taken to themselves and their own States nearly onehalf of all the appropriations that are made to States. Look at the difference there is to be found in the amounts bestowed upon those States that are represented and the amounts bestowed on those that are not. Texas has $959.000 in the bill and is represented on the committee. Louisiana has $104.000. besides the large share she gets of the Mississippi River improVement. Louisiana is represented on the committee. Ohio has $403.000. The gentleman who was so ready to impugn the motives of other people represents Ohio on the committee. Illinois has $305.000. and. singular fact. she is represented on the committee. Michigan has $908.000 in the bill. and she is represented on the committee. California has $333.500. represented on the committee: West Virginia. modest West Virginia. has $254.600. My friend represents her on the committee. Kentucky has $527.000. represented so ably by the chairman of the committee. Alabama has over $600.000. every dollar of which will be spent in the State of Alabama. represented on the committee. So I might go on showing that while there may be no selfishness manifested by this. yet there is the singular coincidence that the States that are most largely remembered are the States that are ably represented on the committee.

Since that time the President has appointed one of the most capable gentlemen in the United States at the head of that bureau. a gentleman who was head of the bureau of -statistics of Massachusetts for a number of years. one of those very few gentlemen that we find in the United States who is thoroughly conversant -with all industrial statistics. He has laid out a plan of work for next summer. to investigate to the bottom all these instances of industrial depression both in the United States and in Europe. and in order to do that he requires a sum additional to what is here provided. The sum which is provided in this bill is for clerkhire. for salaries of officers. for fuel. lights. stationery. &c.. and will not leave a sufficient amount to defray this expense and enable the Commissioner to make this thorough and searching investigation and report itin time for the next session of Congress. If this bureau is to be of any practical advantage to us it must work between now and the beginning of the next session of Congress. We will then have all these questions to go into. and we want to have the benefit of this investigation. I hope my friend from Indiana will not make any objection to this amendment."},{"1":"1884","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I am in favor of the passage of this bill because I believe it to be a step in the right direction. This bill authorizes the commissioner of labor statistics to acquire all useful information upon the subject of labor. its relations to capital. and the means of promoting the material. social. intellectual. and moral prosperity of the laboring men and women of this country. If we are to legislate for the greatest number. then this bill or something similar to it should be passed. Of a total population in the United States in 1880 of 36.761.607 over 10 years of age 17.392.099 weroo 3157 engaged in the various professional and industrial occupations. 2.647.157 being females. These were distributed as follows: Male. Female. Total. Agriculture .................................................. 7.075.983 504.510 7.670.493 Professional and personal services ............... 2.712.043 1.361.295 4.074. 238 Trade and transportation ................. 1.750.892 59.364 1. 810.256 Manufacturing. mechanical. and mining industries ..................................................... 3.205.124 631.988 3.837.112 Of those engaged in agriculture. 3.323.876 were returned as agricultural laborers. Of the personal and professional class. 1.859.223 were laborers. and 1.075.659 domestic servants. Of those engaged in trade and transportation. 1.530.256 were laborers. This gives us a total of 11.626.156 persons in 1880 who labored for days wages and who are directly interested in this bill. In view of these facts. Mr. Chairman. I submit that the bill under discussion. which proposes to gather information to promote the material. social. intellectual. and moral prosperity of so large a body of our adult population. should receive our consideration. and I confess that I am astonished that some prominent gentlemen on the opposite side of this Chamber manifest a disposition to defeat the measure. Sir. I regret that the bill does not go further than it does. but I trust that the information acquired under its provisions will lead to legislation that will prohibit the introduction into this country of indigent labor under the contract system. I am in favor of opening our ports for the introduction of emigrants who seek our land as a home. In common with our native and foreign born citizens I extend a hearty welcome to all such. But. sir. it is well known that capitalists in their individual partnership or corporate capacity have been and are now engaged actively in various directions in contracting for labor. in the gross. from among the most indigent and degraded fbreign multitudes of Europe and Asia. at minimum rates of wages. which must come in competition with our home labor and reduce in price or supplant it entirely. What has already taken place in the recent past is amply sufficient to fill our minds with apprehension as to our future condition and demand at our hands timely selfprotection. Against this policy the people whom I have the honor to represent on this floor have protested to this Congress by petition. and I desire to emphasize their protest by my voice and vote. Already there is indigence in our land because the laboring classes are not sufficiently paid. I regret. sir. that the products of labor arc so cheap as they are. This country will never be truly prosperous while the common. unskilled laborer works ten hours for $1.25 or less. As remarked by another gentleman in this discussion. I am in favor of a protective tariff because I believe it enhances the price of labor. and the moment it ceases to accomplish this end that moment I shall cease to advocate a protective policy. Because the contract system debases and depreciates American labor I shall oppose it. Sir. I insist that the time has arrived when a law should be passed and rigidly enforced against al l contracts for foreign pauper labor and prohibiting the introduction of the same into this country. Trusting that this bill will. in addition to accomplishing great good in other directions. lead up to this consummation. I urge its passage. For one hundred years this country has been the goal of the poor and struggling. Once they landed on our shores their condition improved. and of the millions that have swelled our population as immigrants few have returned to their homes across the sea. Today our country is the most prosperous on the globe. No other country presents such inducements to the skilled artisan. the common laborer or the tiller of the soil. In no other country is labor so honored or man so highly prized. Let us maintain this condition of affairs. and the years that are to come will be more prosperous than those that have passed. and we shall leave to those who succeed us a better heritage than we entered on.

The Revised Stat.utes are a revision of tle law of 1867. So the Senator from Kentucky proposes to continue the law of 1867 in this regard. The law of 1867 was enacted before any of these goods were manufactured at all. It had no reference to these goods. It was made for adjusting the relation between the raw material and the manufactured article as four to one. This clause which the Senator from Kentucky proposes to continue as the law was made with application to another kind of goods called Bradford goods. whose warp was cotton and whose filling was wool. and it was provided and adjusted to give just the rate of protection. counting so much for raw material and so much for labor. to that article which is provided for in the paragraph immediately preceding in this bill. Under that manufacturers abroad went to work to devise a new article to avoid our tariff. and they devised and brought into use and commended to the adoption of the country this new article df worsted goods. and bringing them in under the clause of the law which was made to apply to the other goods. they have brought them in at a rate. when you compare the duty on the raw material and the duty on the manufactured article. much lower than any other woolen goods are brought in. although being made of the finest quality of wool. It should have had a larger rate if it had been specific upon the wool. but being a much finer article of production there was a great deal more labor in it. and therefore if it had been specifically provided for in the tariff of 1867. which is now to be reproduced. it would of course have borne a higher rate. Under that device made to avoid the tariff of 1867 the Senator observes that all these goods have been imported. and that is true. and now the Senator says that this being a bill for the reduction of revenue he proposes to continue a clause in the law through which the revenue will continue to increase."},{"1":"1882","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Let the whole be read.

This is a mere code. codifying the laws of this District. the laws which are in force. laws which are known to the courts and to the profession. and the District will not suffer from a delay of six months in enacting that code into a statute.

Now. why should we crowd out the necessary discussion for maturing a pension system. which has been so largely debated so far. by addressing ourselves to the local system of taxation in the District of Columbia? Why should we crowd out the measures for the relief of the Indians. which have been discussed so fully? Why should we crowd out the Geneva award. which the Senate has debated and debated. but the bill in regard to which I hope will command nearly the unanimous support of the Senate. at any rate of a very large majority?

I urge its passage for the further purpose of placing on permanent. lasting record in the archives of its legislation a great nations appreciation of a courage and heroism that has no precedent in all its annals and no parallel in all the history of noble deeds. I would thus pay a fitting tribute to the name and memory of a man whose grandeur of character and iobility of action mark him as a central gure among those whom history has made immortal for the benefactions they have conferred upon mankind. The touching story of Lieutenant Benners kindly sympathy with the sufferers from yellow fever dunring its recemt fearful reign in the South. his bravery ii going to their succor. and his sad yet heroic death while engaged in that generous service is fresh in the public mind and will not be forgotten while our country has a history. It will be remembered how. in the darkest hour of the plague. when its daily victims were being numbered by hundreds and even thonsands. the whole people of the North. moved by one common impulse of generous humanity. sought to devise some means by which their boundless donations of everything needful for the relief of the stricken victims could most Safely and speedily reach them. that Alexander R. Shepherd. the able and indefatigable president of the National Relief Association. arranged for a reliefboat to descend the Mississippi River from Saint Louis. carrying provisions and medical stores to all the infected cities and towns below. The supplies and necessary transportation were quickly procured and forwarded to Saint Louis. lint a proper officer was wanted to command the vessel upon the perilous voyage it was to undertake. Few men. however brave. would have sought such a position. or willingly encountered tlse fearfil dangers it involved. The most fearless and determined might have shrunk from such a task without dishonor. but there was a man found equal to the occasion. and impelled by a chivalry that would have done honor to any hero of modern or ancient history. and a sense of duty to his fellowmen such as is only found in the most exalted natures and highest types of manhood. he promptly. without solicitation. volunteered for a service fraught with a hndredfold greater danger than ever confronted a soldier upon the bloodiest fieldof battle. That man was Hiram H. Benner. a lieutenant in the Eighteenth United States Infantry. and then stationed on duty at Atlanta. Georgia. His services having been accepted. and permission given by the proper military authorities. he parted from his comrades. his young wife and little children. and hurried to Saint Louis. renorted to Governor Shepherd. and immediately embarked upon the voyage of sitecor and relief to others. but. alas! of death to himself. Regardless of self. thoughtless of the fearful danger lie was braving. he left a place of safety. and intent only upon the high mission which he had sought. bent his journey toward the region where desolation and death reigned supremewhere the merciless plague preyed unrestrained upon helpless. trembling victims. When he had traversed all the country smitten with the pestilencewhen lie had wellnigh finished the noble work with which he was charged. when about to turn his face again toward the North. a woman. without friends or protection. flying from the fever. sought refuge upon his vessel and kindness at his hands. and with that gentleness and chivalry which were a part of his nature. both were cheerfully accorded. and his own apartmentswere surrendered to her use. But. niuconscioisly. she was already a victim of the dreadful contagion. its deadly poison was already flowing in her veins. and from her it was soon commnnicated to her generous and unselfish benefactor. Undismayed. but conscious of his peril. lie confronted it with the unfaltering courage of the true soldier that he was. and battled bravely against the shadowy monster that assailed him. but all his sturdy manhood was unable to shake off its icy grasp. and he calmly yielded lp as noble a life. as gallant a spirit. as ever animated a human body. Few men who have ever served their government have left behind them a more honorable record than Lieutenant Ben ner. Born in Lancaster. Pennsylvania. and enlisting on the 24th of September. 1851. at the age of eighteen. as a private in Conpany E. Thirtyfourth Regiment Illinois Volnnteers. the records of theWar Department show that he encountered all the dangers. privations. and vicissitudes incident to military service during the war. He was in the hospital in Nashville from Juno 24 to November 13. 1862. and was present with his company and participated in the battle of Shiloh. Tennessee. April 7. 18i32. before Corinth. Mississippi. May 29. 1862. at Triune. Tennessee. December 27. 1862. and at Stone River. December 31. 186. He was taken prisoner at the lastnamed battle. and was paroled at City Point. Virginia. January 20. 1663. and was sent to Caip Parole. at Annapolis. Maryland. In March. 186:3. be was sent to Benton Barraeks. Missouri. On June 9. 1862. rejoined his company. and was in the battle at Liberty Gap. Tennessee. June 24. 1862.

South Carolina. December 11. 1864. and furloughed December 26. 1864. for thirty days. then to report at Camp Chase. Ohio. and was finally honorably mustered out of service at Springfield. Illinois. Fehbrnary 22. 1865. to date from Febraary 8. 1865. He was commissioned and mustered in as captain Company F. Eighteenth Illinois Volunteers. March 25. 1855. to serve mne year. and served wit!h his company until honorably mustered out therewith. l)ecember 16. 1865. at Pine Bluff. Arkansas. He was appointed second lieutenant in the Eighteenth Infantry June 20. 1867. and was promoted first lieutenant in that regiment May l.1875. His appointment in the regular Army was recommitended for soldierlyeonduct and efficiency by lion. E. B. Washbrne. his Representative in Congress. Governor Oglesby. of Illinois. LieutenantColonel Webber. eommandingEightceth Illinois Volunteers. and by General U. S. Grant. the then General of the Army. He joined his regiment in September. 1837. and served with it in Dakota and Wyoming Territories to April. 1869. and in Georgia and South Carolina to September 29.1878. when he started from his station .at Atlanta. Georgia. to Saint Louis. to enter upon the service in which he lost his life. Thus we find him following the banner under which he served through all the perils of the war. sickness. battles. and imprisonmonte--being twice in hospitals. twice a prisoner. and fighting safely through nine bloody battles. A nobler or grander sacrifice was never laid upon the altar of humanity. a broader philanthropyand higher aimneverguided human action. and a more heroic death never crowned a more honorable and unselfish life. Virtues and heroism such as Lieutenant Benner exhibited illus. trated the highest traits of American character. and they should be cherished as priceless jewels in the American heart. and be recorded upon the brighest pages of American history. Such a life. such actions. and such a death as his exalts humanity and ennobles mankind. His name should live in the annals of his country as one of the most heroic of its citizens. and his memory be embalmed in the hearts of his countrymen as one of the noblest and most unselfish of its martyrs. * soldier. revering his Government. loving its flag. and following his conviction and duty. he fought gallantly against the people of the South in our unfortunate civil strife on many a hardly contested field. yet. when in the providence of God they were overwhelmed with a visitation that darkened their section with the shadow of death and filled their households with mourning. he came to their rescue as gallantly as he had met them in battle. and fought without fear a noiseless. invisible specter. more dangerous than any human enemy and more terrible than an army with banners. And in doing so he not only exhibited the generosity of his character and the nobility of his own nature. but he inculcated a lesson of charity and fraternity broad as our whole country. and that will. I trust. bear golden fruit to coming generations. I would that the kindly fraternal feeling that sent him on his nission of mercy might continue to flow forever from the North to the .South. like the ceaseless tide of the mighty river that bore him on his journey of death. and I would that every wind wafted to the North might be freighted with blessings and benedictions from the South. In the name of humanity and Christian charity I offer to the name and character of Lieutenaut Benner the homage and reverence of the whole American people. to his stricken wife I tender the sympathy of -every southern woman. and to his orphaned little ones the prayers and benedictions of every southern child.

You propose to abolish the contract system. because. as it is argued. contracts are let to incapable menmen who live in the far West and have not the scientific attainments of those who disport themselves around this capital. Do not be deceived in that way. The hardworking. faithful. competent surveyors upon the border are by education. by constant practice. by superiority of attainment. far better fitted to make these surveys than any body of men to be employed by bureau officers here in Washington. and crowded into the service. fit or unfit. by Senators and Members and other political influences. Experience has shown us the composition of the surveying parties that go out from this capital on these scientific surveys. and certainly when you come to place the land surveys under the same patronage you will find that they will be conducted by the same class of people. Certain surveys have always been made from Washington. Among these surveys of Indian reservations. and I speak within bounds when I say that in the small portion of the public lands which have been thus surveyed there has been more jobs than in all the millioijs of acres surveyed for settlers. though even in these there have been more than enough. If I were certain that the new system would provide for and anticipate the wants of actual settlers I might not oppose i on this ground alone. But I fear thit it will not be done. and that greet harm will ensue to our settlers from the confusion which will be thrown into a system with which they are familiar. I am astonished to find the Commissioner of the General Land Office and the Secretary of the Interior so thoroughly quoted in favor of this change. and must conclude that the same influences which have been brought to bear on Congress has been busy with them. I have seen many bodies of surveyors come into the West to survey boundarylines. railrohd lines. and mines and I have seen them equaled in every respect by the surveyors who Lave followed up this land survey for years. and more than outmatched by our mining engineers. who with quite as good scientific training to start with had added the practical experiences of a lifetime. I have often heard from the strangers the surprised encomiums passed upon those whom they found engaged in these pursuits. It has always been my experience that the highest talent is always to be found where there is most demand for it. and as in these regions there is continual demand there is a competent supply. and the conceit of newfledged collegiates and of governmental scientists is not rarely rubbed off by contact with these men of equal attainments and superior experience. If you abolish this contract system you must put a more costly one in its place. Contract surveyors furnish their own instruments. their own packanimals. their own camp equipage. and provisions. which - being their own property is taken infinitely more pains with than I have over seen any body of persons bestow upon the property of the Government. Now put In its place a system whereby the Government will have to furnish the instruments. the camp equipage. the .provisioas. the cooks. and the animals for these surveying parties to be used while they axe in the field. and cared for when they are not in the field. and the bills that you will be called on to pay will soon convince you that this change is not at least in the interest of economy. You will be unwilling to meet the heavy expenses of the new system. when parties will leave this city late in the spring and get back early in the fall and add the costs of their transportation to that of measuring the land. I fear that the wants of settlers will no longer b.e anticipated. and that the difficulties of getting a survey and a title will work a virtual repeal of our homestead and preemption laws. That the lands will bebetter parceled out I do not believe. But you claim that topography and geology will be added. and perfect maps showing the economic value of the land made and distributed. so that lands can thereby be selected. This is all very well. I am quite willing to have our country mapped out in that way. I do not care to interfere with your scientific surveys. but I must repeat that we are more deeply interested in having the laud divided. We have a system that was founded by the fathers. so simple and plain that any forty acres or any subdivision from Oregon to Alabama can be described in a dozen words. And that is practically what the settler wants. He is going to pick out his lands with his own eye. The speculator may select tracts by the map. the settler will pick it out on the ground. Then all he wants to know is whether his eighty or one hundred and sixty acres is within the four corners of his claim. and it is no earthly importance to him whether its position in relation to some geodetic point is correct or not. whether he is a hairs breadth out of the exact astronomic calculation or otherwise. or whether the  bulge of the earth has removed him any farther than his neighbor Jones from the region of the central fire. I tell the House that there is a great deal of gensitiveness on the subject of changes in our public land system. and all such should be wisely considered and matured. I do not think there is so great a demand for a change in our land system as some members seem to apprehend. They say to us that all the Government lands that are left unsurveyed are worthless. that all our good lands have been taken up. that nothing is left but rugged mountains and barren plains. This has ever been the cry even of the socalled scientists of this country. The surveyorgeneral of Ohio years ago said in a scientific report to the Government that the lands in Michigan. Illinois. and Iowa were worthless and never could be settled. Even so great a man and one so familiar with the West as Thomas H. Benton said that all that part of Iowa west of the Des Moines River would never be settled. And Daniel Webster spent two days in showing that not a bushel of wheat could be raised in the State of California. Professor Hayden years ago reported that Nebraska could not be cultivated. and Professor Powell has been obliged to revise and modify his opinions. But in spite of these declarations of men with theories and without experience. settlers have gone West. and practical men as they were they have seen the capabilities of this land which had escaped the notice of our scientists and statesmen. In spite of these declarations and prophecies the people have built up a new empire in the part of the West which was so condemned as useless. And I tell you that the country which lies beyond. between the one hundredth meridian and Nueva Nevada. which is condemned by many to have but 1 or 2 per cent. of good land. is going to be one of the richest and greatest parts of the vast domain of the United. Statesrich inmines farming lands. and pastures. The Rocky Mountains and valleys and contiguous plains will be occupied by a thriving and prosperous population. There are different modes of agriculture in this world. The agriculture of Spain and of Italy and Egypt is different from that of England. Ireland. and Holland. The countries which have been cultivated by means of irrigation have been made the gardenspots and the granaries of the world. and none of the green lands of the humid climates could rank with them in production and neverdecreasing fertility. Water is soil in many parts of our country. for the soil is but dust without it. but that has bsee a condition of agricultgre in countries which have been recognized as the scat of civilization. the cradle of empires. and the paradise of comfort. learning. and arq. It is claimed that we must divide up this land into larger parcers in order that stockmen and graziers may occupy it. I think that is one great cause for this agitation. I think the great stockmen of Colorado and California would like to have the preemption and homestead system broken up. which limits farms to one hundred and sixty acres each. so that they may obtain possession of tracts of three. four. and five thousand acres. and cover our Territories with small editions of the Spanish land grants of California. but those who believe in small farms and limited landed proprietorship. who wish to doter speculation and avoid monopoly. will do well to consider the sentiment of this country on that subject. before they make a move in this direction. I say to gentlemen here. do not be in too great a hurry to got rid of your public lands or to increase the amonht which any one manmay monopolize. There is many an acre of land in the western Territories which is deemed today to be useless. which will yet make a farm and a home for some poor man and his family. Our public laud system has been established upon the idea of not giving away the lands in large amounts or using them for speculation. but In holding them so as tofurnish homes to the.people of this country. for your sons and children who may go West. for the people who am crowded in your cities. the mechanics and laborers who roam your streets seeking in vain for the privilege of earning by the sweat of their brows that daily bread for which their wives and children pray at home. Not only do the overcrowded people of our cities look to this land for their iuture homes. but those from beyond the sea turn their eyes across the rolling waves hoping that some time they will find a home on the free lands of this free country. And look to it that you take no steps which may result in the alienation of this Godgiven heritage of the people. Do not let people who are able to reach your ear about Washington. whether they be scientific or not. bureaus which desire to perpetuate their existence. and men who want to create profitable offices or themselves and to indulge their scientific pursuits under Government pay and patronage. delude you into the belief that this great undeveloped land. with its stores of gold and silver. copper. iron. and lead. and all the minerals useful to man. is worthless and to be gotten rid of as soon as possible. in lots to suit speculators. It contains in its rich valleys. in its endless rolling pastures. in its rugged mineralseamed mountains. traversed by thousands of streams clear as crystal and cold as melting snow. all the elements of comfort. happiness. and prosperity to millions of men. It is the. interest of this country to open it up and not to throw any hinderances or obstacles in the way of its settlement. which I fear this change will do. And especially. gentlemen of this side of the House. I would have you adhere to that system of disposing of the public land which was inaugurated by your party. which keeps it for the homes of the people of this country. and not be led off in this matter so as to throw many impediments in the way of settlements. And it seems to me that if this violent change of system is so suddenly adopted it will be virtually a repeal of the homestead and preemption laws. I may be unduly alarmed. and the Land Office and these scientific associations may be right that it will work no detriment to settlement. but if it does cripple the poor people in their efforts to get homes on the Government lands you will hear from it in this country."},{"1":"1878","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I have introduced a bill to establish a few words in regard to the material interest of our country. The Department of Commerce. to which I desire to call the attention of policy of encouraging lines of steamers by liberal compensation for the House.

I have been pleased to read the letters of our consuls abroad in response to orders from the honorable Secretary of State. whose earnest efforts in this direction have already been productive in throwing much light upon many matters bearing upon the export trade of our country. This is a step in the right direction. but we must do something more than this. It is a good thing to know that there are other countries waitiug for the products of our mills and soil. but it is of little practical value unless we have the means of transporting those very goods. We not only want to establish steamship lines. hut we want a Department of Commerce corresponding to the English Board of Trade. which extends its arm to every quarter of the globe. collecting and collating information which leads to the opening up of new markets for her overproductions. then follow her steamships and a trade which has made her the richest of nations and the common carrier upon the high seas. The English government in its care for the trade interests of its people is like a great corporation. This is seen in the workingof its board of trade. for be it understood the action of the Government in the interest of trade and commerce is through that department. When in London two years ago I noticed. in passing through her business streets. packages. bales. and boxes of goods marked to all parts of the world. On my return home I could but notice the difference. as our shipments were confined mostly within our own States. This is largely due to the sleepless watch and care of the department known as the board of trade. through which department her merchants have unlocked the doors of the most distant markets of the world. Go where you will you will find British ships and British wares. Through the working of our protective tariffmost of our manufacturing industries have been established so that we no longer fear foreign competition in our home market. and by adopting a more liberal scale of remuneration to our artisans than the European standard has resulted in developing superior skill and a greater perfection in its products. Lord Derby in an address to a meeting of some twenty thousand workingmen in Edinburgh a few years since remarked that they must look well to their laurels. as the nation which paid the highest price for their labor was the one they had most to fear. not the cheap labor of other countries but the superior skill and ingenuity of the more liberally educated mechanics and artisansof America. The exhibit of our late Centennial took the Old World by surprise. indeed the full measure of our progress had not been fully realized by our own people. We no longer need foreign stamps to recommend our goods. Let our manufacturers have their raw material duty free or as nearly so as possible. and let the Government extend a helping hand to build up our merchant marine and give us a department of commerce. with all its great future possibilities for good. then we shall soon find means for disposing of our overproductions. are bringing to our shores millions of dollars which are now diverted to other countries. Then we should be no longer pained with the fact that thousands and tens of thousands of honest labor are standing idle in our streets. Then the flagging energies of our people would wake to new life. when the spindles. looms. and all the implements of our varied industries would clang and hum again with activity. This will solve the problem as to our ability to pay our debts and our taxes by giving us the means to pay with. Various causes have been assigned for this longcontinued depression in business. but in my opinion the chief cause is that with the increased application of machinery in our manufactures our preductive capacity has outstripped the wants of our people. The great want of the time is foreign markets for our products. We have them at our doors. but we have failed to improve as we should our opportunities. A now era is dawning. old issues have passed away. the great work before us is industrial and commercial developments. It is true that the teeming West will sooi become the granary of the world. therefore we must open up new markets for her increased products. so that manufacturers and agriculturists will go hand in hand and help to restore the waste places. and with the blessing of a kind Providence cause our land again to rejoice with prosperity."},{"1":"1877","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Yes. sir. I understand. The gentleman says it is a body ordained by the Constitution and clothed wifb legislative powers and judicial powers. and it is from this proposition. as he states it. that I dissent. Now. sir. if as the gentleman contends it is a body under the Constitution clothed with legislative powers it can do no act nor adopt any resolution nor make any order or take a concurrent vote without having the President of the United States to approve such action. For such is the requirement of the Constitution as to all proceedings of the two Houses when acting as a legislature. Blnt. I repeat. it is no legislature in the contemplation of the Constitution. It cannot perform any legislative act. Could a bill be introduced and passed in such an assembly ? It could net even make an appropriation to payits einployts. The very tellers. by whom the count is made. are appointed for it by the two Houses severally when in session as branches of Congress. It is an organized body provided by the Constitution. called into being once in everyfour years. the two Houses being its constituent parts. but it has only a single ftnelion. and that is to count the electoral vote. as one party contends. or to witness that count. as the other party holds. The method therefore which this bill provides for ascertaining the legal votes which ought to ie counted. and distinguishing them from the illegal votes which ought not to be counted. may be a good or bad method. a wise or foolish mithod. but ait uncoistitutional one it is not. For. in the first place. whatever of power is given to this commission is not given to it by the body intrusted with the duty of counting the electoral vote. bnt by Congress. by regular legislation of the Senate and louse with the approval of the President. If I am right in tin proposition that the duty to be performed in counting the electoral vote does not attach to the character of the Senate and House as the National Legislature. but is the single function of a special organization provided by the Constitution. I think it cannot be doubted that Congress may by law prescribe the teans and agencies whereby the assemblagc may perform its function with facility and efficiency. If in order to perfect the machinery of that special organization Congress by law supplements it with this commission. it cannot be objected to unless it violates some constitutional provisios as to its character. The power given to this commission is not the power intrusted the Senate and House thus assembled of determining who has received a majority of votes. but is simply the power to test the genuineness of a certain class of contested votes. the result of which the two Houses finally determine. Has Congress not the power to do this ? Why. sir. the law of 1792 provides the means by which the President of the Senate shall be guided in receiving tie electoral certificates. and requires that the certificate of the vote from each electoral college shall be attested by the governor of each State. Does that law substitute the governor for the Senate and House or infringe upon their power? So where two returns come from the same State. this bill submits them to the scrutiny of the commission and requires its attestation to the genuineness of the one which is to be counted. unless the Senate and House determine to rejeet the finding of the commission. I desire to examine for a moment the position which has been pressed by gentlemen. in this discussion. that the President of the Senate has the right not only to open the certificates but to count the votes. For the sake of the argument let us adroit this assumed prerogative of that officer with whatevfr of power may be incident to its exercise. It is certain that if lie has the right to count the vote lie has the right to count it only in the presence of the Senate and Hesse. Now. sir. give to these words of the Constitutiou the very miuuioun of significance which gentlemen have allowed them. Say that they mean only the two [louses shall be present as witnesses. and these words are replete with positive andi affirmative power. If they are witnesses surely no one will pretend that they are blind witnesses and deaf and dumb. Sir. if these two Houses are present under a constitutional duty to witness the count. are they not under a correlative obligation to reface to witness that which they hold to be mot a count ? If either of these witnesses denies that it is an honest count. the count is not a legal one. Suppose each of these two Houses retire to its own chamber and there puts on record that it has not witnessed a count but a fraud and a lie. what is the result? Why. sir. the whole proceeding becomes null and void. It is like the case of a man who is about to make his will. He and he alone has tie power to make it. but the law requires him to make it in the presence of three witnesses. If the witcesses. or any one of them. refusesto attest.and swears that the signature is not genuine. orthat the testator was not of sane or disposiung mind. what becomes of the validity of the will? If. then. the Senate or the House reflises to testify to the count. or if they declare upon record that what purported to be a count was a cheating. deceptive. fraudulent preense. what. I ask again. biecones of the validity of the count ? Surely the two Houses alone can testify whether the right vote was counted. If. therefore. the assumed right of the President of the Senate be granted the count cannot result in an election unless the witnesses. the Senate and the House. agree in giving their testimony to its correctness. But to do all this implies the right to discriutinate the legal from the illegal vote. To accomplish this result it is Innposed by this bill that Congress. under its power to pass all laws necessary and proper to the execution of any power vested in any department of the Government. shall provide . tfethod by which in case of two certificates the Senate and House may ascertain the legal vote which ought to be counted. Believing this bill td be constitutional. I shall support it for reasons which I will now give as well as I can in the short time allotted to me. My first reason is that ib furnishes a provision which secures our Government against what has been considered by all our wisest statesmen as the weakest and therefore the most dangerous point in our system. They have feared that the elcetion of President. in wuich nearly all the honors and eniolnuients of Government are staked as prizes to be contended for. would soon degeiirate into a struggle and contest for these honors and emoluments. in which party ascendancy and party triumph will be objects of far greater solicitude than the prosperity and good of the country. This apprehension was twentyfive years ago expressed by agreat American statesman in words which seem to be peculiarly appropriate to the present condition of public affairs. Speakiug of the vast and growingpatronage of the President and the number of offices of distinction and profit in his control. he says : Thene. anil especially the bitter. hove nadle the election of Presitnit tihe great andi atsorbing object of party sniiggles. and en this the appeal to force will be iadoe wheiiever tihe violence of the struggle and the corruption of parties will no longer submit to tie decision of the ballobox.

Sir. this measure. unanimously recommended by men representin both political parties. I regard as certain proof that in this Congress devotion to party is not stronger Itan devotion to the contry. and that the promotion of the prosperity and interest of the country are objects of deeper and more intense solicitude than all the honors and emolunients which may be reaped as the rewards aud spoils of a presidential trimph. Its enactment into a law will be a grand triumph of patriotism. nationality. harmony. and zeal for the public good over faction. selfishness. and the struggle for party ascendancy. For this reason alone I would give my support to this bill. I proceed to my next reason. As I understand the measure it rests on three propositions: First. that the President of the Senate has not the right to decide what votes to count and what to reject. second. that both the Senate and the House have the right to decide and direct what is an honest count of legal votes . third. that. as neither can surrender this right to the other and that there are differences of opinion as to the extent of this power whether it is limited to the ascertainnient of the authenticity of the certified returns or extends to the right of going behind them. it provides for a tribunal to decide these questions in cases of conflicting returns and to determine which return is the true and which of the controverted votes are the proper ones to be counted. In other words. they will take the advice of a commission the character of which will guiarantee a thoroughly considered and impartial opinion. Upon that opinion the two Rouses assembled will finally act. Now. sir. if I had doubts of the wisdom of this plan. which I have not. I would accept it in preference to the alternative which is now before us. If no mode of adjustiiig or reconciling the present differences can be found. what is the result ? Why that the next President will have to be inaugurated by a method and through processes and agencies advocated and pressed by one party alone with the view to a single object. and that is the consummation of its own tinmnnln. to which it believes itself entitled. However this presidential contested election may be ended. unless this bill passes. one or the other party mst determine to submit to what it believes to be a fraudulent perversion of law. Constilution. and right. or to resist by force. Either of these results would beau incalculable calamity. In case ofsntbmission the whole moral force of the Government would be destroyed. Both to those who win and those who lose. the Constitution will have become a ncre weapon of party warfare. and the unanipulation of a venal and corrupt popular vote will be perfected in the bands of bold and bad political adventurers. and in all succeeding elections the forms of constitutional procedure will be more and more -recklessly disregarded until finally the result will be determined. not by the hailt. but by sword and bayonet. As to the alternative of resistance there is no necessity to pretend to ignore it. for we all knuow that a good deal has been said about it. bothl by those who would scorp to think it possible and those whom (1 am sorry to say it) would be glad to hear it threatened. Now. sir. the man who says that Ile despises such indications. who feels a contempt for the menace of civil war. no matter front what quarter it comes. permits himself to overlook one of the most important features iu the problem of government. the contentment. tile harmony. and repose and security of the society for which lie legislates. and he forgets the first lesson in the elementary book of practical politics. For one. I am not unwilling to say that the former altertative (of submission) would be the one adoited and that resistance would not be made. at least by the democratic party. Audin saying this. I wish to repel the disparagement which lihas reen expressed of the couragec and patriotism of our northern political associates nd friends which tie sometimes hear. I believe theer to be Nanting in neither. As to the charge that in the past they have encouraged us with pnmises of support that were not fulfilled. I deny it. They did sympathize .with ns as to the causes which provoked our secession. Bet while a few public men made extravagant declarations as to what they would do in a certain event. our northern democratic friends as a party pleaded with us to remain arnd defend our institutions with their support inside of the Union. They did not as a party give assurances of cooperation and aid to us against their own States should war resilt from our secession. And. sir. if there existed wilh ins at tfiat time any bitter feeling of disappointment toward or frmier political associates. it has been effaced by their undeviating lidelity since the war to the constitutional rights of our people ani by their u nwavering support and syinpalhy. coming tip on every question as trim as tire needle to the pole. withort the necdles variations. No. sir. whatever of responsibility the South incurred in that nriOvemn1t she has no desire to shrink from. The sorrowfil lesson we have to teach our chilren is all our own. It is that we undertook a great political moveenicut which tiineand thofortrnesof war disclosed that we had not the strength and resources to Carry on to r succssful cOIRntinirat ion. Our vindicationand ri generous victor will not deny us thatlies in our soleuin conviction that we were defending the institutions and the priiciples of constitutional liberty. the heritage of the fathers of the iRepublic. It was this sentiment which inspired the courage of our soldiers in battle anti now renders our section all the more precious to us in defeat. giving her to our eyes at least dignity in her desolation and beauty anti rajesty even in her ruin and woe. I repeat. this bill avoids she necessity or any subuission of the defeated party to what it may consider either fraud or force. The result. whatever it may be. will have been reached by the patriotic consent of both parties. Audit it involves any add(ition to thu methods heretofore observed. it will have been an addition fairly discussed. openly ud legally adopted. ratified Ioy the will and approved by the good sense of the whole people. It leaves the framework of the Constitntion unshaken. the saictitycf law inviolate. Indeed. it is so in harmony with the genius of the Constitution. so promotive of the schenre of its framers. that had this commission of reterence been part of the original Constitution itself. there wouhl have been no language too extravagant to describe its farsighted wisdom. To have solved so dingcrous and difficult a question so simply. so calmly. and so jnstly is the highest tribute which can be aid to those principles of cAstitirtionial liberty which have trained tie American people to such a possibility. The spirit in which the bill has been framed by its authors of both parties is no slight guarantee of the fairness with which tire representative men of both political parties -ill administer itsprnvisions. and if I cannot rely upon the patience and ability and thejistice which the members of the Supreme Court will bring to the discharge of perhaps the most soleonm duty ever iposed upon the magistrates of a free country. with what contidence could I accept or aslc others to accept the decision of the same question by a mere party majority either of the Senate or the House I There is another consideration which commends this bill to my support. It cannot be denied that this presidential campaign has been marked Iy some painful characteristics. It cannot he denied that strong sectional prejudices and passions were appealed to and excited in its progress. It cautit be denied that a large niajority of Northern States were found on one side and that an almost unbroken body of Southern States were found on the other. Now. sir. ii such an issue. in the presence of such parties. in full viewof all the unjust and unconstitutional action to which party passion has stirculatel party power. I feel that this bill is a declaration that in the future this tyranny of force nmst cease. that hereafter in riny conflicts to which the South as a part of the Union must be necessarily a party. the sword sh all riot be thrown into the scales of justice nor military power be permitted to silence the law. but that all qlestious of difference must he refurred to the arbitration of reason. I feel that my section at least has been permitted to stand forth once more in the pure air of free diseussion. and that whatever be the decision. we have been allowed to appeal to men acknowledging a common citizenship under an equal Constitution. Nor does the fact that the justices of the Supreme Court are made parties in this commission lessen my conviction of its propriety or weaken the sentiment of approval wit h which I regard it. 1 have no fear of disturbing tire balance of constitutional powers. nor have I any mistrrst of the spirit of honest impartialit y in which that dinty will be discharged. 1 listen with ao patience to imputations npon this august tribunal. I cannot forget that one of the greatest of American statesmen. the man who least of all who have left their mark oir our constitntional history. wasdisposed tocompromise either rights ior duties. who Spoke ocf such comromcise as shiftiigsaidisancl thre Constitiution as a rock of supcport. taught iri tris Cconfideiie. When in 1848 the qcestion of the power of Congress over slavery in the Territories was .cerplexing our councils and presaging the civil troubles which came upon nsafterward. it was proposed in the Clayton conipronise to refer that question. political and sectional as it was. to tire Supreme Court for decision . that reference was warmly supported by Mr. Calhoun. who deeured that such a reference was leaving it where it ought to be left. to the Constitution. And. sir. so we may say that this measure refers this question to the tribunal of the Constitution. Sir. I do know that in the dark hour of our distress it was from that court. just as it is now constituted. and from it alone of all the departments of this Federal Govermeit. that we of the South have had protection against the legislation that forgot the Constitution in the vengeful spirit of its harsh and oppressive provisilins.

I will read from Mr. Seyds recent work on the metallic curreicy of the United States in regard to the effect of the laws of 1834 and 1837: The disappearance and exportation of the Americian silver coinage were caused by quite a different mnatter. The American silver coaio was always liable to exportation for the simaple reason that it ceoutaiul an unume proportion of ilver. In all countries where the double valuation prevails tiotrelative proportion of vaiuo betwcon gold anti silver stands at one to fifteen and onehalf. ant the market valno of silver ill countries where Tiis nota standard give on the avera:.e the canto re. molt. In tite United States clone the rate taten was one part of gold to sixteen of sirer. (15 98837.) the proportion resulting fto the e aglo at two hundre and fiftyeight end the silver tdollar at four hundietd anti twelve and onehalf grains. Tio dotlar therefore contained 3 (3.09) per cent. more silver theu it ought to have eo. veined according to its nominal value. No wonder. then. that the dollar was rapidly exported. and that no one foud induocenent to bring silver to the mints for coinage And let it be understood that the supply of gol 1 had little or nothing to do with this. Long before the discovery of gold to California. over sines 1837. has the effect of this premium on the Uniteil States silver dollar made itself matifest. In xohane for it the foreigner need net have supplied gold. other commaodities served the purpose of realizing elsewhere the larne profit which tlce United States gave to the exporter of hsr silver coin. Muchtl si be liven doubtful. peotliar. ean unsatisfactory in the history of the United States currency between 18 c7 and 1850 ewes its origin to this astounding mistake on the part tf ie Government. which nut. as everv one can see. have given rise to g(octal disorganization of the currency and to lisappointment in the ipacity of tite country to retain otetallie curtonoy. I go further. and sy that it was itho cause why America wan obliged to mate so largo a use of paper money. with all its evils of uoqual interests. oxtravagatthabits. afd expenditure. It is remarkable that by the adoption of the first standard of 1792 gold at once fled the country and silver filled the channels of business. and that by the attempt to correct this error our laws overleaped the market and true relative value of these metals and established the rate of silver too low. and this drove silver out of the country and gold became the universal currency. This nocessary result was deepened and strengthened by the fact that in 1850 by the discovery of gold mines in California gold came pouring into s in such floods that our silver currency entirely diappeared and its relative valte increased. All the money we had was gold money. not silver money. We had no change. In some parts of the country we resorted to shinplasters. Thus a slight error in fixing -the relative value between gold and silver made two remarkable movements in these precious metals. a striking illustration of the necessity for the utmost care in dealing with all questions affecting onetallic money. In 1853 Congress undertook to correct ttis evil. and under the lead of Mr. ltnttter. of Virginia. then chairman of the Committee on Finance. the act of 1853 was passed. I have before me a very learned reoport made by Mr. Hunter. in which he pointed out the evils of the then existing system and prescribed. as he thought. a remedy. Perlaps I hadl beter read to the Senate a brief extrac from Hr. Huntersrport to show that ho examinedthe matter with great care. that Ie apprciated the evil to be remedied . but even he finally fell into the error of largely demonetizing silver by not reducing tile silver dollar then undervalued. Mr. Hunter. on the third page of his report. says: Indeed. it appears from a carefully compiled table appended to Mr. Ingham roport. (document No. 1t1. page 101.) that from 1422 to 1825 there were coned from the American mines $4.310.000.00 in silver. an only elt.90.009.000 in gold. Btt. lt tracing the effect of this chatge of the relative value upon particular oountries. we muet not forget its operation upon the rest of the world. in thus excluding ono of those metals fnom one cotitry. if its property and trade were large attd in t hue forcing mte than its natural proportion iuto oeanufactures. we should dind. fel the volume of specie currney of the world below the natural stpply.- How this would affect mankind will N) hereafter examinod. lint tltettiohief woudhe great indeed if all the world were to adopt but one of the preciouo metals an the standard of value. To adopt gold alone would dliminisb the stecie currency more than onehalf. and the reduction the other way. should silver be taken as the only standard. would be largo enoughto prove highly disastrous to the human race. Ii. deed. a reference to the history of the precious metols and the general course of human production can scarcely fail to convince its that there has been a constant tcndeucoy to appreciate their value as compared with the residue of the property of the world. and that er y oxtraordinary increase of tte supply of the precious inetals of whtch we have any accont has xerciscd a highly becnfloial etfect upon human affahs. When contracts are made by a standard which is gradually eontraocing. the advantages aroon othe side of eapitol as against labor. aind productive energy is crampel by receiving lss than a far share of the profit of its enterprises. It is manifest from this extract that I have read from Mr. Hunters report. which is itself very voluminous. that the desireof Mr. Hunter and those who voted for the passage of the ct of 185 was to bring back silver into this country. so that we might have silver and gold again as the currenty of the country. and the tteasure they adopted was intended to produce that effect. What was it? By the act of 1853 11o change was made in gold coin or in the silver dollar. It was left demonetized by scing rated at less that its market value. The act provided. however. for subsidiary silver coin. the half dollar. the quarter dollar. the dime. and the half dime. It prescribed the weight of the coin atthreehundred audeightyfonr grains to the dollar. instead of four hundred and twelve and a half grains. Iti made the stisidiary coin a legal tender for $5. and all other coins were left a legal tender without limit. This act. as I stated. provided for a subsidiary coinage worth about 6 per cent. less than the par of specie. assuming the par to be at the rate of sixteen to on. The subsidiary coit was only made a legal tender to the amount of $5. leaving the silver dollar still in force a full legal tender for all contracts. The effect of this act of 1853 was to bring back to us silver change in abundance as a token coin. There was issued between 1853 and 1861 about $48.000.000 of silver coin. It was the change of the country. and to that extent silver was monetized again and in daily tet. bnt the dollar was still undervalued and has never entered into circulation from 1853 to this time. Except for special purposes. the silver dollar of the United States disappeared from among the coins of the world for the palpable reason that it was more valuable to export than to coin."},{"1":"1875","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I say thenthat whileI whollydisapproveof the remedies proposed by General Sheridanand he simply submitted themto the Congress of the United Statesyet after a sober review of such papis as I have before me which.

The KuKlux were suppressed by the law. which was onforced ill some of the States. and they abandoned it or probably abandoned it partly on the urgent appeals of such men as Mr. Pollard. who denounced them is a great disgrace against civilization. But the White League comes in. armed. organized. and disciplined. sworn to overthrow the State government of Louisiana. They say they are for protection. We know they are not.

Sir. you will have to convince the northorn people that this story is not true. Yon cannot do it. my worthy colleagne. by sneers or smiles . it must be done by sober facts. because here are indictnentswhich cannothe answeredlightly. Now. Mo. President. I wish to correct a misapprehension that might grow out of my remarks denunciatory of the White Leagues and the banditti. I do not say that all the people of Louisiana are of that mode of thinking at all. I know that we republicans sometimes neglect to give to these people in their present condition. due consideration for some of the circumstances by which they are surrounded. In the first place. in Louisiana the war has left its excitement. and sonc of tis scones of the war in the Red River country. in this very Coushatta region on the upper part of Red River. and in New Orleans. have left great animosities. ani we cannot expect these to (tie away in a monment. We must take that into consideration in viewing the conduct of the people of Louisiana. Besides. tley have a mixed population. We know that there is a portion of the population of French descent. a portion of Spanish descent. many and probably a majority of colored people. soeo from foreign lands. some from our own Northern States. some from other Southern States. Probably there is no portion of the people of tie United States that has a more mixed origin than the people of Louisiana. In all cases that tends to promote violence. because sometimes speaking different languages they cannot understand each other. sometimes being educated in different lands and under different institutions they cannot appreciate the institutions tinder which we live. All these things are to be considered. They have to encounter another great difficulty. in the novelty of foriier masters and slaves living together rsfreemen. This we know by all history is a most difficult problem. Those who were once slaves. whose wives and children were bartered and sold like sheep. are now citizens. The masters have been impoverished. they have bost their slaves. they have lost the use of their lands. all their labor is broken up. All these things are to be considered. cud we must not overlook them. We must not therefore expect from them the same orderly reguhirity. the same freedom from violence and fore that we sliould expect in a stable. orderly people like the peo1)10 of Ohio or Now York. All the sources of wealth. are dried np. When I was there last winter I conversed with gentlemen of all political parties. cal saw the great change in tho value of their property and the amount of their income. Some families hadincomes dependent upon the rents of real estate in Now Orleans. and the real estate would hardly pay the taxes. amd they were reduced to poverty. hardly able to gather money enough to pay their taxes. All that creates acerbity and bitterness of feeling. and no one felt it more than I did at that time. Thoughtful men I say should give heed to all these diseopiragements and difficulties. but after all. considering them all. we have a right to ask of these people to respect the law. to be obedient to the law. If they have a majority.in the uame of God let them have the power of the majority. I would not. I am sure. cud I do not believe aiy of my fellow Senators would. seek to deprive any State of the right to be governed by its own people. by home government. as they call it. Whatwe do sayis that they shall not trample down the rights of others. that when they are exercising their owi right in voting as they please. electing democrats. electing confederate geierals if they please. anybody they choose. they must not trample down the rights of the warls of the nation. who have been emancipated by our policy and by otr laws. Equal rights. equal privileges. equal facilities for education. for life. for liberty. and the acquirement and enjoyment of propertythat we demanid. aid in the name of God and by the agency of the republicall party we will have it sooner or later. There is no doubt about that. I will not now dwell upon the remedy. I intended to do so. but I ant already too wearicil to enter upon it. hut I do say that the Senate ought now to take up this matter ii a dispassionato way and do equal ad exact jastice tothese people. If a democratie house was elected there last November lawfully and fairly. in the name of Heaven given them the organization. reqiiing them however to organize according to law to obey the law and not obtain it by laiwlces violence. If they get the control of the house in a regular and legal way. let them have it. The republican party is strong enough and I hope brave enough to do justiceto our political adversaries. If. as I honestly believe. their soccess will be an unmixed evil to our country. it car be easily repaired. and the future is all before us. Then let them secure to all the people of Louisiana equal and just rights. and let us her no more of the wrongs. outrages. and murders that have wronged the State of Louisiana. Why can they not live in.peaco I cannot cocceive of a state of society where a whole population is overawed and intimidated. as undoubtedly the negro population ire to a very large extent in many parishes of that State. where murder cain be committed without punishment. The nere statemleut that a thousand miurdersonly take onethird of wlat General Sheridan saysthat a thousand murders have beei cumitted in Louisiana id not a single mian punished for them is a fact so atrocious. so terrible. so daninable. that I can hardly belinve it. Yettlieroit is. How that matter occurred at Coushatta. how the people there. democrats and all. did not rise and follow the murderers and take instant vugeance on them. or at least secure them and trythem before the courts. I cannot imagine. Yet four or live young men from the North who went there with capital. who went merely to buildu p a little village. were suddenly broken up and murdered after they had surrendered. The murderers violated even the code of honor which always secures a mai whr surrenders safety.

Because in 1857 the people were suspicions of the paper of fll the baniks. and more anxious to pay their dehts with it and get clear of it. and then if they hind two or three hundred dollars left they would lend it to their neighbors and get a good note for it. preferriig the note to bank paper. but now they do not do that. The currency is so good that they hoard it. There is that difference. and my friend from Miehigan is correct about it. Mr. President. I wish to refer to another thing right here. in viiidication of the action of the Government. and in support of another general proposition. I lay down this as a general proposition. to be established by reference to the history of panics for time last hundred and fifty years: that the true relief for a panic. to bring about a restoration of confidence. has been. not resumption. not coitraction. but by making additions to the currency at the time. That is a very important proposition. if it is true. The remedy has been by making a samallI use the word small -alition to the volume of the currency at the time. One word in regard to the action of the Government. The Government when this panic took place authorized the purchase of bonds to the amount of the currency balance in the Treasury at that the. about fourteen millions. if I remember correctly. It was said that that was taken up by the savingsbanks in New York. Philadelphiai. and Boston. and so it was. It was said that it was unwise. because the moey did not go into circulation. It was the very wisest thin.. that could be done. and in iy opinion prevented great mischief and circiunscribed the cevil effects of the panic at once. The savingsbanks of New York. Philadelphia. Bosten. and other cities held large amomts of United States bonds. and when they sold their bonds to the Government. as they (lid to the amount of about fourteen million dollars. they thereby obtained currency to pay their depositors. Their depositors knew it. had perfect confidence in them. and there was no rue. I happened to be in New York at the time. and I remember well that on that Saturday. and ol what was called black Sunday. there were rumors upon the streets of mobs and runs upon the savingsbanks. and if it had not been tht the people were assured of tie solvency of those banks and of their ability to pay their deposits by the sale of their bonds tothe Government and getting greenbacks for them. there would have been runs upon them. and ii all probability mob violence. and the consequences of that would have been most disastrous all over the nation. The Government could have done nothing better than to have sapplied those banks with currency during that time. which at once restored confidence among their depositors and prevented.public disorder and violence. Next I come to the $44.000.000 reserve. There has been some inmiprovement in times. I hear those who are opposed to what they call inflation talking about it. My friend :from Wisconsin this morning took ground against the wisdom and tIme propriety of the Government encroaching upon the $44.000.000 reserve. Why. sir. that very thing has contributed greatly to the restoration of conlideuce. The very knowledge that the currency was being emlarged. even by the addition of a few millions. has caused the banks cand the people to put their money iito ciruelation. and to cease their hoarding to a considerable extent. It is a restoration of confidence we want. and the knowledge that money is coming gives that confidence. and that knowledge causes banks and private individuals. wno have money and are hoarding it. to again put it in circulation. I want to refer to history on that very point. In 1745. when there was a great pauic in England. caused by the landing of the Pretender en the shores of Seotlaid. how was it av ertedI That panic was averted by a practical suspension of specie payments. au enlarged issue of paper money immediately. and by an agreemet on the part of tlne merchants of London and other large cities in England that they would take that paper instead of coin. Money was made plenty. the merchants were able to borrow. and the panic was stayed. Let me come down to 1793. when the first panic in England took plice. growing out of the Napoleonic wars. Mr. Pitt. a great statesman. took the responsibility of lending to the merchants of London and of Liverpool $25.000.000. (X5.000.000 sterling.) iu what wore called exchequer bills. He relieved their wants. ho made money plenty. and stopped the panie by it. The govermment collected every dollar of it. lost nothing by it. It was one of the wisest responsibilities Mr. Pitt ever took. lie conl do. as prime minister of England. without law. what the President of the United States cannot do under our form of government. lie lent that money without authority of law. put $25.000.000 additional in circulation. ind stopped the panic. amd .in 1797. four years afterward. when thlm second panic began. because they were still in war and that war was being enlarged in its area and magnitude. the ministry took the responsibility of compelling the Bank of England to suspend specie payments. amd that action was confirmed by an act of Parliament. aid the sspension lasted twentyone years. It was twentyone years before they were in a condition to resumie specie paymenits. and jinst as soon its the bank suspended. and was relieved from the necessity of redeeming her notes in coin. she commenced liar discounts iad issued a large addition of paper mnney. The vohnne of the cumrency was hncreased. and according to the historiai of the Bank of England. who gives a very graphic account of it. money that hid been hoarded by bankers. p)rivato banks. merchants. and retired eapitdists. immediately came forth and was emptied hito the general volnmie of circulation. and not only the money issued by the bank. but all the money that had been hidden away. was called into active cireilation. and the panic was at an end. The same thing was done iii 1816. In 1816 there w i.s anotherpanic. and there were Iwo thousand bankrpteics. flow was it relieved ? By the government giving the Bank of England five years longer. by act of Parliament. to resnme specie payments. Then liernotes had risen until they were at only 21 per cent. discount. Now our Governmuent notes are at 10 per cent. discount. But the British government gave the Bank of England five years to overcome the 21 per cent. She overcame the 2+ per cent. in three yearsdid not take the live . but no sooner liad specie payments been resumed than a terrible crash cne oun. and oie of the greatest linalcial disasters the people of England ever suffered occurred hamnediately after the resumnprion of specie payments in 1819. To come further down. in 1825 there was another panic. Specie payments had been resumed. the Bank of England had been paying specie for her notes ever since 1819. How was that panic relieved? There was no actual suspension at that time. but it so happened that the Bank of England found in her vaults �1.000.000 sterling. in �*1 notes. ii an old box that seemed to have been forgotten. and those notes being brought out and put in circulation. it is said to have had the effect to stay the panic. Next in 1826. a crisis again threatened. A large amount of money was issued by the Bank of England by increasing her discounts. Now we come down to 1.844. The Parliament passed waat was called the bank charter. reorganized the Bank of England. and made two departments in the bankwhat was called the banking department for discounts. and ivhnat was called the issue department. the departmnt where they made the bank paper andissued it over to the other department. and they provided that the bank should have authority to issue � 14.000.000 upon the basis of what the government owed herthe government owed her about eleven millions sterlingand three millions iu addition upon paper securities. including exchequer bills. making fourteen millions. That was all the Bank of England had a right to issue under that charterwith this further provision. that whenever the baark issued beyond the fourteen millions sterling she must have a pound sterling of bullion in her vaults for every pound note of paper money that was put out. Then. in 1847. came that dreadful panic. most memorable since that of 1797. and see how the bank was situated. She had at that tine in her vaults over eight million pounds sterling of bullion. or forty million dollars of gold. in what was called the issue department of the bank. What was the relief for the panic? The governrmenit took the responsibility of suspendingthe charter of the bank. They suspended te charter. and in open violation of the law they authorized the transfer of the eight million pounds sterling from the issue department of the bank to the discount department of the bank. thereby enabling the bank to increase the circulation to the amount of forty million dollars of paper. What was the effect of it? Just as soon as the cenmtry knew that the bank was authorized to increase her discounts forty millions the panic was stayed. It took place almst in a single lay. Of the $40.00t.000 that the bank was authorized to issue only �400.000 were actually asked for. Confidence was at once restored by the knowledge that the bank was authorized to increase the circulation. We come down to 1857. There was another panic in England then. How was it stayed? Did they say. like our philosophersdo here. that a panic must ru its course? Our financial philosophers say we must let a panic alone. it must run its course like the measles. or the mnallpox. or a fever: you mast not doctor it any. They never take thatview of it in England. From the first they have proceeded upon the principle of doctoring a panicof trying to stop it at once. You might just as well say that when a fire breaks out in a great city like Chicago you umst let it alone. lot it run its course. not try to put it out or circumscribe it by blowing up buildings all around it. or when the yellow fever breaks out at Memphis yoni must not strive to ber in the pestilenee and stamp it out. let it run its course. I say when a panic occurs it is the duty of the Government. if possible. to stay its progress and shorten its duration. If we can shorten its duration six months we confer a vast blessing upon the country. Ever day it continues millions are lost in productive labor and tIm profits of business. and there is vast suflbring ard distress. ard if you shorten it but one month you have couferrcd al inestinable favor upon tre people. The English government. the French and German governments. have always gone upon the theory. not of letting panitics run their course. but of trying to relieve them. shorten their continurnce. remove their consequences as soon as possible. When the panic of 1857 took place the English government again took the responsibility of s1uspending the bank act aird allowing the bank to issue money beyond her legal limitsin other words. to increase the volume of paper circulation. and is soon as that fact was known it had the effect of staying the panic. aud but two million pounds sterling. or teu million dollars. were required. Again. in 1866. when tie great panic occasioned by the failure of Overend. Gurney & Co. took place. when the currency of England was as perfect as the currency of any country could be. what course did the Englist government take? The same that had been taken ever since 1745--they rolieved the panic by anthorizing the bank to nakanu addition to her circulation. and the effbet was instantaneous. [n 1848. when a panic in France was caused by the revolution. the provisional government. to allay it. authorized the Bank of -Francte to issue additional currency sufficient for the exigency. limiting its entire issue to 350.000.000 francs. or $70.000.000. Then I say that the proposition that panics are not to run their course. but are to be doctored and relieved. is sustained by the history of panics for ruany years in the past. and the way that has been adopted has been either by suspending specie* paynents generally or making an addition to the volume of the currency. When a panic takes place it does not require a very large addition to the currency. to restore confidenco and bring about a revival of trade and coamerce. I am opposed to expansion. I do not believe i tIe doetrino of adding one huidred or two hudred or three hundred millions to tie currency. I would do no such thing . but I do believe in resorting to those easy. natural. and often proved to b efficacious Leans of relieving the eflects of a panic by racking money plenty for the ime being. Money is scarce because people hoard it. How do you make it plenty? Add a little to the whole volume of the currency. and that calls out what has been hoarded. That has been the experience and history of England and France ard Germany. And when the panic has becn relieved and good times have come you can take it back. to use a sailors phrase. you can take in the slack if you desire to do so. If you think the volume of currency is too great you call fund it. as my friend. the cltairman of the coranittee. proposes to do. There are various ways hr which you cast get that money back. it does not take much to start the wheels. but when the wheels of trade are started their revolution becomes fister and faster. If airy of you traveled in the West in former times you have sometimes scen a wagon strek in the nind. and when they put on a fifth horsea little more powerand got at single revolution of the wheels. they could pull out easily. and the additional horse could be taken off. I remember when I was a very little boyit is about as long ago as I can remember anythhrggoing to mill. and the mill was not rinirg because the water was low. and I remember that the miller and his boys went to tire race belowp with buckets. cnd took water cat of the race and carried it up over the overshot wheel. and when they lifted the headgale pouel the water on from the buckets. and the wheel started. slowly at first. but finally turned faster. and the grist was ground out. I doubt not. Mr. President. you have seen air old pump that had gone dry. you wourld pour a quart of water in the top. the circulation would be started. and the punp would resume. and you could ptip water all day. 187r. Presideait. instead of following theory in a matter of this kind. let us follow rather the lights of experience. And now what is being done by the Treasury Department ? Acting on that principlewhether they are doing it for that purpose or not. that is what they are doing. The Government is today. by the disbursement of the $44.000.000 reserve. adding to the volume of the currency. and those sumall additions which are being made. of which the wlole country is aware. are doing much today toward removing the effect of this panic. So that this falling off in the revenue. while it is a great misfortune. is not art unmixed one. it is carrying some benefit to the people. The Govermnent is not responsible for this panic. Why. sir. this panic was an accident. just as much as the explosion of the boiler of a steamboat. or a collision upon a railroadan accident. the result of ali event that nobody could foresee. It had no connection with our Govetrnmnt systeum of finance or anything in our currency. It was an accident that might have happeued just as well ili a country that had nothig but gold and silver as a currency. It was an accident. and shall not relief be provided for this accident ? Our Government is now relieving against it. I was very sorry when the panic commenced that our Government did not see its way clear to put into ei*reulatioar at once the whole $44.000.000 reserve. Ibelievo if the Government had been aide to do that. this panic would have stopped at once. it would not have lasted three weels. but the President was not at liberty to do that. the Secretary of the Treasury (lid not feel safe in doing that. Why? He anticipated. ait witi a sagacity that lie. perhaps. has not got crerit forlhe anticipated. as did tho Presidert. that there aight be a falling offin the revenues. and that thait falling off would require this $44.000.000 reserve to carry on the ordinary operations of the Govermment. and those anticipations have turned out to be correct to the very letter. Is it said that there is no panic. I give you evidence of the existence of a panic. of its widespread and disastrous eharacter. and that is in the falling off of the revenues. There is proof positive. Your imports have fallen off very largely. The very day the panic occurred. or the day after. men who had sent large orders to Europe for goods recalled them by telegraph. I know that that was done. Our imports have fallen oft ltrgely. and therefore our receipts of gold for duties have fallen off largely. cud our internal revenues lso have fallen off largely. These are the effects of the panic. and the best way to restore the revenu is to restore the condition of the country. and you cannot do it until you do restore the condition of the country. As I said before. the Government is no more responsible for this prnic than anybody in private life. It was a thing that could not have been anticipated. and that might happen in any govenucnt and under any system of finance that the irgeuiaity of man ever devised. But the accident came. the consequences are upon us. But. Mr. President. I have said five times as ainich as Texpected to say when I began. I was rather drawn into this line of remtark by inty friend from Massachusetts. I desire to say agailm that while I *1 agree that we arebound at sometime to come to the specie standard and that we :ne bound by the most solemn pledge to redeem our notes inl coin. or by giving the lolders. at their option. an equivalent. I do not believe this is the time to undertake to do it or to enter upon it."}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
