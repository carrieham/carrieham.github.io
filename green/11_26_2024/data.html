I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. my colleague from across the aisle is right: This makes no sense. If my colleagues across the aisle actually want to push back against Russia. Iran. and Venezuela. then pass the supplemental because that funding will do more to help support democracies around the world and help countries most in need than whatever is in H.R. 1121. Listening to some of the arguments we have heard from Republicans over the last week and even now today. I have to say. I am confused. Is oil and gas production higher than ever. or is there a war on energy? Are gas prices high because of Bidenomics. or are prices so low that we should continue exporting LNG? Should the government stop picking winners and losers through energy subsidies. or should we continue giving handouts to oil and gas and even expand those giveaways with the bills up today? I suspect Republican messaging is so confusing because continuing to rig the system for Big Oil just doesnt make sense. The U.S. is producing record amounts of oil and gas and is exporting more than ever before. I will say it again: The U.S. is producing record amounts of oil and gas and is exporting more than ever before. Yet. the American people arent seeing the benefits. Prices for consumers are still high while Big Oil and other big corporations rake in massive profits. Reporting from the Groundwork Collaborative found that over half of recent U.S. inflation was caused by corporate price gouging. even as input costs decreased. Mr. Speaker. I include in the Record the Groundwork Collaborative report. [From Groundwork Collaborative. Jan. 18. 2024] Inflation Revelation: How Outsized Corporate Profits Drive Rising Costs (By Liz Pancotti. Strategic Advisor. and Lindsay Owens. Executive Director) As their cost of doing business comes down. corporations pad their bottom lines on the back of consumers. Inflation has come down significantly from its peak over the past year. yet prices remain high for American consumers. From housing and groceries to car insurance and electric bills. families are still feeling the squeeze. In the wake of the pandemic. virtually every company in every industry faced rising costs to make products and stock shelves. Labor costs rose sharply. the cost of transporting goods across the country hit record highs. and raw materials became costly or impossible to get. Corporations were quick to pass rising costs--and a little extra--on to consumers. fueling rapid inflation. As supply chain snarls have receded and the economy has stabilized. businesses continue to pad their bottom lines. rather than passing these savings on to consumers. corporate profits are driving more than half of inflation Some economists and pundits have sought to discredit the link between inflation and corporate profiteering. A Washington Post columnist recently claimed that blaming inflation on corporate profiteering is like saying its raining because water is falling from the sky. But this isnt true. Prices are simply the sum of costs and corporate profits. While rising costs or inputs can drive up Americans pay at the gas pump or the grocery store. corporate profits can just as easily. As corporations have lamented supply chain woes and high labor costs over the past two years. their profits have skyrocketed. fueling inflation and exacerbating a longstanding affordability crisis. Some economists suggested that markup growth in 2021 was primarily driven by corporations raising prices in anticipation of future costs increases. However. corporate profit margins have remained high--and even grown--as labor costs have stabilized. nonlabor input costs have come down. and supply chains snarls have eased. While labor and nonlabor input costs have played a role in price increases. corporate profits drove 53 percent of inflation during the second and third quarters of 2023 and more than one-third since the start of the pandemic. Comparatively. over the 40 years prior to the pandemic. they drove just 11 percent of growth. Corporate profits as a share of national income has skyrocketed by 29 percent since the start of the pandemic. While our economy has returned to or surpassed its pre- pandemic levels on many indicators. workers share of corporate income has still not recovered. As White House National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard has noted. Overall. the labor share of income has declined over the past two years and appears to be at or below pre-pandemic levels. While corporate profits as a share of GDP remain near postwar highs. Economist Isabella Weber has pointed out that corporations are keeping prices high even as post-pandemic and Ukraine War supply chain pressures ease and wage growth slows. Why? Because they can. Weber argues that supply shocks allowed corporations to tacitly collude. hike prices. and rake in record profits. This type of inflation. where corporations raise prices to protect--and even increase--their profit margins. allows prices to rise faster than the costs to make goods or provide services. When corporations pursued this opportunistic pricing strategy. they found a lot of space to increase prices. drive up profits. and see very little dropoff in demand. Though inflation has eased. prices remain tremendously elevated from their pre-pandemic levels. Housing costs. for example. are up 21 percent. grocery costs have risen by 25 percent. consumer prices are rising much faster than corporations input costs While prices for consumers have risen by 3.4 percent over the past year. input costs for producers have risen by just 1 percent. For many commodities and services. producers prices have actually decreased. Input costs for key goods and services have sharply decreased over the past year. For example. nearly 60 percent of the drop in input goods prices was driven by large declines in energy costs. such as jet fuel and diesel fuel. Transportation and warehousing costs. which many corporations have cited as a main driver of price increases. have come down by nearly 4 percent since peaking in June 2022. These input costs are critically important for corporations balance sheets. As costs go down but revenue stays high because of higher sticker prices. corporate profit margins expand on the backs of American consumers. One prime example of this is the diaper industry. which is highly concentrated--Procter &amp. Gamble Co. (P&amp.G) and Kimberly- Clark Corp. control 70 percent of the domestic market. Diaper prices have increased by more than 30 percent since 2019 from. on average. $16.50 to nearly $22. Wood pulp is a major input in diapers and other paper products. like toilet paper and paper towels. Wholesale wood pulp prices soared by 87 percent between January 2021 and January 2023. Yet between January and December 2023. prices declined by 25 percent. Using their pricing power. P&amp.G and Kimberly-Clark have kept diaper prices high for American families. allowing their profit margins to expand considerably. In P&amp.Gs October 2023 earnings call. its CFO. Andre Schulten. said that high prices were a big driver of profit margin expansion and 33 percent of their profits in the previous quarter were driven by lower input costs. During P&amp.Gs July 2023 earnings call. the company predicted $800 million in windfall profits because of declining input costs. In Kimberly-Clarks October 2023 earnings call. CEO Mike Hsu said the company finally saw inflation in the cost environment and admitted that he believes the company has a lot of opportunity to [expand margins over time] between what [theyre] doing on the revenue side and also on the cost side. Despite these large input cost declines. Hsu said he thinks the company has priced appropriately and did not anticipate any price deflation. The diaper industry is just one example of corporations exploiting their pricing power to expand margins as input costs normalize. The same is true for many consumer goods. including new and used cars. groceries. and housing. corporations have bragged about their ability to raise prices Over the past two years. corporations have been explicit about how theyve exploited their pricing power. and how they have and will continue to do so even as inflation comes down. General Mills attributed their 16.5 percent increase in profits in FY 2022 to getting smart about how [they] look at pricing. PepsiCo raised its prices across snacks and beverages by roughly 15 percent during each of 2022Q4 and 2023Q1 as it increased its margin. CFO Hugh Johnson said they may. in fact. increase margins during the course of the year as costs decreases and prices remain elevated. The CEO of Holcim. a construction materials manufacturer. said on recent earnings call. We are in that inflationary environment already for almost two years now...We have done the pricing in a very proactive way so that our results arent suffering. On the contrary. they are improving the margins. Profit margins for AutoNations finance and insurance segment have increased by 7 percent as they continue to hike margins with new fees and increased prices for consumers. even while products dont improve. Carvana notes that it deceased its non-vehicle retail costs by nearly $1.000 per car. driving huge margin increases (30 percent) even as used car costs remain elevated. Used car prices remain elevated and are up nearly 40 percent. conclusion In the wake of the pandemic. consumer demand rebounded and supply chains struggled to keep up as a result of decades of disinvestment and offshoring. Goods became more expensive to make and transport. and tighter labor markets delivered long- overdue wage increases for workers. As businesses costs went up. they jumped on the opportunity to pass on rising costs to consumers and have continued squeezing Americans pocketbooks for more. Now that their costs have stailized--or. in many cases. come down significantly--its time for companies to stop gouging consumers. The Biden administration is taking steps to strengthen global supply chains and onshore manufacturing. crack down on corporate concentration that has enabled corporations to put consumers through the wringer. and eliminate junk fees. President Biden said last month. To any corporation that has not brought their prices back down--even as inflation has come down. even [as] supply chains have been rebuilt--its time to stop the price gouging. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. the Federal Trade Commission. and the Department of Justice continue to dust off authorities not touched in decades to rein in corporate profiteering and concentration. As Congress turns to expiring provisions from the 2017 Trump tax cuts over the next year. they must take a hard look at the corporate tax rate. Our tax code should support a robust and equitable economy. not incentivize profiteering. The fundamental question we need to ask ourselves is whether we want an economy where corporations can exploit pandemics. supply chain crises. and wars at the expense of American workers and families. or an economy where corporations are put in check. allowing everyone to thrive"},{"1":"2023","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. we have heard from my colleagues the reasons why Representative Omar should be removed from this committee. but I feel like all the reasons have not just yet been stated. which is why I rise to add to the Record. We have heard about the comments that were made regarding anti- Semitism and anti-Israeli views. but I rise to add to the Record that as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I have sat there and heard the Representative actually spew anti-American rhetoric. as well. I have been in that committee room where the Representative equates Israel and the United States to Hamas and the Taliban. Absolutely unacceptable for a member of that committee. I have also heard the Representative equate that it is the United States fault that there is turmoil in Venezuela. that it is not because of the oppressive socialism and communism that has spread throughout Central and South America and Venezuela at the hands of the Maduro and Hugo Chavez regimes. That is unacceptable. As a New York Representative. to hear the Representative belittle. to try to diminish the worst terrorist attack on United States soil on September 11. 2001. as some people did something. that is unacceptable. as well. And I hold the same standard for this side of the aisle that I do the other. because when another colleague on my side said something about 9/11. I also voted to have her removed from the Committee on Education and Labor. because I thought that was inappropriate. So I am being consistent here. and I hope my colleagues will do the same. to show that this is about consistency and accountability. Because we should not have an individual with those views on the committee that is tasked with representing our country and our Congress to foreign nations."},{"1":"2022","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Madam President. this is all happening on the fly right now. so I am actually going to withdraw that in the spirit of what Senator Lee has said. Hopefully. we can do this later today. We need to make sure that everybody has the benefit of seeing the language. and then we will be back later to do this. I thank the Senator from Utah. and I will spare him the rest of my speech except that I think he deserves to hear this. and I think everybody here deserves to hear this. which is. when the ENR Committee took this legislation up this fall. here is what the survivors from Amache wrote to the committee. and I just want to put their words into the Record before I withdraw: During World War II. we were forced to live as prisoners in our own country. Along with our parents. we were forced from our homes. tagged like animals. and sent to the desolate prairie of southeast Colorado. where we lived in trauma. a constant presence of armed guards. barbed wire. and suffering too large to describe in one correspondence. Our families suffered a loss of jobs. homes. property. and businesses. and many of us lost family members. Many of our parents went to their graves without even an apology from their country. Our nation still has a long way to go to learn from this mistake. and our community. both old and young. continues to suffer from anti-Asian hate crimes. increasing to this day. Our national parks and the stories they honor reflect our values as a nation. Adding Amache to the National Park System would allow us to protect a unique story that has largely been forgotten and can only be told through the power of place. With each year that passes. there are fewer of us. We are counting on you to see us through. Because of the discussion we have had tonight. we are going to have the chance later to be able to do that. I thank my friend from Utah. I yield the floor."},{"1":"2021","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 2225. the NSF for the Future Act. which I am proud to be an original cosponsor of. along with Chairwoman Johnson. Ranking Member Lucas. and Chairwoman Stevens. As ranking member of the Research and Technology Subcommittee. I am proud of the process this bill went through to get here today. with well over a years work. including meetings. roundtables. legislative hearings. and two committee markups. The final bill includes over 13 Republican amendments and standalone pieces of legislation and 11 recommendations from the House GOPs China Task Force. It is projected that China surpassed the United States in 2019. in total research and development spending. I would like to thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for their leadership throughout this process. which set the tone for developing thoughtful legislation. H.R. 2225 takes important steps in expanding the mission of the National Science Foundation to ensure we maintain our edge against rising global competition. while protecting the foundations primary mission of supporting fundamental research. It makes key investments in the STEM workforce to expand the American talent pipeline. It supports world-class research facilities. like Embry-Riddle. Bethune-Cookman. and Stetson Universities. all of which are in my district. It promotes the research needed to develop revolutionary technologies that are crucial to our national and economic security. While making these investments. we also secure taxpayer-funded research and technologies from adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party. The National Science Foundation Inspector General is seeing a 1.000 percent increase in FBI referrals for research theft inquiries. H.R. 2225 gives the NSF security office the resources. the authority. and the tools for the foundation. for the sponsoring institutions. and for the applicants to identify and address malign foreign influence and to address research theft. The bill also instructs the NSF to develop mandatory security training to ensure that individual researchers. frankly. have no more excuses and that they understand the threat and the Federal policies and guidelines. Lastly. Representative Randy Feenstra and I successfully added an amendment during the full committee markup that bans grant applicants from participating in malign foreign talent programs. like the Chinese Communist Partys Thousand Talents program. It is critical that we strike a balance between keeping our research enterprise open. but also protecting it from adversaries who seek to take advantage of our open system. There is more work to be done. but I think these provisions take some big steps in striking that balance. Mr. Speaker. I encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill."},{"1":"2020","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"Madam Speaker. this bill that we are debating here is a partisan travesty and spends entirely more than this government can afford. That is why I rise again today to offer an amendment to cut spending to the Interior and Environment portion of the bill. In addition to its overspending. this bill attempts to delegitimize President Trumps replacement for the Obama administrations overreaching WOTUS rule. The farmers and landowners in my district will tell you how devastating that would be. It continues down the path that the far left have been touting this entire Congress. implementing socialist Green New Deal policies disguised as emergency funding. but this couldnt be further from the truth. This bill not only spends more of Americans taxpayer dollars. but forces others to spend more. forcing onerous regulations on American business owners that would ultimately lead to higher costs for our American families. Continuing to adhere to the Obama administrations outdated and repressive regulations would be detrimental not only to the energy sector workers. but to millions of American families whose budgets depend on affordable and reliable fuel and natural gas. and would jeopardize Americas energy independence. Todays minibus totals $219.6 billion in discretionary spending. plus another $37.5 billion in emergency spending. busting the budget agreement and increasing funds in the form of BCA cap-exempt funding. with almost a third of the funding of this division not subject to the BCA caps. And let me remind you that under the Democratic majority. we cant even stick to the budget that was agreed to. The Interior and Environment division would provide funding at a whopping 41.4 percent above the fiscal year 2020 enacted level and 59 percent over the Presidents request. While the Presidents budget proposed to reduce or eliminate programs in the EPA that are better left to States. communities. and private individuals. the Houses proposal for Interior and Environment maintains or increases spending on EPA programs. I am a former business owner. and just like any good business owner or family knows. you must operate within a budget and make tough choices to live within your means. As Members of the peoples House. we must hold ourselves to the same standard that American workers and families do. My simple amendment is a good place to start. { My amendment would reduce interior and environmental spending by 5 percent for fiscal year 2021. I am going to do some quick math for you. My amendment would cut about $2.7 billion. Even with my 5 percent cut. this division would still dramatically increase spending for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020. To be honest. I wish we could cut more. but this is a place that I believe we can start. Even with my amendment. we still will be spending a lot of taxpayer dollars. so I believe my Democratic colleagues could easily support this. Our national debt crisis can no longer be ignored. and my colleagues must take a serious look at Washington spending in order to start taking back control. Madam Speaker. earlier today I mentioned my 13 beautiful grandchildren. and I am excited that we have another one on the way. I believe it is all of our duties to do everything possible to avoid placing a $26 trillion. and growing. national debt burden on the backs of the next generation. My amendment is just a small. first step toward bringing fiscal responsibility back to Washington. I urge all of my colleagues in this body to support my amendment today. Madam Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time."},{"1":"2019","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Madam Speaker. we were sent to Congress to lead. but this partial government shutdown is not leadership. It speaks to a bigger problem in Washington: the reluctance to reach across the aisle and serve in the best interests of our constituents. Playing political games should not take precedence over securing our border and keeping Americans safe. but it seems to me that is exactly what is happening right now. I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come to the table so we can find a solution to this partial government shutdown and make sure Federal workers get paid for the work they are doing and the work they have done. This inability to come together on commonsense border security funding has gone on too long and affected too many Americans. We must put partisanship aside. secure our border. and reopen this government."},{"1":"2018","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. the Senate finally completed its work on a new longterm FAA Reauthorization bill. This 5-year bill will give the aviation industry the certainty it needs in order to plan for future investments and service enhancements. This bill also gives the FAA the direction and tools necessary to address customer and community concerns that arise from those activities. Stable funding for the Airport Improvement Program. AIP. is an essential program for both large and small airports. In this fiscal year. in my home State of Maryland. 13 airports received 16 separate grants to aid in construction related improvements. These are projects that likely would have been delayed or postponed if it were not for AIP. This bill contains language that I supported to address the negative effects of airplane noise on homeowners. Directing the FAA to review how they work with communities impacted by airplane noise and study the health impacts of noise is a step in the right direction toward tackling the impacts of NextGen implementation. I look forward to working with the FAA to ensure the provisions in this bill are implemented and to strive for additional ways to address the perpetual problem of noise in our communities. Reauthorizing the Essential Air Service Program and Small Community Air Service Development Program is important to make sure that the rural airports in our country. like Hagerstown Regional Airport in Maryland. receive the funding they need to maintain service in remote areas. I am also pleased that the bill contains S. 2792. a bill to modernize training programs at aviation maintenance technician schools and S. 2506. a bill to establish an aviation maintenance workforce development pilot program. The Pittsburgh Institute of Aeronautics has a satellite campus at Hagerstown Regional Airport where they are training the next generation of aviation technicians. As our airplanes modernize. so too must aviation technician curriculum. While the bill contains several provisions that seek to improve customer service including the language that I offered to the TICKETS Act that prevents the forcible removal of passengers after boarding. setting passenger seat size minimums. and improving accessibility for travelers with disabilities. I am disappointed that the bill does not include the Fair Fees Act. The Fair Fees Act would have protected consumers by prohibiting an air carrier from imposing fees for basic services like checking a bag or rescheduling a flight that are unreasonable or disproportional to the cost incurred by the air carrier. In addition. I am concerned about the potential impact of sections 1602 and 1919 on privacy. press freedoms. and other civil liberties. I strongly urge the administration to implement these provisions in a manner consistent with the First and Fourth Amendments of the Constitution and other applicable provisions of Federal law. Providing for the security of the American people is one of our greatest responsibilities. however. we must equally ensure that we safeguard the individual liberties enshrined in our Constitution."},{"1":"2017","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to share the amazing story of Rick Corman. the hardworking. hard-charging founder of R.J. Corman Railroad Group in Nicholasville. Kentucky. in my district. Ricks life story is an example of the American Dream. and his tireless spirit. grit. determination. and generosity benefited not only the employees of R.J. Corman. but an entire community. Unfortunately. because of Americas broken Tax Code. the abilities of entrepreneurs like Rick are compromised. and the estate tax. in particular. threatens the future ability of the R.J. Corman Railroad Group to continue to drive economic growth. employment. and charitable giving in Kentucky. This story is timely. As Congress takes on the task of reforming our broken Tax Code over the next few weeks. critics will undoubtedly protest that this plan is a tax cut for the rich. and they will cite our changes to the estate tax as an example. But as the story of Rick Corman reveals. the estate tax is not a tax on the wealthy as much as it is an unfair penalty on hard work. jobs. charity. upward mobility. and the American Dream. In 1973. after growing up in a low-income. five-room house with no interior bathroom. Rick Corman started his company immediately following high school graduation with nothing more than a dump truck. a backhoe. and a tenacious spirit. Driven by his remarkable operator skills. and then by his commitment to safe and reliable service. Rick was able to become a trusted provider in the railroad industry. But his success would not have been possible without the assistance early in his career from Luther Deaton. a community banker for what is now called Central Bank in Kentucky. As Rick grew his company. he faced debts and cash flow problems. He struggled to get a loan. As Luther said: He had a good company. he just faced a cash crunch. But Rick invited Luther to the site of a coal train derailment inside a tunnel in the middle of the night to show his work. and Rick. recalling the episode. laughed because he had gotten his banker filthy and covered in coal dust. But after that experience and seeing how hard Rick worked. Luther knew that this man would not fail. So Rick was then able to secure character-based loans that allowed his company to thrive because his community banker was willing to take a risk on him based on what he knew about his business and Ricks drive to succeed. Today. this type of loan would never be allowed under the overly restricted Dodd-Frank law. but those loans proved to be essential for the growth of Ricks company and ultimately highly profitable for the bank. Without access to capital. todays entrepreneurs are prohibited from doing what Rick Corman did. Over 40 years he grew his company into what is today known as R.J. Corman Railroad Group. continuously investing profits back into his business. into its workers. and into the surrounding community. Today. R.J. Corman has field offices in 23 States. The company serves all seven class I railroads. many regional and short line railroads. as well as various rail-served industries. Rick grew the company into what it is today by treating all of his workers well. working alongside them. and never asking them to do a job that Rick himself was unable or incapable of doing himself. The companys diversity and investment in people gave it the ability to service all aspects of the freight railroad industry at any scale. The company has been critical to restoring service when class I railroads are devastated by flooding or storms like Hurricanes Katrina. Harvey. or Irma. But now the future success of this company is threatened by the estate tax. also known as the death tax. In 2013. Rick Corman passed away after a heroic 12-year battle with cancer. It resulted in the transfer of his lifes work to a living trust. More than anything. Rick had an intense appreciation for the hard work and loyalty of his employees who had been and continue to be an integral part of the companys success. and he wanted to ensure that he protected their jobs into the future. Since Ricks passing. the trust has continued to reinvest cash into the company. as he intended. and the company continues to operate and help those who have benefited from it. The company has invested nearly $110 million in capital assets. and employment has grown by 53 percent. nearly 450 jobs. The company has donated more than $2.5 million to charitable causes since Ricks passing. But due to the estate tax. the company has yet to feel the full impact of the tax. But starting in 2019. nearly 30 percent of its annual cash flow will be pulled from the company as a result. This will significantly impact R.J. Cormans ability to create jobs. purchase equipment. and donate to charity. The leadership of the company now tells me that the government will actually lose revenue because the company will not be able to grow and create jobs that would produce more revenue than the estate tax will produce. This is an example of why it is so important we end this unfair tax. The death tax destroys intergenerational small businesses and family farms throughout the Nation owned by people who started with literally nothing and worked their entire life to build a successful company and jobs. So as we look at the estate tax and tax reform in the coming weeks. I hope my colleagues will remember the story of Rick Corman. These families and these businesses should not have to fear triple taxation from Washington just because someone passes away. Our bill immediately delivers relief from this tax. and I hope that we will pass a repeal of the estate tax to honor entrepreneurs. job creators. and philanthropists like Rick Corman."},{"1":"2016","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. pursuant to House Resolution 897.

I know he knew Senator Lautenberg very well and worked with him on the committee and off the committee on a variety of issues. He was very committed to his grandchildren. As Senator Inhofe knows. many times we would see him in committee. and when he would talk specifically about the bills before us. he would say: Is this going to help my children and their children? One of the things he talked about on this bill was that this would save more lives and help his grandchildrens generation more than any bill he ever worked on. So he was very proud of this bill. and we were very sorry to lose him. But the thing I want to say about Chairman Inhofe is that as a dedicated and determined legislator. he saw the opportunity. Senator Vitter and I had worked on this. We came to Senator Inhofe at the beginning of the Congress and said: We have a good bipartisan piece of legislation we have worked on for a while. But you took the bull by the horns. You ended up helping us improve it. I think when we started in the committee--when you marked it up earlier in the year in the Environment and Public Works Committee. we had maybe one or two Democrats supporting it. We expanded that. and it passed out with a 15- to-5 vote. so a very significant vote in terms of holding people together. I really give you a lot of credit for the way you ran the committee. how gracious you were when Senator Lautenbergs widow. Bonnie Lautenberg. came down and spoke. and I wasnt on the committee any longer. but how you treated me and had me speak before the committee on the work we had done. It has been a real pleasure. All those staff members you mentioned--from Dimitri. to Jonathan Black. to Drew Wallace. and all the other staff members of the large number of Senators on the committee--Senator Carper. Senator Whitehouse. Senator Merkley. Senator Markey. Senator Booker--many Senators on that committee focused in with you and with Senator Vitter to make sure we got this done. I am very proud of what we have done today. I think it will be looked back on as a major environmental accomplishment in terms of bipartisanship and pulling people together. The thing we did that I am very proud of is we had all stakeholders at the table and we listened to them and we proceeded through. It is a real tribute to Senator Inhofes ability as a legislator. We dont have to be convinced on this bill. Just earlier in the year. he produced a transportation bill--which was a major accomplishment--for 5 years. So now once again Chairman Inhofe shows how he is able to pull people together and get this done. So I once again just want to thank you. I know there are additional comments we will make later on. I know the Lautenberg family has followed this closely. Bonnie Lautenberg has followed this. They are going to be very proud. As you know. we are naming the legislation after Frank Lautenberg. It is going to be called the Frank Lautenberg Chemical Safety Act of 2015. So all of us who served with Frank Lautenberg are going to be very happy and proud that this significant major piece of legislation will carry his name."},{"1":"2014","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Madam Chair. this language in this amendment will hold the Sacramento River settlement contracts in place until issues associated with the litigation or renewal of the contracts are settled. Maintaining these contracts is critically important to the effective operation of the Central Valley Project and efficient delivery of water north and south of the delta. The settlement contracts are foundational to the CVP and provide vital stability that benefits the Bureau of Reclamation. agricultural and municipal and industrial water users. the environment. the California State water project and its beneficiaries. The language does not prejudice the disposition of the ongoing litigation. it simply ensures stability until such issues are resolved. The settlement contracts. originally entered into by the Bureau in 1964 and renewed in 2005. allowed the United States to properly distribute the Sacramento River water rights and provide operational stability for the CVP. Without these contracts in place and full compliance with their terms. the underlying right to divert water from the Sacramento River will be called into question. potentially creating instability statewide. The settlement contractors would continue to divert water under their historic rights. but will begin to do so earlier in the year and during critical months. In addition. they would not be required to compensate the United States for any of the water they divert. This would cost the Treasury approximately $12 million in lost revenue. Moreover. the settlement contractors would no longer be obligated to schedule their water diversions with the U.S. This would result. at a minimum. in an inability to operate the CVP in an efficient manner. causing uncertainty and instability throughout the Central Valley Project and the State water project. which serve a combined 23 million people. Finally. the contract supplies available for diversion under the existing SRS contracts were assumed in all base and future studies used in the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service 2008 biological opinion pertaining to the delta smelt. The Ninth Circuit recently confirmed the validity of that biological opinion. as urged by the U.S. and NRDC. Accordingly. continuing these contracts under their existing terms pending the final outcome of the NRDC v. Jewell litigation would have no adverse effect on delta smelt.

April 26. is World IP Day. when countries around the world celebrate the role of intellectual property in encouraging innovation and creativity. It is an opportunity for us to acknowledge the authors. artists. and musicians who enrich our lives. the inventors whose work is transforming our digital economy. and creators around the world. Whether you are an inventor. a creative artist. or a small business owner protecting your brand. you deserve the benefit of your work. By protecting those works. we incentivize future developments that benefit us all. As lawmakers. our goal must be to provide strong and effective protections for creators. while ensuring that their creations can be appreciated. used. and enjoyed. This policy is central to the American economy. where 35 percent of our GDP is generated by IPrelated industries. A vibrant intellectual property system fosters growth not only in our country. but also around the world. Earlier this month. I introduced legislation that would strengthen an innovation program created by the Patent and Trademark Office. the Patents for Humanity Program. The Patents for Humanity Program rewards a select number of exceptional innovators who apply their intellectual property to address global humanitarian needs. At the first Patents for Humanity Awards ceremony 2 weeks ago. I was proud to honor inventors who had worked to improve the diagnosis of devastating diseases. supply access to clean water. and combat the spread of dangerous counterfeit drugs. Our patent system protects that lifechanging work and. in the case of the Patents for Humanity Program. helps promote its use for the global good. As we find ways to incentivize and promote widespread innovation. we must uphold the vital protections that allow innovators to grow and thrive. We must work to deter and prevent the theft of intellectual property. which hurts creators. costs jobs. and impedes economic growth. In our interconnected age. no country. or even group of countries. can address that problem alone. More than ever. we need to work together to recognize the value of intellectual property so that inventors and creators around the world may receive the benefit of their work and continue to create it. We must also come together to streamline processes that will help innovators to fuel growth in the future. Eighteen months ago. Congress took an important step with passage of the LeahySmith America Invents Act. which modernized our patent system for the 21st century and helped harmonize our laws with systems around the world. Last December. I was pleased to expand on those improvements with passage of the Patent Law Treaties Implementation Act. which will help American inventors by simplifying and expediting the process for obtaining patent protections overseas. There is more Congress can do to improve the patent system and address the problem of patent trolling. by increasing transparency and accountability. I intend to work in a bipartisan and bicameral manner on legislation that will ensure the real party in interest of a patent is disclosed. protect unknowing and innocent purchasers of allegedly infringing products from unwarranted suits. and continue to improve patent quality. and we will explore other means to make trolling activity unprofitable. Our intellectual property system supports the creative and inventive talents of our citizens and provides the vital fuel of our economy.

A lot is at stake. We will make a choice in 2009. and that choice will determine the health care system we have in our Nation for a long time to come. Fifteen years have passed since we last attempted to pass health care reform. What we do now will be consequential for decades to come. It will be a long time before the people of this country and their leaders will return to this complex and contentious issue. So let us carefully review the potential plans. We have a plan being developed by the House of Representatives. we have a plan from the Senate HELP Committee. and a plan from the Finance Committee. we have the bipar55. Pt. 15 August 6. 2009 tisan WydenBennett plan. and then we have a plan I am going to spend a lot of time talking about. and that is the PHS plan. In listening to my colleagues speak on the floor of the Senate. on television. talk radio. in newspapers. and in private meetings. one thing is clear: They think the plan we end up with will be the PHS plan. They think a combination of those who want no health care reform and those who like none of the proposed plans will combine to kill all other plans. So what is the PHS plan? Our present health care system. Lets look at what will happen to average Americans if we keep our present health care system. First. Americans health care insurance costs will explodeand that is not an overstatementexplode. The average family in America can look forward to premium costs for their health insurance of more than $24.000 a year by 2016. That is an 83percent increase over the cost in 2008. In my home State of Delaware. the costs will be even higher. with the average premium for family coverage approaching $29.000. At that amount. more than half of Delaware families would each have to spend half of their income on health insurance. This means families will be forced to either go without insurance or to buy less coverage and put their life savings at risk. Second. personal bankruptcies for medical costs will soar. Today. bankruptcies involving medical bills account for more than 60 percent of U.S. personal bankruptcies. a rate 1 2 times that of just 6 years ago. Going forward under PHS. we can expect more families in bankruptcy. Third. insured Americans will keep paying a hidden tax to help pay for care for the uninsured. Under the PHS plan. doctors and hospitals will charge Insurers even greater amounts to recoup the costs to provide services to the uninsured. Today. this hidden tax is estimated to be $1.100 per family per year. Under the PHS plan. it will most assuredly go up. raising the cost of health care for all Americans. Fourth. Americans will continue to be denied coverage if they have preexisting conditions. Several weeks ago. I talked about four Delawareans who. because of preexisting conditions. could not find insurance coverage. Others who could get coverage have to pay exorbitant premiums to cover conditions such as high cholesterol. hypertension. diabetes. and cancer. Unfortunately. those who get sick may have their coverage dropped altogether. These problems. which threaten the security of all families. will continue under the PHS plan. Fifth. for too many workers. health insurance portability will still be beyond reach. Too many Americans lose their insurance when they lose their jobs. Some cant afford their COBRA coverage. and others cant get another policy due to preexisting conditions. Even when they can find a new policy. they often discover they can no longer see the same doctor or use the same hospital. As a result. too many Americans are stuck in their jobs. forgoing career advancement. just to keep their existing health plans. Now lets look at what will happen to the American economy if we keep our present health care system. First. our present health care system is bankrupting the Federal Government. The biggest driving force behind our Federal deficit is the skyrocketing cost of Medicare and Medicaid. In 2008. government spending on Medicare and Medicaid took up more than one dollar out of every five in our Federal budget. The more we spend on health care. the less we have for other investmentsfor education. for our veterans. and for jobcreating technologies. to name a few. To pay those higher Federal health care bills. we will have to pay more taxes or borrow more from China and other nations. Controlling health care costs is the key to controlling our financial future. But under the PHS. health care costs continue to spiral out of control. Second. health care spending will crowd out our national savings and lower our standard of living. Health care cost as a percent of gross domestic product will grow from 18 percent today to 28 percent in the year 2030and even 34 percent in 2040. Those dollars out of every familys budget going to health care cannot go for housing. food. or transportation. American consumers. over twothirds of our economy. will have fewer dollars left for any other priorities. That means less spending at the mall. at our car dealers. and at the grocery store. Controlling health care costs will put money back in families budgets and therefore back into the rest of our economy. Third. the present health care system is killing U.S. economic competitiveness. Today. U.S. manufacturing firms pay almost $5.000 per worker per year in health costs. Thats more than twice the average cost for firms located in our major trading partners such as Europe and Japan. where a firm pays less than $2.000 per worker each year. In a global economy. our workers and corporations face competitors who can beat them on price every time. just because of our broken health care system. Controlling health care costs will help to level that playing field. In a fair fight. our workers and our businesses can win. Finally. more firms will stop offering health insurance for their employees. The PHS will continue the slow erosion of employersponsored insurance. This is especially true for small businesses. In the 2008 Employer Health Benefits Survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation. only 63 percent of companies of all sizes offered health insurance to their employees. down from 69 percent in 2000. But these numbers are even lower when looking just at small businesses. with the National Small Business Association reporting that that only 38 percent of small businesses provided coverage last year. compared to 61 percent in 1993. Under the PHS plan. this decline in coverage will continue. with an estimated 10 percent of small businesses eliminating coverage in the next year and nearly 20 percent in the next 3 to 5 years. Under the PHS plan. that would mean an additional 13 million added to the rolls of the uninsured in the next 5 years. So that is what America will get if we decide to choose the PHS plan. Again. that is the present health care system. If we choose the PHS plan. consumers will pay higher and higher premiums. including the hidden tax to help pay for all of our fellow Americans without insurance. We will continue to see a rise in personal bankruptcies due to high medical costs. Americans will continue to face insurance coverage rejections based on preexisting conditions or have insurers drop their policies once they do get sick. And they wont have portable insurance that they can take from job to job. If we choose the PHS plan. health care spending will continue to threaten the bottom line of our Federal budget. eating away higher percentages of our GDP. Our businesses will face more competitive disadvantages to their foreign competitors. paying more for health care insurance for their employees. or dropping it altogether. The present health care system mistreats Americans as individuals and serves the country badly as a whole. We cannot continue in the present health care system.I hope my colleagues will return in September committed to replacing our present health care system. I hope they will spend August searching for the best of the alternative plans that they want to support. I hope we will turn our backs on the bankrupt present health care system and instead give the American people a health care system they can all be proud ofa health care system that will sustain them into the future. We can do no less. They deserve no less. I yield the floor. 55. Pt. 15 20823"},{"1":"2008","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker.

The members of this body were able to reach important conclusions regarding the need for increased corporate average fuel economy standards. improved energy efficiency for buildings and appliances. a national standard to help accelerate the development of renewable fuels. and carbon sequestration technology to capture carbon emitted through the burning of coal. The Energy bill approved by the Senate truly represents a shift toward a comprehensive. responsible. and focused national energy policy. Not to be forgotten in establishing this policy are Americas small business owners. There are nearly 26 million small businesses in this countrynearly 26 million business owners that are focused on keeping their doors open and putting food on the table for their families. And while climate change and national energy security sometimes seem like distant threats compared to rising health care costs and staying competitive in an increasingly global economy. small business owners are telling us that energy costs are indeed a concern. The National Small Business Association recently conducted a poll of its members. asking how energy prices affected their business decisions. Seventyfive percent said that energy prices had at least a moderate effect on their businesseswith roughly the same number saying that reducing energy costs would increase their profitability. Despite these numbers. only 33 percent have invested in energy efficiency measures. In March of this year. I convened a hearing in the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship to look at what small businesses can do to confront global warming. We learned over the course of that hearing just how much can be done to help small businesses become energy efficient. We also learned just how little the current administration is doing. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that small businesses consume roughly 30 percent of the commercial energy consumed in this countrythat is roughly 2 trillion kBtu of energy per year. and its costing small business concerns approximately $29 million a year. Through efforts to Increase energy efficiency. small businesses can contribute to Americas energy security. help to combat global warming. and add to their bottom line all at the same time. Last night. I worked with Senator SNOWE to include two amendments to H.R. 6 that will go a long way toward helping small business owners become more energy efficient. These amendments. which together represent the provisions included in S. 1657. the Small Business Energy Efficiency Act of 2007. require the Small Business Administration. SBA. to implement an energy efficiency program that was mandated in the 2005 Energy Policy Act. To date. the SBA has dragged its feet in implementing a program that could help small business owners to become more energy efficient. Administrator Preston should implement this important program today. and this bill directs him to do so. Second. this legislation establishes a program to increase energy efficiency through energy audits at Small Business Development Centers. SBDCs. The Pennsylvania SBDC currently operates a similar program. and has successfully assisted hundreds of businesses to become more energy efficient. As a result of the program. six of the eight winners of the 2006 ENERGY STAR Small Business Awards given by the EPA went to Pennsylvania businesses. This program should be replicated so that small businesses across the country have the same opportunity to cut energy costs through the efficiency measures. Third. the SBA Administrator is authorized to guarantee onbill financing agreements between businesses and utility companies. to cover a utility companys risk in entering into such an agreement. The federal government should encourage utility companies to pursue these agreements with businesses. where an electric utility will cover the upfront costs of implementing energy efficiency measures. and a business will repay these costs through the savings realized in their energy bill. Fourth. the legislation creates a telecommuting pilot program through the SBA. The Administrator is authorized to establish a program that produces educational materials and performs outreach to small businesses on the benefits of telecommuting. Finally. the legislation encourages increased innovation by providing a priority status within the SBIR and STTR programs that ensures high priority be given to small business concerns participating in energy effitdlency or renewable energy system research and development projects. As a nation. we have much to do to secure our future energy supply and to solve the international crisis that is global warming. Last nights approval of H.R. 6 demonstrates this bodys will to set the right course. and Americas small business owners should know that Congress is providing them with the tools they need to join the crusade. Mr. President. last night. we successfully passed comprehensive energy legislation which included a significant increase in fuel economy standards. For far too long. this has been the third rail of energy policy. It has been one of Washingtons great failures in leadership. But thanks to a bipartisan effort on the part of so many of my colleagues. these new requirements will cut automobile carbon emissions dramatically and will help put our couintry on a path toward energy dependence. The oil savings from the CAFE provision alone will ultimately total 1.2 million barrels per day by 2020. When we first established CAFE standards for passenger cars and trucks in 1975. within 10 years we increased fuel economy by 70 percent and decreased our oil dependence from 36 percent to 27 percent. Ever since then. we have been stuck in neutral. The fuel economy of the average new passenger vehicle is lower today than it was 10 years ago. We now have overcome the forces of inertia. and our country is now poised to at last revolutionize the way we drive. 1 am proud of the bipartisan commitment to this issue. which was demonstrated with historic vote. I particularly would like to thank my colleagues. Senator INOUYE and Senator STEVENS. for their leadership on this issue. I was proud to cast my vote In support of this important bipartisan energy legislation. which will dramatically increase our use of renewable fuels. incentivize energy efficiency. reduce our oil dependence. and address the growing threat of climate change.

To distract Americans from this fact. Republicans have put forth the prooil company bills like the current Refinery Permit Process Schedule Act which they claim will lower fuel costs for consumers by allowing oil companies to drill more freely. Instead. the bill simply offers yet another needless handout to large oil companies in the form of weakened local regulation where any local public health and environmental concern could be ignored. Mr. Speaker. instead of taking initiative and moving forward with real solutions to the growing fuel crisis in our country. Republicans offer more of the same.

I know we have a lot of things on our minds with some distractions. of course. but I will talk just a moment about some of the things I believe we ought to have as priorities. We need to establish our priorities so that we can work on the things we collectively believe have the most impact and should really be acted upon. Obviously. there are all kinds of ideas among us. and as we talk to people who come to see us and our people at home. why. there are a million things. but there are some that seem to be in need of consideration more quickly. One of them is energy. We have talked about having an energy policy now for several years. The evidence now is even stronger that we need an energy policy which gives us some kind of insight as to where we need to be in 10 or 15 years so that as we approach the problems. we can discover the things it takes to attain those goals. Our energy policy has always been a broad policy. as it should be. It has been a policy that talks about conservation. efficiency. alternative sources. renewables. as well as domestic production. Certainly. one of the things that is most important. that the administration and the President has pushed. is to do some work to make sure coal fits into the environment satisfactorily. Coal is our largest fossil fuel. and we ought to be using coal for electric generation rather than some things other than coal. such as gas. Almost all of the generation plants over the last 20 years have been gas. largely because it is more economical to build a smaller plant closer to the market with gas than coal. So not only do we need to do something about the carbon and the exhaust from coal. but we also have to do something about transmission so that we can economically create electricity at the mine mouth and get it through our transmission system to the market. We passed a highway bill a number of years ago. and we have never been able to get it completely passed. so we have just passed on the old one. It is certainly more than past time to get a highway bill. There is probably nothing that has more impact on our economy. creates more jobs. and allows for other things to happen in the economy than highways. We certainly need to do that. Additionally. one of the things that becomes clear. and even more clear as we spend time on Social Security. which we should. is personal savings accounts that people can have for themselves. As I have gone about talking about Social Security. I have always tried to remind folks that Social Security was never intended to be a retirement program. It is a supplement. It is a supplement to the retirement programs that we put together. There are a number of ways. of course. where there are incentives for savings. whether they be retirement programs or 401(k)s in which the employers participate. Now we have a potential for savings that can be spent earlier than retirement. that could be used for almost anything. One of the real issues is to have medical savings accounts so that we can buy cheaper insurance policies with a higher deductible and. therefore. have some money to pay for that. There is nothing. perhaps. more important than to get ourselves into a position of people preparing for their own retirement. This Social Security discussion has shown basically what young people could do by putting aside a relatively small amount of money every month and having it earn interest for them. One of the things I recognize is a little bit regional is the Endangered Species Act. It has been in place for a very long time. In my judgment. it has not been as effective as it could be. I am not for doing away with the Endangered Species Act. but we have roughly 1.300 species listed as endangered and have only recovered about a dozen. So the emphasis has been in the wrong place. We are going to have an opportunity to be able to do that. and it has great impact in many cases. It is kind of used as a land management tool so that we lose the multipleuse aspect of public and even private lands because of endangered species. There are a lot of things I think we ought to be doing. Finally. it seems to me that we ought to have a system that takes a look at programs after they have been in place 10 years. or whateverafter they have been there for a while. We should restudy those programs. reanalyze those programs to see if. indeed. the need for them is still what it was when they started. to see if they could be made more efficient after 10 years or. indeed. if they dont need to be there anymore. I know it is very difficult. There gets to be a support group that forms around all the programs that are funded. of course. It becomes difficult to change. But it is too bad. when we think about it. to pass programs that are spending Federal money and have them out there when there is no longer any need for them or when the time has come where something different needs to be done. I am hopeful we can get something done. I am thinking about putting something in bill form that will provide a review or oversight of programs that are in place to see if they are still important. to see if they are still being done efficiently. and to see if they could be done a better way or. indeed. need to be done at all. These are some of the things I think are very important. I hope we try to set some priorities. I understand out of 100 people there are going to be many different ideas. but that is part of our challenge. to put 100 people together and decide what are the five most important issues that impact this country and impact our States. I hope we can do that and I look forward to that opportunity."},{"1":"2004","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. today I take the opportunity to honor the Muhlenberg Career Development Center.

I want to address the House tonight on an issue of importance. I think. to the Nation in terms of what we are facing in the area of domestic policy decision. which I think is an extremely important one for the country. Not surprisingly. I am going to be talking about immigration and immigration reform and a number of related issues this evening. Mr. Speaker. recently in the Colorado newspapers there have been a series of stories and editorials about an incident that occurred some time ago that was brought to the attention of the public as a result of a story published in the Denver Post maybe a month ago. perhaps a little more than that. The story was one that identified a particular individual in Colorado. actually a particular family in Colorado who were illegal immigrants to the United States. According to the news reports. even the Denver Post went to the Mexican consul in Denver or the Mexican consul went to the Post. I am not sure which way it happened. but somehow or other they got together and decided to write a story about a family. the Apodaca family. They decided to highlight a particular individual. a young man that is the oldest son of the family. I believe. who is graduating from a school in Aurora. Colorado. in my district. who has evidently been a model student with very good grades who is now faced with a dilemma. The dilemma is what to do about going to college. how is he going to pay for it. Mr. Speaker. across the country there are several attempts being made to change State laws with regard to illegal immigrants access to higher education. I believe several States have actually changed their laws that will allow instate tuition for kids who are themselves illegal or parents of illegal immigrants. This is a major push on the part of the Mexican Government through the Mexican consuls throughout the United States. and it is a major push by immigration advocates all over the country and groups like La Raza and others who want a variety of things. including free K12 education which they already have. free or taxpayersubsidized public education. which they do not now have. and drivers licenses and welfare and a number of other things that would add up to citizenship. That is really the point of all of this. The attempt is being made to erase anything that would be a distinguishment of someone being here illegally. Because after all. if you can come to the United States illegally. put your kids into school. which you can today under Supreme Court rules. have them educated at taxpayer expense. if you can eventually get taxpayers to subsidize their higher education. if you can get taxpayers to subsidize welfare. to pay for welfare for illegal immigrants into the country. if you can get State legislatures to change their laws to provide drivers licenses to people who are here illegally. then what happens. after a while there is nothing that separates you from anyone who is here legally. If you are present. if you are physically present in the country that we call the United States. you will have all of the benefits of being a citizen. and it does not matter how you got here. This is the desire. This is the hope. this is the plan. To some extent it has been successful. as I say. in several State legislatures. I think California is one. perhaps Utah is another. But the same thing is going on in Colorado. So there was this plan. if you will. to begin a lobbying process to change our laws in Colorado to allow people who are here. who are in the country and in Colorado in this particular case illegally. to have access to higher education. So the Mexican consul provided the names of a family. the Apodaca family. to the Denver Post. This was a particularly sympathetic case because apparently these folks came here 7 or 8 years ago. by their own admission illegally. but have so far lived the lives of model citizens. They send their kids to school. They are employed. or at least the husband is employed. and so they now are in this precarious position. They are trying to figure out what to do about the problem they face. How do you send your kids to higher ed. to the University of Colorado? So about a month ago. as I say. the Denver Post highlighted these people. They in fact put them on the front page of the Denver Post. this family. put in a picture and ran this very. very long story about the family and said. gee. these people. yes. they are here illegally. but they are not concerned about that. They are. as I say. giving their names and locales to the paper and we should in fact now be. of course. cognizant of and sympathetic to their plight. I read this story as did hundreds of thousands of other people in Colorado and thought. is it not interesting that we are now at the point where people who are here illegally can be so brazen as to make that known publicly without the slightest fear of any sort of negative ramifications? Is it not amazing. I thought. that the Mexican consul would be so audacious as to become involved in domestic politics in the United States? And. more importantly. is it not an affront to every single person who has come to this country legally? Is it not a slap in the face to every single person in this country who has gone through the brain damage and the expense of coming here through the legal process? Mr. Speaker. I have been able to go up to Commerce City. Colorado. where we have had and where they still have ceremonies to recognize people who are now taking their oath of citizenship to the country. They are becoming new citizens. I have gone there and I have spoken to these groups and I have said. first of all. I want to welcome you to the United States. Secondly. I want to thank you for doing it the right way. for going through the process. for spending the time. the money. for being inconvenienced as I know you are. for trying to learn the language as you are supposed to do. I want to thank you for all of that. because you are acting as good citizens. And every time that we do things like provide amnesty for people who come here illegally. it is a slap in the face to all those who have done it the right way. Mr. Speaker. I have in my office as I know you do and every Member of this Congress. we have lists of people who have applied for some sort of change in their immigration status and they have asked us to help. And we have. Well over 100 I saw at last count in our office alone. I know that in certain other districts. certain other congressional districts. the numbers are higher. but in mine. a relatively suburban district. 100. that is quite a few for us. We have actually two people assigned to helping those folks come into the United States or if they are here. to get their status adjusted under the law. That is a resource allocation that I think is unique. I do not believe I have two people among my staff who have a single responsibility or at least have some partial responsibility for a single issue. But that is the load we have. and that is the dedication I have to trying to help. I thought to myself when I read this story on the front page of the Denver Post that it is amazing that we are so blatant. so fearless about the fact that you do not have to go through that process. that. in fact. you are suckers if you do. that you are being naive if you try to abide by the laws. that you will become celebrities. You will be on the front page of the Denver Post. You will be characterized as heroes because you have lived a good life and you have done what is expected of you in America. you have had a job and you send your kids to school. and therefore because you are an A student. we should ignore the fact that you are here illegally and tell everyone in America who is here because they came the right way that they have been suckers. It also tells everybody in the world who is waiting for the opportunity to come to the United States legally that they should probably simply ignore the bureaucracy. which can be daunting in terms of the obstacles it sets up. and they should simply go to the head of the line. They should simply pass by everybody waiting and enter the gate. That is what amnesty does and that is what we tell people when we showcase them for being here illegally. Mr. Speaker. I do not know the Apodacas. From everything I have read. they seem to be very fine people who have. as I say. tried to come to the United States for the same reasons that my grandparents. perhaps yours. came here. looking for a better life. I do not blame them for wanting it. But I must admit to you that when the decision was made by the Denver Post and the family and the Mexican consul to showcase these people. they put those folks in jeopardy. Because somebody is going to say. Is this right that you can violate the laws of the Nation with such impunity? Is it right that all those who have attempted to do it the right way should be so insulted? I certainly did not think so when I read the story. So I waited about 3 weeks or more and finally I called the INS office in Denver and I said. can I please speak to the head of the agency? It was a gentleman by the name of Mr. Comfort. Again. a very nice fellow whom I have met with in the past. I asked him in the beginning of our conversation. I have a hypothetical situation to present to you and that is this: today. Mr. Comfort. you as the head of the regional office for the INS. if you walked out of the office and were heading over to lunch at a restaurant across the street and somebody came up to you on the street and said. I want to tell you something if you dont mind. I am a person who is a good citizen. I have a job. I have never been in trouble with the law. I send my kids to school. Im trying to get them an education. but I have this one problem. I am here illegally. What would you do under those circumstances? He said. Well. of course I would have to take them into custody. Those were his exact words. I would have to take them into custody at that point. and I would have to then put them through the judicial process. They would have a hearing. It would be determined by an immigration law judge as to whether or not they should be deported. I said. That is interesting to me. because I am wondering what you did about the family that told you that. told not you that. but told the entire State of Colorado that 3 or 4 weeks ago. They said they were here illegally. They were looking for someone to help support their sons higher education goals and expenses. He said. Yeah. we saw that. we looked into it. but were not going to do anything about it. I said. How come? I just asked you what you would do if this happened to you on the street. He said. Its a resource thing. I dont have the resources to actually go after these people. I said. Im not asking you to send in a SWAT team. Im not asking you to devote any resources to this issue that would jeopardize the major tasks you have in terms of felons who are here illegally and potential terrorists and all that sort of thing. I dont want you to do that. Im just asking you what you do when somebody tells you this. as these people did and as the Denver Post and as the Mexican consul did. He said. I really dont know what to say. We dont have the resources. He kept saying. We dont have the resources. I said. again. What does it take? Would you send a letter? Would you at least send a letter to the folks and ask them to please come in and talk to you about the fact that they have stated publicly that they are here illegally? He said. yes. that they would do that. Shortly thereafter. I received a call from the Denver Post wanting a followup interview to the original story about these folks. I told the Denver Post. it was amazingly coincidental. but I had just talked to the INS and I told them this story. The next day the Denver Post wrote a story. it appeared again on the front page and it was entitled something like Tancredo Demands the Deportation of this A Student. Forget about the fact that that was an interesting spin that they put on it because I never even mentioned the student in my conversations with the INS. I was talking about the family who had made this statement to the Post. But. regardless. that was the story. It has been amazing in terms of the reaction to it. I have had literally thousands of email and telephone calls and letters about this into my office. Overwhelmingly. I should say that the letters and emails are supportive. But the Denver Post is very upset about the fact that I did this. I have tried to explain to them that really what I did was what hundreds of other citizens I know have tried to do and that is to talk to the INS. get them to look into the situation. the situation that individuals may feel exists out there in terms of illegals being here and that the INS routinely ignores those inquiries and/or reports from John Q. Citizen. In this case because I was able to get the head of the INS on the phone and speak to him directly. they were perhaps less able to ignore my request to them to look into the issue. I did not demand. I should say. anyones deportation. not Jesus Apodaca who was the young man that was identified in this story as being the A student who is looking for a college education. or anyone else. I simply said. Would you look into this. would you simply send a letter and ask these people to come in and talk to you? But the press has portrayed this in a way. as you might imagine. to make it appear as though I have taken it upon myself to become the head of the INS and bully. I think is the word they use most often. and meanspirited. another one that they throw in there. Then yesterday we got a call from the same reporter who had done this story. and he said. we have found out because of good reporting that Congressman TANcREDO has hired people to work in his home. in his home. in this case to finish a basement. and they were illegal. they were here illegally. and they wanted to know whether we had a response. My response was. I in fact did hire a company. a very reputable company to finish my basement and to put in a home theater for a Christmas present to my family. It was truly an expensive one. but it is one that we were able to pay for by refinancing my home. which is what we did. I went to a company in Denver. I purchased the equipment. and I asked if they also installed. They said yes. I said I also need the basement to be finished for this. They said they could do that. A part of their company was also a construction company. I] 1945 I hired them for this purpose. They were expensive. it is true. but we checked out their references and they were good. And we felt because they had promised me to get it done by Christmas last year. that we would go ahead and pay the extra money that we thought we were paying compared to other estimates to get this job done. So we hired them. Now. Mr. Speaker. frankly. as you know. we are not home often. especially if you live as far away from Washington as I do. We are home sometimes on the weekend and during break. But we put a lockbox on our door and we gave the key to the lockbox to the construction company. And they were absolutely efficient and they did a great job. and I can say nothing but good things about the experience. They finished exactly when they said they were going to finish. The job is a great job. I have nothing to complain about whatsoever. Now. I have no idea who they hired. where they came from or anything else. But. anyway. the Denver Post tomorrow is going to run a story. we are told. they called us tonight to tell us they are going to run a story tomorrow that states what I have just told you. that we have had people working in our home who were in fact illegal immigrants. Somehow. of course. I know they are going to try and tie this to me. that I either knew. or. I do not know exactly what the point of it is. but I know they are very upset about the fact that we have called them on this issue of highlighting the Apodaca family. So. as a ..result of good reporting. they have uncovered some more illegal aliens who are in Colorado. and they are going to publish a story tomorrow about that. Now. I have to tell you. Mr. Speaker. that I have been called a bully. I have been called meanspirited. because I called the INS and asked them to look into the Apodaca story. which had been printed in the paper serial several weeks before. But. Mr. Speaker. I have to also tell you that I do not seek out people who are here illegally. I do not ask people who may be serving me at a restaurant. who may be doing my lawn work or putting on the roof of my house. or. in this case. the laborers of a company that I hired to put in a home theater system and finish my basement. I do not ask them to show me proof of the fact that the people. I do not say. you know. the waiter that you sent me last night could not speak English very well. or the cab driver that I got when I came over here could not speak English very well. so I would like to see whether or not they are here illegally. I do not do that. I think that would be sort of meanspirited. frankly. I do not do that. I only got into this issue. became even acquainted with the Apodaca family. because the Post and Mexican Consul and the family themselves choose to make themselves known to me and to the rest of the people in Colorado. the entire citizenry. So. I do not know. Mr. Speaker. frankly. I have not the foggiest idea of whether or not the people who were employed by the company that I hired were illegal. I know they were good workers and did a great job. That is all I know. But if the Denver Post continues to press this. if they identify people and companies. then. of course. I would tell the INS the same thing: -Look. the Denver Post is once again pointing out people who are here illegally. Are you going to do something about it? But I want to try to just make people understand the nature of this debate. I know that I suffer the slings and arrows. I know that I am going to be vilified in the paper. Tomorrow I am sure that the article that the Denver Post writes about me will not be complimentary. But. you know. I guess I am really thinking aloud here with you tonight. and that is. who is really the bully? Who is really meanspirited here? I hope that we will enforce our immigration laws in this country. I hope that we will stiffen those laws. I hope that we will in fact even put military troops on the border to help enforce immigration laws. But I will tell you. Mr. Speaker. quite honestly. that if this Nation decides that it does not wish to enforce immigration laws. that if we do not wish to have a border that requires somebody to get permission to cross. that is okay with me. It is not okay. I would be a no vote on that bill. but let us assume for a moment that this House and the Senate. the other body. I should say. and the President agree that we should abandon this whole concept of border security and immigration policy. If it is the will of the majority. I would live by it. The idea that we can have a law in place that says you cannot enter the country illegally. but. on the other hand. if you do. and if you are a nice guy and if you have got a kid who is an A student. I do not know. if he is a B student. I am not sure we would cut him this slack. or C or D or F. or maybe if he does not go to school at all. maybe then we should try to deport him. So maybe we should make an immigration policy that depends upon someones grade point average. or whether or not they have simply been in the country a while and kept a job and stayed out of trouble. You know. whatever we do. whatever this Congress and the Senate decide to do. the other body decides to do. and the President agrees to. that is the law of the land and I certainly would abide by it. But if we. unfortunately for the Apodacas. have a law that says if you come into the country illegally you are subject to deportation. even if your child is an A student. even if you have lived in the country as model citizens. you do not have the right to citizenship. as long as that is the law of the land. then let me ask you. is it being a bully to ask the INS to enforce the law? Now. again. Mr. Speaker. I want to say we know there are between 9 million and 13 million people who are here illegally. That is true. I have not the foggiest idea how many people I may have hired in the past as taxi drivers. as waiters. waitresses. home improvement people. I have not the foggiest idea how many of those people may have been here illegally. and it is not my job to ask them. In fact. Mr. Speaker. it is against the law to do so. You could be sued under the Civil Rights Act if you go out and ask people that have been hired by somebody else if they are here illegally or not. I do not do that. I do not inquire. If you go to the Denver Post or any other newspaper and you say. I am here illegally and here is the benefits that I want. then. of course. I think it is a different situation. and the Denver Post and the Mexican Consul and this family have to take some responsibility for making the choice to become prominently displayed on the front page of a major newspaper. Now. I know that this is a very controversial and very emotional issue. I know that. and I do not relish the idea of being here and discussing it. Frankly. there are other things that are also important to me. other issues. the tax policy of the country. the war. the potential war with Iraq. there are a whole bunch of things that weigh on my conscience very heavily and weigh on my mind. as I know they do on yours. Mr. Speaker. and every other Member of this body. But I must admit to you that what is happening here by attempts in this case by the Mexican Consul and sympathetic news media. the attempts to characterize illegal immigration as benign. that is wrong and it is dangerous. The Apodaca family. certainly from all accounts I have read. anyway. are no danger to the United States. They pose no danger. They seem like good people. people I would be happy to have as neighbors and friends. But it is irrelevant to the issue as to whether or not they have broken the law to come into the country. What is the most discouraging or disconcerting aspect of this whole thing is that when trying to characterize and personify the illegal immigration issue by using the Apodacas. what you do is ignore another face of illegal immigration that is much. much uglier. much nastier. That is the face of illegal immigration that you confront on the borders of this country. both the Canadian border and the Mexican border. It is the face of murder. it is the face of infiltration into the country of people who are coming to do us great harm. it is the face of drug smuggling. It is the face of rape and robbery. because coyotes who often bring these people. in this case from Mexico. into the United States. they charge them sometimes $1.000 or $1.500 to bring them into the United States illegally. and when they get to the borders they rape the women. they steal the money. they force the people into the United States into some of the most inhospitable parts of the country in terms of the desert. and they die out there. This is an ugly thing. It is the face of murder. where a little over a month and a half ago a young man by the name of Kris Eggle. who was a Park Service employee. he was a Park Ranger in the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in Arizona. and Chris. who was 28 years old. along with a colleague in the Border Patrol. stopped two Mexicans who had come across the border after having murdered four people in Mexico in some sort of drug deal type of thing that went awry. or they were hit men for some cartel. I do not know all of the details. But they came into the United States. They were stopped by this young man. 28 years old. and when he got out of the car. he was killed. They opened up on him with automatic weapons and killed him. I went to his funeral in Ajo. Arizona. where I saw his mother and his father. I saw all of his colleagues from the Border Patrol. from the Park Service. from the Customs agency. all of them coming to pay their respects. But I saw no one else from the government. I saw no members of the media to talk about that face of illegal immigration into the country. I have not heard a thing about the fact that a short time ago. maybe less than a week ago. two FBI agents on the border near El Paso. I believe. were abducted. dragged across the line and beaten almost to death. They are both in the hospital in Texas in critical condition. I have seen nothing about that face of illegal immigration. I have seen nothing about the fact that hundreds and hundreds of thousands of pounds of illegal narcotics are confiscated on our borders with both Canada and Mexico every year. and I have seen nothing about the fact that agents are routinely placed in harms way. Border Patrol agents. U.S. Forest Service personnel. are placed in harms way and injured and in fact killed in defense of the Nations immigration policy. socalled immigration policy. Fl 2000 I have seen nothing about that in the Denver Post. I have seen nothing about the fact that I received the following message from someone who will remain anonymous. but here is what he says: Sir: Until about 5 months ago I was a U.S. Border Patrol agent. I was recently informed by a friend who is still with the U.S. Border Patrol of another Ramireztype incident that Border Patrol agents had been ordered not to talk about and that the Border Patrol is desperately trying to keep away from the media. A Catholic nun was recently raped and murdered in Oregon by a Mexican illegal alien who was apprehended earlier by U.S. Border Patrol agents in Deming. New Mexico. The IDENT/ENFORCE system worked and the system alerted the agent that the alien was a violent criminal. The subject was released back into Mexico where he promptly made his way back into the United States. traveled to Oregon and raped two nuns. one of which was also murdered. The Border Patrol has put the word out to its agents that this information is not to be divulged to anyone outside the U.S. Border Patrol. The patrol agent in charge of the Deming. New Mexico station has been relieved and temporarily assigned to the sector headquarters in El Paso. Texas. The killing of the nun made the news. but the fact that the killer is an illegal alien recently captured and released by the U.S. Border Patrol did not. Hopefully. you can change that. Keep up the good work. Well. thank you. sir. for your courage in telling me and telling. therefore. the country about this. Because I can assure my colleagues. Mr. Speaker. that this will not be on the front page of the Denver Post tomorrow. The fact that I hired a company that purportedly hired illegal aliens to work on my basement. according to what we were told tonight by the Post. but this will not. although the story has certainly made news earlier. they said it was news in Oregon. it will not be there. because this is not the face of illegal immigration that the press wants to present to the American public. However. this is the face of illegal immigration on our borders. Mr. Speaker. I have come to this floor many times. I have no doubt that my concerns about illegal immigration. about the immigration issue have made me a number of very powerful enemies. I have no doubt that they will from this point on hound me. dog me. find out who delivers the milk to my house. who cuts our lawn. I mean. I have no idea to what extent they will go to try and vilify me for bringing the message. I guess. of course. it is an intimidating thing. but I also know that. because I have to ask myself and my own conscience. is this the right thing to do. I have to search my own conscience. Mr. Speaker. about why I do it. Is it out of some sort of animosity or animus that I have? I truly do not believe that is the case. I know that I would be doing essentially the same thing. as millions of others who are seeking a better life in the United States. I would be looking for a way into the country. I do not necessarily blame the people who come here illegally. I blame our own government for encouraging it on the one hand by refusing to actually secure our borders. and periodically giving amnesty so as to tell people all over the world that the message is. by the way. to come into the United States. and for not cracking down on people who hire illegal aliens. If they knowingly hire somebody who is here illegally. then. of course. there is a price to pay. And I only suggest that if we want to have an immigration policy that establishes what the borders of the United States are and that one must ask permission to come across them. as we must do going to either Canada or Mexico. that the law. and that those borders. ought to be actually upheld. It is amazing to me and incredibly ironic in a way that the Mexican consul has been so actively involved with trying to change our immigration status. It is amazing to me that the Mexican consul and advocates for immigration policies. for liberal immigration policies continually ignore the laws that are in place in our neighboring countries. Canada and Mexico. I have yet to see in the Mexican press or the Canadian press negative stories about the fact that in these countries if you enter illegally. you can be prosecuted for that. I have yet to see a story in the press about the fact that neither Canada nor Mexico. nor any other country of which I am aware. will allow you to go to school at their expense. at the taxpayers expense of that country. go on to higher education at the taxpayers expense of that country. if you are not a citizen of that country. I have never seen an article written attacking any country for their meanspirited immigration policy. I have never seen the Mexican consul speak out in the United States. and certainly I would be amazed if they did. of course. against the repressive actions taken by the Mexican Government against Guatemalans who periodically come into the country of Mexico illegally. Often. the Mexican Government will send troops to that southern border. to their southern border and they will also. by the way. round up. and I mean that in the ugliest sense of the words. round up illegal Guatemalans. illegal aliens into Mexico from Guatemala. they will round them up. send them back. they will incarcerate them. Mr. Speaker. I have actually been in detention facilities in Mexico for people who have entered their country illegally. They are not nice places. I assure my colleagues that the detention facilities that we have in the United States are more like Hilton hotels than in comparison to the detention facility for illegal entrance into Mexico. But there has not been a word of concern about that. has there? Have I missed it? Has any paper in the United States attacked the Mexican Government for their attitude about illegal immigrants into Mexico? Has any media outlet in this country suggested that Mexico should begin educating all children who go to Mexico. regardless of where they are from. at the expense of the Mexican taxpayer? We do that. We do that because the Supreme Court has ruled that if you are here. even if you are illegal. we need to give you a K12 education. Now. so far they have not ruled that we have to give you a higher education at taxpayers expense. but that is what they are seeking. That is what the people that support a liberalized immigration policy. that is what they are seeking. I have never heard anybody else. any other country chastised because they do not do what they are demanding of us. So is it meanspirited. truly. for me to suggest that if we have an immigration policy. we should uphold it. if we do not wish to do so. we should abandon it? I assure my colleagues. Mr. Speaker. and I have said this on the floor many times. that I wish there was someone with the courage to introduce a bill into this House that says we will abandon our borders. there is no need for them. we want the free flow of goods. services. and people. And if it passes. over my no vote. if it passes and if it passes the other body. and if it is signed by the President. that is the law of the land. and I walk away from the issue. But if. on the other hand. we pretend that we have borders and that for some reason that is important. which I think it is. then should we not do everything possible to uphold the law about those borders. especially. especially. Mr. Speaker. in times like these. in times that present the United States with the potential for catastrophic terrorist activity. catastrophic events that could be perpetrated by people who have come across our borders illegally? Should we not try to defend those borders? Should we not try? When we go to the American public. either the administration or the Congress goes to the American public and says. we are trying to do everything we can. we are doing everything we can to protect you. can we be truthful in that. Mr. Speaker? Do we believe that we are doing everything we can to protect America? If that is the case. then why is it still possible for. say. one mile on either side of any port of entry in the country. you can walk across and no one is going to stop you? Is that really doing everything that we can to protect the United States of America? Should we not be as interested in defending our own borders as we are in defending the borders of Korea or Kosovo? Should we not be as concerned about our own safety in this country as we are about perhaps deposing Saddam Hussein and. therefore. removing a threat to the United States. which I happen to agree with? I mean. I agree that he is a threat and that we should depose him. But is it not just as important for us to defend our own country at the closest point of vulnerability. and that point is the northern. the southern. eastern and western borders of the United States? I cannot for the life of me understand why we do not pursue that as aggressively as we do a war with Iraq. If we go to war with Iraq. does anyone not believe that the danger to the United States increases exponentially. that the danger will not come on the battlefields of Iraq necessarily. although that is certainly a dangerous place. but it will also come as a result of increased infiltration into the United States of fundamentalist Islamic cells designed and with the purpose. I should say. of doing us great harm? Would that not be only logical to assume as a possibility? And should any country not do the rational thing and try to actually defend those borders. even if it means preventing the flow of illegal immigrants into the country who are not coming to harm us? But. Mr. Speaker. we cannot set up a sieve that distinguishes that. We cannot really expect people on the border to go. I see you coming across here. you look to me to be someone who is just coming across for a job and a better education for your kids. so I am going to let you come by. But you. you look like someone who might be coming across to do us great harm. No. of course. we cannot do that. I mean. even if we tried. the ACLU would go crazy and call it racial profiling or something. So we cannot do that. We either defend our borders or we do not. E 2015 Either walk away from this and stop putting our Border Patrol. or Forest Service people. our Park Service employees. our Customs agents. stop putting them in jeopardy of their lives for a principle one is not willing to uphold. One or the other. Mr. President and Mr. Speaker. one or the other. Uphold the law or abandon the law. repeal the law. Those are our choices. But this halfbaked approach is the worst possible way to deal with it. And I will suffer the slings and arrows of an angry media and of angry constituents and of angry members of the Hispanic and immigrant communities in the United States. although I must say. Mr. Speaker. that we get many. many supportive emails and calls and letters from Hispanic Americans who consider themselves to be Americans only. Americans. No hyphenated part in there. and they are worried about this countrys survival. and they are worried about the effects of massive immigration. legal and illegal. and they support this position. It has got nothing to do with ethnicity. I said this a thousand times if I said it once. It has got nothing to do with the countries of origin. We are talking about whether or not we are in fact a sovereign State or whether we are not. and if we choose not to be. if we choose to go the route of the European Union and begin the process of eliminating borders. creating common currency and all that. that is okay as long as it is done as a result of a legal process. It is called this body. We vote on it. We make a decision on behalf of our constituents. That is the way it should be done. It should not be done in a de facto way. just having it happen and then 10 years from now we say. Gee. how did this occur? Remember when there used to be an actual border between Canada and the United States and Mexico and the United States? Remember when we used to ask people flying in for visas and things like that? I wonder why we do not do that any more. What has happened to the whole American experiment? So I guess I will continue to raise my voice in defense of the American experiment. in defense of the people who have come here over the last 250odd years. who have come here seeking a better life. who have come here legally. I speak in defense of them. I speak in defense of all those folks who do not have the money to plead their case. I suppose. with the INS. but they are in line. they are following the rules. they are hoping that we will let them in and they will have a shot at the good life. God bless them. I say. God bless them. They are doing it the right way. And every time we slap them in the face. all I can say is I am sorry. It is rude. it is meanspirited and it is ugly. Again. I tell them thank you for doing it the right way. for coming to the United States legally. welcome to the United States to everyone in this Nation who has come here the right way. I hope. Mr. Speaker. that this issue eventually resolves itself so that our Nation is defended and that the idea of sovereignty is upheld and the hopes and dreams of millions of people seeking to come here will be fulfilled. seeking to come here legally."},{"1":"2001","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 1749. which would designate the United States Postal Service located at 685 Tumberry Road in Newport News. Virginia as the Herbert H. Bateman Post Office Building. I would also like to thank my colleague. Representative Jo ANN DAVIS. Herbs successor in Americas First District. for her leadership in introducing this legislation. My friend and former colleague Herb Bateman was a true gentleman and a great patriot. I will never forget his kind and valuable tutelage when I first came to Congress. nor will I forget how he demonstrated to all of us the importance of caring more about doing good than getting credit. On a political and ideological level. there was much to learn from Herb: His fiscal conservation and commitment to restraining big government and protecting taxpayers interest. His unwavering support of a strong military and of the men and women who dedicate their lives to protecting our nation. His dedication to cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay. and so much more. Herb Bateman took great pride in serving the people of Americas First District for 18 years. In doing so. he was an asset not only to the people of the Northern Neck and the Eastern Shore of Virginia. but to the nation as a whole. It is fitting. therefore. that we take steps to honor and memorialize Herb. so that his service to America will never be forgotten."},{"1":"2000","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. the Bible says in Ecclesiastes. To everything there is a season. a time for every purpose under heaven. And. now. as the 106th Congress is coming to a close. the hour has come to pay tribute to five distinguished colleaguesSenators with whom I have had the honor and pleasure of working. These gentlemen of the Senate have decided that it is now time to embark on a new chapter in their lives. Each in his own way has left behind a part of their vision for America and has influenced the course of our country. The Senate Finance Committee is seeing a great exodus as four of the five Senators retiring served this Committee. I will certainly miss their participation on this committee and the leadership on key issues. DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN and I were elected to the Senate from our respective states in the same year1976. So we two freshman learned the ways of this august body at the same time. And. I have to say to my colleagues who have more recently been elected to this body. that was no minor education. We began our Senate service with giants like James 0. Eastland. Barry Goldwater. Hubert Humphrey. and Howard Baker. The difference was that PAT MOYNIHAN had already had a distinguished career in public service having served as urban affairs advisor to President Nixon and as Ambassador to India and the United Nations. I have always had great admiration for his strong character. great intellect and exceptional diplomacyparticularly on those occasions when it was between warring political parties. not countries. Senator MOYNIHAN is famous for spotting emerging issues long before anyone else. He has been warning for years that Social Security needs reform. He has urged reform of the alternative minimum tax. and worked tirelessly in the effort to reform a broken welfare system. On the candor scale. Senator ROBERT KERREY would rank near the top. That is a commodity sadly lacking in many circlesand not just in government. but in business and academia as well. BOB KERREY has been as courageous about sharing his opinions as he was when serving in the Vietnam war. during which he was awarded a Purple Heart. Bronze Star. and our nations highest honor. the Congressional of Medal of Honor. He left the governorship of Nebraska with a 70 percent approval rating. which tells us something about his record of employing common sense and exercising integrity in governance. Nebraskans are no nonsense. hardworking people. They would not have tolerated any less. BOB KERREY has put those same virtues to work in the Senate. particularly in our bipartisan efforts to reform Social Security and Medicare as well as the IRS. I am going to miss my colleague from the West. Senator RICHARD BRYAN. Though we have not agreed on every issuewho does?-we have a common appreciation for the impact of federal policy on the western states. I was also most appreciative and grateful for his honest. straightforward. and thorough leadership of the Senate Ethics Committeeno doubt one of the more thankless jobs in the Senate. But. every senator. regardless of political party. could be assured that. if wrongs had been committed. they would certainly be found out. If allegations were false. the verdict would be made clear to all. Senator FRANK LAUTENBERG. like me. is living proof that the American dream can come true. His hard work. determination. and ingenuity brought him from humble beginnings to build with two partners the Automatic Data Processing (ADP) Company. which became the worlds largest computing services company. I was pleased to work with Senator LAUTENBERG on legislation to prohibit smoking on public transportation. He has been a tireless worker in the war to prevent teenage smoking. To my Democratic colleagues. Senators LAUTENBERG. MOYNIHAN. BRYAN and KERREY: We have battled through many issues. each of us committed to doing what we believed was best for America and for our respective states. There has never been a dull moment. It has been a privilege to work with you. Last but not least. I have to bid farewell to my fellow Republican and Finance Committee member. Senator CONNIE MACK. His friendship. leadership. and dedication to furthering the causes of fiscal responsibility. governmental accountability. and medical research will be greatly missed. Senator MACK has successfully fought for Floridas concerns and kept his campaign promise of less taxing. less spending. less government and more freedom. which resulted in 70 percent of the vote in 1994. more than any other Republican Senatorial candidate in the Nation. The Roman politician Cicero states. It is the character of a brave and resolute man not to be ruffled by adversity and not to desert his post. I believe Senator MACK has been this exemplary leader. and. instead of faltering like most men. Senator MACK had the ability to rise above not one. but three. personal battles with cancerhis wifes. his daughters and his own. Senator MACK lost his mother. father and younger brother to cancer. This history makes the Macks the poster family for early detection. a role they have indefatigably played. Drawing from this experience. Senator MACK has fought to double the funding for National Institute of Health (NIH) in order to step up the search for a cure for cancer as well as other diseases that plague our families and society today. This is a goal I will continue to support not as a legacy for CONNIE MACK. but inspired by him and his family. It has been a pleasure and an honor to serve with these men. and I want to take this opportunity to bid farewell and best wishes to our colleagues as they begin what I hope will be a very rewarding retirement."},{"1":"1999","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this important resolution. I would like to begin by recognizing the hard work of my colleagues. Chairman DAN MILLER and Congresswoman CAROLYN MALONEY. They have worked tirelessly on this issue. and I applaud their efforts on this extremely important issue. H. Con. Res. 193 expresses the support of Congress for activities to increase public participation in the decennial census. As we all know. in order to achieve a successful decennial census. the joint efforts of Federal. State. and local government and other interested parties and grassroots organizations must come together as partners. The Bureau of the Census has implemented a partnership program through which a comprehensive outreach. education. and motivation campaign is being carried out to encourage all segments of the population to participate in the upcoming census. As I have said many times. Texas has a lot at stake in the current debate over the year 2000 Census. The County of El Paso has a lot to lose if the 2000 Census is conducted the way the 1990 Census was conducted. In 1900. the census used a traditional head count and made about 26 million mistakes. It missed over 8 million people completely. doublecounted over 4 million and put 13 million in the wrong places. And most of the undercount involved children. people of color and the urban and rural poor. The Census Bureau estimates that in Texas. the net undercount of residents in 1990 was over 486.000 individuals. The net undercount rate in Texas was .028. which represented the second most undercounted state in the nation. They were either out of town. tossed the form with the junk mail. did not trust the government. feared immigration or bill collection officials. lived in a neighborhood the census workers did not feel like checking. Whatever the reason. too many individuals were missed. Included in this are over 279.000 Caucasians. 83.300 blacks. 247.000 individuals of Hispanic origin. 8.500 Asian and Pacific Islanders and. over 1.875 American Indians. In addition. over 228.300 children were missed in Texas. Over 25.000 individuals were missed in El Paso alone. enough to fill half of the Sun Bowl. We were the 17th most undercounted district in the nation. The failure of the 1990 Census to accurately count the population in El Paso County seriously shortchanged the Federal funding that cities within my district should have received during the past decade. In effect. cities like El Paso. Anthony and Socorro were required to utilize funds for schools. roads. health facilities. housing. and other important services for people that were not counted by the census. The number of children missed in the 16th Congressional district would fill 22 schools staffed by 770 teachers. According to the Council of Great City Schools. every child not counted by the census means that some $650 in federal resources is lost each year by the school that must educate that child. This equals over $8 million lost in my Congressional district alone! We are not alone. The 1990 Census did the same thing nationwide. Two million of those missed in 1990 were children under the age of 18half the net undercount although they were only about a quarter of the U.S. population in 1990. The 1990 Census affected minorities the most: 4.4 percent of blacks were missed. 5 percent of Hispanics. 12.2 percent of at least one tribe of Native Americans. This differential racial undercount must be addressed by the 2000 Census. This resolution is sending the right message at the right timethat public participation is necessary to ensure that everyone is counted. especially children. people of color and the urban and rural poor. Anything less is unacceptable."},{"1":"1998","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I honestly believe this is the worst day for this institution In this century. and history will see it as such. The tool of impeachment was inserted in the Constitution to protect the country from irreparable harm. not to punish the President. Under our system. the proper institution to punish the President if he violated the law is the court system. a legal institution. not the Congress. a political institution. The House Republican leadership has said that this is a vote of conscience. It is denying the right to cast that vote of conscience to those of us who believe that the proper course is to censure. not impeach. That decision dooms this House to go down in history as tragically lacking in both perspective and fairness. To those who say censure has no bite. my response is this: I come from the State of Joe McCarthy. Tell him censure has no bite. It destroyed him. Whether the President has committed perjury or not is a legal. technical question that can be decided by a jury and a judge and our court system at the proper time. There is no question that the President has misled the country and the Congress. That is unacceptable. But. in my view. It does. not rise to the level of an impeachable offense. because the lies essentially grew out of sex. not public acts. If the House ignores that distinction. it fails in its obligation to put the Presidents acts in perspective. Mr. Speaker. the gentleman from Illinois said earlier in this debate that there cannot be one law for the ruler and one law for the ruled. I agree. But I would say. respectfully. that this House should not have one standard of judgment for truth telling for the leader of the Executive Branch. and another for the leader of this institution. who was found not to have told the truth to this House. In that case there was no removal from office. there was not even censure. There was simply a reprimand and then reelection by the Republican House majority to the Speakership. Mr. Speaker. for the House Republican leadership to. in effect. predetermine the outcome of this vote by refusing to allow a conscience vote on censure in this instance is a massive failure of fairness. If the House leadership can only win this vote by denying any alternative. it will have failed the country as much as Bill Clinton has. Mr. Speaker. because of time limits imposed on debate today I would like to extend my remarks at this point updating the thought on the issue that I expressed earlier in the year. to place my conclusion in full context. Mr. Speaker. three months ago. as I tried to wade through my copy of the Starr Report. and as I came again and again to gratuitously graphic and voyeuristic descriptions of sexual encounters contained in that report. I reached the point where I could read no more. I had voted to release that report earlier that day. but I really began to wonder whether I would have done so if I had known it was so graphic. I say that because while reading the report I was continually asking myself what we had done to our own children. to the Presidents privacy and dignity (and that of Monica Lewinsky) and even to the dignity of the nation itself by the placement of that report on the Internet. Puffing down the report. I turned on the tv. set to see. as an unreconstructed Cub fan. if I could find out if Sammy Sosa had hit another home run or not. The tube came on and within seconds I heard a CNBC reporter describing the Starr report. using language I never expected to hear on the nations national news programs or what passes for them these days. At that moment I reached the same conclusions that millions of Americans have probably reached. I have had itnot just with this story. but with something far more disturbing. What I felt was a conclusion that has been building within me for months. even years. I was overwhelmed with the feeling that this report is a phenomenally gross verification that our society and our country is faced with nothing less than the accelerating failure of institutions that are central to our functioning as a decent society and as a democracy that works the way our Founding Fathers wanted it to work. Please do not misunderstand. This is a great country. In many ways it is a good country. There is much that is good in our society. and we have had much good economic news in recent years. Nonetheless. I believe that the most crucial institutions and institutional arrangements in this country and in this society are failing in their responsibilities. That failure is affecting our economy. our culture. our political system. our longterm environmental security. and even our own spirituality. The evidence of the failure of our most important institutions is all around usin this and in other events. At the moment that our nation is transfixed on the most pornographic document ever produced by government. global challenges face us everywhere. The worlds economy is in turmoil. We have almost no tool but persuasion to move the Japanese government off a course of economic and fiscal impotence and incompetence that threatens the economic health of all of Asia and indirectly threatens our own as well. International financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund are being overwhelmed by changes in the world economy. changes in currency relationships. changes in capital flows that each day weaken the ability of the major institution the world has to stabilize economic relationships between nations. The nation with the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons that could possibly one day be arrayed against us (Russia) is experiencing political and economic chaos. Much of Europe is focused on that chaos. but here in America we give it only intermittent attention and analysis. The most irrational. paranoid and dangerous government in the world (North Korea) is facing military. political. and economic instability that could easily threaten the lives of 50.000 American servicemen and women stationed in South Korea and hundreds of thousands of others. Our ability to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons has been brought to the edge of failure by events on the Indian subcontinent and in Korea. And yet. the discourse in this country about how to deal with that issue is shallow and in some cases downright dangerous. The best change in a generation for peace in the Middle East is slowly but surely sliding away. This decade has produced the hottest known global temperatures in 200 years with huge potential consequences for worldwide agriculture. fisheries. economic dislocation. public health. and environmental stability. Yet commercial disputes about profit levels are threatening our ability to take even marginal action to minimize potential catastrophe. On the home front. the Supreme Court. the institution that we. in the end. rely upon more than any other to preserve the balance of forces that protect our democratic processes and our liberty. has handed down two very different sets of decisions that have crippled the ability of our political system to function as a democracy should. (1) The spectacularly myopic decision in the Paula Jones case that the government would not be distracted if that case went forward now rather than two years from now when the President was out of office and his private activities could be handled as a private civil matter rather than as a national governmental soap opera. (2) The mindbogglingly naive decisions that the constitutional rights of Americans to have a political system that functions for them would be protected by a series of naively libertarian decisions that equate money with speech. establish absurd legalisms about campaign financing that have no relationship to reality. that have turned politics into a money chase and political campaigns into the competition of dollars rather than ideas. And other domestic institutions are also failing in their fundamental responsibilities. Large sections of corporate America are making economic decisions. devoid of any values except the maximization of financial benefit to the management and investment elite of this country--in almost total disregard of the impact of those decisions on loyal workers. their families. and their broader communities which have nurtured them. These decisions. and policy decisions by government. have together produced the greatest disparity between the economic wellbeing of the wealthiest 5 percent of our people and everyone else in the modem history of the country. If we as a people are concerned with moral outcomes. should we not be just as concerned about how the nation deals with poor people and sick people as we are about how we deal with each other on matters of sexual intimacy? The political elite has largely debased what passes for political dialogue on many crucial issues. It has allowed its reliance upon the community of pollsters and consultants to produce lowest common denominator discourse in which winning and holding power drive out any consideration of the need to educate and enlighten the public on almost every front. We should ask ourselves: Are there no lengths to which we will not go to seize or hold power? Is there no amount of pain we will not inflict on each other for political gain? More and more. individuals are entering Congress and other political institutions who see issues not as problems to be confronted. but concerns to be manipulated and toyed with around the margins in order to seize and hold power. So many debates are split along party lines and driven by ideological enforcers (the modem day American counterparts of Michael Suslov. the old guardian of the purity of Soviet Orthodoxy) that when bipartisanship does occur. we are almost startled by its appearance. And the focus and limits of much of that debate are set by political elites in both parties who rub shoulders with the financial and economic elites of the nation far more often than they do with every day working people. The press itself. with all too few lonely and valiant exceptions. has fallen into the same bad habits it legitimately criticizes in the politicians it covers. The press too (especially the electronic media) drawn by the realities of the marketplace. has often become little more than the public affairs entertainment division of profit making corporations who will do almost anything to preserve market share instead of responding to the publics need to understand the substance of issues before the country. The press. driven by market surveys and polls. produces story after story that portray politicians as gladiators and celebrities rather than problem solversresponding to and strengthening some of the most unhealthy public biases on the landscape. For every question I get from a reporter about the substance of an issue. I get five from other reporters about the politics of that same issuereflecting both a laziness and a shallowness that the country cannot afford. And worst of all. some reporters cannot resist using any device to win a point. no matter how much damage they do to the country and innocent individuals in the process. One need look no further than the incident last Sunday in which a report from a Sunday talk show. during his interview with the Presidents lawyer. David Kendall. snidely asked Mr. Kendall what Mr. Kendalls wifes definition of sex was. That reporter owes his own profession. his viewers. and Mrs. Kendall a public apology for his inability to resist his Dennis the Menace impulses which have increasingly made that reporter a caricature of himself. Is there no length to which some segments of the press will go to humiliate other human beings in the name of news values? Even religious institutions have allowed themselves to fail the Nation in too many instances and have allowed politicians to manipulate religious concerns. more to find political advantage than to find spiritual answers. Debates and discussions about the nature of humankind. our origins. our purpose. and our relationship with our creator are essentially conversations about the unknowableat least in this life. And yet the certitude with which some political and religious figures attack those who have legitimate differences of belief are disheartening and appalling and border on the sacrilegious. Too many political and religious leaders alike have allowed religion--or the superficial reference to religion--to be used for nonreligious purposes. They wrap political commercial and ideological preferences in religious ribbons and desecrate both religion and politics in the process. The Ten Commandments represent a guide for living and for the treatment of others. God did not give them to us to provide a roadmap for human beings and politicians to destroy each other. They are not a political program or an economic platform. As Mario Cuomo once said. God is not a celestial party chairman. To the best of my knowledge. God has not yet taken a position on capital gains or other tax plans. but you would never know that by listening to some of the selfpromoting political manipulators who pass themselves off as the Clergy of the Tube. Politicians have no special qualifications to judge the private lives of other people. In the end. only God can do that. The Nuns at St. James taught me a long time ago that we have enough to do worrying about the stewardship of our own souls to pass judgment on the private lives of others. Neither do religious leaders have any special competence to judge the specific mechanisms by which elected officials in a democracy accomplish decent public ends. Those of us in public life owe due consideration to their opinions. but we have. after all. taken an oath to uphold the Constitution in accordance with the dictates of our ownnot someone elsesconscience and that is our own sacred public duty under the Constitution. Wereligious and political leaders alikehave allowed debates about religious truths and values to be used all too often as weapons to inflict pain and gain political advantage rather than as tools to find moral answers that take decent account of the moral values of others as well as ourselves. We have all too often allowed the substitution of moralizing for morality and have allowed the search for God to become a journey that develops hatred and contempt rather than love for our fellow searchers. Example: On abortion. perhaps the most agonizing. troubling. and divisive of all moral debates in the public realm. both sides have allowed their own certitude about the will of God or their dedication to unbending individualism. their desire for tactical advantage. to get in the way of their responsibility to recognize good intentions and honest nuances of conscience. And so that debate has become more and more a political manipulation of the legislative process rather than a search for areas of agreement that would reduce the worlds acceptance of abortion at the same time that it recognizes the dignity of individual conscience. All of these institutional failures are rooted in two shortcomings. One. simply a lack of knowledge or understanding about how the world and institutional relationships are changing. The other is the triumph of a mefirst rampant. materialistic individualism that prevents the leaders of almost all of our social. political. commercial. informational. and religious institutions from really focusing on the answer to one simple question: In addressing whatever decisions confront us. how can I. or we. take into fair account the needs. concerns. and interests of those who are not just like us in social or economic standing. cultural outlook. or political or religious beliefs? We desperately need to address our key institutional shortcomings because institutions are the major tools available to any culture. to any nation. to any society to shape its future. Yet we continue to be transfixed on the StarrClintonLewinsky soap opera. The nation has been moved to this focus because of two people: (1) Mr. Starr: On a number of accounts Mr. Starrs report grossly represents the overreaching zealotry of a personally upright. but ideologically and politically partisan. individual who. before he was appointed special prosecutor. was already contemplating filing a court brief on behalf of Paula Jones and who had indicated that he was planning to join Pepperdine Law School. and institution financed in large part by a person who has contributed millions of dollars to try to bring down the President. Mr. Starr from all reports is a fine. upstanding human being. but a person of his partisan and ideological mind set should never have been appointed to a position that called for. above all. unquestioned fairness balance and judgement. (2) President Clinton: Up to this point. he has been the most personally talented politician of his generation. He appears to be a person of good heart and courage who wants to do good things for the country. But his career has been both promoted and crippled by a tendency to manipulate language in ways that are technically in conformance with the truth. but often are designed to obscure rather than clarifyl For example: As frustrating as I feel the Presidents lack of candor to be in this episode. Im even more unhappy about the lack of candor demonstrated by both the President and congressional leaders in jointly obscuring the real effect of the budget agreement they both sold to the nation last year on our ability to meet our domestic responsibilities in strengthening education. health. environment. housing. and social services. Why does that frustrate me more? Because the lack of candor in the first instance was meant to hide private. personal conduct. but the second was a public event which had direct substantive consequences for American citizens and their families. After finishing reading Mr. Stares submission of opinion and the response of the Presidents lawyers some things are clear to me and some things are not. I cannot really reach a final judgement on this depressing matter until I have had an opportunity to evaluate the thousands of pages of backup material which are still to be released. But my first impressions of what I read are these. First. after four years and the expenditure of over $40 million since Mr. Starr was first appointed to review the facts surrounding the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas in the 1970s. we still have no finding of illegal conduct by the President in Whitewater. no finding of illegal conduct by the President in the investigation of the White House travel office which Mr. Starr subsequently undertook. no finding of illegality by the President on the matter relating to the FBI file case. All we have is a document which is largely focused on what actions the President took to hide sexual conduct that had not even occurred when Mr. Starr was first appointed Independent Prosecutor. Theres no doubt that some conduct cited in the allegations is indeed troubling. Many other allegations clearly overreach. Mr. Starrs allegation that the President acted illegally by misleading his own staff about his sexual activity is a real stretch as is his allegation that the President acted illegally by pursuing legitimate questions of Executive Privilege. Mr. Starrs active advocacy of impeachment. going so far as to draw up potential articles of impeachment. is. as the Washington Post has said. an arrogant act that claims for Mr. Starr a responsibility that is solely the prerogative of Congress. Mr. Starrs job is to lay out the facts in Joe Friday style-as Mr. Starr himself has on occasion pointed out. It is not to reach a conclusion about what actions Congress should take. That is our job. But. Mr. Starrs overreaching does not obscure the fact that the President appears at this moment to have provided information to the public in the Paula Jones suit and possibly to the grand jury that obscured the truth. even if it did not technically violate it. If that proves to be the case. the question we will then have to answer is: What is the proper action for Congress to take? The actions taken by President Clinton. regrettable though they may be. are far different from the actions President Nixon took in Watergate. The actions in Watergate involved burglarizing and wiretapping political opponents. attempting to use the IRS to intimidate political opponents. financial payoffs to defendants in criminal cases. and other uses of the levers of governmental power to subvert the very democratic process that underlies the essence of America. In contract. this case is largely about actions taken by the President to obscure personal conduct. They are not in the same league as Mr. Nixons. That does not necessarily mean that some action by Congress may not be warranted. If it is. based on what we know now. the case of Speaker Gingrich may be instructive. In the case of the Speaker. the House determined that the proper action for the House to take was to reprimand the Speaker for having misled the House in the ethnics investigation of his political activities. Because the essence of the charges against the President seem to be similarthat his actions also appear to have been designed to obscure the trutha congressional reprimand or sanction of some sort. rather than removal from office. may prove to be the most appropriate action. It would be especially so if it allowed Congress to end this matter in a much shorter period of time so that the Congress and the Presidency can refocus our attention and our activities from the past private misdeeds of this President to the future public needs of the nation and the people we are supposed to represent. I do not know how this sad chapter will end. but I do know that this episode and the way it has been handled by the leadership circles of our major institutions demonstrates a desperate need to examine how we can renew those crucial institutions. In two years the millennium will draw to a close. This nations institutions are simply not ready to lead this country into a new one. I would never in three lifetimes call for a new Constitutional convention because this generation of political leadership is highly unlikely to improve on the work of the Founding Fathers. it is much more likely to muck it up. But I do believe we need to have Millennium Conventions convened for the purpose of examining ways to reshape. redirect. and refocus almost all of our institutionseconomic. corporate. political. communication. religious. and even our international institutions such as the IMF. the U.N.. and NATO. In the political area. we need special attention paid to the presidential nominating process to try to find ways to reduce the importance of candidates media skills and increase the role of peer review by people who know them best. if both parties are to produce candidates with the qualities necessary to lead the nation. I do not know how we can change the human heart. but we need to find ways to reshape the major institutions of this society so that there are more incentives to produce a new focus on selflessness. That is the major task that we each face as individuals on lifes journey. and we need more helpand less hindrancefrom the institutions that dominate our lives along the way."},{"1":"1997","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I want to recognize my friend. the gentleman from Montana . for his leadership on this very important issue. He has worked very diligently and hard on the campaign finance reform task force that has produced the bipartisan Campaign Integrity Act of 1997. and I want to congratulate him and thank him for his comments and associate myself with those comments on this key area of reform. I also want to compliment my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have joined together in a bipartisan fashion to formulate this very important step forward in an incremental fashion to accomplishing significant campaign finance reform legislation. I hope that as a result of all of our efforts we can do something good for the American people. As I sit here in Congress now and think about some of the objections that are raised and also some of the urgings to bring this legislation to the floor. I cannot help but think that as we fight this battle together. there are supporters and detractors of campaign finance reform legislation on both sides of the aisle. We have got good friends on the other side that support this. we have opponents on the other side. and the same thing on the Republican side of the aisle. We have to forget pointing fingers at each other and move toward working together to accomplish this. I think that we can do that. There are other people who say. well. let us just have campaign finance reform legislation. but let us do not ban soft money. I do not believe that we can have legitimate campaign finance reform legislation that will be accepted by the American public unless there is a ban on soft money. Now. there are certain objections that are raised. people who say. well. in our system. and I hear this particularly from our side of the aisle. that if we close the loophole in this area. the money will continue to flow in campaigns. And I will acknowledge that whenever we have campaigns and we have politics that center around power we will have money flow to those centers of power. That is the nature of it. But there are two ways we can address campaigns in America. We can take all the limits off. We can take all the rules off and just let the money flow. I personally believe that that is a step in the wrong direction. We should have campaign limits. spending. contribution limits. I think that is appropriate as long as it is within the first amendment. So we have to have some rules. And any time we have a system of rules. from time to time. we will have to adjust those rules. We are in that phase right now. The last time we had significant reform was after Watergate. The freshmen rose up and accomplished reform during that time. I believe the freshmen can do that same thing today and move this bill forward and accomplish this. and it has to start with banning soft money. Yes. there will be other loopholes down the road. but we have to address the most significant problem now. and that is soft money and we can do that. 0l 1830 There are some people who raise an objection to banning soft money by saying. Well. youre going to give an advantage to the other side. I believe that that is incorrect. We look at the statistics and this comes from the Center for Responsive Politics. based on the Federal Election Commission reports. It found in the 1996 election cycle that the Democrats raised $122 million in soft money. the Republicans raised $141 million. Yes. the Republican side is a little bit more. but we were in the majority at that point. So it is roughly equivalent what each party raised in soft money. whether it is labor money or corporate money. So if you ban soft money. you keep the playing field level. As a former State party chairman. I think that is the first criteria of election reform. of campaign finance reform. that you keep a level playing field so everyone can compete fairly and honestly within the system. The Bipartisan Campaign Integrity Act of 1997 does this. It meets those objectives. It restores confidence in the system. It increases disclosure. increases information to the American voter. It empowers them by making their contributions once again more meaningful. That is why this is good legislation. I have urged my Republican leaders to move this legislation forward. I congratulate the gentleman from California . the chairman. who has taken a strong position. He is going to conduct a hearing on this legislation. I hope it will come this fall. I think the time is right right now for this legislation to move forward in the U.S. Congress."},{"1":"1996","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. we are returning to session after several weeks of being able to remain in our districts and intermingle with the people who voted to put us here. and that is a very good phenomenon. It is one that I am certain that every Member has benefited from greatly. I have certainly benefited from it. I think it is very important to have the opportunity to allow the common sense of our constituents to irrigate the deliberative legislative process that takes place back here in Washington. Common sense is a shorthand expression for. I guess. wisdom of the people. It is the wisdom of the people that we absorb when we go back home. and the wisdom of the people is very much needed to counteract the Washington conventional wisdom. which is very much stuck in a rut. The Washington conventional wisdom. and I speak of a bipartisan wisdom. there is a lot of agreement here on some things that represent conventional wisdom that certainly needs to be challenged by ordinary common sense. I think that we recently have experienced a phenomenon with respect to the Republican primaries that has certainly placed common sense on the radar screen. The rise of media star Pat Buchanan. a candidate for the Presidency. has certainly lifted certain basic issues into an area of high visibility. On the radar screen you have a discussion of certain issues that Washington conventional wisdom has refused to recognize. Problems that Just were not accepted as being problems are now being discussed. So the conventional wisdom has been shaken up. and that is good. God and American politics work in very mysterious ways. If some issues which deserve to be projected on to the center of the stage are projected by a conservative. rightwing Republican candidate running for President. then so be it. some good can come out of any set of circumstances. The leadership here in Washington is stuck in a rut and that is very dangerous because when leaders. in their conventional wisdom. refuse to move off dead center because of the fact they are leaders and have great power. it is very dangerous. It is all right if my grandmother gets an ornery notion and refuses to budge. or my neighbor down the street who has certain odd ways wants to go off on his tangent. you know. That is an individual kind of thing that really wont hurt anybody. But when we get stuck in a rut and refuse to recognize certain problems here in Washington. it can do great harm. it can cause great suffering. The same is true. of course. across the world. When you have leadership in command of nations. leadership in command of armed forces. leadership in command of MIG fighter planes. you can have a great deal of harm done when that leadership Is stuck in a rut in terms of their own thinking. Fidel Castro represents that kind of leadership. stuck in a rut and very dangerous. You had a situation that occurred which is something out of a bygone era. You do not expect MIG planes to be sent out to shoot down unarmed planes that are part of a peaceful protest. Yes. it was a protest. Yes. it was civil disobedience. Because they were probably violating the airspace of Cuba. the planes were shot down by Castros MiGs. Yes. they knew what they were doing. It was a civil disobedience act in the air. Any civil rights veteran. any person who has gone through the 1960s. as I have. knows that you take a chance. You take a risk when you set out on a civil disobedience venture. but you do not assume that the very worst is going to happen. Yes. Bull Conner ordered the civil rights marchers in Birmingham to get off the streets. and maybe he was the law and the order there. He was a commissioner and they were disobeying him. So they were disobeying the law and he set dogs upon them and he set fire hoses upon them. But Bull Conner had machine guns. and Bull Conner had rifles. and he could have shot them down. He did not go that far. Yes. Gandhi against the British in India certainly angered a large number of militaryminded British commanders and commissioners and so forth. They did put him In jail and they did all kinds of things to his followers. but they did not bring in the machine guns and shoot them in cold blood. Civil disobedience is a risk. You take a gamble. but you assume that in a civilized society. you will be punished but the punishment will not be death. What Castro and his MiGs have done Is committed coldblooded murder against people who were enraging In civil disobedience. You do not have to agree with the civil disobedience or not. It is not for us to pass judgment in orderon the action and the politics of it. It was murder no matter how you put it. unnecessary coldblooded murder that belongs to another era. You talk about a new world order. you hope that we really have a new world order. The new world order involves some new kind of thinking where nobody would murder In cold blood a group of people who were conducting a civil disobedience action and that has happened. So Castro and his leaders in Cuba. Castro and the pilots of the MIGs are stuck in a time bind. They are very dangerous. They are in another era. That is the storm trooper mentality. Very dangerous. There is no way you can Justify. Yes. you commit civil disobedience. some punishment is going to happe.. But here it was murder. So my point is that It may not be that the stakes are as high. and the immediate murder is not the problem when we commit errors here in Washington. but we are causing a great deal of harm and a great deal of suffering because we just refuse to accept certain obvious premises. We refuse to accept the fact that there is a tremendous income gap in America and it is getting wider and wider. We refuse to accept the fact that wages are stagnated even among those lucky enough to have jobs. Even among middle class people with college degrees. wages are stagnating. We refuse to accept the fact that there is a great deal of anxiety among people who have college degrees and are in middlemanagement Jobs. technical Jobs. because they are finding that the layoffs and the streamlining and the downsizing affects them. too. It is a time of great anxiety for good reason. At the same time. we see the anxiety being created by the insecurity. We see the stagnation at the other end of the pole. at the Wall Street level. We see the executives making salaries that are larger and larger. you know. now 200 times the average workers salary is what the CEOs are making. We see tremendous profits being made overnight by new information industries that are capitalizing on technology that has been created by the entire society. the technology that is used by Netscape and a few of these other information giants who overnight went public on Wall Street and they become billionaires just because it is known among the people who know about information technology and technological communication. telecommunications. they know that these efforts are going to pay off in the near future. They are going to pay off and they are going to pay off big. Tremendous amounts of money being made at the same time others are suffering and this insecurity is being increased. We refuse to recognize that as a fact here. we refuse to address that. We have gone out and negotiated agreements on the world trade stage. GATT was negotiated. Then closer to home. we had NAFTA negotiated. Yes. it may be true. I voted against NAFTA. I voted against GATT. If I had to make the vote again. I would do the same thing again. but it was not because I am against free world trade. It is not because I do not recognize that we have a global economy taking place and that we cannot afford to build walls around ourselves and expect to survive or to be leaders in that global economy. I recognize all that. You cannot stand in the road and stop progress. I recognize that we had to move. But the problem is when we tried to get some kind of reasonable attachments. some reasonable builtin processes that would take care of the fact that there was going to be a great dislocation In the work force. there is continuing. continuing problems that must be addressed in terms of loss of jobs. retraining. loss of security. all kinds of things which could have been addressed In the preparation of the NAFTA and the GATT agreements. We could have had side legislation which dealt with problems that we knew were going to result. We were asking for some kind of humane approach to the debris that would be created by this great revolution. It is a revolution that is underway now. a revolution which is an economic revolution. And in revolutions. somebody is going to suffer. I was at a conference. a seminar in Canada last summer. and there were large numbers. a significant number of people there who were there to discuss trade. world trade. the impact upon the United States economy and workers. and some of them were from the current administration. some of them had participated In the negotiation of the GATT and NAFTA agreements. And repeatedly you kept hearing the phrase there are going to be some losers. You cannot avoid having losers. And I recognize that. It is a fact of life. You are going to have some losers In a great upheaval. an economic revolution. But they would say there are going to be some losers. and they would shrug their shoulders as if so. you have to have some losers. There was no sympathy for the losers. There was no understanding that government has a duty to try to minimize the losses. Government has a duty to care enough about people to want to take a program which provides the necessary resources to get people through this transition with a minimum amount of dislocation and a minimum amount of suffering. We have that conventional wisdom which locks into yes. there are going to be losers and. you know. we can not do much about it. Yes. we have to move forward and there is going to be some suffering. some people have to be thrown overboard. and our answer is no. You can have GATT. you can have NAFTA and you can make it a humane step forward instead of a step backwards where the winners take everything and there are so many losers. I will return to that in a minute. but I think I would like to cite another example of beingof where the leadership in Washington is stuck in a rut. There is a general acceptance here that the era of big government is over. that government automatically is a monster and. therefore. if you downsize government. you have created some kind of new public good. I do not accept that premise. The era of big bureaucracy ought to be over. The era of bureaucracies fumbling and stumbling. and bureaucracies that have lost their purpose. their sense of purpose. should be over. but we should not back away from the era of governmental commitment. A government must be a guardian of the people who are in harms way. The people who need government should have government there. the workers who are caught in the middle of the road as the steamroller of technological change comes down. As the steamroller of the global economy comes down. those workers desire to have government as a guardian. Government. the era of big government ought to be certainly treated across the board in some kind of uniform way. If we really were serious about ending the era of big government and we really downsized on a sincere and reasonable level and a sincere and reasonable way. then you will be talking about downsizing the Pentagon and downsizing the CIA. and if you were downsizing all those humongous. monstrous agencies that have lost their reason for being. then you would generate funds in that process of downsizing those agencies which would be available. The funds would be available then for the Job training. for the education. for the transition. the necessary transition items. necessary transition programs and projects that would allow people to adjust to the new age of information and the age of technology. age of telecommunications. But the wisdom here is that big government is over. the era of big government is over. but it is a phony statement. The era of big government is not over. The Pentagon is as big as It ever was. The majority. Republican majority in the Congress. insisted on adding $6 billion to the Pentagon budget. I understand they are building new buildings and new facilities. The CIA is as big as it ever was. Recently. the CIA discovered that it has a slush fund. a petty cash fund of $2 billion that they did not know they had. So you know. big government is over in the area that helps people. Big Government may be over in AFDC. Aid to Families with Dependent Children. They want to cut down on that. Big Government may be over. they would like to see it end In the area of Medicaid and cut back on the health care that is available for poor people. But on the other hand. the Big Government goes on and on and on in areas that are considered highly profitable by the Members of the Republican majority. If they were just sincere. we could downsize across the board and accumulate funds that could deal with the real problems that Mr. Buchanans campaign has inadvertently kicked to the top of the agenda. There is another Washington. piece of Washington conventional wisdom that is ridiculous and needs to be challenged. and that is that States can do it better. Block grants and State control is suddenly some kind of virtue in league with the 10 Commandments. I never heard States praised so much as the fountains of good government. This runs contrary to all the history that we can dig up for practically every State. The history of State government is littered with scandals and inconsistencies and incompetence. State government gave us the problem of young men going to the draft in World War I and World War II who were physically not fit to fight. you know. because of the fact that they had not been given free lunches. those poor people who needed them. had been malnourished. maltreated. no health services. State government gave us that. State government gives us waste year after year of monumental proportions. In New York State. for example. State government is at an alltime low. State government is being led by the administration. happens to be a Republican administration. a Republican administration that has tried to turn the State of New York into a giant clubhouse. The executive branch of government is acting as if it is running a giant clubhouse. They are going to move State facilities around and State functions around in ways which accommodate their loyal constituency. The way you hand out patronage to the clubhouse. they are going to seek to hand out State services and State agencies as If they were a giant clubhouse. And they had the right to reward their workers by handing them that agency or handing them a hospital or handing them some set of functions in their particular area and taking it away from another area. The government of New York State has proposed to move certain facilities out of the State capital. Why do you have a State capital if it is not efficient and effective to have all of the pertinent services. administrative agencies grouped together. But he is going to take part of the State capital functions and move them to his home area of Poughkeepsie. NY and put them in facilities there because that is where his constituency is. Those are the people who voted for him and he wants to build up the economy of the area where he came from. And he is going to do this in a 4year period. sort of throw the whole State government out of kilter by seeking to reward his loyal supporters while he punishes the people in the Albany area. the area of the capital. because they did not vote. for him in as large numbers as people in Poughkeepsie voted for him. It is an obvious move. Everybody is talking about it. What baffles me most is how and why nobody has brought a court suit or threatened to arrest the Governor. I do not know how you can so blatantly and so openly misuse public resources and be allowed to remain in office or not be challenged. That is going on now at the level of New York State government. This Governor has gotten ahead of the Contract With America in many ways. He is already trying to change the standards in nursing homes. and he has already proposed a giant cut in Aid to Families with Dependent Children. He is already going after the poor with a vengeance. So he is ahead of the Contract With America and proving just how horrible the fate of the people who need government most will be under State governments. So block grants to the States and State control of certain programs will only mean horror stories and great suffering for large numbers of people. Yet. the wisdom here seems to be give it to the States. give it to the States. The Governors have spoken. The Governors are unified. The Democratic Governors are with the Republican Governors on Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The Democratic Governors are in agreement with the Republican Governors on Medicaid. Well. this Nation was not constructed. the Government was not constructed the way it is for no good reason. If they wanted Governors to legislate nationally. it would have been simple to have the Governors of all the States compose the legislature of the United States. but that is not the case. The Governors are now very greedy. They do not want to wait until the power Is handed down to them. They have taken the initiative. become very aggressive. and now they want to take over the function of Congress. So the Governor of Montana. the Governor of Maine. the Governor of Nevada. States with very little in terms of population. they have very few people. so they have very little representation in Congress. We have New York. Texas. Florida. California with large numbers of Representatives in Congress. according to population. That is the way the Constitution constructed it. The Constitution may need some correction and adJustment with respect to the Senate. because we do not have one man vote in the other body. It is every State has two votes regardless of its population. That itself is something that ought to be on the agenda for the next decade to deal with. But. certainly. there is a good sense. common sense counterbalance in terms that the House of Representatives is proportioned according to population. So how can 50 States. one Governor from each State. usurp the Congress right and begin to make legislation with each one of those Governors having an equal vote? They broadcast this all over. We agree. all of us agree. all of us agree. The Governor of Montana agrees with the Governor of Maine who agrees with the Governor of New York. We are here. and we are here representing constituencies and congressional districts. And we reserve the right to make the decisions ourselves and not have the Governors usurp the powers of the Congress. Let them wait until this process runs its course. Let us see how much power we are going to hand down to the States. Let us see how the people respond. Let us not assume that the Governors are already in charge. We have leadership stuck In a rut here in Washington. We have leadership stuck in a rut in Albany. in New York. and lots of other State capitals. We have leadership stuck in a rut in New York City. The mayor of New York City insists on continuing to cut education programs. Over and over again he goes after education. creating more and more problems in a city that cannot survive unless it has a more educated population. The city Is losing jobs. The only hope is in the area of high. technology jobs. telecommunications. Only educated people are going to keep the city of New York alive. They mayor of New York City continues to make cuts. He is stuck in a rut in terms of how to approach a budget and how to set priorities. The police. they will not be cut. The police represent a great deal of inefficiency because you have a lot of police who are doing the work that civilians should be doing. We were moving in the direction of civilianization of the police department. but because of political considerations. the mayor cuts education while he bloats the salaries of the police department who ought to be out fighting crime. And you could replace them with lower paid civilian workers. So we have this phenomenon of people in responsible positions. when they are stuck in a rut and their conventional wisdom is all that you have to work with. They cause great suffering and great destruction. The Washington obsolete. outofstep reasoning sets a pace for all the others. Washington is so off base in the last year. since this Congress began. until they knock everything else out of kilter. Other jurisdictions. States and municipalities pick up. Washington serves as a negative role model. and we have a great deal of incompetence. blundering. dishonesty. bullying oppression. waste. right down the line as a result of the example set here in Washington. We waste money on a monumental scale. Whitewater hearings. for example. I understand there is an effort to keep the Whitewater hearings going on indefinitely. Whitewater is as great an examnle as you will want to find of a complete turnover of an official government function to a partisan party consideration. If the Whitewater hearings are continued. they certainly should be paid for out of the Republican Partys campaign funds. because it is a political campaign that is being waged through an official congressional hearing. If Whitewater really was sincere. if Whitewater had any credibility and Whitewater meant anything other than a way to harass the President by the other party. if Whitewater was really focused on savings and loans scandals. then I would be the first to applaud Whitewater. Because if ever there was a piece of American history that has been smothered and kept out of the view of the public. it is the savings and loan scandal. Whitewater is cited by the people who are conducting the Whitewater hearings as being very important because I think $60.000. $60 million. I have forgotten. 60 million. 60.000. in a minute you will understand why neither one impresses. 60 million is considerably more than 60.000. That is a lot of money. Whitewater lost that. the bank lost it. There is nothing that says the President or the First Lady had anything to do with those losses. but it is a good idea to have savings and loans. banks investigated and to have the spotlight thrown on the savings and loan scandal. As I have said many times here on this floor. the savings and loan scandal was the biggest swindle in the history of civilization. In the history of mankind. never have so many gotten away with so much and walked off scotfree as in the savings and loan scandal. If you were serious about investigating the savings and loan scandal. if you were serious about exposing to the American people the great cost of the savings and loan scandal. then you would have a hierarchy of hearings. You would start with hearings related to the banks that lost the most money. If you were serious. you would start with Mr. Keatings bank. Mr. Keating has so much exposure and he did so many rotten things beyond what other savings and loans crooks did. After he ran out of FDIC funds. funds that were guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Mr. Keating had his people go out and swindle senior citizens of their money. and it had no FDIC backing. So the State of California went after him in such an obvious way that the U.S. Government had to fall in line and go after him. So Keating and his whole savings and loan empire. they got exposed. and Keating. for a liability of a minimum of $2 billionyou will see why $60 million was soso. did not register well in my mindwhen you start talking about $2 billion. you can see why Whitewaters $60 million pales in comparison. Two billion dollars. what Keatings empire cost at a minimum. The FDIC had to cough up that much money in order to bail out the banking empire that Keating had thoroughly looted. So Keating got 12 years in jail. With good behavior he will soon be out. But at least he got some Jail time. At least it was exposed. So Keatings S&L scandal ought to be Investigated a little bit more. and we ought to have hearings about that just to let the American people know what the dimensions of it were. that if you steal $2 billion. you will get 12 years in jail. If you are the victim of a great deal of publicity. if six Senators are accused of helping you. then you cant. you will end up getting 12 years in jail. At least the American people ought to clearly have the Whitewater hearings people throw Whitewater aside and focus on that. No 1. And then banks that lost a billion and a half would come next. Let us have hearings on all the savings and loans banks or all the other banks. because in the process of correcting the savings and loan scandal. there were many regular banks that were not savings and loans that also were involved in the same kind of chicanery. same kind of crooked deals. same kind of racketeering enterprises. So take all the banks that cost the taxpayers a million and. a billion and a half and have hearings on them next. and then after that. all the banks that coat the American taxpayer a billion. and then after that go down to the $900 million and then the $900 million. I think if you did it that way and were sincerely interested in exposing to the American people exactly what we lost in these savings and loans swindles. exactly how it worked and how we should guard against it for the future. and how private enterprise is not the great. efficient. honest capable productive sector that we make -it out to be. a whole lot of lessons could be learned if you took those kinds of hearings and substituted that for the focus on Whitewater. You would get to Whitewater eventually. Probably in 10 years we will get down to the $60 million level. After you go through all the ones that lost more than a billion and a half. those that lost a billion. those that lost $900 million. then you come down systematically. maybe you will get to Whitewater in 10 years. Then we can say that we have an investigation and a set of hearings that are truly serving the public interest. and they are not partisan fishing expeditions designed to harass the President. Then we could say that. and it would be a great thing for America and a great thing for civilization. because the kind of swindle that was pulled with the savings and loans swindle is something that we should know as much as possible about in order to guarantee that never again will it happen. It is estimated that no less than $300 billion. $300 billion. the American people have lost no less than $300 billion. It may be as high as $500 billion. They do not account for it. What we need hearings for on the savings and loans is to make them sit down and tell us at one hearing what the summary figures are at this point in February 1996. how many banks have you sold off. how much money have you recovered. how much restitution has been given by individuals. what happened with Silverado bank in Denver. CO? Silverado bank comes second probably to Keatings bank. I think they lost close to $2 billion. The son of the President at that time. Neil Bush. sat on that board. and I read accounts of how he was indignant when they investigated and said to him. this board has been so Irresponsible and maybe so crooked that you cant ever sit again on another banking board. He got indignant. Then later I heard that he calmed down. and they fined him. What did they fine him? I think they fined him $40.000. Silverado Bank had lost 2 billion. I think one of the board members named Neil Bush was fined $40.000. That is the bank where there was an incident where a building was bought by a realtor for $26 million. and the building was appraised for $13 million. The bank told the purchaser we will loan you $26 million. and you deposit half of it in the bank because the orders are coingsoon and we need that money to show. So they loaned them $26 million. $13 million more than the building was worth. in order to have the books show that they had a little more money in the bank. If that is not racketeering. you know. I do not know what it is. But we cannot Just talk about this in a special order. we need hearings. we need ongoing hearings. and we need to start at the very top with the banks that have lost the most money. and maybe we will get to Whitewater in my lifetime if you use that hierarchy. I doubt it. The Washington conventional wisdom says let us go after Whitewater. which is just a pebble in the stream. and that is what is happening. Washington wisdom says we should balance the budget on the backs of the powerless. and that is passed down to the States and down to the city. Great harassment is taking place in New York. Anyone who applies for welfare has to wait several weeks. has to fill out very complicated forms. has to go through all kinds of bureaucratic harassment. They are harassing the poorest people because they have the least amount of power. That starts here in Washington. We go after AFDC. we go after Medicaid. we go after the areas where the people are the poorest at the same time we increase the budget of the Defense Department by $6 billion. $6 billion. At the same time we refuse to deal with it. the fact that the agribusinesses are on welfare and the agribusinesses are spending billions of dollars. are receiving billions of dollars in cash payments for not growing grain. for not planting anything. for not doing any work. and they do not have to pass a means test to prove that they are poor. We turn our backs on obvious waste while the conventional wisdom tells us to beat up on the poor. beat up on children who are receiving aid to families with dependent children. Washington conventional wisdom promulgated by the majority. Republicans. say that the workers of America are a threat to the economy. that the workers of America are a drag on our forward progress. that not only do you have to keep the workers wages low. and they refuse to discuss an increase in the minimum wage. the majority. Republicans. would not even discuss it. I serve on the committee. the Committee on Education and labor. a name which I choose to continue to give to the committee. although the official name now under the Republican majority is Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities. The word labor is such a horrendous word that they do not want it in there anywhere. The certainly do not want worker. term worker. around anywhere. For some reason. although I did not read it anywhere in the Contract With America. for some reason the majority of Republicans have chose to wage a relentless assault upon workers. Workers and their families are being attacked on every front. They refuse to raise the minimum wage. would not even discuss it. They go after the Fair Labor Standards Act. which deals with wages and overtime. et cetera. They want to radically change that. They go after OSHA. which provides for safety in the workplace. They are going after the Labor Relations Board. There is nothing. no component of American Government which is designed to help workers that has not been placed on the greater tack by the Republican majority. The assault on workers and their families as enemies of the American economy and the American people continues. No wonder Pat Buchanan gets a response from workers out there when he dares to mention some of their problems. He only dares to mention some of them. Pat Buchanan talks about the fact that there is a gap. but he does not talk about how to close the gap. He would not support an increase in the minimum wage. When he is asked the question. he avoids the question. But he recognizes there is a gap. and every worker applauds. At least somebody would have visibility. somebody that the media covers recognizes that there is a great gap between most Americans. the great majority of Americans and the people at the very top. it ought to be closed. Somebody recognizes that this gap is caused partially by the global economy movement. which has been greatly enhanced by the passage of NAFTA and the passage of GATT. Somebody recognizes that when you have Mexican workers making a dollar an hour on a job where American workers may make $10 to $15 an hour. naturally the factory is going to move to Mexico. Any fool could tell you that. and you do not have to be an economist from Harvard to know that when you pass NAFTA and create those conditions. you are going to make life difficult for American workers who had those jobs before. At least Pat Buchanan has raised it up on the radar screen. and the workers now have somebody who indicates that they exist. There is a lesson in this for all the Democrats at every level to pay attention to the fact of the assault on the workers has created a siege mentality among workers and a siege mentality among the middle class who do not like to be called workers. But the technicians and the professionals and the middle management people. they too are caught up in the siege mentality because they have concrete anxieties. definite causes for concern. Washington obsolete. outofstep conventional wisdom says that education and job training programs should be cut. Nobody was more shocked than I was when I heard that an agreement had been made in the continuing resolution process. The White House had agreed that the continuing resolution should contain cuts for education that we had been fighting all along and the President had indicated he would never accept. You know the $1.1 billion cut of title I is there. it is still there. The cut on Head Start is there. it is still there. The agreement that every program should operate at 75 percent of its last years budget means that there Is a cut. at least $1.1 billion for Title I. The cut is there. If you accept that 75 percent of last years budget will determine the continuing budget level for title I education funds. title I is the only program that funnels money from the Federal Government to elementary and secondary education. It is very important. It is important because the mayor of New York City is cutting education drastically. it is important because the Governor of New York State is cutting education drastically. and even though education funds that come from the Federal level are only 7 percent of the total. if they are taking heavy cuts at the city level and the State level. then the Federal dollars assume a new importance. and the increadethere was a slight increase in title I funds for most of the school districts across the country. That increase plus what they had before was very important in helping to maintain some kind of stability. and now with the leadership of the Federal Government the cuts at the local level. the State level. are larger than they would have been otherwise. Their philosophy comes from the Federal Government. the Congress of the United States. The majority. Republicans. in the Congress have indicated that education should not even be a Federal function. that we should get rid of the Department of Education. They have made a frontal assault on education. and it is one of the smallest agencies. smallest activities. in Government. Yes. they sometimes have a large budget because they have student loans and student grants. but when you look at the agency as a whole. it has the least number of employees. and it is a smallest. one of the smallest. bureaucracies. So why have an assault on education in an era when job training and education are needed more than ever? The assault on education following the assault on workers. it all leads to a situation where large numbers of people in our Nation. voters. think that they are under assault. they are under siege. and they are right. The commonsense observance is more on target than the Washington wisdom. The conventional wisdom here in Washington says it is not enough of a problem to discuss. But the commonsense reason of the people says we have got a real problem and we will even go with all the liabilities represented by a Pat Buchanan candidacy to get some attention. Education and Job training cuts are outrageous at a time like this. I understand that the continuing resolution with respect to education and labor cannot clarify really whether we are going to have a summer youth employment program this summer. Summer youth employment program has already been cut over the years down to a minimum program. whereas New York City used to receive money enough to give 90.000 jobs to young people during the summer. In the last few years It has been cut all the way down to about 30.000 jobs. and now we are in danger of losing the 30.000 jobs. And New York City has 8 million people. a lot of young people. Now we are about to lose the meager 30.000 jobs because it is not clear In the continuing resolution what the funding level is for the summer youth employment. There is some talk about being funded at 75 percent of last years level. but the summer youth employment was singled out last year to be phased out. and I think that last years level is defined as the amount of money that was appropriated for phasing it out. So it is not the same amount as it was the last operational year. We are still trying to clarify that. but the fact that it Is even in jeopardy and there is a question shows how far afield the Washington wisdom is. The fact that the White House has not rushed to clarify that or rushed to make clear that in its agreement of a continuing resolution. it certainly did not mean to Jeopardize the Summer Youth Employment Program. But I have a solution. We have these cuts in education and the cuts in Job training. summer youth employment. The solution is at hand. It has been supplied by the CIA. We have said that these cuts are being made because we must downsize government. streamline government. we want to end the era of big government. and I say that that is an acceptable goal. But If you do not do it across the board. then you are going to generate dislocations and suffering in the wrong places. and we have done that. By cutting education. by cutting job training. we are cutting in the wrong places. we are greatly crippling our efforts to move forward in the global economy and make America competitive. Education is key. job training is key. So why do not we cut the CIA? I proposed this for 2 years in a row. I have had legislation on the floor saying we should cut the CIA by 10 percent per year over a 5year period. and the legislation has gotten very few votes. 57 votes I think we got last time. which means that both parties. Democrats and Republicans. are stuck in a rut with their conventional wisdom. They will not vote to cut CIA. CIA existed primarily to spy on the Soviet Union. At least half of its resources were devoted to that enemy. The Soviet Union now. you know. we have them over here in our missile sites and the space program we are running jointly with them and all kinds of interactions taking place. Why do we need to have the same amount of money dedicated to the CIA as we had when the Soviet Union was the Evil Empire and we needed to keep tabs on them? You know. why do we need it? So we have not been able to win the battle of cutting the CIA. The budget is not known. it is still a secret. and the Russian secret service. its equivalent of the CIA. they have exposed a lot of things. they have opened up a lot of their files. but we are strictly secret even to the point of not telling the American people what the budget is. A Member of Congress cannot get to know what the budget is unless he goes to a little room and looks at the budget and when he comes out he is sworn to secrecy and he cannot discuss it. So I refuse to go into the room. I refuse to go into the room. I accept the estimates of the New York Times. the estimates that the conventional. acrosstheboard most reliable sources say the budget of the CIA and the intelligence agencies under the CIA all come out to about $28 billion. So a $28 billion cut. a 10percent cut of a $28 billion agency would be a $2.8 billion cut over a 5year period. You could have a sizeable amount to put back in. What I am here to propose is that we lost the fight. The CIA is not being downsized. not being streamlined. The era of big government. as far as the CIA is concerned. still is intact. but the CIA recently found S2 billion outside of the budget. They had 2 billion that they had not used over several years that they lost track of. It was in a petty cash fund. The American people. try to comprehend a petty cash fund of $2 billion. Try to comprehend how an agency of the Government can lose $2 billion. how the Director of the agency can have $2 billion in his budget and not know about it. Try to comprehend that. I find it very difficult to comprehend. but let us not dwell on comprehending it. Listen to my proposal. My proposal is that you have $2 billion that you did not know you had. You have $2 billion outside of the attempt to balance the budget. outside of downsizing. You have 32 billion. and education needs about 32 billion. $1.1 billion can go to maintenance of the budget at the same level for the title I program. $1.1 billion. $300 million can be restored to Head Start. We still have not used the whole $2 billion. The rest of it can go for the Summer Youth Employment Program. and we are even. No sweat. no pain. You do not have to hurt anybody. This is lost money that has been found. and now we can celebrate and take care of the young people of America in the school and in the Summer Youth Employment Program. That is a solution. Let us throw aside the Washington conventional wisdom. because I heard that there are plans to let the CIA reprogram the money. They are going to be rewarded by being allowed to reprogram the lost petty cash. The slush fund will be given to the people who created the slush fund. There is an article in the New York Times which shows that maybe that will not happen. Maybe it will not happen. Suddenly. somebody has become indignant. Suddenly. there is talk about firing the people who lost 2 billion in their petty cash fund. Mr. Speaker. I will include in the RECORD an article from todays New York Times entitled Spy Satellite Agency Heads Are Ousted for Lost Money. The article referred to follows: (From the New York Times. Feb. 27. 1996]"},{"1":"1995","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. earlier today. I spoke of a worldwide scourge of landmines and the use of antipersonnel landmines. I noted that there have been few times in history when the nations of the world joined together to outlaw the use of a weapon of war. It was done with chemical and biological weapons. because it was understood that once they were unleashed. they could not be controlled. They maim or kill whoever comes in contact with them. and they do that whether it is civilians or combatants. In fact. If they are in the hands of terrorists. they could wreak havoc on whole societies. We had a terrifying glimpse of that in Japan a few months ago. Now. while chemical weapons are relatively easy to produce. the political cost of using them is enormous. There is worldwide revulsion if they are used. and any perpetrator is branded a war criminal. a pariah. and ostracized by the entire world community. And so we ban them. We did the same with dum dum bullets. which expand on contact with the human body and cause horrific injuries. They have been outlawed for a century. I mention this because every weapon may have some military utility. as do chemical weapons and dum dum bullets. Some have been repudiated as inhumane and a violation of the laws of war. That is what Civil War General Sherman said about landmines over a century ago. Sherman was no humanitarian. but he condemned landmines as a violation of civilized warfare. It was in the Civil War that landminesactually live artillery shells. were first concealed beneath the surface of roads. in houses. even concealed in flour barrels. where they maimed and killed soldiers and civilians alike. But even though Sherman and others condemned them. they have been used ever since in steadily increasing numbers. Today. vast areas of many countries have become deathtraps from millions of unexploded landmines. The State Department estimates that there are 80 to 110 million of these tiny explosives in 62 countries. each one waiting to explode from the pressure of a footstep. To give you an idea. Mr. President. this is a landmine in my hand. I am sure my colleagues know it is a deactivated landmine. but this is a landmine. It is tiny and costs $3 or $4 to produce. It Is all rubber or plastic except for one tiny piece of metal about the size of a thumbtack. So It is nearly undetectable. If this had been real. in just touching it like this. my arm would be gone and most of my face would be gone. If you step on it. your leg is gone. If you are a child. you are probably killed. Children are killed daily on these. In fact. every day. it is estimated that 70 people are maimed or killed by landmines. That is one person every 22 minutes. That Is 26.000 people every year. Most of them are not combatants. They are civilians going about their daily lives--bringing their animals to a field. collecting wood. or they are getting water. or going to market. or they are going to business. They are like Ken Rutherford. a humanitarian worker from Colorado. working with others in Africa. He hit a landmine. As he described it in his very painful and very graphic testimony before the Senate. he sat there holding his foot in his hand. trying to figure out how he could put it back on. Of course. he never did. And there was surgery after surgery. We watched him walk painfully to the table where he testified before the Senate. These pictures. Mr. President. behind me. tell a gruesome story. But. in a way. these are the lucky oneslucky because they survived. but unlucky that they are in a country where they will face a lifetime of hardship. There are tens of thousands of people like them. Many others die. Just from a lack of blood or from shock. before they can reach a hospital. In many of these countries the hospitals are overwhelmed. I do not have the slightest doubt. Mr. President. that any Member of the Senate. Republican or Democrat. could not see what I have seen without feeling as passionately as I do. Young children with their legs blown off at the knees. mothers with an arm or leg missing. hospital rows filled with rows of amputees. I have visited these hospitals. My wife. a registered nurse. has visited these hospitals. We know what they are like. Tim Rieser. from my staff. has traveled to all parts of the world to see what landmines have done. Senators JOHNSTON and SPECTER. Senators SIMPSON and NICKLES saw firsthand what mines can do when they visited a center for amputees in Vietnam. Most people have not been to Vietnam. Afghanistan. Cambodia. Bosnia. Angola. or Mozambique where mines have been a fact of daily life and. in most places. still are. There you see. over and over. the terrible human tragedy these insidious weapons cause. Civilians are not the only victims of landmines. They have become the scourge of the U.N. peacekeepers. An article in this weeks issue of Defense Week is titled. If U.S. Troops Get the Call in Bosnia. Mines Will Pose Serious Threat. It says American troops sent to former Yugoslavia would have to combat an estimated 1.7 million mines in Bosnia alone. It says that mines have been used by all sides in that war to intimidate U.N. peacekeepers. We are called in there as the most powerful nation history has ever known. But we will be facing $3 and $4 and $5 and $8 landmines and be brought to the level of just about any other country. powerful or otherwise. Landmines have become a cheap. popular weapon in Third World countries. the same countries where American troops are likely to be sent in the future. The $2 or $3 antipersonnel mine hidden under a layer of sand or dust can blow the leg off the besttrained. bestequipped American soldier. even though he or she represents the most powerful nation on earth. Two years ago. almost no one was paying attention to this global crisis. Then the U.S. Senate passed my amendment for a moratorium on the export of antipersonnel landmines. Republicans and Democrats together joined to pass that. The amendment had one goal: To challenge other countries to join with us to stop the spread of these hidden killers. As I spoke to the leaders of the other countries. I could tell them this was somethingand probably the only thing during that same Congress--that united Senators as nothing else had. no matter what their party or political philosophy. With the public pressure that grew out of that and the efforts of people around this world. 26 countries have now halted all or most of their exports of antipersonnel landmines in just 2 years. starting with what we were able to do here. Mr. President. 26 countries have halted all or most of their exports of antipersonnel landmines. If. in my 21 years. I had to point to what I was most proud of. I could not think of anything I could be more proud of or have more pride in than knowing men and women both in this body and in parliamentary bodies around the world who have joined with the Senate. Last September. in a historic speech to the U.N. General Assembly. President Clinton announced the goal of eventually eliminating antipersonnel landmines. On December 15. the 184 members of the U.N. General Assembly passed a resolution calling for further steps toward the eventual elimination of antipersonnel landmines. This is the first time since the banning of chemical weapons that the nations of the world have singled out a type of weapon for total elimination. It reflects a growing worldwide consensus that these weapons are unacceptable because they are indiscriminate. They are so cheap. so easy to mass produce. so easy to conceal and transport and scatter by the thousands. They cannot be controlled. They are used routinely to terrorize civilian populations. In March of this year. Belgium passed a law prohibiting production. export. and use of antipersonnel mines. Belgium had been a major producer. Now they have outlawed them. Norway did the same just last week. Half a dozen other countries have declared support for a global ban on these weapons. U.N. SecretaryGeneral BoutrosGhali. Pope John Paul II. former President Jimmy Carter. American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole. these are but a few of the world leaders who have called for an end to the use of antipersonnel mines. But despite this progress. the use of landmines continues unabated. Millions of new mines are being produced each year. and today the Russians are dropping them by the thousands. out of airplanes. over Chechnya. Mr. President. today I introduce legislation that builds on the steps we have taken. It would impose a 1year moratorium on the use of antipersonnel mines. to take effect 3 years from the date of enactment. It would permit the use of these mines along international borders. for example between North and South Korea. in minefields that are monitored to keep out civilians. It also permits the use of Claymore mines. which are used to guard a perimeter. and antitank mines. The purpose of the legislation is simple: Like the landmine export moratorium and the nuclear testing moratorium. it alms. by setting an example. to challenge other countries to join to bring an end to the mass destruction in slow motion caused by landmines. As a step toward that goal. it would temporarily halt the scattering of antipersonnel mines that cause such a massive number of civilian casualties. One person who has worked on this in Cambodia said. sitting in my office in Burlington. VT. Yes. we clear landmines in Cambodia. We clear them an arm and a leg at a time. In addition. my legislation would provide for sanctions against countries that continue to export antipersonnel mines. Mr. President. this is a global crisis. Even with all of our power. the United States cannot solve it alone. But neither will it be solved without strong U.S. leadership. That is what the legislation does. It sets an example. It says. For 1 year. we will take time out. We will challenge other countries to live up to what they said at the United Nations last December when they agreed to work to rid the world of these weapons. Every ambassador from other countries I have talked to. every leader. every foreign minister. has told me in words the same thing: If the United States. the most powerful nation history has ever known. if the United States cannot set the moral leadership. this will not be done. But if the United States sets the example. then it can be done. Our people will be safer. The people in 180 other countries ultimately will be safer. certainly the people of the 60 or more countries that are littered with mines can now begin to get rid of them. With 500 new landmine casualties each week. resolutions are not enough. We have to jolt the world out of complacency. Only the United States can do that. I have two minds about this legislation. I believe it could be the spark that leads to international cooperation to stop this senseless slaughter. because what we do is being watched around the globe. and there is great support. It will take a determined effort over the next few years. but if our leadership gets other governments to join. and I believe Jt will. Americans who are sent into harms way in the future will have far more to gain from what we do here. Whether we send our men and women in uniform. whether we send our people on humanitarian missions. whatever else. to the other parts of the world. they will be safer because of what we can do here. At the same time. it is only a 1year moratorium and does not take effect for 3 years. Between now and then. 82.000 people will die or be horribly maimed by landmines. Frankly. Mr. President. this legislation is the least we can do as the worlds only superpower with by far the most powerful military. It is the least we can do to stigmatize these weapons. because they are indiscriminate and inhumane. whether they are the simple $2 or $3 type or the more complex selfdestructive type. What is our alternative? To accept that large areas of the world will be forever littered with hidden deadly explosives? I cannot accept that. Or that every 22 minutes of every day of every year someone. often a child. usually a civilian. will lose a leg or an arm. or life. as the result of a landmine? I and the 40 other Senators of both parties sponsoring this legislation cannot accept that. It is a global catastrophe. Landmines are causing more unnecessary suffering than any other weapon of war. and people everywhere are calling for the end of this. Today. if armies leave the field they take their weapons with them. They take away their guns. their tanks. and their cannons. But they leave behind landmines that continue to kill long after anybody even remembers what the armies were fighting about. Long after their leaders. their generals. their politicians are dead and gone. the landmines stay there. It is the weapon that keeps on killing. There are some weapons that are so inhumane they do not belong on this Earth. Antipersonnel landmines are in that category. This is not a weapon we need for our national security. It is a terrorist weapon used most often against the defenseless. like these children here who are no threat to anybody. They are the victims. It is. above all. a moral issue. I want to close with a quote from Archbishop Desmond Tutu. because he has spoken eloquently about the 20 million landmines in Africa that have already destroyed so many innocent lives. Archbishop Tutu said: Antipersonnel landmines are not just a crime perpetrated against people. they are a sin. Why has the world been so silent about these obscenities? It is because most of the victims of landmines are neither heard nor seen. Mr. President. the legislation I am introducing today shows that we do hear. that we do see. and we are going to stop this. By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. KENNEDY):"},{"1":"1994","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I rise in strong support of H.R. 4385. the National Highway System designation. The legislation will provide needed assistance in rebuilding the infrastructure of our Nation. Mr. Chairman. this legislation addresses more than just transportation. it takes positive steps in worker safety and in the environment. It requires a person trained and certified in workzone safety to be at every construction project site. This legislation also takes the necessary steps toward increased use of recycled paving material. Finally. this bill authorizes projects throughout the country to rebuild our infrastructure. Let me give you one example. from my home city of Hartford. CT. Interstate 91 cut the city off from the Connecticut River. We are in the process of reestablishing that link. Funds in this bill will allow us to construct walkways around the riverfront linking four surrounding municipalities. Residents and visitors alike will be able to walk along the river and enjoy the natural beauty which this area holds. These walkways will provide access that had previously been impossible because of the interstate highway. This effort would bring the city and river together again. or to use the phrase now current in Hartford. it will allow us to recapture our riverfront. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. for not only does it provide for todays transportation needs. it provides opportunities for the future."},{"1":"1993","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Madam Chairman. I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from North Carolina and cosponsored by the gentleman from California and the gentleman from California . This amendment enjoys broad bipartisan support. because the idea that private property ought to be respected is so very basic to our Nations culture. Now. I know Secretary Babbitt is urging defeat of this provision to require written permission from a private landowner before going onto ones property to perform the biological surveys intended under this bill. The Secretary implies he will require his troops to receive permission for entry through rulemaking or other guidance written at the new agency. After all. the model for the NBS is supposed to be the U.S. Geological Survey. and they do not have to seek written permission to perform geologic field studies on private land. do they? Well. my colleagues. to that I say. why isnt the USGS so bound? I am prepared to offer an obviously nongermane amendment to H.R. 1845 to require the USGS to likewise obtain written permission for private land entry for field work and to make its raw data available to the landowner whence it was collected. If that is the major argument for why the Taylor amendment should be defeated. then we have a sorry state of affairs in this government. So. why hasnt there been a groundswell of support to bind the USGS to a Taylorlike provision? I will admit that I know of no Nevadans who have complained that Federal geologists were on their land without permission. My understanding is these men and women have been courteous to a fault. pun intended. always asking. at least orally. before hammering away at private outcrops. Of course. in my State and district only 13 percent of the land is privately owned. so there is little opportunity for trampling private property rights. But. let us not kid ourselves. The USGS is not the Governments endangered species policebut an NBS is or will be. I know of no authority in the USGS charter akin to the mandate handed this new agency. The Geological Survey scrupulously avoids policy calls. not wanting to taint its reputation. And it has been successful at maintaining scientific credibility. Let me give an example. Madam Chairman. The 100th Congress asked the USGS to study the potential for disruption of thermal features at Yellowstone by the pumping of a private well a few miles north of the parks boundary. A thorough study was done. and like many. a totally negative result could not be scientifically proven. The USGS did prove that no discernible impact upon Yellowstones thermal features was possible if the well were pumped at less than a specific rate. What a tremendous hue and cry was heard from the environmental community saying the USGS had failed to listen to the Park Service argumentsan agency with a policy stake in the outcome of the study. Of course they did not. to have done otherwise would have tarnished the science. Madam Chairman. perhaps I am off the track. somewhat. of explaining my support for this amendment. but I wanted to point my concern over the scope of the proposed NBS. in general. It is disingenuous of supporters of this new agency to suggest it will be the biological equivalent to the esteemed USGS. at least not as it appears to me in H.R. 1845. Some Members who stand here today opposing weakening amendments are the very same Members who condemned the Yellowstone geothermal study because the science was too isolated from policy concerns of the Park Service. I fully expect NBS scientists to be caught in a similar science versus policy trap. but I doubt the ability of the new agency to maintain scientific objectivity. Madam Chairman. one way to help achieve thoughtful balance is to require permission from landowners before entry for field studies. and then to let the landowner have the raw data gathered from her land. All this will do is make the agents of the NBS have to explain themselves. and their mission. before counting species on a persons property. Am I attempting to censor activities of the NBS? You bet I am. If NBS scientists cannot make credible arguments for their datagathering needs to the very people who own the land they seek to survey. they ought not to have access to that landpure and simple. On the other hand. if after proper notification a landowner is persuaded of the worth of the survey and grants permission. then the NBS may go ahead and enter the property. What could be fairer. Madam Chairman? I urge my colleagues to support the TaylorConditPombo amendment. E3 1630"},{"1":"1992","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. I have been concerned about indoor air quality for many years now in the Coniress. As far back as 1974. when we had our first big wave of legislation to start stressing conservation of the building codes and so forth. and Congress dived headlong into pushing the public into sealing public buildings airtight. and then they pressured the American citizens to lock themselves into little bubbles within their own homes. I said then we should go slow about change and that forcing the public into these sealed homes until we know a little more about what happens to air quality. Congress. in its zeal and socalled wisdom in the early 1970s. at the time of the first boycott with respect to oil and energy supplies and higher escalating energy costs. acted anyway. Now we have before us a bill that addresses some of these problems. People have found out in time that a little fresh air inside buildings saves a lot of problems with respect to air quality. The bill. for the most part. is a wellbalanced. measured response. The bill does. however. put forward some new. aggressive research initiatives and clarifies the objections of the Federal Indoor Air Quality Response Act and gets some information out to those people who may need it. So that part of the bill. on the whole. is not a bad thing. I guess I should put it this way: I think this is unneeded legislation. But I also say to my colleagues who are here before the Senate pushing this legislation. on a scale of I to 10 on legislation that would be detrimental to the economy of the country. this is low on the scale. I did not think it will do any good. It is going to increase spending and help break the budget. and it is part of the reason we have a $300billion deficit. But I do think that there can be some meritorious comments made on behalf of our colleagues pushing this legislation. who want to make sure that people have the basic understanding of what radon levels mean. and where the national radon education program comes into effect. We cannot just tell folks a given radon level and expect they will know it Is good or bad. In the past. we have drastically overstated effects. I think what we need in all of these pieces of legislation is more sound sciencemore sound science. I think that if you go to Canada and look at the standards there as compared to here. you get quite a different story. Mr. President. I think it also needs to be said here on the floor that the administration does oppose the enactment of S. 792. The bills prescriptive and regulatory requirements will duplicate programs without significantly lowering the radon qualities and levels. The bill will also undermine programs designed to provide States with the flexibility to develop selfsustaining and costeffective specific programs. The Federal Government is already undertaking numerous programs to address elevated radon levels in buildings. The EPA provides a wide range of technical assistance to help States identify and mitigate elevated radon in residents. workplaces. and schools. The EPA is also working with other Federal agencies to develop policies for federally run programs. The bill would inappropriately reauthorize the State radon program as a federally subsidized program. This reauthorization is contrary to the original intent of the existing 3year startup program. Mr. President. The program was designed with Federal assistance after 3 years by gradually increasing the States share. While the administration would not oppose a 1year extension at a reduced Federal share. it opposes the longer extension. The bills unfocused requirements that definitions will result in overcontrol and excessive societal costs where radon levels are relatively low. These definitions of priority radon areas and target action points are too broad and ignore the work that EPA and other agencies have already done to determine these areas. The bills prescriptive regulatory approach is premature. given the state of scientific and technical expertise in mitigating radon. S. 792 will unnecessarily insert the Federal Government into areas that have traditionally been the province of States and local governments. I am sure that does not slow down the intent of those who are in favor of this legislation. but I think it is something that should be considered. With respect to the costand I know in terms of the legislation that passes this Congress. one almost hesitates to get up and talk about a bill that Is as small in terms of spending as this one. But it is millions and millions of dollars. Mr. President. and this is the fundamental problem that we have here with respect to scoring this bill as pay as you go. S. 792 will increase spending. It is subject to the payasyougo requirement of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The budget point of order applies in both the House and Senate against any bill that is not fully under CBO scoring. If. contrary to the administrations recommendation. the Senate waives any such point of order that applies to S. 792. the effect of enactment of this legislation would be included in a lookback. payasyougo sequester report at the end of the congressional session. OMBs preliminary scoring estimates of this bill are presented in the table that I will read from. In 1992. it will be $16 million. 1993. $5 million. 1994. $5 million. 1995. $5 million. and 199295. a total of $31 million. So. as I say. in terms of costs hero. it is not as bad as many pieces of legislation. But the principal point I think should be understood by my colleagues is that. as in many instances. this radon problem is already being looked at and undertaken by EPA and many State indoor air quality agencies throughout the country. I believe the country would probably be better off not to spend the $31 million. Raise the issue. let the public find out about it. Let the States worry about this problem. and let EPA do what they have been doing with respect to an education program to the public so that people are aware of it. Basically. one way to avoid some of the problems is to have a little fresh air and circulation inside of houses. It is not all that complicated. but it is one of those things that we have brought largely on ourselves. This bill speaks to a problem that was brought upon the American people by earlier actions of Congress. I would be remiss. also. if I did not compliment my colleague from New Hampshire for his amendment. which I think is a substantial improvement to the legislation with respect to water quality. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that at the end of my remarks. a Warren Brookes article of June 25. 1990. be printed in the RECORD."},{"1":"1991","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. I ask to use as much time as I consume and that the Chair advise me when I have used 10 minutes. Mr. President. this morning the Senate begins its debate on energy policy. I. like most of my colleagues. support a strong energy policy that will protect Americans from oil price shocks and provide adequate environmental protection in the decades ahead. I want to underline that point. I know every Senator supports a strong energy policy as we attempt to endeavor to find some way that this country in fact enacts strong energy policy. We need such a policy. The Senate should work to adopt such a policy as soon as it possibly can. However. the pending legislation. S. 1220. is a seriously flawed and inappropriate starting point for such an energy debate. S. 1220 embraces the false hope that America can produce enough oil to shield itself from the uncertainties of Middle East politics. S. 1220 turns its back on developing technologies that can increase our energy efficiency by creating no new markets for such technologies. S. 1220 calls for drilling of oil in a pristine area of Alaska. It provides for no mandated improvement in the efficiency of our automobiles--none. It completely restructures the electric utility industry. It shuts out the public during the nuclear licensing process. It allows many hydroelectric projects to evade the Endangered Species Act. And it provides insignificant. voluntary improvements in efficiency of appliances. lighting. and buildings. We could improve each of these provisions through debate on the Senate floor. and that is what many of us are urging. But the better course for the Senate and for this country would be to start with a proposal that looks to the future and not to the past. That is the essential problem with this bill. We should be considering an energy policy that reduces. not increases. our dependence on oil. We should be able to declare that the legislation we are considering will provide significant reductions in the gases that contribute to global warming. Mr. President. we can do better. I and others are prepared to spend the time necessary to address each of the dozens of significant problems presented in S. I would prefer to spend my time. however. in supporting legislation that protects the future of this country. one that does not look to the past. I come to this debate unwillingly. Clearly. the Energy Committee members. particularly its chairman. have devoted a lot of time to this legislation. But wise and careful energy productionI underline the word productioncoupled with careful energy use. should be our goal. S. 1220 is devoid of such a goal. I cannot. therefore. recommend that the Senate initiate a protracted debate on such a reversionary policy. The energy policy put forth in this legislation is seriously flawed. It is policy that is heavily skewed toward increased energy production. at any cost to the environment and the consumer. It suffers from the tunnel vision of chasing cheap oil while shunning energy conservation and efficiency. It is a policy to deregulate virtually every major energy industry in this country. The singleminded pursuit of oil for the past decade has made our families and businesses more vulnerable to oil price shocks. It has reduced our ability to compete with Japan. Germany. and other nations in the world marketplace. And it has contributed to global warming. air pollution. and other environmental problems. This socalled comprehensive energy legislation has no broader vision than merely continuing our present policy. It continues to stumble along in the wrong direction. Some have said that this bill is flawed because it is not balanced with more conservation measures. I disagree. It is flawed because it has no vision of the future. It fails to take us in a new direction. a direction that leads to increased energy efficiency and development of other energy sources. a direction that leads to greater economic stability. increased international competitiveness and a healthier environment. The centerpiece of this bill is the panacea of drilling for oil In the Arctic Refuges wilderness. It is. in reality. only a hope that we will be able to find 200 days worth of oiloil that the Office of Technology Assessment has said would provide a shortterm and very small benefit to us 10 to 40 years from now. This bill threatens to destroy a portion of this countrys natural heritage with very little in return. The exploration for oil and gas that would follow leasing would change forever a magnificent and wild national treasure. In exchange for the certainty of that harm. the Nations major oil companiesnot the independents but the maJors--would have gained the right to roll the dice. or to flip a coin. on finding oil. And look where this approach leaves us 10 years from now. We will have made little progress toward greater conservation and more efficient use of energy. We will have made little progress toward development of energy alternatives to oil. And we will have begun to drain the last of our oil to feed our wasteful energy habit. Opening the wilderness areas of the Arctic Refuge Is a quick fix that has more to do with helping big oil than it does with helping the public. The big oil companies reaped more than $40 billion in profits from Prudhoe Bay production between 1969 and 1987. I reject a policy that. for 6 months of oilmaybe 7 months of oilwould sacrifice what the Interior Department called the only conservation system unit that protects. in an undisturbed condition. a complete spectrum of the arctic ecosystems in North America. The olispill in Prince William Sound taught us that the promise of not having to choose between a wild. natural arctic ecosystem and extensive development is a promise that cannot be kept. We do have to choose. Remember that 90 percent of the 1.100mile northern coastline of Alaskaoffshore and onshore--has been devoted to energy exploration and possible development. Only the 110 miles of the Arctic Refuges coastal plain remains off limits. We do not have to develop the last and best 10 percent to have a sound energy policy for this Nation. Our problem with Imported oil Is its price. not its availability. Most of the worlds oil reserves lie In the Persian Gulf. It is instability in this region that produces large shocks in the price of oil. The United States has only 4 percent of the worlds oil reserves and much of what is left is Inaccessible and expensive to develop. No matter how hard we tryno matter how much of our natural heritage we destroythe United States cannot produce Its way out of our current vulnerability to oil price increases. It cannot. During the war with Iraq. Alaskan oil sold for the same price as oil that was Imported from the Persian Gulf. Oil from the Arctic Refuge. If there is any. also would sell at the same price as Persian Gulf oil. Between the last oil crisis and this one we burned most of the oil we had found on Alaskas North Slope. But that oil did nothing to insulate us from skyrocketing prices. and the answer Is not one single find. Our national energy strategy should not abandon domestic oil production. but it should be more focused toward the future. This countrys policy should provide economic incentives to put the oil rigs in Montana. Texas. Oklahoma. and elsewhere around the country back to work extracting known oil reserves. It is called enhanced recovery. The Presidents national energy study showed that the amount of additional oil that we can get from enhanced recovery vastly exceeds four or five times the amount that may be found in a very pristine area of northern Alaska. or other strikes in addition. I might add. We should encourage more thorough exploration and development of the tens of millions of acres already under lease in Alaska. Strikes in some of these areas already have proven to be far more promising than originally thought."},{"1":"1990","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. as chairman of the Subcommittee on Environment. Energy. and Natural Resources. who had done most of the hearings in this area. I rise in support of this amendment. I rise in support of the amendment for the following reasons: First. the amendment simply incorporates a bill already passed by the House earlier this Congress: The Eckart amendment incorporates a bill. H.R. 1056. which was overwhelmingly approved by the House 380 to 39 on July 19. 1989. after being approved by the Energy and Commerce Committee by a vote of 38 to 5. Second. this amendment is necessary to address an immediate and serious problem. the failure of Federal agencies to comply with the Federal hazardous waste laws: Both my Subcommittee on Environment. Energy and Natural Resources of the Government Operations Committee. which reported this bill. and the Energy and Commerce Committee. which reported H.R. 1056. have held extensive hearings on environmental problems at Federal facilities. From these hearings and investigations conducted by the U.S. General Accounting Office we know of extensive hazardous waste problems at Federal facilities. For example: 28 of 45 major Department of Energy sitessites not individual facilitieswill require corrective actions unrer RCRA and more under Superfund. At the Hanford site alone there are over 1.000 individual facilities or spills requiring cleanup. Cleanup costs at DOE sites are estimated at between $35 billion and $60 billion. Third. the amendment would correct a regulatory vacuum created by the courts and the Justice Department: The Justice Department argues that EPA cant take enforcement action against other Federal agencies under RCRA. At the same time. Justice has also convinced some courts that the States cant either. Consequently. we are left. in some cases. with no effective enforcement. This amendment would restore both EPAs authority and the States authorities to regulate as Congress originally intended. Fourth. the EPA Cabinet bill is the right vehicle to solve this problem: We are passing this bill to elevate EPA to a Cabinet level agency precisely because we want there to be no doubt about the national importance of protecting the environment and the Importance of EPAs role. Congress would be remiss if we did not take this opportunity to clear up the existing ambiguity over EPAs authority to enforce RCRA. Fifth. Eckart amendment will end the double standard for hazardous waste regulation: The Eckart amendment will end the double standard for hazardous waste regulation where States. municipalities. and private corporations are subject to civil penalties levied by EPA for RCRA violations. but not other agencies of the Federal Government. Sixth. Eckart amendment is consistent with new DOE policy on contractor accountability: Earlier this year. DOE proposed changes to its procurement policy to make contractors liable for fines and penalties for violations of environmental laws. The Eckart amendment would simply add RCRA to the list of environmental statutes containing fines and penalties which DOE now acknowledges are important tools to assure contractor accountability for environmental protection. The Department of Defense already holds its contractors responsible for paying such fines. Seventh. H.R. 1056 Is supported by all 50 State attorneys general. the National Conference of State Legislatures. and the Western Governors Association: All 50 State AGs signed a joint letter last summer during debate on the H.R. 1056. The Western Governors Association passed a resolution last summer calling for the enactment of H.R. 1056. And the National Conference of State Legislatures has sent a letter to all Members of the House urging them to adopt the Eckart amendment."},{"1":"1989","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. today we are voting on a responsible. modest increase in the minimum wage. This conference report is the product of many compromises negotiated over several years. As first introduced in 1987. the legislation would have indexed the minimum wage so it would automatically increase over time. A later version of the bill raised the minimum wage to $5.05. But to meet the concerns raised by businesses and some Members of Congress. the Democratic leadership compromised. This year the minimum wage bill as introduced contained no provisions to index the wage and reduced the increase to $4.65. Since January advocates of a higher minimum wage have again compromised. this time by reducing the Increase another 10 cents and creating a new training wage. So does the final product increase the minimum wage too much? No. Since 1981. inflation has reduced the wages value by 37 percent. This bill increases the minimum wage just enough to keep the wages purchasing power relatively constant. Yet President Bush says this is too much. He says that minimum wage workers should accept continued reductions in the value of their wages. For many minimum wage workers and their families accepting a smaller increase will mean less food on the table. It will mean an increase In the number of working Americans who are homeless. We Democrats believe that the poorest American workers should not have the value of their wages reduced any further. These workers have already made enough sacrifices. In the name of fairness for American workers I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I urge President Bush not to veto this bill."},{"1":"1988","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"If the Senator would yield for one more comment I would appreciate his indulgence. When this bill came back in the form of a conference report. I raised the whole issue on the floor at that time. This is not the first time I raised it and I think the distinguished Senator from Ohios recollection is faulty on this. If I have a faulty recollection. I am willing to admit it. but I can tell you this has been a serious thing. The original language in the bill was amended in conference. I did raise it. I think if you go back and look in the did raise it. It is an important issue. it is not an inconsequential issue. Even if I did not raise it. which I did. but even if I did not. I still have an obligation if I just found out about it yesterday to bring it up and protect the labor laws of this country. That is what I am trying to do. I have done it expeditiously. In all honesty. I think we have done it not only expeditiously but honorably. I think it is an amendment that should have passed. I can stand to lose. I have lost many times on this floor and I have won sometimes. but this is one that really does bother me because it really is important.

I thank you for those comments and I appreciate your observation as it relates to the people of your district versus the people of my congressional district. I guess they have one thing in common. They are Americans. And as Americans they believe in their system of government. But they have also come to recognize very clearly in the last 10 to 15 years that their Government is not doing for them what they ask it to do. and that is to provide them. in a limited sense. with a variety of programs that provide for their safety and for their protection and yet at the same time assures that they will have access to a free and vibrant economy with which to seek their successes and their failures as American citizens. I have often said that if there was anything good to come out of the recessions of 1981 and 1982 it was the fabulous lesson in economics for the American people. because they saw for the first time so clearly what happens when you tax too much and when you spend too much at the Federal level and at all levels of Government. and you simply pull from the economic reserve or reservoir in this country that we call the gross national product too much money for Government. simply not leaving enough money for the average citizen. Interest rates went through the roof. inflation began to take off. and all of those kinds of problems resulted from a Government that was running loose and rampant. We were able to rein it in some over the period of 198183. But why does the American public. without question today. say that the number one issue is the deficit. as they say in your district and as they say in mine? Because they know. They know very clearly. from lessons of the past. that deficit spending is that dynamic. if you will. or that force inside the economy that ultimately destroys the economy. and when you destroy it you destroy their jobs. you destroy their homes and you destroy the very future they have that they can turn and offer to their children and to their childrens children. And that is what they are frightened of right now. To see the interest on the debt becoming one of the largest single items in the Federal budget is a frightening experience. because we know. as business people in what we oftentimes say real life. with business experience. when that happens with business. all of a sudden it is bankrupt. it is gone. it destroys its Jobs. it destroys any form of economic vitality that it had. There is only one difference here. We can borrow and we can print. but it does catch up with us. And that is what is happening today. There are a good many of us who are struggling to try to bring that under control. I think the gentleman is absolutely correct. GrammRudman.MackCheney provides us with the tool. the enabling legislation. the process by which we get from here to here and over here. is that balanced budget. And to ensure that it happens. then. I do believe. as the gentleman has mentioned. that we need a constitutional amendment that says to the Congress. No. you cannot change us arbitrarily because we are the Constitution. we are the law that governs you. because we are the people. That is one thing that sometimes the American citizens forget. The Constitution is theirs. We cannot change it here in the Congress. we can only propose change. Is it the American people that have to vote by threefourths of their States in the ratification of a change that really brings about the change. Well over 70 percent of the American people today say that a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget is what they want. Of course. they recognize. as the 90plus percent in the gentlemans district recognize. that you can accomplish deficit reduction by getting to that balanced budget vis.avis the peoples law.

I would like to pay tribute today to my friend and colleague. Dr. John Byrne. who Is leaving his position as the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration CNOAA]. I have enjoyed working with John. who has shared my commitment to developing and protecting our Nations oceans resources. I have always been a believer of this Nations ocean potential to meet the growing needs of our economy. Recent scientific and technological advances have rapidly expanded our use of the oceans to encompass such diverse activities as oil and gas exploration and development. exploration and research with deepsea submersible vessels. fisheries and acquaculture research and development. and increased use of satellites in our weather forecasting activities. Developing sound policies to deal with these diverse uses has been one of my highest priorities as a Member of this Senate. Dr. John Byrne. as the Administrator of NOAA. has played a key role in the development of these policies. In the past few years the Federal budget has come under increased pressure. This pressure has been felt most acutely by the Nations oceanic and atmospheric programs. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce. Justice. State. and the Judiciary. I have been particularly aware of the stresses that budget stringencies have placed on environmental research. These circumstances have resulted in difficult choices for John. and I deeply appreciate his cooperation in directing and maintaining sound oceans and atmospheric research programs within NOAA. Under the leadership of Dr. Byrne. NOAA has seen the expansion of its undersea research programs. the upgrading of atmospheric programs to enhance the Nations ability to predict weather. and the advancement of a sound satellite program. Under his leadership we have seen improvements in fisheries and coastal management. new developments in acquaculture. and the introduction of Ocean Service Centers to distribute atmospheric and marine scientific data throughout the country. John Byrnes new position as president of Oregon State University serves him well: he originally came to NOAA from OSU. bringing with him the scientific expertise necessary to run the agency. Oregon State is gaining a great asset. and I know that John will continue to contribute to the Nations marine research efforts by maintaining OSUs fine tradition of marine scientific research and education. I think that it is critical for an agency such as NOAA to be directed by an individual who has expertise in the natural sciences. Johns experience as a geologist. educator. and administrator gave him much of the background needed to direct NOAA. Furthermore. NOAA has a longstanding tradition of maintaining a strong liaison with educational institutions throughout the country. It has been one of the stimuli for States. territories. and the Federal Government to have education. management. and research project that provide the foundation for a sound oceans policy. I look forward to working with John in the future to further NOAAuniversity relations so that the broader goals of ocean scientific research can be served. I am sure my colleagues all share my appreciation of the services John has performed in his tenure with NOAA. and join me in wishing him the best of luck in his new position.*"},{"1":"1983","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to Join my colleague from Minnesota in offering an amendment that will encourage small businesses to use the ExportImport Bank. The foundation upon which this Nations economic prosperity rests has been. and remains. small business. Small business has been the key to much of our economic growth. its technological innovation and Job creation. H.R. 2957 makes important strides on behalf of small business. and the committee should be commended for its actions. Our colleagues Mr. LUNDINE. Mr. ROEMER. and Ms. KAPTUR deserve particular credit for their efforts on behalf of small business. The thrust of our amendment today is to complement and supplement what they have already accomplished. Mr. Chairman. the greatest potential for export expansion. for new job creation and new industries. lies with small business. The Department of Commerce estimates that there are at least 20.000 businesses in this country that could export but do not. Ninetytwo percent of all American firms sell only in the United States while 93 percent of the worlds population is outside the United States. There ought to be improvement when one considers that exports represent some 9 percent of our GNP and that for every $1 billion in exports. at least 25.000 new U.S. Jobs are created. The greatest problem these smalland mediumsized exporters face. according to a recent survey conducted by the Commerce Department. is the availability of competitive export finance support. The problem of adequate export credit support for smaller companies is addressed in the Eximbank provisions of H.R. 2957. but the problem of assuring the availability of competitive programs for smaller companies was not adequately resolved. The amendment I am offering with Congressman FRENZEL would direct the Bank to institute a mediumterm credit program. This program is currently available to all users. but could be of particular help to those engaged in smaller transactions and those just breaking into the export market. Our amendment will establish an Eximbank mediumterm credit program which will compete with comparable programs offered by our trading partners. The program would establish interest rates at the lowest rates permitted under international guidelines adopted by the member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The program would also require the Eximbank to cover up to 85 percent of the exports involved and would establish a program to promote the mediumterm program among small businesses. We are pleased that the Eximbank has agreed with our conclusions and announced the creation. on July 19. of a mediumterm credit program precisely along the lines we propose. We are encouraged by the Banks actions. The Banks action. however. does not obviate the need for our amendment. Rather. it points out the necessity of our amendment. The Bank can institute this program today. as it has in the past. and withdraw it another day. It is imperative that Congress state clearly that this Is a program that is too important to Americas small businesses to be removed ever again. The Bank itself has estimated that there Is a $3 to $5 billion demand for mediumterm credit. Constant changes in the Banks mediumterm program have made it impossible for U.S. exporters. particularly small businesses. to develop orderly overseas marketing strategies. Our amendment would require the Eximbank to develop and retain a predictable program that U.S. exporters will use. Today. the U.S. Eximbank is considered the least competitive institution of its kind in the world. Adoption of our amendment will improve the position of the Bank and will encourage our smaller exporters to use the services of the Bank. Failure of our amendment will only result in what has become an all too familiar storyquestions about U.S. supplier reliability. lost markets. and most important. lost Jobs. I urge my colleagues to Join us in promoting U.S. exports. small business and Jobs."},{"1":"1982","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"I thank the Speaker. Mr. Speaker. this letter Is from Brookline.

It is heartening to read the New York Times article today. page 11. that there is one Republican. perhaps more.

We need more of your kind in Congress. Wish you would run again. This letter is from San Mateo. Calif.: Thank you for saying what most of us feel. yet either dont say or dont have the opportunity to say regarding the economic and social programs of this current administration. You may not have had much of an audience on the day that you made your speechAnd frankly. I dont have much of an audience today. eitherHowever. I am pleased the news media published the accountAs am IAnd I am sure that you have lifted the spirits of many Americans. myself included. with your heartfelt and truthful remarks. From the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee: I was reading the New York Times this morning and could hardly believe my eyes. I have often fantasized that someone in Congress would say what you said. how you said it. not only about the heartlessness of the Reagan administration. but about so many other public issues. What was said with par. ticular decency. directness and grace. was that few people have the effective freedom and the opportunity to say it. all necessities aside. I dont believe it is only because you are about to be leaving Congress that you said it. There are many who have left who have kept a discreet silence. It takes substance to have thought to say it that way to begin with. no less to have done it. My only regret is that you will not continue to be there and I am hoping the mail accumulates to persuade you otherwise. but in my case I want to thank you for what is a rare state. ment of the straightest candor by an elected official. The gentleman is a professor at the University of Wisconsin. From Boulder. Colo.: I am writing to thank you very much for the speech you gave on the floor of the House of Representativesand other nice thingsI feel that you have addressed the Reagan presidency in exactly the correct fashion and your speech can only help to go far in the necessary task of stripping away Reagans facade and the illusion created by his administration. For me and many of my loved ones. Reagans domestic and military policies are nothing short of terrifying. From San Mateo. Calif.: I read the newspaper article in the San Francisco Chronicle about your recent speech concerning the dissatisfaction with the present administration. I also read of your concern about not having to be able to make a difference while you were in office. I want to let you know at least from my point of view that it is to the contrary. This coun. try needs more people like you. people who have the courage and faith in their fellow man enough to voice that dissatisfaction. rather than sit silently by regardless of party affiliation or whatever. You took the time to make a public speech that appeared no doubt in papers all over the country. You make a difference to me. There are no doubt so many people who feel the same way as you do who read that article this morning. Thank you for making the difference. This letter comes from Savannah. Ga. DEAR CONGRESSMAN: I am a 16 year old high school Junior. I have many high hopes to one day serve in the United States Senate. Although I know parts of the American political process. I certainly need to learn much more. On March 9th I learned quite a bit about politics. Not ten minutes ago I saw a section of your speech which came on CSPAN. I learned a valuable lesson about oratory and about principles. I write my own speeches at my high school and I take some sort of pride in them. but your speech was wonderful. I can say that I am a true blue Democrat. but I saw a vision of prosperity in your eloquent oration. I think that Mr. Reagan and his million dollar infield have let the ball roll between their legs.

Beyond any straight information needs. however. is the importance of tapping the expertise of experienced leaders from the public and private sectors. One such person from the business community. the past chairman and chief executive officer of B. F. Goodrich. 0. Pendleton Thomas. has taken the time to put forth a most cogent statement on what can and cannot be done in the energy policy field. In his paper. A Program To Reduce Oil Imports. Mr. Thomas has shown the linkages between conservation. alternative resources. and expansion of domestic production. The analysis draws on recent studies as well as the authors direct contact with the forces driving the countrys economy. Perhaps the most important observations made by Mr. Thomas as he leads us through the complex series of events which brought us to our current difficulties are reflected in these two quotes: We Americans are accustomed to thinking that any problem can be solved speedilyparticularly if we spend enough money. However. increased dependence on foreign energy has been developing for a long period of time and the situation cannot be reversed with quick fixes. We must have the patience and determination to carry out a wellplanned and longterm effort. The government must establish our goals and objectives for increased energy production .... However. the carrying out of the program must be turned over to Industry. Economic incentives will have to be provided and the economic uncertainties and risks will have to be minimized. These points are the necessary philosophical starting point for any workable energy policy. The historical perspective must be understood and a functioning partnership between government. business. and public interest groups must be forged. With those thoughts in mind. Mr. Thomas then goes on to identify his views on what can be accomplished in the various commercial. residential. industrial. and transportation sectors. In doing this. he ties together many study results with his own. comprehensive knowledge of the subject. Mr. President. I commend Mr. Thomas for the contribution he has made to understanding and resolving the energy questions facing the country. His participation is a most welcome addition to the ongoing energy debate. I submit for the RECORD Mr. Thomas excellent paper:"},{"1":"1979","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. the countercyclical revenue sharing program has been one of the most important methods by which the Federal Government has provided fiscal relief to State and local governments that have been hard hit by high unemployment. I am introducing a bill today that will reauthorize this vitally needed program and will concentrate its benefits on those governments that need them most. Because the countercyclical program expired in September 30. 1978. and was not extended in the last Congress. States and localities were denied Federal funds that were specifically designed to help them deal with high unemployment and soaring inflation. Even worse. the Carter administration specifically instructed many cities to include these funds in their 1979 budget. New York City. for example. was told to expect $140 million for fiscal year 1979. and Buffalo was told to plan on over $3 million. Both cities counted on these funds in their fiscal plans and the failure to provide them created serious fiscal difficulties for these cities. If the administration believes it is important to fulfill the pledges it has made to foreign countries. it should also be steadfast in fulfilling the promises it made to our own cities. My bill changes the old countercyclical program in one important respect: State and local governments with an unemployment rate of 6 percent or higher will continue to receive countercyclical revenue sharing funds regardless of the national unemployment rate. This will target the funds to those localities that continue to lag behind the country as a whole economically and will allow the aid to be used by those governments most in need. New York City will receive $60 million a year. Significantly. the fiscal year 1979 congressional budget already includes $550 million for the countercyclical program. Thus. this bill. which costs $550 million. is in no way a budget breaker. It is important to put the relatively moderate cost of this vital program in perspective. The cost overrun of a single Trident submarine is $750 million-$200 million more than the entire countercyclical revenue sharing program. If we can afford to build a Trident. we can surely afford to save our cities. The Federal funds added by my bill will save jobs and prevent reductions in police. fire. education. and other essential services. At a time when many of our cities. including New York. are experiencing serious fiscal difficulties. it would be irresponsible for the Federal Government to withhold this critical program. I strongly urge my colleagues support for this important legislation. The text of the bill follows: H.R.A bill to amend title II of the Public Works Employment Act of 1976 to establish a supplementary antirecession fiscal assistance program for local governments suffering severe unemployment Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled. SECTION 1. This Act may be cited as the Antirecession Supplementary Fiscal Assistance Amendments of 1979.. SEC. 2.

I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman.

As a matter of fact. I am a Member who is not considered a dove but. rather. a hawk. but still I think we can make cuts everywhere and we should eliminate waste where possible and cut as much as we can. So I know we can cut there. But the one point I would like to make to my good friend and colleague. the gentleman from Indiana . is that I know there has been a lot said about my HEW amendment we passed yesterday. But to make the record clear. all we are doing is cutting the 9.7 percent increase to 7.9 percent. The 7.9 percent is still way ahead of inflation. so we did not cut HEW. we merely cut approximately 2 percent from the increase. I think they can live with an overall 7.9 percent increase rather than 9.7 percent."},{"1":"1977","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I thank my distinguished colleague and friend. the Senator from Rhode Island. Mr. President. I rise to state my own strong support for the amendment the Senator from Rhode Island has proposed. an amendment which he has done me the honor of allowing me to cosponsor with him. I rise also to make two points to add to this debate. one more general than the other. which I think. however. may enlarge our understanding of the issue before us. The first is a historical point. in a sense. It goes to the criterion which Congress and the executive have established for need with respect to economic development legislation. If I am not mistaken. the single largest event of this kind took place in the mid1960s when President Johnson. following an earlier initiative of President Kennedy. established a task force to inquire into the nature and causes of poverty in the United States. Mr. President. I served as a member of President Johnsons task force and. as has since been written in some detail in a number of works. including one of my own. one of the greatest decisions of the poverty program of the 1960s was whether there would be a jobs component. whether there would be a direct effort to create jobs as part of the poverty program. In the end. the answer to that question was. no. we did not. We moved away from concentration on employment and. instead. began concentrating on questions of income. There was an unavoidable and not undesirable regional. sectional bias to a concentration on income as the main criterion of need. but it had as its unavoidable consequence. also. the avoidance of the problem of economic decline in many of the previouslydeveloped regions of the Nation. I believe that in this Congress. with the support of President Carter. we are beginning to right the imbalance that resulted in the mid1960s by devising programs which take. as a key measure of need. levels of unemployment which recognize that. whilst anyone unemployed is equally unemployed. no matter where he or she may be. equal measures will not create jobs. and special measures are required. There was a measure which we debated at some length with respect to the Public Works Employment Act and which the Senate. by an overwhelming majority. endorsed. It endorsed the principle that high levels of unemployment create special needs and warrant special consideration. I think a large principle is being confirmed in Congress with the support of the administration. I very much support that principle. I wish to make a second point. as I said. Mr. President. that does go to a regional concern. Although. as the Senator from Rhode Island has said. this is in nowise a regional measure. simply to give the Senate a sense of how different has been the experience of some regions as against others. I wish to describe a chart I have here. It was prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. It describes the experience of employment in the Nation since the previous peak month of November 1973. If that is taken as ground zero. as they say. we find that. during this time. we went along in a period of prosperity. Then. beginning in 1974. we entered the strongest recession this Nation has had since the great depression of the 1930s. which was accompanied by the New Deal. That recession was sharp. It was unprecedented in the decline involved. However. in June of 1975 the bottom was reached for the Nation as a whole. After a decline altogether of some 2 percent of jobs in the Nation. the Nation itself has risen to the point where there is now almost a 3percent increase in jobs. that magic 3percent number to which we have been addressing ourselves. There are now more than 3 percent more persons working today than there were in the previous peak of 1973. up considerably from the trough of June 1975. But there are two regions in the Nation which. very simply. have not at all recovered from that strongest recession the Nation has known since the 1930s. In New England today. although there has been some increase since the bottom of the recession. there are still fewer than 2 percent of the number of jobs there were in the previous peak. in the Middle Atlantic States. there has been no recovery from the recession of 1974 whatever. If you could see this chart which I am holding. you would see the employment data for the Middle Atlantic States peaking at the beginning of 1974 and declining regularly ever since. In the Middle Atlantic States. we are still in the recession that began in 1974. There has not been any recovery. There are not even signs of a recovery. The jobs bill before us. as the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee has made clear. is a bill to create jobs. While we have the overwhelming support of this body for it. I think the measure does need the calibration which the Senator from Rhode Islands amendment would provide. such that it will have the same effect in areas that need jobs most and have them least as it will in more fortunate areas. I congratulate the Senator from Rhode Island. I think he addresses himself to a point which. if we continue to affirm it in this Congress. will end by having a large and in my view wholly desirable effect upon national economic policy. I thank the Senator."},{"1":"1976","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"I thank the Senator. Mr. President. when this amendment was last debated. my able friend and the distinguished Senator from Oregon quoted Dr. Louis Hellman of the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare as saying that: Most of the women denied medicaid for abortions would be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. The cost to the government for the first year alone after birth for medical care and public assistance would be between $450 million and $565 million. Whereas it is estimated that the department is currently financing between 250.000 and 300.000 abortions annually at a cost of $45 to $50 million. At that time. I think the record will show that I asked the distinguished Senator from Oregon whether he might be saying that: It is cheaper to the state to kill the unborn children of the poor than it is to let them be born. I believe that such was the necessary and direct implication of both his and Dr. Hellmans statement. To my surprise my good friend from Oregon did not repudiate that inference from his statement. Indeed he merely said that he had other arguments as well on which to base his position. Mr. President. I know this is a controversial subject. but I am bound to say that many Americans regard this as a most invidious argument. Had I ever any doubt concerning how I would vote on this amendment before this argument was made. I certainly would vote in favor of the Hyde amendment simply to repudiate any inference that the Senate of the United States would ever entertain such a notion. To vote against the Hyde amendment in the context of this argument is to take the Senate on the first step to horror and tragedy. What we will be saying. if we reject the Hyde amendment under these circumstances. is that innocent human lives can and. indeed. should be subordinated to the monetary interests of the state. If we embrace this principle today. to what extremes will we go tomorrow? I predict. and I do so with all seriousness that if we today embrace the principle that innocent human life may be disposed of to save the Government money in regard to child care. in the foreseeable future we could again hear this argument applied to the old. the feeble. the infirm. and the handicapped. We know too plainly where such reasoning has led in the past. It is no mere coincidence that the modem practice of abortion as a policy of government first appeared in Nazi and Communist dictatorships. The low value these governments place on individual lives made the practice of abortion an easy vehicle for the implementation of their societys goals. During the course of the Nuremberg Military Tribunals trials of Nazi war criminals. the promotion of abortion was considered a crime against humanity. The Nazi regime encouraged and even in some circumstances forced abortions on eastern European women as part of their genocidal racial policies. Abortions were prohibited in Germany by the German Penal Code and after the Nazis came to power they strictly enforced the law as to Germans. But abortions were also prohibited by the Polish Penal Code and the Soviet Penal Code. After the war. the prosecution argued during the Nuremberg Trials that the war crimes of certain Nazi officers in the race and resettlement office consisted in the implementation of a policy with the result that. and I quote official U.S. Government trial documents: The protection of the law was denied to the unborn children of the Russian and Polish women in Nazi Germany. Abortions were encouraged and even forced on these women. According to Nazi documents the procedures involved were quite simple. In the case of eastern female workers. pregnancy may be interrupted if the pregnant woman so desires. Concerning the request of the eastern female worker. the officer for expert opinion for abortion is the locally competent medical office .... obtaining the consent of the higher SS and police leader as deputy of the reich commissioner for the strengthening of Germanism is. according to this. necessary only in the cases in which it is maintained or is probable that the father was a German and a member of an ethnically related (Germanic) race. Gestapo and SS documents revealed at the trial derided physicians who argued that promoting abortions among these women was not in accordance with the moral obligation of a physician to preserve life. Other doctors were criticized for objecting to lateterm abortions as child murder. Also the documents expressed concern thatThe more intelligent female eastern workers had misgivings about interruption of pregnancy. since they know from their native country that a womans ability to conceive suffers through artificial abortion. The defense position at trial basically involved two principal arguments. First. the defense argued that the mental attitude and personal beliefs of the defendants necessary to convict them of intending to commit a crime against humanity was absent becauseA personal subjective attitude towards the matter was unnecessary all the more as it came to our knowledge that in those cases the woman themselves had applied for the interruption of pregnancy and had wanted it themselves and that these abortions could only be carried out on a voluntarly basis. Second. the defense argued that their conduct did not constitute a serious crime. Interruption of pregnancy is or was never considered as murder. but it was considered a special violation against life. Generally this incurs considerably milder punishment than if it were murder. Up to now nobody had the idea to see in this interruption of pregnancy a crime against humanity. It was in response to such attitudes that American physicians warned in the 1940 yearbook of obstetrics and gynocology. that: A physician has a clear duty to preserve human life. but by what principle can one demonstrate that he is the arbiter of life and death and may therefore decide to kill one human being so that another may live? When we approach the consideration of the rights of one human being over the life of another. we are confronted with a problem where the principles we may enunciate may have consequences that will soon extend much farther than we think and lead to results that we would abhor. American physicians continued their disagreement with Nazi policy on abortion in the 1941 yearbook. At the present time. when rivers of blood and tears of innocent men. women and children are flowing in most parts of the world. it seems almost silly to be contending over the right to live of an unknowable atom of human flesh in the uterus of a woman. No. it is not silly. On the contrary. it is of transcendent importance that there be in this chaotic world one high spot. however small. which is safe against the deluge of immorality and savagery that is sweeping over us. That we. the medical profession. hold to the principle of the sacredness of human life and of the rights of the individual. even though unborn. is proof that humanity is not yet lost and that we may ultimately attain salvation. Perhaps some will refuse to see any comparison with the promotion of abortion in order to reduce government expenditures and the promotion of abortion to implement government racial policies. However. there are millions of Americans who do and who are opposed to the use of their tax dollars to promote such a policy. We have heard over and over again on this floor from the proponents of abortion that today we live in a pluralistic society and that they would never think of imposing their particular beliefs upon those of us who do not share them. Well. I can see no stronger means of imposing one persons beliefs upon another person than by requiring that person under penalty of law to finance activity to which he is morally. religiously. and philosophically opposed. If this is the pluralism of the proabortionists then I. for one. want none of it. We must also consider today whether we will force millions of Americans to violate their long tradition of religious morality concerning abortion and force them to finance an act which they believe to be a homicide. Millions of Christians find in the Bible many indications that abortion is contrary to Christian morality. For example. in the first chapter of the Book of Jeremiah. when God called Jeremiah to be a prophet he said: Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee. and before thou comest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee And the Southern Baptist Convention. at its annual meeting this June adopted a resolution which reaffirmedThe biblical sacredness and dignity of all human life. including fetal lifeAnd held that thepractice of abortion for selfish nontherapeutic reasons wantonly destroys fetal life. dulls our societys moral sensitivity. and leads to a cheapening of all human life. The last time we debated this issue. the distinguished Senator from Oregon read into the record the names of various religious organizations which accepted the Supreme Courts ruling on abortion. I do not want to compare figures with him. nor do I wish to debate how many Christians or other religious people may or may not support abortion. That is not the issue. All that I do want to emphasize is that there are millions of people in this country whose fundamental religious morality rejects the practice of abortion. For the Senate to force these people to pay for abortion is to clearly restrain the free practice of their religion. Mr. President. the last time we considered the Hyde amendment many Members of this assembly voiced concern with the propriety of attaching legislative amendments to an appropriations bill. In general. I share their concern and respect the practice of this body not to favor such amendments. However. a procedural rule. such as this one must at times yield to more substantial considerations. We must weigh the efficacy of following this practice with the other goals to be achieved by this amendment. We must balance the goods to be achieved by each course of action. Even our most precious and longstanding constitutional principles admit of exceptions in certain circumstances. Today we are talking about the lives of hundreds of thousands of children about to be born and we are talking about a very positive and straightforward restraint on the freedom of religious practice by the use of the taxing power of the Federal Government. I believe that on balance. an exception and necessary on this occasion to our procedural practice. I thank the Chair. and I yield back the remainder of the time allotted to me."},{"1":"1975","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. I hope that the Andrews substitute to the Fraser amendment will clear the air on the Garrison project. I regret that uncertainty remains on the problem of Canadian objections. Mr. Chairman. although there have been a host of charges and countercharges over many aspects of the Garrison unit project. I think that we should concentrate our consideration on two main areas: the long term and unchanged opposition by our best internationally allyCanada. Mr. Chairman. Canada first voiced doubts over the repercussions of the Garrison diversion in 1970. Since then. the Canadian equivalent of our Environmental Protection Agency has studied the potential polluting effects of the North Dakota irrigation system. and strongly questioned the impact on Canadian waters. The Canadian Parliament voted unanimously to seek a moratorium on the project. and numerous diplomatic exchanges have further illustrated the large concern of our Canadian neighbors. Canadians are concerned that the runoff waters from the Garrisons irrigated lands will pollute at least two rivers that flow into Canada. Despite American assurances. it appears that Canada presently has absolutely no guarantee that the Garrison system will not indeed pollute Canadian water.

Prof. Allan Meltzer in a recent article in Fortune stated that: We do know that no inflation has been ended without reduction in the growth rate of money. and I dont believe we will keep the growth rate of money down If we continue to run deficits. Mr. President. in the face of these hard facts. there is an incredible attempt being made in some quarters to rationalize continued Federal deficit spending. We are being urged not to cut the budget because there is a fear of causing unemployment. We are told that a tough wageprice policy. a vastly expanded public service job program. and a forced reduction of interest rates will cure the ravages of inflation. These suggestions are coming from the same quarter which provided the economic philosophy which brought America its current inflationary dilemma. It appears that they have severely confused cause and cure. Mr. President. in addition to those experts looking for justification for continued deficit spending. we are hearing similar advice from the leaders of organized labor. These selfproclaimed economic experts have recommended a program which could lead only to further inflation and harm the very workers the union leaders allegedly attempt to represent.

I oppose the amendment to exempt employers with fewer than 25 employees from the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. As the ranking minority member of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. I had a great deal to do with the enactment of the law. I hope very much that the Senate will not now act to deprive 20 million workers of its protection. That is what the pending amendment would do. Enactment of the occupational safety and health law was not a matter of legislative whimsy. It was based on our appalling record of industrial accidents and diseases which each year results in 14.000 deaths. over 2 million disabling injuries. and uncounted thousands of illnesses. and the clear showing that this record could not be expected to improve due to voluntary action by business or the States. It bears remembering that despite the intense labormanagement fight over the organizational and procedural provisions of the new Federal law. the interested parties were in complete agreement that a Federal law was necessary. It is also noteworthy that at no time during the consideration of the legislation was the suggestion made to exempt small businesses or any particular category of employment. Now we are witnessing an effort to emasculate enforcement of the law for 20 million employees of small businesses throughout the Nation. The basis for this effort is that the act is too onerous to be applied to small businessmen. Throughout the country. what amounts to a vicious campaign based on unfounded rumors has stirred up fears of small businessmen that the new act will force them out of business. In some areas of the country petitions have even been circulated based on what amounts to a smear campaign against the new Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The Labor Department has investigated many of these charges and the reports of their investigation demonstrate the falsity and viciousness of the campaign which has been mounted.

The Senator from Pennsylvania who was for the first time acting on the Senate floor in the role of ranking minority member of the Employment Manpower and Poverty Subcommittee on a major poverty measure. also had a great deal to do with the effective and expeditious handling of the bill. as did the Senator from Ohio . Although the Senator from Ohio and I differed on certain amendments. his cooperation speeded the measure through the Senate. and he has been a vigorous champion of the committee provisions on legal services which he was so instrumental in developing. I wish to pay tribute to another who also had a great deal to do with the expeditious handling of the bill. That Senator is the acting majority leader. the Senator from West Virginia . who was enormously helpful in moving the bill so rapidly through the Senate. Finally. we must recognize the contributions made to the handling of the bill by the chairman of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. the Senator from New Jersey . I also call attention to and commend the outstanding staff work of the majority staff of the Subcommittee on Employment. Manpower. and Poverty. William Bechtel.

The Senate has once again given evidence of its real concern about this problem. This resolution is very similar to my S.J. Res. 156. to establish an interagency commission to make necessary plans for the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment scheduled for 1972 and for other international conferences and meetings relating to the human environment. which is now in the Foreign Relations Committee.

I thank the Senator for yielding. I. too. join my friend. the distinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island . who. through the years. has done so much and fought so hard in this cause. in commending the distinguished junior Senator from Georgia for the masterful statement he has made and for the significance it carries. As the Senator from Rhode Island was kind enough to note. the Senator from New Hampshire has for long years been deeply interested in this matter. My own State has lost untold thousands of textile jobs We are now losing jobs in the shoe industry day by day. Throughout the years that I have had the honor of serving in the Senate. we have listened to lullabies from Presidents of both parties. I said the other day. and I say it on the Senate floor today. that of all the Presidents under whom I have servedand I respect them allonly Harry Truman. may God bless his downtoearth. fearless. sensible soul. ever told the State Department that it was not the boss. That statement was not particularly made with respect to a matter such as confronts us now. It was made with respect to certain other problems. I talked with President Eisenhower. I talked with those who were close to him. I listened to the fine. honey words. However. when the chips were down. we got nowhere. I well remember when the New England Senators--as my friend. the senior Senator from Rhode Island. will recallmet every week or two and delegated to certain Senators the job of going downtown on certain questions. It was my privilege. when I was a freshman Senator. to go with the then Senator John F. Kennedy to Gordon Gray. in the Defense Mobilization Department in an effort to do something on a kindred subject. We got the usual brushoff. I remember that. on the way back. Senator Kennedyand he fumed about itsaid that New England was getting a raw deal. It was less than 3 years later. when he was President. that I went to the White House with another group to see him. and I took the liberty. in a nice way. as one does with the President. of recalling that incident. He said: Yes. but now I am President. and I have to think of the entire country and its foreign relations. So I have seen all of themEisenhower. Kennedy. Johnsonwhen the chips were down. listen to the State Department in the last analysis. and hold up their hands in holy horror at the idea of our ever asserting ourselves. and of Congress ever asserting itself. so that we would no longer be the only nation on earth that did not. in the form of import licenses. or the like. have some protection for the men and women who work in our industries. Now I shall come to my point. I say to my friend from Georgia: Now we have another President. For many years I have been his friend. We were sworn In as Members of Congress on the same day. I hold him in the highest esteem. I am a member of his party. But I can see the handwriting on the wall. The Senator will understand that it is a Republican who is talking. and I can say a few things that perhaps might have more significance than If my friend from Rhode Island or my friend from Georgia said then. We sat down with Secretary Stans. and he told us about his troubles abroad and of what he was trying to do to protect American industry. He told us about the cordial reception he got. I commend him for it. I am sure that Secretary Stans earnestly. honestly. and forcefully presented our case. He told about the good reception he got everywhereuntil he got to Japan. Then it was not quite so cordial a reception. I could believe him. because in 1959. I went to Japan with the late Senator from Kansas. Andrew Schoeppel. who was then the ranking minority member of the Committee on Commerce. My interest in going to Japan was largely about textiles. I visited Kobe. went through the mills. and saw the best and most efficient machinery that one could find anywhere on Gods earth. Most of it we provided them. Yet. the mills in my own State of New Hampshire were still striving to replace their old machinery and bring it up to date. I had a chance to talk with some of the Japanese textile producers. I found at first hand that they had no more intention of ceasing or curtailing or limiting by voluntary agreement their endeavors to monopolize the American market than they had of surrendering the sovereignty of their own country. to which they are so devotedly loyal. Personally. I am very pessimistic about our getting a voluntary agreement. It is fine for us to talk here. I am deeply impressed by the words of the Senator from Georgia. I am not challenging any Senator. But there is one thing. to be perfectly frank. about which I am getting weary. Every 2 or 3 months. some textile association or some shoe association calls on the phone or drops into the office and says. Senator TALMADGE or Senator PASTORE or Senator HOLLINGS. or some other Senator. is going to take to the floor today or tomorrow and talk about the problem of our closing mills. or about our textile industry or our shoe industry. We hope you will get over there and have a good word to say when he finishes. You can see I got the word. and that is why I am here now. although I am always glad to listen to the Senator from Georgia."},{"1":"1968","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. President Johnson announced today grants of $1.096.000 to the National Council on Aging and $1.129.520 to the National Council of Senior Citizens. The grants are being made by the Department of Labor. These grants are a first major step toward establishing Older Americans Community Service Corps across the Nation. The money will be spent in a number of cities. some of them not yet pinpointed. The aim of both projects is to search out community needs which can be met by elderly people and to find elderly people with the experience or skills required who are willing to devote their time and energy to meeting these needs. During the hearings on the legislation which I introduced. Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz was highly enthusiastic about the idea and said he was not going to wait for legislation. but was going to develop a program on his own. I am delighted that he has done so and that President Johnson has given his endorsement to it. The grants announced today will enable us to begin on a pilot scale. I am confident that experience will show that the program should be established across the Nation. The studies by the Senate Special Committee on Aging and testimony at the hearing on the Senior Community Service Corps bill showed that elderly people are anxious to remain busy and productive. And. we were told repeatedly. they are more than willing to volunteer their time and a lifetime of experience in service to their neighbors. In a few areas. on a limited basis. this is being .done now. Elderly persons are serving as teachers aides. foster grandparents. and in a number of other capacities. And we have barely begun to touch the potential. I was pleased. also. at the Presidents announcement of the funding for Project Green Thumb. It will be doubled next year. This has been one of the few antipoverty projects which has been directed toward the rural poor and the only one. really. solely devoted to the elderly. It has been a remarkable success. In New Jersey. retired residents of rural areas have been hired. part time. to beautify our State highways and do similar work. Reports on the program have been uniformly good. And this has been one antipoverty program which really accomplished what it set out to accomplishsupplement the income of the rural. elderly poor. Some 87 percent of the money appropriated for the program actually went into the pockets of those who participated."},{"1":"1967","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President.

If we go on record of having no pay increases over these upper brackets until we balance the budget. then I believe that we will get a balanced budget. The eloquent Senator from Hawaii pointed out that we have not had a balanced budget since 1960. but we have added four pay raises. One of the virtues of this thing is that it is an incentive. It will not hurt research. It will see that the money vested in research is conserved. that we will then be able to get a balanced budget. and then we shall be able to put on a pay increase."},{"1":"1966","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I know something about pressure.

On October 11. last year. the Senate voted on cloture for this measure. The vote was 45 yeas and 47 nays. So the bill is back again. But the issue is clear. The primary issue is whether States shall continue to have the right to legislate in this field. If the bill ever passes. that right will be gone. and it will be gone for good. It will not be retrieved in our lifetime. There is a secondary issue. and it is whether the States can prevent the application and enforcement of a bargaining contract that will order an employer to fire an employee if at the end of 30 days the employee has not joined the union. This proposal concerns the right to work. to survive. it concerns the right to join or not to join a union. By its action. the House has become a party to it. I think that is greviously unfortunate. But I will be no party to a drive to force. to coerce. to dragoon a free American citizen into an organization against his will.

Why are they out on the frontier of freedom. if freedom is not the spirit that compels them? Two hundred thousand of them are in Vietnam. and now the newspapers are speculating about the number being run up to 600.000. Is it not freedom that sustains them in an anxious and bloody hour? Is it not their hope and belief that as they come back. this will still be a free land. and they will be free from coercion?

The concept of manpower development through retraining.is a basic tenet of the Republican Party. The Manpower Development Act of 1962. was Republican drafted and Republican supported. One of the Republican concepts included in the original bill was the requirement for a FederalState partnership achieved through the medium of matching funds. Under the original act the States were required to provide matching funds in the amount of 50 percent. And this was reduced to 33V3 percent in 1963. This bill reduces this requirement still further to 10 percent and defers its effective date for another year. until July .1. 1966. However. it was only through the efforts of the Republican members of the Education and Labor Committee that even this small percentage of State participation remains. While the Republican policy committee deplores this further erosion of the concept of FederalState partnership through matching funds. we are relieved that at least the principle of matching funds is left intact. We are pleased to note that the bill brings the training program for redevelopment areas now pending in the Area Redevelopment Act under the Manpower Development and Training Act.

This project was initiated following World War II. It has promise of being a very beneficial and useful project. Mr. President. but unfortunately problems have been encountered that have delayed the execution of repayment contracts past the development period. My bill would give authority for water delivery in the division to farmers who want it. Without this authority no water can be released this year. I need not stress the need for a rapid decision on this matter. Mother Nature waits for no man. and todays wonderful weather is an indication that spring is almost here. The farmers in the third division have plans to make and those plans will hinge upon the availability of water from this project for this years growing season. Mr. President. I will not go into the problems that have beset this project except to say that they are problems which can be corrected. My bill would allow for water now while permanent solutions to these problems are being worked out. I might point out that at the direction of the Congress a Wyoming reclamation projects survey team was appointed by the Bureau of Reclamation to study this project and others in my State. This team. made up of highly qualified men. has just completed its study of the Riverton project and submitted a report and recomendations to the Secretary of the Interior. Mr. President. I am confident that with the assistance of this valuable report and with the cooperation of the settlers.

I should like to explain why ostensibly reasonable statistics do not apply in this situation. We have 4 million unemployed. If that be the situation. why should they not take these jobs? Let me explain to you briefly. In the first place. these jobs are highly seasonal. and regular people will not go for these jobs. In our sugar beet areas we have to thin beets. The person who thins beets has to crawl on his hands and knees or he has to stoop clear to the ground. I have thinned beets. and I will say that for hours after my days work was over I could see lights in front of my eyes. It is stoop labor that is almost loathesome. I do not want you to feel when I said our unemployed miners would not take these jobs that I am casting any reflection on the miners. because I am not. I do not blame them a bit. It is one of the toughest jobs you ever saw. and no man who thinks much of himself would ever touch it. So if we had 5 or 6 million unemployed. I doubt if they would come and thin our sugar beets. That is why the unemployment statistics just do not apply to this situation at all. Mr. Chairman. I wonder where we would be for domestic sugar as far as the beet industry is concerned if you take away the Mexican labor? Castro has signed up with Russia for a million tons of sugar and probably with China for a halfmillion tons of sugar. The distribution of land out there might knock Cuba out of producing another million tons of sugar. Now you are going to knock our domestic producers. our beet growers. out of the opportunity to provide this country with sugar. You better think about that before you amend this act. I am certainly in favor of this act as it stands. just a simple renewal for 1 year. The Secretary of Labor must certify that no labor can be obtained for these purposes before any of these nationals may be brought in. I think it is a fine thing for the nationals. too. because they do not have to swim the river. I believe what we spend on the program has been saved in trying to police the river. and prevent the wetbacks from swimming over here. Now they come in orderly under contract. and it is a fine. honorable thing to do.

My company is typical of the average molding manufacturer operating throughout the United States. Molding producers are characteristically small business enterprises. generally located in small rural communities. My concern employs approximately 60 men in a community of less than 4.000 population. We attempt. for our own business success and the stability of the community. to operate on a yeararound basis. Although our product is not entirely seasonal. we do have peaks and lows in demand which create a fluctuation in the selling price of our products. Our minimum wage is now $2.05 per hour with an average wage scale in excess of $2.50 per hour. Being strictly a remanufacturer we purchase our lumber from sawmills on the open market in direct competition with other molding manufacturers. We are not members of any established molding group or organization as none exist. We therefore are on our own completely as individuals to -ise or fall with our own ability in the national economy. I am well acquainted with the problem presented to American producers by Mexican molding. It has been my experience in the past several years.wherever we ran into competition with Mexican moldings. that it was Impossible for us to compete in the same market. As a result. my company has had to withdraw from territories supplied by the Mexican producers and seek markets elsewhere where their competition was not direct. This is so because their prices were so low It was impossible for us to sell and stay in business. This has caused an inevitable depression for American producers resulting in cutthroat competition for AmerIcans competing in these markets. From my standpoint. as a small molding manufacturer. and as a representative of this group. I respectfully urge that the committee give favorable consideration to the Anderson molding amendment. With that testimony as the foundation on which I wish to build my argument. Mr. President. I wish to say that there are American concerns operating molding establishments across the border. and they are operating them with dollaraday labor. Mr.. President. I am not seeking to discriminate against Mexican molding. I am asking that we stop Mexican discrimination against American molding. because we are dealing here with a problem of definition. What we are considering is not raw lumber. it is manufactured lumber. and I think it is perfectly clear that the Tariff Commission in treating it as raw lumber at a dollar a thousand instead of the 17 percent ad valorem tax. has been discriminating against American molding. The Senator referred to my position as chairman of the LatinAmerican Subcommittee. As chairman of that committee. Mr. President. I am not working against the best interests of Latin America when I take the position I assume on this issue. The Senator from Texas would seem to attempt to have Senators believe that because exports to Mexico exceed imports from Mexico. therefore we should not proceed to protect American molding manufacturers who are being discriminated against by Americanowned concerns operating molding establishments with cheap labor across the Mexican border. Mr. President. Mexico needs exports that we ship to her. andshe needs them in order to develop her productive power so that she can export to other countries which receive her exports to a greater extent than they would be able to do otherwise. We must deal with this problem of reciprocal trade. Mr. President. by asking the simple question: Is it reciprocal? I am for reciprocal trade. but reciprocal trade means reciprocity. We do not have an example of fair reciprocity in regard to the particular issue -now before the Senate.

I have just been reading the Chicago Tribune of this morning. and on page 1 I find a statement quoting one of the outstanding Republican statesmen of the Nation. a beloved colleague from Illinois. as saying that if the Democrats were in the White House now they would be boasting about prosperity. Then follows a suggestion that the present recession. which all Americans. regardless of party. devoutly hope soon will clear up. is the product of Democratic imaginations. Then I turn to page 6 of part 2 of the same Chicago Tribune of this morning. and here I find a news article under a headline reading: Riders Losing Jobs. So CTA Is Losing Money. The subheadline reads: Passengers Are Fewer by 12 Percent. The substance of this article is that Chicago Transit Authority. which operates the local transportation system in the city of Chicago. in the month of January failed by $340.459 to meet its January requirement for the depreciation account. which is money that must be set aside for the future replacement of equipment. The Chicago Tribune says that CTA places the blame for this loss on layoffs in industrial plants. pointing out that a considerable portion of the great loss in passengers during January was caused not only by people not having jobs to go to. but by fewer shoppers having money to spend. I quote from the news article by Thomas Buck on page 6 of part 2 of this mornings Chicago Tribune: The CTAs monthly financial statement disclosed that riding in January dropped 12.02 percent to 45.932.834 passengers from 52.210.217 in January of last year. About 9 percent of the loss was attributed to the higher fares that became effective last July. There appears to be no reason other than the plant layoffs to account for the additional passenger loss. said a CTA spokesman. The layoffs also have caused a reduction in the number of shoppers riding the transit system. The biggest loss of riders occurred on surface lines. where January riding declined 12.84 percent to 36.553.184 from 41.938.157 a year earlier. Riding on the L subway system dropped 8.69 percent to 9.379.650 from 10.272.060. Operating and maintenance expenses totaled $9.573.696. which was 1.43 percent less than $9.712.300 in January of last year. The reduction in these costs was attributed to operating economies and a relatively low bill for snow and ice removal in January.

Since that initial session. a number of scientists have appeared before the subcommittee. which is headed by Representative CHET HOLIFIELD of Californias 19th District. to testify regarding the dangers of radiation exposure. These hearings are unique in that they represent the first attempt on the part of Congress to gather and coordinate information on this subject. which is becoming of increasing concern to the people of the United States and of the world as we push forward more rapidly into an atomic era. Although testimony before the subcommittee has been primarily concerned with the effects of radioactive fallout resulting from the explosion of nuclear weapons. important conclusions can be drawn from the evidence submitted regarding the dangers inherent in the use of military and industrial reactors and medical use of radioactive materials. As research progresses in this area. we know that man will risk ever greater perils of exposure to radiation. As sponsor of S. 1228. a bill to establish a National Radiation Health Institute within the Institutes of National Health. I have been particularly interested in the hearings being conducted by Representative HOLIFIELDS subcommittee.

Mr. President. I hope that Congress will heed the advice of this eminent scientist. The peril of radiation exposure is acknowledged.

I have been receiving letters from Republicans in my State denouncing me as an alleged leftist. I am sure that if I had voted against the President. I would have received letters from the same people accusing me of not supporting our great President of the United States. This is not the first time our friends across the aisle have tried to have their cake and eat it too. Only this morning I consulted the hearings transcript on the nomination of Wesley DEwart to be Assistant Secretary of the Interior. I was lectured by some of my friends across the aisle because I opposed Mr. DEwart. inasmuch as I disagree with him on certain vital questions of conservation. Some of my friends across the aisle said to me. On an appointment such as this. the President of the United States is entitled to name a person in whom he has confidence. Lo and behold. some of the same friends who thus lectured me voted against the President of the United States only recently in connection with the nomination of Paul G. Hoffman. On that particular occasion. it did not seem that the President of the United States was entitled to have someone of his own choosing. in whom he has confidence. According to the Congressional Quarterly. during 1955 I voted with President Eisenhower 80 percent of the time on questions of foreign policy. According to the same Congressional Quarterly. one of the Republican Representatives from my State voted with President Eisenhower 25 percent of the time on foreign policy. When I got home that man criticized me for not supporting the great President of the United States. I think it is well to have the RECORD today showand I am glad the senior Senator from Georgia read the Presidents letter into the RECORDthat those of us who are opposing the amendment which has been offered by the minority leader are supporting the policies presented by the President of the United States and his Secretary of State."},{"1":"1955","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Finally. I should like to say that in our labors on the bill we have enjoyed very pleasant working relationship with the junior Senator from California . who finds himself in opposition to the bill. I wish that the good people of his State could have kept their opposition to the bill on the high level on which the distinguished junior Senator from California has kept his. A few days ago I received in the mail the pamphlet I hold in my hand. which refers to a new $4 billion tax burden threatening us. It sets forth the amount of the tax burden which will fall on the various States. I am sure the distinguished senior Senator from Colorado has read this pamphlet. I find that my State will be assessed $15 million of the cost. Arizona will be assessed $20 million of the cost. California vill have to bear $372 million worth of the burden. I mentioned a moment ago that anyone who will take the time to check the experience of the Reclamation Bureau throughout the West. will realize. as does the Senator from Colorado that these vast projects and other prospective projects which are coming along will also be revenueproducing projects. I mention that because in one of these writings it is mentioned that the ArkansasFryingpan project will be helped on its way by the passage of this proposed legislation. While the Senator from Colorado is on the floor I wish to say that I hope to have a final markup of his bill. in which he is so greatly interested. the ArkansasFryingpan project. next Wednesday. We expect to have the bill before the full committee on the following Tuesday. Here. again. is an example of the Federal Government stepping in to do what an individual State cannot do. and making it possible for the people of Colorado to enjoy benefits and to anticipate the population growth which is now ahead of them. I do not wish to discuss the bill which Is coming before the committee. It will be amply discussed on the floor. But one of the purposes of the bill about which the people of California are a little worried is that of supplying water to municipalities in Colorado. One of those municipalities. the city of Colorado Springs. is enjoying an unusual building boom. and the Federal Government. through the utilization of the water. will be able to develop that fine community. Therefore. Mr. President. I welcome the bill which has been introduced and on which hearings have been held. I predict that the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the Committee on Public Works will report favorably on the bill. I believe all these measures. such as the upper Colorado River bill. the ArkansasFryingpan bill. and proposed legislation dealing with districts in California which involve the conservation of water resources. are extremely important and that the attention of the Congress needs to be called to them as we plan the food needs for future years."},{"1":"1954","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Speaker. I have the greatest respect for the gentleman from Virginia and I usually find myself wholeheartedly in agreement with him. However. he has oversimplified the matter which is before the House. Last year in the United States there were 171/2 million people who bought fishing licenses. Most of them wanted to fish for trout. There are 325 socalled trout farms. to which the gentleman referred. 325 in the United States. They are one of the most important sources of supply for restocking the trout streams in this country. Another example of oversimplification: Thirtyone State fish and game commissions wrote to the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee urging the adoption of this legislation. If these 325 small businesses in the United States are forced out of existence. then either the States or the Federal Government will have to replace the production of eggs. fingerlings. and of legal sized trout which are planted in the streams of this Nation. There is another feature to this. We have here a practice which is downright dishonest. All of the manufactured products that come into this country from foreign nations must bear a label on them Made in Japan or Made in. Germany. These trout are shipped in frozen. in great big boxes. and as the gentleman from Massachusetts remarked the other day. you cannot get trout eggs out of a frozen trout. They ship them in these great big boxes. and on the outside of the box it will say Produce of Denmark or Produce of Japan. But. you open up the box. and what does it have inside of it? Individual bundles of trout. And. incidentally. they are not even the same speties of fish that are raised in this country. But. it will say on the package containing maybe a dozen trout. Rocky Mountain rainbow trout. Sierra Mountain trout. Eastern brook trout. a deliberate attempt to deceive the people of this country who want to eat that type of fish."},{"1":"1953","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I propose to support the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kansas . I think that if we have less money than $24.000.000 we probably would be confronted with another bill for additional money. This restoration. in my opinion. Is meeting an obligation made by this Congress in a bill signed by the President of the United States. which became law. The present President of the United States concurs in this activity. It is wrong to make an agreement with respect to funds. then violate that agreement. It has been said here that several cities were not going to get any of this money. I want to assure you that the State of New Mexico which I represent in this House did not ask that one of the largest areas in the United States be taken over by the Army as a proving ground for guided missiles. located at Alamogordo. N. Mex.. where the first atomic bomb was exploded. an area comprising about 90 by 30 miles. I do not think Chicago would want that project. nor do I think any of the other cities want it. There are few places that could have a project of that kind. The ranchers on the project did not want it. So the Federal Government went into the courts. condemned the land and took over. As a result thousands of children came there to go to school. We welcomed them because they came to a State where health is one of the great assets. We are happy to have the children. but very unfortunately we cannot provide the money to take over an impact of that * kind so quickly. I think to deny an education to those children is criminal. If this amendment is not adopted the people of the country have every right to accuse us of bad faith. The committee report actually repudiates an agreement the Congress made 2 years ago. an agreement which the school districts affected accepted in good faith and have. since that time. adjusted their financial arrangements in the belief that the promised Federal payments would be forthcoming in accordance with the terms of Public Law 874. We gave our word. Now we are asked by the committee to break it.. I. for one. cannot be a party to that. I do not impugn the motives of the committee. Apparently it is seeking to make a record of some sort for what it thinks to be economy. There are a thousand places in this widespread governmental structure of ours where sound economy can and must be practiced. but this is not one of them. It means the difference between education or ignorance for thousands of children. It seems inconceivable that this action could have been taken had the committee understood the purpose of Congress in enacting that legislation. Reference was made by the committee to the increase in the number of school districts which received aid during the war and to those who are receiving aid under the provisions of Public Law 874. The Lanham Act provided for deficit nancing and assisted only those school districts which were unable to provide a reasonable level of education without Federal assistance. Public Law 874 had a different motive. Over the years 17 different Federal agencies have been authorized to provide educational assistance for the children of Federal employees. Public Law 874 represented a constructive overall approach to discharge the obligation of the Federal Government resulting from the acquisition of large amounts of real property with the consequent reduction of the tax base of the school districts and an influx of children who were dependents of Federal employees. The cost to the Federal Government is a very small proportion of the amount which would be required to pay the regular assessed school taxes if the federally acquired property had remained in private hands. Whether this law was or was not unwise in all its provisions is not the issue today. Congress assumed the Federal responsibility stated in Public Law 874 over 2 years ago. It cut off all other forms of Federal aid. The school districts involved have adjusted their financial arrangements with the assurance that the Federal payments would be forthcoming in accordance with the provisions of the law. School districts were assisted in the education of 716.380 children in the last year and an increase of about 25 percent is estimated for the current school year. If the $24.000.000 requested is not appropriated. schools for these children must be closed and teachers contracts must be canceled at the expiration of the first twothirds of the school year. There are many school districts throughout the United States. boundaries of which are coextensive with the reservation of a Federal housing project. They have no other means of raising school funds. To fail to appropriate this money will not only mean that the school year will be cut short but also that the school districts will be in debt for the unexpired term of teachers contracts and will be severely handicapped in conducting school next year. The committee report cites one reason for its action which should be ample proof that the committee started with the wrong premise and. consequently. could not reach a sound conclusion. The report states that less than 500 districts received assistance at the peak of World War II and that now 2.300 are receiving it. It could have gone even further back than it did and cite the fact that none received assistance during the Revolutionary War. That would be just as germane to the question at issue here. In my own State of New Mexico. for Instance. the Federal impact due to the defense program is easily three times that during World War II. Millions of dollars worth of property. once on the tax rolls. has been acquired by the Government and the tax payments have ceased. At the same time thousands of children of immigrating Federal defense workers have swelled the school population to the point where there are neither facilities nor money available to educate them. Who is responsible for that? The Federal Government. of course. The Congress recognized that when Public Law 874 was passed. Now we are asked to repudiate that agreement with the people of the school districts from whom we have taken tax income and added to their cost of educating the children. In some cases that cost has been doubled by activities of the Federal Government. I am for every sound economy that can be exercised to save dollars for the taxpayers. but I am not for the false economy that requires the Congress and the Federal Government to break just and equitable commitments that have been made and accepted in good faith. This amendment should be adoptedand unanimously. I would like to take this occasion to say a word of appreciation for the fine contribution made by my esteemed colleague from West Virginia to the support of this amendment. He has made a long and careful study of this subject and I share with many other Members of the House a profound respect for his knowledge and understanding of it."},{"1":"1952","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I have carefully studied the Presidents plan while it was before the Senate committee and have listened to the debate that has been going on in this Chamber. In my opinion one issueand only oneis presented for decision here today. That issue simply is whether this body is willIng to agree to elimination of political patronage in the tax collection system. This Is the real issue in my judgment and no amount of skill or ingenuity in framing technical objections to the plan will hide this issue from the press and the public. Editorial after editorial and columnist after columnist have put this plainly to their readers. particularly in the last few days since the Senate Committee on Government Operations voted to recommend disapproval. The action of that committee has been variously described as cynical. shocking. phony. deceptive. and worse. The almost universal Sonclusion put to the public is that this committee voted to recommend patronage in preference to reform. And the key question is then asked: What will the Senate as a whole do? We must therefore take a stand on the real issue of patronage or reform. Many Senators who have addressed this body have appeared on television and radio. and have made strong statements to the press reflecting shock over the revelations of misconduct in collectors offices. Some of us have devoted a great deal of our time to investigation of this misconduct. We have denounced in the strongest terms disclosures of the involvement of tax administration in local politics. Now we have the opportunity to provide a cure for the known disease. The root of the trouble. it has been revealed in the last months. is the present system of political appointments in the Revenue Bureau. This is the basic source of the record of corruption which has been spread across the papers of the land. We shall never have fair. honest. and equitable administration of the tax laws among all taxpayers 8o long as tax officials feel obliged in making case decisions to listen to the advice or suggestions of the men who have made possible their appointment. As we all know. our tax structure is one of voluntary assessment and collection. This system can be successful only so long as the taxpayer has confidence in the administration of the system. Today the tax burden reaches nearly all people who receive income. Revenue collection is the Nations biggest business. The 55.000.00 taxpayers in this country demand that this business be conducted fairly and honestly among all. Revenue collection by patronage belongs to a past decade when the number of taxpayers and the size of the business were relatively small. With the size and impact of tax collection today we cannot risk sacrificing taxpayer confidence in that system in order to keep some 70 patronage jobs. It is curious. indeed. that there lis been no abuse of office by the 17 career civilservice collectors. It is a source of great concern that 7 of the 47 patronage collectors have gone sour. The Hoover Commission stated that the chief obstacle to effective organization of the Treasury is the patronage system of the Revenue Bureau. Chairman KING. of the House committee investigating tax administration. firmly expressed the view of his committee that political appointment of collectors must be abolished. Former President Hoover personally approved this tax reform. The Citizens Committee fr the Hoovei Report gave its strong endorsement. The House Expenditures Committee voted unanimously in favor of this reform after exhaustive hearings. The House of Representatives voted in favor of the plan by an overwhelming majority. Many other outstanding legislators. private citizens. and public organizations have urged that patronage should be cut out of tax collection. Tomorrow is the traditional deadline for this Nations millions of taxpayers to make their returns. This is the time when the taxpayer is acutely aware of his tax obligation and the obligation of the tax collector to him. Today is the deadline for the Senate to take a step to assure the public that we are determined to do everything in our power to give the taxpayer fair and honest tax administration. It is indeed a fortuitous conjunction of dates that rises up to sharpen taxpayer consciousness of the issue that faces the Senate today. It should also acutely sharpen the awareness of the Members of the Senate of their duty to the taxpaying public. It is incongruous indeed to yell about corruption of collectors and then to evade action to correct the obvious root of the evil."},{"1":"1951","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. fair administration of Executive Order No. 10290 is at best only a theoretical possibility. Our experience with censorship by the military establishment is sufficient proof that the power to suppress information will be abused. That experience indicates that matters having only a tenuous connection with national security acquire. at the very least. a restricted classification. It also indicates that information constantly moves toward higher security classifications making necessary the creation of a host of supersecret categories. We are also aware that the military has used security restrictions to protect itself against criticism which would be of no value whatever to a potential enemy. Mr. President. I have had the experience. as a member of a joint committee of the House and Senate. of having had brought to my office under guard certain information in regard to that committees work and the work of the commission with which it is supposed to be concerned. and then to my amazement. of having picked up a newspaper a day or two later only to find the same thing in the public press. Yet we. as members of the joint committee. were sworn to utter secrecy. I doubt very much if there is at the present time adequate protection and security as to real military secretsnot against spies and saboteurs. because we already know the sordid story of that kind of effort in our own country. but against the release of publicity by the publicitycrazy and hungry representatives of bureaucracy to get their names on the front page of the newspapers. I said a moment ago that many things had been sent to my office. and we have heard many things in committee hearings. which we were pledged in deepest secrecy not to reveal. Yet. I pick up a magazine and find pictures of pilotless bombers. from which the enemy might obtain very definite information. I find information about baby bombs. atomic torpedoes. atomic aircraft. atomic bombers. and atomic aircraft carriers. I say. Mr. President. that instead of an order such as the President of the United States issued last week. which Is really against the public securing information to which it is entitled. there should be a more careful observance of the security laws of the Nation in the field of military science and in the field of atomic energy. The time has come for a more diligent and careful scrutiny on the part of the military leaders of the country. from the Secretary of Defense on down. to see that our enemies do not get information which might be valuable to them and detrimental to our national interests. We all recognize. Mr. President. that classification of information for security reasons by the Defense Department and by the Atomic Energy Commission must be tolerated in spite of the inevitable abusos. The Presidents recent order gives to more than 60 Government departments and agencies the same power to suppress information. It permits more than 2.300.000 Federal employees to be armed with rubber stamps and to impose a total blackout on the activities of the executive branch. The recent OPS order banning disclosure of all information embarrassing to the agency Is a preview of what may be expected unless Mr. Trumans gag order is rescinded by the Congress. President Trumans order has for its precedent the controls over information imposed by the Politburo. Peron. and Nehru. and by the late unlamented Propaganda Minister Goebbels in Nazi Germany. Executive Order 10290 is unworthy of a President of the United States whatever his motives may be. It is an insult to the Congress. to the worlds best press. and to a free people. It is subversive in every sense of the word. As a reason for the Issuance of his censorship order the President states in the third paragraph of the preamble: The furnishing of information to the public about government activities will be facilitated by clear Identification and marking of those matters the safeguarding of which is required in the interest of national security. Mr. Truman does not mean. of course. that the dissemination of information will be facilitated by stamping it secret. confidential. or restricted. Mr. Truman is referring to another type of information known as propaganda. Of course. the furnishing of propaganda to the public will be facilitated if the press and the Congress are rendered unable to refute the self -serving statements of an army of public relations officers. Had Mr. Truman been concerned exclusively with national security. Executive Order 10290 would have been issued in an entirely different form. The sweeping nature of this Executive order suggests that Mr. Truman is more concerned with suppressing information relative to corruption. disloyalty. and the general incompetence which is the trademark of his administration. The following features of the Truman gag order substantiate this fear: First. Ambiguity: Mr. Trumans order does not even attempt to define what It top secret. secret. confidential. or restricted. These definitions are left to the host of bureaucrats who may have reason to evade the healthy spotlight of a free press. Second. Unlimited scope: The order makes no distinction between the security needs of the Department of Defense or the Atomic Energy Commission as contrasted with those of the OPS. Department of Labor. Federal Security Agency. Veterans Administration. the Smithsonian Institution. and other nonmilitary departments and agencies. Third. Unlimited power to delegate au- thority to censor: Section 24 of the Presidents order provides that the head of an agency may delegate the performance of any or all of the functions charged to him. Fourth. No provision made for appeal or review: The action of those who wield the rubber stamps is final. There is no appeal in the Executive order or in law from arbitrary action by anyone who might put that rubber stamp of secret. supersecret. confidential. or anything else upon the propaganda handed down by the various departments. There are some. Mr. President. who will deny any improper motive on the part of the President. Good intentions would not make the Presidents gag order more palatable. Mr. Truman will not administer Executive Order No. 10290. It must be applied and enforced by thousands of Federal employees. Anyone who is familiar with recent decisions of the Supreme Court knows that the problem of reconciling the first amendment with the demands of national security raises extremely delicate and complex issues of constitutional law which are still far from being settled. There are few. if any. Federal employees who are qualified to make an objective. impartial adjustment between the alleged interests of national security and the language of the first amendment. I would oppose Executive Order No. 10290 no matter who occupied the White House. Repeal of this vicious Executive order will simply continue the status quo that we have enjoyed during the past few years. There has been during this year too much restriction on information to the Congress and to the people of the United States. and that. without authority. on the part of the President. I refer to the loyalty order of the President of the United States. as the result of which I have heard high officials of the Government sit upon the witness stand and. when asked about simple facts with regard to records and evidence as to the loyalty of employees of the Federal Government. say. We cannot answer that question because of the Presidents Executive order. My own opinion is that the security restrictions now in force should be relaxed rather than tightened. and particularly in regard to the loyalty order. We cannot. of course. permit the disclosure of military secrets. Too many. however. have been disclosed already. not alone by spies and saboteurs. but by representatives of this Government. However. the loss of some of our most vital secrets has been due to disloyal personnel of the executive branch who conveyed those secrets. not to the American press. but to agents of hostile foreign powers. � If restrictions on the release of information concerning the executive branch should be tightened. the powers of the President should be defined in a carefully worded statute. I have no doubt that if the President honestly describes the defects he sees in the present security system. Congress will cooperate fully in passing necessary legislation. Freedom of the press is too important a subject for careless treatment in a Presidential order. S. 2190 merely provides that Executive Order No. 10290. issued September 24. 1951. is hereby repealed. Several people have asked me about the power of Congress to repeal an Executive order. There is nothing inherently sacred about Executive orders. They are not untouchable. If the time ever comes when an Executive order can foreclose the exercise of legislative power by the Congress. there will be no reason for the existence of Congress. Fortunately the Congress has never doubted its right to repeal an Executive order. provided. of course. that the subject falls within the reach of its constitutional power. In 1947. for example. Congress passed. and the President signed. Senate Joint Resolution 148 providing that after November 1. 1947. the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System shall not exercise consumer credit controls pursuant to Executive Order No. 8843Public Law No. 386. Eightieth Congress. first session. The operation of the Presidents Executive order is confined to internal affairs of the executive branch. There are some who have the erroneous impression that all the internal affairs of the executive branch are outside the sphere of direct legislative action. The Constitution provides that the Congress shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers. and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States. or in any department or officer thereofarticle I. section 8. That is allinclusive. Mr. President. and the powers of any department of the Government. outside those delineated in the Constitution. which has been created by the Congress and its powers given to it by the Congress can be taken away. they can be changed.. they can be amended. or the department can be abolished by action of the Congress. That is where the power lies under the Constitution. Thus. if Congress had the time and inclination. it could prescribe in great detail the duties of every Government employee. In the absence of specific legislative direction. the President can define the duties of Federal employees and delegate authority by Executive order. However. the supremacy of legislation in this field was recognized in the Reorganization Act of 1949 which gave the President. subject to the approval of Congress. limited power to revise the internal organization of the Executive branch prescribed by law. It came about. Mr. President. because of the agitation in favor of putting into effect the reports of the Hoover Commission. Up to the present time. there has not been a saving. I dare say. of $1 in Federal expense as a result of the Executive orders of the President. though it was suggested that $3.000.000.000 might be saved from the regular budget by putting into force and effect the recommendations of that commission. Furthermore. it Is the wrong way to legislate. and I doubt if the Congress of the United States would .ever again give the President the power to legislate and leave the veto power in the Congress. the very reverse of what the Constitution of. the United States provided for. The time will soon come when Congress should repeal the Reorganization Act and take back the authority which the Constitution gives it. We should take it away from the President of the United States. We are not a vetoing authority. We are a policylegislating authority. and the veto should rest in the President. On hundreds of occasions. Congress has exercised its power to regulate the disclosure of information originating in some part of the executive branch. Congress has prohibited the gathering and disclosure of information concerning military facilities owned by the United StatesEighteenth United States Code. section 791. the disclosure of crop information by Federal employeeseighteenth United States Code. section 1902. disclosures of information by bank examinerseighteenth United States Code. section 1906. and the unlawful concealment or removal of Government recordsEighteenth United States Code. section 2071. When we talk about concealment or removal or destruction of Government records. that likewise is provided for in the Presidents order. There is no reason why any Federal records ought to be destroyed so long as they are of any use. The legislative power of Congress is not limited to providing penalties for the unlawful disclosure or concealment of information. In section 10 of the Atomic Energy Act. Congress defined restricted data and directed the Commission to encourage the dissemination of scientific information subject to overriding demands of national securityFortysecond United States Code. section 1810. In creating Government departments and agencies Congress has generally provided for the submission of detailed reports periodically. In addition. Congress has provided that every executive department or independent establishment shall. at the request of the Committee on Expenditures of either House. furnish any information relating to matters within the committees jurisdictionFifth United States Code. section 105a. It would be unthinkable for Congress to admit that information concerning the activities of the executive branch is not within its jurisdiction. It seems reasonably certain- that the Presidents order is not unconstitutional on its face. There is little doubt. however. that the application and enforcement of the order will abridge freedom of the press. and the rights of the citizens under the first amendment. It is futile to expect the courts to act because the improper suppression of information. even if known. could not be presented in the form of a justiciable controversy. It is my hope. Mr. President. that Congress will prevent Executive Order 10290 from taking effect by passing S. 2190 before the end of the present session. Such action would not prevent the President from reissuing an identical order. but I do not believe that he would so openly defy the Congress. After passage of S. 2190. we .ould reasonably expect the President to request appropriate legislation or to issue a new order not inconsistent with the spirit of the first amendment. . Mr. Trumans attempt to lower an iron curtain around the executive branch is no isolated threat to freedom of speech and of the press. Recent efforts to weaken the protection of the first amendment have no parallel in American history. They are infinitely more dangerous than anything attempted under the infamous Sedition Act of 1798. Mr. Truman spoke the truth when he told the American Legion. on August 14. 1951. that the Bill of Rights was in deadly peril. Ironically. all the recent attempts to. undermine fundamental freedoms have been those of the President or spokesmen for his administration. The first and most sweeping threat to freedom is found in the United Nations draft Covenant on Human Rights. The State Department has endorsed article 14 (3). which provides that freedom of speech and of the press may be subjected to such penalties. liabilities. and restrictions as are necessary in the interest of national security. Article 2 (1) of the draft Covenant would permit freedom of speech and of the press to be restricted by Executive order during any national emergency. The dangers inherent in the draft Covenant may be more fully appreciated if we take Executive Order 10290. add penalties. and apply it directly to newspapers and radio stations. . The second threat to freedom of the press arises out of the payment of Federal funds to supposedly independent newspaper and radio commentators. A subsidized press Is the forerunner of a Governmentcontrolled press. It is inevitable. when we launch on that road. that ultimately we shall have a Governmentcontrolled press. A third threat to freedom of the press is indicated in the gratuitous insults which President Truman hurls at publishers who dare to criticize the policies of his administration. Some of Mr. Trumans recent speeches indicate that he is trying to make freedom from political criticism an integral part of the first amendment. A fourth threat to freedom of information is revealed in attempts to prevent military leaders from expressing their views to the Congress or its committees. A fifth threat to freedom of information is revealed in attempts to expand the Lobbying Act. A socalled liberal Senator recently introduced a bill. the announced purpose of which is to regulate modern effective lobbying techniques (which) are directed primarily to the grass roots. where large numbers of influential and rankandfile citizens are reached. The idea that a benevolent government must protect its citizens against lobbying at the grassroots level is drawn undiluted from the manuals of totalitarian rulers. A sixth threat to liberty of the press is found in proposals advanced by Dr. Robert Hutchins. Americans for Democratic Action. and other selfstyled liberals that the Government break up. regulate. or operate alleged monopolies in press. radio. motion pictures. and television. These socalled. selfstyled liberals are the most reactionary politi-"},{"1":"1950","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I rise today to perform the most reluctant duty that has ever been my task in public life. In a time of extreme gravity for the United States. when there is need for decent and full discussion of the issues. I am compelled to discuss matters which never should be the concern of the Senate. and which have no place in American public life. I regret giving public recognition and circulation to this scandalous business. but I cherish the good name and the reputation of myself and my family more than I cherish anything else on this earth. The hoodlum Hearst press has announced a mucker campaign to defile my honor and my public career in a series of newspaper articles to begin the day after tomorrow. Sunday. September 24. This campaign was carefully plotted to start after the Congress was in adjournment. in the belief that I would then be deprived of a proper forum in which to bring the truth before the people of America. It was a typical yellow act of yellow journalism. But the timing was wrong. the Congress is still in session. and I have this forumthe greatest forum in the worldin which to present the facts. The notorious Hearsts have made $100.000.000 peddling pornography and scurrility. They have lowered the standards of the American press and attempted to deprave the taste and morals of the American people. For half a century the Hearst press has poured forth a stream of calumny to besmirch the reputations of the finest public figures in American life. The list of victims is long and honorable: Theodore Roosevelt. Charles Evans Hughes. Woodrow Wilson. Herbert Hoover. Franklin D. Roosevelt. and Alfred E. Smith. It is a mark of honor to be marked along with these men for political assassination. These men fought back against Hearst in defense of their honor. and I shall do the same. Theodore Roosevelt. in a statement issued by Elihu Root. directly charged Hearst with stirring up the public hate and hysteria which led to the assassination of President McKinley. I shall place Mr. Roots statement in this RECORD. I cite a few examples of what Hearst said about the most distinguished men in public life. Hearst called Theodore Roosevelt a woman killer. a flagrant tax dodger. a man who has sold himself to the devil and will live up to the bargain. In discussing President McKinley. Hearst said: Institutions. like men. will last until they die. and if bad institutions and bad men can be got rid of only by killing. then killing must be done. In his finest act of service for the Nation he loved so well. Al Smith drove Hear:t cut of New York State and out of American public life forever. It was Al Smith. the courageous warrior. who personally and alone prevented Hearst from taking a seat in the Senate. For that service Al Smith deserves the highest monument his friends and admirers can erect. It was this Hearst who bought and published. in the late 1920s. the forged Mexican documents which were intended to plunge this Nation into a bloody war with Mexico. These alleged documents charged some of the most distinguished Members of the United States Senate with being in the pay of foreign sources to betray their Government. Those accused included Senators Norris. of Nebraska. Borah. of Idaho. and La Follette. of Wisconsin. among the most distinguished and honorable men who ever sat in this body. A short time after the publishing of these spurious documents Hearst appeared before a committee of this Senate and made a full confession. He confessed that the documents were forged and that his own handwriting experts had told him they were forged. It was the most abject act of selfdebasement in the last century of American public life. But the Hearsts did not abandon completely their forging habits. In the 1944 campaign they secured forged affidavits in an effort to show that Harry Truman had been a member of the Ku Klux Klan. the most dastardly attempt at character assassination in the last 10 years of American politics. The public immediately showed what they thought of the Hearsts by electing Mr. Truman Vice President and later President. The foregoing brief r~sumd is intended to establish the character and moral level of the Hearsts. The Hearsts have now decided that I am to be the principal target of their mud gunners in the coming election campaign. Here is a smear red box appearing on the front page of the JournalAmerican: How did the Connecticut Senator BRIEN MCMAHoN acquire fame and wealth in Washington? What is his connection with the notorious draftdodger. Serge Rubinstein? See Leslie Goulds revealing articles starting in Sundays JournalAmerican. Read for the first time the inside story of atomic energy control. Learn whether the United States has lost its leadership in atomic development. Whether there has been laxity in safeguarding atomic secrets. Starts exclusively in Sundays JournalAmerican. The intent is apparent: the Hearsts intend to shake the confidence of the American people in their atomicenergy project at this crucial period in national life. They will gamble the security of their country in pursuit of their sordid ends. Again I point out that this series of articles was planned to appear after the adjournment of Congress. The Hearsts are completely Fascists in their political orientation. and I earned their undying enmity by sponsoring civilian control over atomic energy as against military control. But I wish to call attention to one sentence in the JournalAmerican smear box. which says it will reveal my connection with the notorious draft dodger Serge Rubinstein. The fact is that I represented Mr. Rubinstein. then a New York businessman. while I was practicing law in Washington before my election to the Senate. I represented a couple of the companies in which Rubinstein had a business interest. and I also represented him personally in an immigration matter. At that time. Rubinstein had an appeal pending on his draft status with General Hershey. the National Director of Selective Service. At that time. Rubinstein had been accused of no crime. but to clear the record. I wrote General Hershey in the plainest language the human tongue can devise to advise him officially that I had no connection with Rubinsteins draft case. I said: For the purposes of keeping the record straight. I wish to inform you that this firm has not represented Mr. Rubinstein in his draft matter. The reference is to my law firm. Some years later. after I had severed all my law connections and taken a seat in this body. Rubinstein was convicted in connection with allegations made in his draft statement. He was ably prosecuted by the law enforcement officials of this Government. Since then he has been released from jail and is again under indictment by Federal authorities. The record shows that the Rubinstein case was conducted honestly. ably. and efficiently. by the law enforcement agencies of this Government. The Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives. during the Eightieth Republicancontrolled Congress so found when it looked into the matter in pursuance of a resolution that undoubtedly had its inspirations in the machinations of Mr. Gould. The record shows also that I never had the slightest connection with Rubinsteins draft case and that I so stated in official communication to the proper authorities of this Government before a single criminal charge was ever preferred against this man. And the record shows more than that. For more than 2 years. the Hearst JournalAmerican has scandalized me in written articles from time to time. by printing the fraudulent charge that I intervened for Rubinstein in his draft difficulties. Imagine the absurdity of this charge in view of the fact that he received a 21/2 -year sentence to the penitentiary. In December of 1948. I summoned William R. Hearst. Jr.. to my office. gave him all the facts. and told him the complete record was available for publication in his newspaper. He gave his solemn pledge to me in person. and later in writing. that he would bring the writer of these articles. one Gould. a crooked Wall Street scribbler. to my office to go over the record. Hearst broke his pledged word. Instead. in February of 1949. this mucker Gould. who has been connected with so many shoddy stock manipulations in New York financial circles that no one can keep track of them. again printed a scandalous article attempting to link me to Rubinsteins draft case. I then wrote the letter to Hearst which I read now: DEAR SIR: Goulds column has been brought to my attention. You lied to me. You pledged your word. persona.ly and in writing. that before more such columns were published. you would bring Gould to my office to see what you have seenpositive evidence to prove the utter falsity of his charges. This letter is to establish the record. I have in my files a letter written by me in 1943 to General Hershey. serving formal notice that I had nothing to do with the Rubinstein draft case. Also. in my files. there is a letter written by me in August 1948 demanding a thorough investigation of the Rubinstein case and the Hearsts. Also. a reply from General Hershey in which. among other things. he again acknowledged receipt of my letter written in 1943. This correspondence is available for publication in full in your newspapers. whenever you wish to place the truth before your readers. Meanwhile. I have not been idle and neither have my friends. This renewed effort to blacken my character will not go unchallenged. I have pledges of vigorous support. both within the Senate and outside the Senate. Organizations of veterans. organized labor. and civic groups which your newspapers have defamed. stand ready to back me to the limit. You will be hearing from some of them shortly. You caught me at a very busy moment. I am engaged in honorable pursuits with honorable men. and I dislike intensely to be diverted by a pipsqueak like Gould. But I am prepared to see this thing through. Meanwhile. this is an interim reply to Goulds column. for publication in the JournalAmerican. Sincerely yours. The letter was signed by me. Fellow Senators. here is a complete test of Hearst honor. That letter was never answered. Hearst never published that letter in the JournalAmerican. and he never brought Gould to see the documents offered for publication in his newspaper. Hearst pleaded guilty by evasion. Does this meet the high standards of American newspaper ethics? Instead. he preferred the cowardly way. the usual Hearst way. by waiting until now. when he felt Congress would be out of session to besmirch and destroy my good name and reputation. In the summer of 1948. the Hearsts were carrying on their smear campaign against me in full vigor. I wrote General Hershey formally calling upon him for a sweeping investigation of the Rubinstein case and the draft records of the sons of William Randolph Hearst. These men. now high officials in the Hearst organizations and leaders against me in their current smear campaign. were healthy. wealthy. and well within the age limits when the United States was fighting for its life in World War II. For years in their sordid newspapers. the Hearsts have advocated universal military training for every American boyapparently. for everybody except the Hearsts. The Hearsts pleaded to their draft boards that they were needed at home to support their families. Apparently $100.000.000 is not enough. General Hershey replied that he was proud of his record in Selective Service. that there was no reason to investigate the Rubinstein case. and that he would surrender the Hearst records on subpena by a committee of Congress. I place in the record my letter and General Hersheys reply."},{"1":"1949","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I do not come from an agricultural area. but I look at this as a matter of law.

I congratulate the Senator from Georgia for leading the movement to preserve the soilconservation program. In my State the program has obtained splendid results. Much of our soils in Texas are black land which is easily eroded. Floods wash down hillsides and absolutely destroy the fertility of the soil. I have a small farm. and I was early impressed with the necessity of taking measures to preserve its soil. As long ago as 1925. 23 years ago. I had my farm terraced. The results were absolutely astonishing in preserving fertility and increasing production. I think it is absolutely vital to agriculture and to our whole economy to rebuild the soils which have been washed away. They can be rebuilt. My experience in Texas has been that in connection with a number of different phases of the question. farms which had been practically destroyed and washed away have been terraced and. under the methods of the agricultural program. have been rebuilt and made fertile and productive. I heartily commend the Senator from Georgia upon his remarks today."},{"1":"1947","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. the final action on H. R. 1 will be taken here today when the conference report is adopted. I realize that this is probably the best result that can be obtained at this time. Naturally. I have been in favor. of H. R. 1 as it left the House in the first instance. The change from January 1 to July 1. 1947. is not in accord with my views. but inasmuch as almost all legislation is a matter of compromise I believe that the conferees on the part of the House did all that they could do to relieve the taxpayers of any portion of their tax in 1947. Personally. I believe that it would be much better for the country if H. R. 1 as the House enacted it could have been put into effect. because it would n6t only relieve the taxpayers from a terrific burden but it would -release venture capital and thus provide an incentive for new enterprise with ever increasing pay rolls. I want to call attention to- a fact that must not be overlooked in adopting tax legislation. I refer to the importance of furnishing more jobs and more pay rolls to provide opportunity for the ever increasing flow coming from. our high schools and colleges. I shall only take one instance which shows the constant need for an increase in the development of new enterprise. I note in Sundays paper that there are 29.000 students In Minnesota University. When it is considered that our universities all over the United States are bulging with students and that an army of students will enter the businiss and professional and industrial world. it is highly important that new enterprise be developed to absorb this great mass of young people. Then there are the boys and girls graduating from schools all over this land they. too. -must find their place in private enterprise if this country is to expand. I was very much impressed with the statement made by H. W. Prentis. Jr.. president of the Armstrong Cork Co.. Lancaster. Pa.. in an address delivered on November 20. 1946. before the one hundred and fiftyeighth dinner of the Economic Club of New York. I take pleasure in quoting from his reremarks under the heading Present taxes discourage individual initiative: Here are three married men--each with two childrenresiding in New York. The first earns $10.000 a year. spends $7.750 for living expenses. pays $1.825 in Federal and State income -taxes. and saves $425 per annum. The second receives $15.000 a year. spends $10.200 for his familys living. pays $3.585 in income taxes. puts aside $1.215 per annum. The third enjoys earnings of $20.000. spends $11.950 for living expenses. pays $5.745 In income taxes. and saves $2.SO5 per annum. Living costs in each case have been carefully estimated item by item. If the $10.000 man invests his entire annual .savings of $435 regularly every year with compound: Interest at 2/2 percent. it will take him 36 years to accumulate enough to leave his family a net estate of $20.000after paying modest funeral and legal expenses and the New York estate tax of approximately $200. If the $15.000 man invested all his yearly savings with compound interest at 2Y2 percent. he would have to work 34 years to provide a net estate of a little over $50.000 for his widow. the $20.000 man. 37 years to leave approximately $100.000 to his dependdents. Note too that all three of these men. if they died at 65. would have had to reach their maximum earning levels at the comparatively early ages of 29. 31 and 28 years respectivelya situation which would be the exception rather than the rule. No provision for life insurance was made in any of these .cases so that all would remain on the same comparative basis. Invested at 3 percent. the first mans widow would receive the munificent annual income of $600. the seconds. $1.500. the thirds. $3.000all subject to income taxes at prevailing rates. Now one of the finest instincts of a normal man is his desire to provide for the future security of himself and his family. Hence. the present tax laws. which strike at the very roots of personal incentive. should rightly be a matter of deep concern to every thoughtful American. People generally do notrealize what has been done to them in the past. 10 years. With income and estate taxes and interest rates at their present levels. it is virtually impossibleas these figures showfor a young man starting at scratch to accumulate a competency for his old age and that of his family after he is gone. The present personal Income taxes. corporate taxes. the capital gains tax and the everpresent threat of taxes on accumulated surplus combine to encourage the integration of existing. closely held family enterprises with larger corporations. and simultaneously make the development. of similar small businesses in the future a wellnigh insurmountable task. So all that even an exceptionally able man with no inherited capital behind him can look forward to in America tomorrow is perhaps a little more than the pittance provided by the Federal oldage pension system. We should never forget that. While the welfare of the socalled common man is of vital importance. it is only through the intliative and ingenuity of the uncommonly gifted individual that the general wellbeing can be further advanced. The bill as agreed upon in conference brings some relief to all classes of taxburdened people and it does release some money In the way of venture capital. but it does not In my opinion go far enough in respect to either of these important factors. I am hoping to see the long range tax bill. upon which hearings are now being held. solve a multitude of problems which have long been delayed because of the war and unlimited spending. even prior to the war. Wemust not overlook the investment required to create a job. Pay rolls require a vast investment in each individual workers job. It is easy to demagogue on a tax measure. but to do so is dangerous to free enterprise. I insert some realistic information relating to jobs: A study by the Twentieth Century Fund estimates that aggregate investment of new capital in commerce and industry. transportation. urban development and rural development may exceed $280.000.000.000 in the next 15 years. exceeding $18.000.000.000 annually. The Chamber of Commerce of Gastonia. N. C.. and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States recently cooperated in a case study of Investment Per Job in that community. This survey revealed an average investment in fixed and working capital per worker in Gastonia manufacturing industries of $8.000 in food processing. $3.941 in apparel and finished products. $3.850 in beverage bottling and $2.179 in textile mills. In distribution and service industries. the investment per job varied from $45.762 for cotton merchants. $9.000 in warehouses. $8.385 in furniture. and $7.200 in automobile repair to $2.357 in barber shops and $1.567 in cleaning shops."},{"1":"1946","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I wish to invite the attention of the able Senator from Ohio to subclause (2) on page 2. which defines the checkoff.

The Metals Reserve Company. a subdivision of the R. F. C.. has just signed a new contract with the Aluminum Co. of Canada. to purchase another 250.000.000 pounds of aluminum. The Aluminum Co. of Canada is the Canadian front for the giant American aluminum trust. Alcoa. That fact alone is deeply disturbing. and particularly so when all accompanying facts are marshaled to stand beside it. We certainly are not so narrow in our views that we would protest the purchase of needed and vital war materials from a company located within the boundaries of an ally. Certainly there is no Member of this Congress who would be so shortsighted as to insist that we cut off our war supplies because we do not want a monopoly to produce them. What is wrong with what is commonly referred to as the Shipshaw deal is that it is stifling the American aluminum industry. It is risking at least $50.000.000 of taxpayers money invested in the Pacific Northwest alone. It will cost us $10.000.000 more for aluminum than we could produce it for ourselves. And this vast wastage comes atop an outright loss of at least another $65.000.000or possibly $100.000.000already invested in uneconomic aluminum plants whose location in highcost power areas can only be understood as having been dictated by those who wanted to protect Alcoa from real postwar competition. Now. the Shipshaw contract has been extended. This renewal may cripple the postwar prospects of at least one entire section of our Nationthe Pacific Northwest. That is not the concern alone of us who come from that section. If one section suffers. the Nation suffers. If monopoly is aided to stifle free enterprise for potential competitors. our whole economic system becomes more unworkable. and our 60.000.000 postwar jobs program becomes unrealizable. . Not the least objectionable feature of this contract is that it comes at the very moment when the circuit court of New York. in a final decision. has branded the vast aluminum empire of Alcoa a monopoly and ordered its dissolution after the war if competition is not by that time firmly established. � The entire Shipshaw deal. originated and engineered by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Metals Reserve Company under Jesse Jones. is a national scandal. I see no reason now that a scandal left by Jesse Jones should be perpetuated after he himself has left US. Mr. Speaker. so vital is it to this Nation to win this war as quickly as possible that most of us excuse almost any act if it will help defeat the Axis 1 day sooner. If it could be shown that this 250.000.000pound contract with Aluminum Co. of Canada. a wholly owned subsidiary of a corporation whose stock is held by the same stockholders who control Alcoa and dominated by the same 11 individuals who rule American aluminum production. is essential to victory. or will bring that victory a single hour sooner. there would be. no logical ground for protest. With this in mind. a week ago I urged the Senate Small Business Committee. which has been investigating the lightmetals industry. to look thoroughly into this contract. � After an exhaustive study of my own I have reluctantly concluded that the extension of the Shipshaw contract cannot longer be excused on the basis of the war urgency. that the extended contract must be canceled. and our own Governmentowned plantsunder private management the potential postwar competitors of Alcoabe given the opportunity to produce this needed aluminum. Let me review some of the facts which have come to my attention. I know that I do not need to detail the great solicitude which we have previously shown for the Aluminum Co. of Canadathe Alcoa of our northern neighbor. My esteemed colleague the gentleman from the Sixth District of Washington has ably exposed this solicitude long before I was a Member of this Congress. In April of 19432 years agomy colleague introduced a resolution to investigate Jesse Jones assistance to Alcoas Canadian front. He presented a startling array of facts. Repeatedly since then the gentleman from Washington and other able Members have detailed the way in which the Defense Plant Corporation and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation gave more than $68.500.000 of our taxpayers money to the Aluminum Trust in Canada. and how the 11 stockholders owning a majority interest in both the American and Canadian companies got from the D. P. C. and R. F. C. here. and from the Canadian Government. a $300.000.000 aluminum plant at Shipshaw. in Canada. for an investment of only $15.000.000 of their own money. We loaned the $68.500.000 interestfree. We arranged to give the principal. too. through prices enough more than what we paid any American producer so that all of the original $68.500.000 would eventually come out of our pockets. That. original deal might have been Justifiable because the only people who knew how to produce aluminum were the ones we had permitted to monopolize 90. percent of the virgin ingot business through the years before the war. But did we help potential competitors of Alcoa on the same favorable terms? We did not. We gave them no interest free money. What the R. F. C. loaned American competitors of Alcoa was at 4 percent interest. We gave no American producer specially high prices to help him repay the principal. While we were paying Alcoa of Canada 17 cents or more a pound for aluminum. we rigidly demanded 15 cents a pound as a ceiling from American competitors of the aluminum trust. At this same time. we were putting $271.000.000 of American money into Defense Plant Corporation aluminum plants of our own. Who chose the sights for these plants. I do not know. But anyone who will aquaint himself with the problems of aluminum production can easily discover that every time you add one mill to the cost of electric power at an aluminum plant. you add a cent a pound to the cost of producing aluminum. For it takes 10 kilowatthours of power to produce 1 pound of aluminum. This fact must have been known to those who located our American plants. Yet. they put: A $33.000.000 plant at Maspeth. N. Y.. where power costs 6.5 mills. A $19.900.00 plant at Massena. N. Y.. where power costs 6.5 mills. A $17.000.000 plant at Burlington. N. J.. where power costs 6.5 mills. Consequently. the cost of production at these plants. all of which were later closed. was 16 cents or more a pound. The selling price was 15 cents a pound. Thus. we lost on every pound produced. from the day the site was picked for these plants. we were destined to lose. The gentlemen from New York and .*from New Jersey are as interested in this problem as any of us. because they now have in those sections D. P. C. plants which cannot produce aluminum at an economically sound price. and are therefore only $65.000.000 junk piled when it comes time to interest private investors in them for postwar developments. While these mistakes were being madeand through them Alcoa was being assured of no real competition from such highcost plants in the postwar world aheadthe D. P. C. did locate In lowcost power diftricts. other aluminum plants. We in the Pacific Northwest are blessed with an abundance of hydroelectric power. and we have had the visionand this administration and Congress has had the vision. to develop that power through Grand Coulee and Bonneville. We hope to develop it further through a Columbia Valley Authority. It was this power which gave to us in the Northwest ideal locations for aluminum plants. Alcoa and Reynolds. the only private competitor the monopoly has and one which came into existence without benefit of special Government aid such as we granted to Alcoas Canadian.counterpart. took advantage of this situation. Alcoa has a plant at Vancouver. Wash. Reynolds located a plant at Longview. Wash. I The Defense Plant Corporation also Invested $50.000.000 in Northwest plants. One at $23.500.000. in Spokane. one. at $19.600.000. in Troutdale. Oreg.. and one at $6.554.000. at Tacoma. Wash. All of these plants benefit from our cheap Northwest power. the cheapest power in this Nation at 2 mills. As a consequence they did produce. and are producing aluminum at from 10 to 11 cents a pound. and they returned to this Government. when they produced at capacity. between $14.000.000 and $15.000.000 a year in profits. South along the Pacific coast. which also has hydroelectric power. although at a price nearly double that in the Northwest. two other plants were located. a $13.000.000 plant at Los Angeles and a $8.000.000 plant at Riverbank. Calif. With the higher power cost. these two plants could not return a profit to the Government. but they could. and did. produce aluminum for the war at virtually cost. For nearly 3 years now. there has been rightful agitation to locate an alumina plant at tidewater in the Pacific Northwest. Aluminum is made froma white. flourlike substance. known as alumina. chiefly produced from bauxite. The D. P. C. erected two alumina plants. one at Hurricane Creek. Ark.. at a cost of $39.045.000. and one at Baton Rouge. La.. at a cost of $28.567.000. The Baton Rouge plant hardly got into operation when it was closed. Had this plant been located at tidewater in the Pacific Northwest. or had it been removed there. or had a new plant been erected to supply the 2.000 tons of alumina which the Northwest plants consume a day. the investment would have been paid off in freightrate savings in 3 years. Meanwhile. there was being developed a process of extracting alumina from Northwest clays. Five small pilot plants. to experiment in the production of alumina from clay. were authorized. Today. we slill await the operation of such a plant at Salem. Oreg. Had full attention been given to the production of almuinum under these circumstances on the Pacific coast. we could have already saved millions of dollars during this war in terms of returned profit from lowcost production. We could have regained the more than $50.000.000 of Government investment in western aluminum plants through sale to willing private investors. And we would have laid the ground work for a great new light metals industry. armed and prepared to assume its role of a competitor with the great giant. Alcoa. in the postwar world. We would have contributed toward the prosperity we seek. and the 60.000.000 jobs we are pledged to attain. Butno! Last August came the pronouncement that we had aluminum running our of our ears. D. P. C. ordered cutbacks all along the line. Riverbank and Los Angeles plants were closedadded. at that moment. to the $65.000.000 junk pile of eastern plants. Two pot lines at Troutdale were closed. Two were closed at Spokane. Last month one .of these pot lines at Spokane reopened. No effort was made to bring to the Northwest an alumina plant of any type. Yet. men of visiqn.must know that a nearby source of alumina would be profitable to the Governments operation now. and will be essential to the postwar disposal of Government facilities without great loss. With the war in the Pacific gathering in velocity. it is criminal to clog our badly pressed railroads to the coast with shipments of alumina from Arkansas which could be made cheaply in the Northwest. The shocking fact Is that if those cutbacks in the Pacific coast production of aluminum had not been made last August. America would by this time have produced 25 percent more aluminum than is called for in our contract with the Canadian Alcoa and at a saving fqr our taxpayers of 4 cents on every one of the 250.000.000 pounds just authorized. If the R. F. C. would cancel that new contract and reopen the Northwests pot lines. which it should do. we could produce in our own country within 6 months the amount the contract with the Canadian monopoly demands. In cold dollars. at 4 cents a pound. we would save $10.000.000. and on every penny of that 4 cents a pound saving. this Government would receive 85 percent. of the profit. in accordance with the terms of its contracts with the operators of D. P. C. plants. It is not a question of giving the contract to Canadas Alcoa or not having aluminum for the war. We can produce what we need by operating the Plants we have already built with Government funds. We can get it cheaper. At the same time. we can preserve the Government investment in out own efficient. lowcost plants ind make them more attractive for postwar disposal to private interests. Alcoa has just been held by the Circiit Court of New York to be a monopoly operating in violation of the Sherman antitrust law.. Alcoa has just been told that after the war it must dissolve unless it is by that time no longer the sole source of virgin ingots in this country. Aluminum. Ltd.. In Canada has just been found to have actively participated In the organization of an illegal world cartel. The disposition of D. P. C. aluminum plants. especially those which can produce economically and in competition with Alcoa. must not be prejudiced now by further contracts with AlUminum. Ltd.. especially when the aluminum we need wecan get by :operating .the facilities we have built ourselves. The future of this great industry. the future of the great aviation industry. the future of the people who have come to the Northwest to work in our mighty war plants there. the future of private Investors who look to the beginnings of light metals production in that great. rich area. and more generally. *the future of our whole country. free from the restrictive effects of monopoly. un- shackled from world cartels. are all iivolved to some degree in the R. F. C.s most unwise extension of the Shipshaw contract. It should be immediately canceled and the Northwests plants should be put to work at full blast."},{"1":"1944","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Speaker. the Boulder Canyon Dam was built for a great purpose. It was built for the purpose of holding back the waters of the Colorado River and also for the retention of silt. To the best of my knowledge. the Colorado River carries more silt by several times than any other great river in the world. The Boulder Canyon Dam provides for the retention of 1.400.000 acrefeet of silt in the next 50 years. If it were not for the Boulder Canyon Dam. the delta land lying in Mexico would be overrun by destructive floods nearly every year. To that extent. of course. the works of the Boulder Canyon Dam benefit Mexico. There are other benefits proposed. but in the course of this treaty we find that the United States. as provided in article 12. is to build a regulating dam. known as Davis Dam. at a point between Boulder Dam and Parker Dam. Of course. that project was authorized by the Congress in the enactment known as section 9 of the Reclamation Project Act of 1939. It was provided that the cost of that dam should be recovered to the Federal Government through the sale of power to the people in the United States. all of the costs of that dam being allocated to power. The repayment to the Government is expected to take place in 40 years at 3percent interest through the sale of power. None of the funds being expended on that dam have been allocated to the purpose of river regulation. Approximately $7.000.000 has already been appropriated by this Congress for the purpose of building the Davis Dam. Crews were working in pursuance to a contract let to the Utah Construction Co.. and the work was stopped by orders of the War Production Board in December of 1942.. That matter. of course. is still pending. The Davis Dam is considered in this treaty as part of the works that are agreed to be constructed by the United States for the purpose of providing a regulated flow of water to the United States of Mexico. Yet at the same time the people who are to purchase the power from the Davis Dam will be required to repay to the Federal Government the entire cost of that dam. An estimate furnished to me this morning by the Department of the Interior indicates the cost of the Davis Dam. on a prewar basis. would be $41.200.000. all of which amount the users of power would be obligated to repay to the Federal Government in the price of electrical energy. Mr. Speaker. I hold in my hand a memorandum on behalf of the Committee of Fourteen of the seven Colorado River Basin States and I desire to call attention to certain matters that they have set forth in this report. I desire to place in the RECORD at this point a number of points raised by the Committee of Fourteen. for the perusal of the Congress. There is one matter contained on page 70 of this report that I should like to read: The United States has conducted the Boulder Canyon project and the local agencies have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the construction of their facilities on the faith .in the provision in the Boulder Canyon Project Act that the stored waters of the Colorado River are for beneficial uses exclusively in the United States. Any material allotment to Mexico of stored water would amount to partial repeal by a treaty of the most important provisions of this act. Elsewhere it points out in this report that every drop of water that is sent over the line into Mexico would decrease the amount of available water in the United States and thereby cause the future development of that much land in the United States to be retarded. if not absolutely prevented. whereas the United States of Mexico would achieve additional development fay beyond anything historical from the use of the water. It is well known that water to the West is as dear as life itself. Without water there is no life. That is one of the reasons. or the principal reason. why we have come before the Congress in the past asking for the cooperation of the United States through the Congress in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution to enable us to better utilize this water. In so doing we have guaranteed to repay those moneys advanced by the United Siates pursuant to acts of Congress and are repaying those moneys to the United States faithfully. It is no expense to the United States whatever. It is an expense to our people who use the water and the power. and we are proud to repay the advances with interest. Mr. Speaker. I believe that the matter is fully set forth in the remarks which I have made. I would like to recall to the House once more in conclusion paragraph 2 of section 3. article IV of the Constitution of the United States of America. which provides: The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States. and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims of the United States or any particular State."},{"1":"1943","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. it seems to me it would be unfair to the report to attempt to summarize it. For the same reason. I hesitate even to speak particularly of any excerpts. I prefer that Senators should read the complete documents. and I assure them that they will find it well worth their while. But I hope I am justified in emphasizing the general trend of the findings and recommendations made by Mr. Baruch in view of the large confidence which the country rightly has in his ability and his patriotism. While the Baruch report deals specifically only with a serious manpower shortage in west coast aircraft manufacturing plants. it bears relatively upon the manpower situation as a whole andas it itself asserts from time to timeoffers a key to greater efficiency in the war effort throughout the country. The Baruch report starts from this premise: Proper handling of manpower has been made -impossible by the failure of Government agencies to work as a team with a clearly defined program. Measures -undertaken by one agency have been undone by the conflicting actions or inactions of other agencies. In discussions with officials of the War Production Board. War Manpower Commission. and other agencies we have Eought to develop a program on which all agencies can agree and take action at once and one which will work. The Baruch report thereupon proceeds to make its specific recommendations dealing with the attainment of these objectivesan attainment which Director Byrnes correctly says has been substantially embraced in his directive of September 4 respecting the west coast manpower problem. After dealing with the necessity for dependable deferments for all necessary aircraft workers. and the need for the continuing use of highschool boys and girls in the production lines. the Baruch report asserts that the Demand for labor and supply are hopelessly out of line and that a breakdown canbe avoidedonly by the concerted action of all agencies behind a plan that goes to the root of the trouble. Thereupon the report outlines the need for labor priorities and develops in adequate detail a socalled labor budget plan which is aimed to correct this difficulty. This labor budget plan calls for decentralized administration under local auspices and makes this pertinent observation: The time must end when agencies spend their energies battling to build up empires of power. It is time to reassert the fact that there is one Federal Governmentspeaking with one voicenot a centimouth. The report thereupon lists these further sources of menace to the maintenance of adequate manpower in essential war production: 1. Reduce the alarming turnover of workers. 1 2. Enlist every possible source of new labor. 3. Curtail less essential activities. 4. Step up efficiency of labor already in plants. 5. Minimize the disruptive effects of the draft. 6. Combat the hoarding or waste of labor. 7. Improve management. 8. Reduce demands on the labor supply. The report deals specifically with each of these necessities. It admits that all through the country. much labor is being hoarded or poorly utilized. and particularly condemns the prevailing costplusfixedfee contracts as encouraging these wastes. I think I should quote the following language: Under these contracts the Government pays all costswhatever they are. Since the Government is footing the bill. there is no incentive for manufacturers to economize in the use of materials. facilities. or labor. More workers are hired than are needed. Workers may stand idleit costs the manufacturers nothing. Much labor is wasted. The report thereupon constructively discusses the advisability of promptly developing not only incentive wages for labor but also incentive contracts for producersand it adroitly suggests means. for linking up both types of incentives with the postwar era. Meanwhile. it says: Until now the energies of Government have been directed principally at reducing the 5. 10. or 15 cents of a production dollar that goes into profits. While not relaxing our efforts to prevent profiteering. it is time we turned our attention* to reducing the 85. 90. or 95 cents of the production dollar represented by costs. The report suggests the furloughing of key industrial workers back from the Army into industry. It warns that what it calls premature peace jitters are already threatening an adequate realization of the production job and the military needs still remaining. It condemns too man3 investigations by congressional committees which overlap each other. although it insistently defends the importance of congressional inquiry. It particularly condemns the utterly enormous paper work required by the Government and costing manpower sadly needed for more productive enterprise. What I have said is merely a key to the contents of the report. I repeat that the report should be fully read so that It may wholly speak for itself. But I have wanted to say enough to indicate the high importance .of the report as it affects the general manpower problem of the country. and I want to express the belief that if its general theme can be translated into general actionas Director Byrnes has already done in certain instances on the west coast through his directive of September 4we shall greatly simplify our problem and find it much easier to meet. I wish again to commend Director Byrnes for his prompt and unequivocal response to my request for the publication of the Baruch report and for his swift adoptionat least in one regionof some of its major recommendations. But the report still contains much unmined gold. and it is richly worthy of prompt and intensive study by all concerned in the manpower problem. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the exhibits requested by Director Byrnes to be fully extended in the RECORD be printed in the RECORD at this point."},{"1":"1942","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Yes. I shall be glad to. I wish to make a brief explanation of the conference report. When the House passed this measure which has to do with housing and public works. or community facilities. in the metropolitan area of the District of Columbia. it authorized an appropriation of $50.000.000 for these two purposes. made necessary by the influx of defense workers into Washington. After the bill was passed by the House. the President issued under the War Powers Act an Executive order placing defense housing under the control of the National- Housing Agency. and placing the public works. or community facilities. in the congested defense areas under the control and supervision of the Federal Works Agency. The bill was amended in the Senate to (.c.:form with the provisions of that Executive order and the conference report is in accordance with those provisions."},{"1":"1941","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. we continue to legislate for national security and to appropriate unprecedented sums for national security. Security for America and victory for democracy will be won on the production lines and In the factories of America. There continue to be stoppages of work on the production lines and in the factories and in the industrial life of America. I am happy to report to the House that one of the strikes led by Communists which threatened for a time to tie up the entire production of planes on the west coast has ended. but I think the House should know something further about the men who led that strike. I want to show the kind of people who were prominent leaders in the strike at the Harvill plant in Englewood. Calif. Happily. that strike was concluded yesterday. but the record of two of the strike leaders is still of the greatest importance. When we ask patriotic managers of our American defense industries to bargain collectively with socalled labor leaders such as Kenneth Eggert and Ralph Dawson. we are making a shameful request. It has already been stated on this floor that Kenneth Eggert. one of the leaders of the Harvill strike. was until recently the section organizer for the Communist Party in Toledo. Ohio. Eggert was sent to the Pacific coast by the Communist Party for the express purpose of sabotage in the aircraft Industry. Early this year. Eggert attempted to conceal his identity by changing his name to Eckert. He went so far as to cbtain automobile license plates in Ohio under the name of Eckertto be more exact. under the name of Ken F. Eckert. He then traveled to California in an automobile bearing license plates issued in that name. His Ohio license plates bore the number 9900C. The Dies committee has obtained still more illuminating information concerning this man Eggert since last week. We have learned that the Communist Party sent Eggert to Russia in 1932 for a period of study in the Lenin school. Our comnittee has heard competent testimony by witnesses who were former Audents at the Lenin school in Moscow. These witnesses have told how American Communists were brought to Moscow to study all the arts of violence and sabotage for special use in American industry. Eggert studied these tactics in Moscow. He had been trained years ago under the very shadow of the Kremlin for the work Which he has been doing in the California aircraft industry under the auspices of the C. I. 0. I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of Eggerts passport application. There is no doubt about his having traveled to Russia under the name of Kenneth Franklin Eggert. If. as he now states. his real nameis Kenneth F. Eckert. then he traveled to Moscow on a false passport. If. on the other hand. he was using his real name in 1932 when he went to Russia. we must conclude that he is now using a false name and obtained his 1941 Ohio license plates fraudulently. At one time or the other. this man has lied about his real name. I give you the record of another man who was a leader in the Harvill strike. I read you a telegram from our committees investigators in Los Angeles which shows that Ralph Dawson. actually the head of the whole C. I. 0. organization in Los Angeles and righthand man of Harry Bridges. has also used aliases to conceal his identity. When we reflect on the strategic position in which the C. I. 0. has placed this man Dawson. his criminal and Communist record becomes truly appalling. The telegram follows: Los ANGELES. CALIF.. March 21. 1941. Re Harvill strike."},{"1":"1940","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Under the law. they would be restricted to enrolling men who were out of jobs and who were in need of employment.

I have asked for unanimous consent to address the House at this time for the purpose of calling attention of the Members of Congress to the administration by the Department of Agriculture of the cropinsurance title of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of I am advised that the Department of Agriculture has Issued a regulation which provides that all wheat farmers who expect to take out crop insurance under the act after next fallin order to have such insurancewill be compelled to comply with other features of the act. In other words. after the 1939 crop is harvested. wheat farmers must agree to come under the soilconservation requirements or cropcontrol provisions of the 1938 Agricultural Act if they expect to receive the benefits of Federal crop insurance for 1940. I am not. for the moment. discussing the 1938 Agricultural Act as such. but do think it is unfair for. the Department of Agriculture to provide and promulgate regulations and interpretations that will require wheat farmers to comply with other features of the 1938 Agricultural Act. in order to have Federal crop insurance. I do not believe such a thing was contemplated by this Congress. If the sponsors of this bill had expected that farmers were to be required to come under the compulsory features of the act in order to have Federal crop insurance. it should have been deflnitely stated in the bill. The Senate passed a cropinsurance bill before the agricultural act was considered in the House or Senate. This same cropinsurance bill. with minor amendments. was recommended by the House Committee on Agriculture. After the agricultural bill passed the House and was sent to the Senate. the Senate attached the cropinsurance bill as a separate title to the Agricultural Act. It was afterward approved by the conference committee of both Houses. The conference report was approved by both Houses. The cropinsurance title of the Agricultural Act was not debated on the floor of the House. I do not believe the Members of Congress. in voting upon the conference report. expected the cropinsurance title to be controlled or affected by any other provisions of the Agricultural Act. The problem of crop insurance has been before Congress for some time. It has been advocated by a number of farm organizations. especially the National Grange. Even though it may be an experiment. it should be tried. I believe. as a matter of right. that every farmer who wants to take out Federal crop insurance should be permitted to do so. whether or not he participates in other features of the agricultural act. Crop insurance does not affect the Nations supply or demand. or surplus or shortage of crops. No farmer should be denied a right to take such Federal crop insurance if he is otherwise qualifiedjust because he does not choose to join a compulsory or reduction farm program."},{"1":"1937","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I have requested this time in order to briefly point out to Congress and to the country the fact that there is probably no type of Federal project. I care not what its nature may be. which receives the thorough. painstaking study and consideration to which a river and harbor project is subjected before it is authorized by Congress and the money is actually appropriated by Congress. The local community initiates the project for the dredging or improving of the river or harbor in question. to serve the local community by providing lowcost water transportation. and to aid commerce and navigation at that point. The project is discussed in the community. the citizens themselves see the possibilities and advantages which would accrue. and therefore they agitate and advocate the project and local industries join with them in favoring it. then their representative in Congress is called upon and introduces a bill for a survey which is essential in the case of every new project. He presents the matter to the Committee on Rivers and Harbors. which submits it to the United States Army Engineers having jurisdiction of rivers and harbors. who determine whether a survey is necessary and desirable and recommend accordingly. This results in the bill either being passed separately or included in the omnibus river and harbor bill. such as the pending measure. which includes numerous surveys. If the project is one for the modification or change of an existing project. then a resolution for review of prior reports is sufficient and the Representative sponsors such a resolution which is submitted to the Army engineers and later to the committee which passes It and refers It back to the Army engineers for the desired report. The project is then referred to the district engineer. of whom there are 42 in the United States. embracing every section of the country. He calls a hearing in the local community and all those who might be interested are notified and afforded an opportunity to be heard and present testimony and arguments showing the need for the improvement and evidence in support of the merits of the project. It is a public hearing. the public is invited and welcomed. and all those who indicate a desire to be heard either for or against the project are heard. It is in the nature of a quasijudicial hearing. The district engineer. after considering all the testimony. makes recommendations and refers the project to the division engineer. of whom there are 10 in all sections of the Nation. the last division engineers office to be established being at Portland. Oreg.. in charge of Col. T. M. Robins. who was transferred from San Francisco on account of the large Bonneville Dam project on the Columbia River. in Oregon and western Washington. The division engineer reviews the recommendations and report of the district engineer. He then makes his report and recommendations and sends the project on to Washington. D. C.. where it.is again reviewed and considered by the Board of United States Army Engineers. at which time the Representative in Congress is again heard in behalf of the project. The Board consists of seven members. They have served as district and division engineers in various parts of the Nation and like them were honor students at West Point and took the special course at the engineering school at Fort Belvoir. Va.. prior to serving as district and division engineers before being promoted to membership on the Board. The members of the Board have no local interest to serve whatsoever. they consider each project from a national viewpoint. how it will affect the navigation and commerce of the United States. They are far removed geographically from each project. These skilled engineers are absolutely divorced from politics. They are nonpolitical and nonpartisan and consider and decide the project solely upon its merits and demerits. The final decision rests with the Chief of the United States Army Engineers. who reviews the report and recommendations of the Board. After the project has run the gantlet of the district engineer. division engineer. Board of Engineers. and Chief of Engineers. these reports are submitted to the Committee on Rivers and Harbors. which hears the project de novo and listens to the presentation made by the local Congressman and representatives of the office of the United States Army Engineers and either approves or rejects the project. preparatory to its inclusion in an omnibus river and harbor bill. I repeat the assertion made at the outset that the scrutiny and searching investigation which I have described is probably not equaled or even approached by any other class of projects or expenditures of the Federal Government. Mr. Chairman. not only are river and harbor projects based upon merit. but they also result in a greater proportionate expenditure for labor. direct and indirect. than almost any other class of publicworks projects. To substantiate and prove this fact I call attention to the following statement prepared under the direction of Maj. Gen. E. M. Markham. Chief of Engineers. United States Army. furnished to me under date of June 25. 1937. The total percentage. direct and indirect. of labor costs ranges from 78.5 to 87.9 percent. demonstrating conclusively the soundness and desirability of river and harbor projects as laboremployment projects. The statement of General Markham referred to is as follows: Percentages of labor costs. direct and indirect. to total cost for work completed with Government plant and hired labor by the Corps of Engineers.

I beg the indulgence of the Senate for just a moment while I say an additional word regarding my pending resolution calling upon the Department of Agriculture for a report of all benefit payments under Triple A in excess of $10.000. The resolution is before the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. I wish the committee and the Senate to have certain additional information in connection therewith. The distinguished Secretary of Agriculture has made a statement to the press in opposition to the resolution. precisely as his Department opposed a similar resolution in the House of Representatives. He recites the same objections here that were previously asserted there. and I am bound to say. with great respect. that I consider the objections to be captious and disingenuous. They do not meet the issue. they avoid it. Some better reasons should be presented for maintaining secrecy respecting this gigantic distribution of a billion dollars of public money. or the cloak of secrecy should be drawn aside. The Secretary presents only two reasons for protesting the Senate resolution. I quote the first from a Washington dispatch in the Baltimore Sun of March 26: Secretary Wallace said the A. A. A.s primary objection to the request for a report on all farmers getting $10.000 or more was the actual job of assembling the data. Like Chester C. Davis. A. A. A. Administrator. he estimated the task would require the undivided attention of the entire Comptrollers division for about 6 weeks. Such an assignment. the Secretary said. would come at a most inopportune time. the Comptrollers division being occupied now with dissemination of some $296.000.000 of benefit checks due farmers on last years contracts. It is a very adroit and subtle suggestion. Mr. President. that the resolution will interfere with the current distribution of benefit checks due the farmers of America under their 1935 contracts. That is delightfully calculated to raise a protest which will smother the real issue. It is excellent strategyfrom the Secretarys point of viewbut it does not bear up under scrutiny. The farmers are entitled to their checks without delay because a contractgood or badis still a contract. so far as I am concerned. and the Governments obligations under the old A. A. A. should be promptly liquidated before new Government obligations are created under the new law. which. even more than its predecessor. permits the Secretary of Agriculture to disburse public money as he pleases. if he pleases. when he pleases. and how he pleases. If a report on the old law will interfere. at the moment. with a completion of the old disbursements. let the report wait until the contracted disbursement is concluded on W. P. A. But what are the facts? The Secretary says the report for which I am asking wouldRequire the undivided attention of the entire Comptrollers division for about 6 weeks. But what does the Comptroller say? That it would take his entire divisionwhich counts some 4.500 persons6 weeks? Oh. no! In a letter to Representative JOHN TABER. dated March 26. 1936. he says the list of beneficiaries can be compiledFrom the punch cards retained by the Division of Disbursement. Treasury Department. which were used to prepare the payment checks. And how long would that take? An entire division for 6 weeks? Oh. no! He says the primary operation would tale 10 operators and machines just 17 days of 7 hours each. or. if the machines be worked in three shifts. as is often the practice. it would take 10 operators and machines about I week. The subsequent labor. to conclude the compilation. would be comparatively simple and would interfere with nothing. No. Mr. President. the time and labor element presents no insurmountable obstacle if it be decided that Congress and the country are entitled to some small degree of intimate information regarding the disbursement of the largest single sum of money ever disbursed by a nonelected officer of government. solely upon his own discretion and without public report respecting its identified destination. Even if the task were as burdensome as the Secretary laboriously tries to suggest. that would be no reason for secrecy. The very size of the distribution would seem. at least to some of us. to emphasize the size of the challenge. One does not need to question the integrity of the distributionwhich I categorically do notin order to sustain a belief that the wisdom of the distribution. involving hundreds of thousands of decisions by hastily appointed subordinates. should pass in review for the benefit of whatever information it may disclose bearing upon continued operation of a farmbenefit plan. So. Mr. President. I repeat my belief that the Secretarys first excuse for avoiding the issue is irrelevant. incompetent. and immaterial. Now for his second and only other excuse. I quote the Associated Press out of Washington for March 25: The Secretary said both the commercial people and the political people had asked repeatedly for names of contract signers and amounts of benefit payments made. and that the A. A. A. had a steadfast rule of silence for the protection of individuals. It seems to me that this reason is even more naive than the first. I would be the last to withdraw legitimate protection for the individual. and I commend this sudden and wholly unexpected zeal in his behalf from this wholly unanticipated source. But in this instance it is misplaced zeal. No individual who draws subsidies from the Public Treasuryno matter how inherently worthy his cause or classificationis entitled to immunity from public scrutiny upon this score. Every penny going out of the Public Treasury is a matter of legitimate public concern. It is doubly a matter of public concern. and most emphatically a matter of congressional concern. when a billion dollars leaves the Treasury through checks that are written by an executive bureau answerable only to its own discretion. The Secretary speaks solicitously about his fears that commercial people and political people would misuse the information I am seeking. I do not know to whom he refers. If by the latter reference he means it would be politically dangerous to let the information out. he may be right. He has all the information. I have only a very small fragment of it. He is in much better position to judge than am I. But I respectfully suggest that dangers are relative. and it would seem to me to be far more dangerous to leave public opinion at the mercy of the countless stories regarding extravagant farmbenefit payments. which have run up and down the land for 2 years. than to bring the true facts out into the open. I remind the Senate that I have not invited its action on the basis of any of this gossip. although I have received literally hundreds of letters suggesting hundreds of situations. episodes. and incidents which might well be the basis of comment. which I withhold. because I insist upon clinging to the things I can prove. I have presented three specific exhibits which I am prepared to prove any time. anywhere. when the issue is joined. I have not said even that there is anything necessarily wrong about these three cases. I say simply that they raise a question of public policy which ought to be liquidated. I say simply that the Senate is entitled to the full facts. Then let the facts speak for themselves. They may eloquently vindicate the Department of Agriculture and its A. A. A. administration. If they will. I fail to appreciate why their production should be opposed on the Secretarys plea that a rule of silence is necessary for the protection of individuals. My resolution is not asking for information regarding the vast multitude of benefit payments going to the vast majority of farmers. The average cornhog benefit check in Iowa was less than $400. These farmers are still protected-to use the Secretarys sympathetic wordunder the terms of my resolution. But I submit that the beneficiary in another State who collected $219.825 in 2 years for not raising 14.587 hogs on 445 acres is manifestly amply able to take care of himself without the need of any secretarial protection. And how many more are there in this favored class? And why? The average cotton contract throughout the South is under $1.500. My resolution does not ask for their disclosurealthough I know of no good reason why any Government subsidy should be a secret. The Secretary is protecting-his wordthe beneficiary who collected $168.000 for not planting 7.000 acres. I do not believe it will be seriously argued that such beneficiaries as these require any protection from anybody. Is this an isolated case? Who knows? The Secretary does. Must the rest of usand particularly the legislative arm of government. which is supposed to control the public pursego permanently uninformed? The average wheat contract in Kansas runs in the neighborhood of $800. My resolution leaves all such contracts as secret as the day they were made. The socalled little farmer has nothing to fear from these disclosures. Indeed. my mail during the last week strongly suggests that the little farmer would immensely like to know the full facts. He is interested in finding out about the bigger beneficiary who collected $78.638 in 65 wheat checks in 2 years. Perhaps it is all just the prorata operation of the basic plan. I make no charges. I simply assert the importance of knowing these larger facts for whatever bearing they may have upon our subsequent legislative grants for farm relief. I am sure the Secretary. upon reflection. will not assert a necessity that these larger beneficiaries must huddle beneath the protecting wing of his steadfast silence in order to be saved. Please note that I do not hear my figures questioned. These gentlemen at the other end of the Avenue evidently know exactly what it is I am talking about. In this connection I should like to propound another question to them. Benefit payments to domestic sugarbeet farmers are being sharply curtailed todaycut back to a basis which violates the moral obligation involved in a benefitpayment plan which was specifically substituted for a reduction in the sugar tariff. These farmers now have neither the tariff nor the full payments intended to be substituted therefor. This is one point where the Secretarys protection-his wordis conspicuous by its absence. As a protectionist the Secretary picks and chooses the beneficiaries of his grace. In the face of this particularly acute situation. I should like to submit this question: Is it or is it not true that a great New York bank collected $705.488.66 as its residuary share of A. A. A. benefit payments to one Puerto Rican sugar operation in 1 year? Then here is an exceedingly interesting corollary question: Is it or is it not true. that a Puerto Rican sugar company received $961.064 in 193435 as compensation for restricting crops. and that this company concurrently increased Its capital stock by a splitup of shares. increased its stock from 70.000 shares selling in the neighborhood of $160 per shareor a market value of $11.200.000to 700.000 shares selling this week in the neighborhood of $40 per shareor a market value of $28.000.000? I do not assert the fact. I ask the question with considerable assurance that it is the fact. Are these pertinent considerations. Mr. President. for the information of the Senate? Do they not involve serious questions of public policy? Shall they be left to mystifying speculation? Is it an answer for the distinguished Secretary of Agriculture to say that he is too busy to inform the Senate or that somebody needs protection? There is no reason why this resolution should invite a spirit of controversy. The Secretary of Agriculture has administered an enormous responsibility. He has labored under tremendous pressure. He has been pioneering new fields. It is to be expected that the new system should have"},{"1":"1935","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment.

For that reason. and having reviewed the bill in its entirety. the dangerous provisions which give a draft power to the President. and a power which not only does not destroy profits but can even be so administered as to guarantee profits.

Section 1 provides: That whenever Congress shall declare war or the existence of an emergency due to the imminence of war. then from and after a date prior to such declaration. which date the President is hereby authorized and directed to determine and publicly proclaim it shall be unlawful for any person to buy. sell. or otherwise contract for any article or thing at a higher rate. rent. price. commission. compensation. or reward than was in effect at the date so determined. Assuming that a man should be elected President of the United States other than the great champion of the forgotten man . Franklin D. Roosevelt. he could set the price of commodities at a date of high prices. for example. back in the 1929 level. and thereby guarantee to the munition manufacturers and others who promote war for their own selfish purposes a higher profit than they might otherwise make. The other power to which I raise strenuous objection is that contained in section 3. which is an obnoxious and objectionable power given to the President of the United States in peace time when the drums of war are resounding on every international horizon. There is grave danger in such action at this hour. when our great leader. who believes in peace and speaks of peace. is the only leader on the international stage who is not engaged in sword rattling. I believe the bill will promote and instigate war propaganda. I believe that there is no way to promote peace but to legislate for peace. to promote war. legislative for war. To bring about peace we must think peace. talk peace. act peace. and legislate peace. I have always believed that the way to peace was threefold: Taking the profit out of the blood money of war. educating for peace. and submitting the question of war to the people for their direct consideration. One need only consider the number of millionaires created during the World War to become convinced that conscription of profits and conscription of wealth in war time and. if possible. in peace time especially as to munition manufacturing. is necessary if we are to attain peace. Mothers bear the sons who battle. Wives sacrifice their husbands to the Nation in such a crisis. The miners who dig the ore. the men who work on farms. produce the war materials. Is it not. therefore. reasonable to suggest that the question of war be submitted to those who bear the brunt of battle? Rather than provide that. this bill specifically declares for their conscription against their will and wish. Our fathers thought that honor could not refuse the challenge to the duel. We do. Our fathers thought we could not hear around the world. We do. Our fathers thought that men of divers creeds in concord could not live. We do. And some there are who say that we cannot live without war. But we can and will. and the only way to do it is by taking in a real manner the profits out of war and not by passage of a measure that is. as I have termed it before. a sugarcoated draft measure. This bill legislates war. not peace. and it does not take profits out of war. There is only one bill proposed to date that will take the profit out of war. and that is the bill that Senator NYE. who has so ably conducted the investigation into the munition manufacturers profiteering. has presented. I hope this bill will be defeated. and that we will adopt no amendments that will place a greater sugarcoating on a bill that has been so misnamed as this."},{"1":"1934","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"According to the report of the committee on this particular bill. it would seem to me that this is a very important board we are creating.

H. R. 13991the domesticallotment plan. Nor in the same short space of time do I have the opportunity to present to the House the farreaching and disastrous consequences which would ensue if the bill became a law. Everyone knows and everyone admits that agriculture is in a very distressed condition. that the prices of farm products are not sufficient to enable the farmers of the United States to pay the expenses of the operation of their farms. as well as the taxes and the interest -charges on the debts which they owe. Everyone knows and everyone admits that not only the farmers but thousands and millions of other people are likewise suffering on account of the financial losses caused either to themselves or to those that they worked for during this terrible depression. For everyone knows. as well as everyone admits. that the Congress of the United States should pass such legislation for the improvement of financial conditions and the betterment of the people of the United States as is possible. In these troublesome days. and not speaking of this bill. may I not suggest to the membership of the House that we be very careful in following and passing legislation which the organized minorities are calling for. It is our duty. I take it. after mature and sound deliberation to pass legislation which will be economically sound and which. as I have stated before. will benefit agriculture as well as every other industry and business and the people of the United States. It has been most unfortunate that the membership of the House during the debate upon this bill were not enlightened by a complete and careful analysis of the bill. But from careful consideration of the bill. the reports. and the hearings it is. in my opinion. an attempt by the Congress of the United States. under the discretionary powers of the Secretary of Agriculture. to place an excise tax upon the processors of cotton. wheat. tobacco. and hogs in order that a bounty might be given to the producers of these products. provided that they reduce the production of these products. The tax thus levied will have to be either paid by the producer. the processor. the manufacturer. or the consumer. It is nothing more nor less than a sales tax placed therefor upon these four products. with the hope that somehow or other the amount of taxes collected. less the costs of operation. would be returned to agriculture. In my experience in Congress various and sundry agricultural relief bills have been before the Houses of Congress. We had the equalizationfee plan. We had the Federal Farm Board plan. as well as probably some others. But in my experience none of these bills were as unsound as this one. The arbitrary power conferred upon the Secretary of Agriculture. a power which might bring direful results not only to agriculture but to the manufacturer as well. an authority which places the power in the hands of the Secretary of Agriculture to tax one group with a burdensome tax for the reward of another group. Prosperity will not return to this Nation under such a system as this. Prosperity will not even be returned to agriculture by this system. Many years ago. Adam Smith in Wealth of Nations made this statement. which is as true today as it was then: Those systems. therefore. which preferring agriculture to all other employments. in order to promote it. impose restraints upon manufactures and foreign trade. act contrary to the very end which they propose. and directly discourage that very species of industry which they mean to promote * It is thus that every system which endeavors either by extraordinary encouragements to draw towards a particular species of industry a greater share of the capital of the society than what would naturally go to it. or. by extraordinary restraints. to force from a particular species of industry some share of the capital which would otherwise be employed in it. is in reality subversive of the great purpose which it means to promote. It retards. instead of accelerating. the progress of the society towards real wealth and greatness. and diminishes. instead of increasing. the real value of the annual produce of its land and labor. It is not known by anyone what the costs of the operation would be in the event that this bill were enacted into law. It is not known nor do we have any intimation of how many positions would have to be created to check up on the farmers to see whether or not they had reduced the 20 per cent. Nor is it known how many additional employees would be necessary in the Bureau of Internal Revenue to collect the tax from the processor. nor how many additional employees would have to be had in order to see that the processor process under the provisions of the law. This. of course. would apply to every butcher. every packer. every miller. every tobacco factory. every cotton textile plant. every rayon and silk mill. and possibly many others. who would be in the position of a processor. There is no question but that an immense hoard of governmental employees would be necessary to carry out the provisions of the law. I wish to discuss the provisions in the bill affecting cotton. and a great many of these provisions apply equally as well to wheat and tobacco. In the first place. it is necessary that we go back to the 5year period from 1909 to 1914 to find out what the fair exchange value will be of any of the four commodities. We find in that date that the cotton ratio price was approximately 11.9 cents per pound. That the cotton ratio prices for the year 1932 would average 5.8 cents per pound. This would mean that it would be necessary for the Secretary of Agriculture to decree that the fair exchange value or the bounty. which the producers would receive on the cotton for domestic purposes would be 6.1 cents per pound. But the bill. as amended. provides that after taking the discretionary powers away from the Secretary of Agriculture as to the initial marketing period. exchange value of 9 cents a pound on cotton. 75 cents a bushel on wheat. and 5 cents a pound on hogs. This would mean that the processor would have to pay this tax of approximately 4 cents per pound if the tax were not passed on to the consumer. And I am speaking of the cotton textile mills that it would bankrupt or put into receivership. practically every mill in America. Thus you would have one of the largest industries in the United States. employing a great amount of labor. bankrupt. and the labor unemployed. Do this and it would affect agriculture seriously in this country. Now. then. so far as the cotton farmers are concerned. if this bill were to become a law now. the cotton farmer. of course. could not receive any benefit from it until the next marketing season. or his crop next fall. Of course. between now and next fall. if he wished to sell any of his commodities. and I am speaking of cotton especially. he would have to show in some way not mentioned in the bill that he had reduced his acreage 20 per cent. Two weeks prior to the commencement of the marketing year the Secretary of Agriculture shall estimate. as nearly as practicable. and proclaim the percentage of the total domestic production or commodity (cotton) during the then current calendar year that will be marketed and needed for domestic consumption. The farmer picks his cotton after having. as I have stated. reduced his acreage and received notice of the domestic consumption percentage. He then sells his cotton and receives an adjustment certificate covering the domesticconsumption percentage of the commodity of his own production. marketed by him. The face value of any adjustment certificate per unit of any commodity covered thereby shall be equal to the fair exchange allowance per like unit of the commodity. These words are the words in the bill. In my opinion. it means that the face value of this adjustment certificate will be the amount of the fair exchange allowance of the crop sold by the farmers to be used in domestic consumption. less. of course. the pro rata share of the administrative expenses. as estimated by the Secretary of Agriculture. In other words. and I am using this as an illustration. we will assume that 9 cents a pound is the fair exchange allowance. and that a farmer sells 50 bales of cotton at 500 pound.i per bale. and that the Secretary of Agriculture has determined that 50 per cent of the cotton crop is to be used for domestic consumption and the remaining 50 per cent is for exportable purposes. Then the farmer will be issued adjustment certificates on 25 bales of cotton at 9 cents per pound. He will have to have two certificates issued to him. both to be redeemed during the year. but the first one a month after the issuance and the second one six months after. These certificates will be negotiable instruments. redeemable at the United States Treasury. or other designated places. The cotton then passes on to the processor. And he then manufactures it into yarn or cloth. Then the Bureau of Internal Revenue. either daily. weekly. or monthly. at least. sends down one of its employees or agents. who checks up on the manufacturer to find out as to the amount of cotton that he has processed. the manufacturer. of course. paying the agent of the Bureau of Internal Revenue 9 cents per pound on all 50 bales. Now. in order to appear to protect the manufacturer against competition. a tax is placed on silk or rayon equal to the adjustment charge or the tax the manufacturer pays on the cotton. Even though this tax of 9 cents per pound. and I am assuming it is this much and no more. is placed upon rayon. the authorities of this bill failed to realize that there is a difference in the marketing price of cotton and of rayon and of silk. The manufacturer of cotton will pay a 9cent tax. and again I am assuming that this is a fair allowance. on cotton that cost him 6 cents per pound. The manufacturer of rayon will pay a tax of 9 cents per pound on rayon costing 60 cents per pound. The manufacturer of silk will pay a tax of 9 cents per pound on silk costing between $1.25 and $1.50 per pound.. Thus the protection is not afforded to the cotton manufacturer at all. for the percentage is widely different between the costs of cotton. rayon. and silk. The waste in a bale of cotton amounts to approximately onefifth of a bale. This. then. would amount to a tax of 101/4 cents per pound on a 500pound bale of cotton. assuming that the fair allowance was 9 cents per pound. Then. in addition to this discriminatory competition. you must realize that the yarn in both silk and rayon weighs less than cotton of the same thread. After considering the waste in a bale of cotton. which as I have stated is about onefifth of the bale. then there is another matter that should be brought to your attention. and that is this. as you know. the coarse yarns are heavier than the fine yarns. and so the tax on the coarse yarns would be considerably more on the yardage than the tax on fine yarns. As an illustration. overalls. heavy cotton hosiery. heavy work clothes. underclothes. and shirts would be taxed more than fine hosiery. fine underwear. fine dress goods. and fine yarn shirts. So. if this tax were passed. the people who use the working clothes would pay proportionately much greater tax than those people who use the finer grade of clothing. There is another matter connected with this bill which I do not understand. The tax. of course. would be applied to the cotton now being processed. if this bill became a law. as well as the wheat now to be processed. like cotton. before the new crop is made. What is to be done with this tax? The bill does not show that any of the tax collected will be used to be applied to the supply of cotton and wheat now on hand. In short. this surplus can not be reduced by this bill. and we still have it on hand as part of the worlds visible supply of cotton and wheat. In addition to these facts. it would lessen the use of cotton. increase the use of rayon and silk. which would materially affect the American farmers. the cotton textile mills of the United States. which in normal times give employment to hundreds of thousands of people. and many of which. in these depressing times. are operating for the purpose of providing their employees with work. which would entail a tremendous cash outlay in the payment of these taxes. The cotton mills in the United States would be seriously crippled by the passage of the bill. and if the buying power of the textile employees is reduced. every farmer in America will feel the effects of it. You can not. as already quoted by me from Adam Smith. attempt to give one industry a benefit at the expense of the other without impoverishing the latter industry. I have used cotton as an analysis in the working of this bill. because I am more acquainted with it than I am with wheat and tobacco. But I say to you this bill is absolutely unworkable as to hogs. and I say to you that it will not bring benefits to any of the producers of any of the four commodities. The bill might be well termed. instead of a bill to aid agriculture and relieve the existing economic emergency. a bill to perpetuate the tariff. because of a necessity the tariff duties on cotton and cotton textiles must be raised. and likewise on the other commodities. Again I say that it is unsound and unworkable and creates a horde of Federal officials. gives dictatory powers to the Secretary of Agriculture. and in addition to all of this. in my opinion. is unconstitutionalFor the revenue collected from this source is not used for public purposes but is only used to give a bounty to the producers of the four commodities. * 0 * Agriculture must be helped by either this or the next Congress. This bill on its face can not bring any immediate relief to the cotton farmers of this Nation. for it will be next fall. even though it is enacted into law at once. before any farmer could receive any benefit. and I deny that he can receive any benefit under this bill. A way can be found. and it should be done. The tariff barriers that now obstruct the channels of trade between the nations of the world should be lowered. Economic conferences should be held and. last but not least. the loans which the United States Government have advanced to the farmers of the Nation. through the Federal land banks and other sources. should be refinanced at an extremely low rate of interest. We owe a duty to the farmer. but we also owe a duty to e&ery citizen of this country. and I would suggest that as soon as possible we proceed to enact sound and workable legislation which would benefit all and not prove disastrous to all concerned. as this bill does. The time for these panaceas is past and we should. as I have stated before. immediately proceed to enact a law which will prove a benefit to the farmers and to all of the citizens of this country. In conclusion. whatever is done to relieve the present distressing agricultural situation. which affects not only the farmer but everyone else as well. there should be the assurance in so far as possible that the remedy to be applied will attain the purpose for which it is intended. For my part I shall do as I have always done. support all sound legislation for the benefit of agriculture."},{"1":"1932","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. under the leave to extend my remarks in the RECORD I include the following emergency employment plan: The Rochester (N. Y.) emergency employment plan recently put into operation is designed (1) to provide additional employment. (2) to stimulate business and trade. and (3) to encourage public confidence in the countrys situation by putting idle. or hoarded. dollars back into their wonted channels of circulation. The encouragement of public confidence is a natural byproduct. or result. of purposes (1) and (2). The plan does not contemplate foolish or extravagant spending. or buying of things or making of improvements that are not needed or that the purchaser can not afford. In brief. under the plan the citizens of Rochester and Monroe County have signed pledges to spend a specified amount of money within three months from date of the pledge in improving their property by making needed repairs or alterations or purchasing desirable equipment. or by making other needed purchases for self. family. or friends. all of which expenditures might otherwise be deferred. As a result of a 10day intensive campaign to put the plan into operation. almost 11.000 individuals and firms of Rochester and Monroe County signed pledges for expenditures aggregating more than $6.000.000. While the pledges do not specify what the expenditures will be for. those actively in charge of the campaign estimate that about 75 or 80 per cent of the expenditures will be for repairs and Improvements to homes. commercial. Industrial. and other property. Almost immediately following the campaign merchants. materials dealers. and others connected with the building industry reported a considerable improvement in business. sales. and demand for services. and a marked increase in employment was noted. Many projects covered by the pledges are under way and are furnishing employment to many men who otherwise might be idle and on the relief rolls of the community. Business men of Rochester state that the campaign also has brought about an attitude of increased confidence in the general situation on the part of residents of the city. One of the most important features of the plan is the pledge and the  performance or fulfillmentofpledge report. The one says  I will  and the other says I have. Blank forms for these are presented here as follows: (Date) -----------Believing that a dollar invested in employing labor does more good than a dollar given as charity. and desiring. to help to Increase employment.

(Date) -----------The expenditure which I pledged in the amount of $ -----has been completed. The total expenditure was $ ----- of which $ ---- was the cost of improvements to real estate. $ ---- was for equipment. furnishings. and personal effects. Signed.................. Address ......... The plan was originated by Libanus M. Todd. a retired manufacturer and publicspirited citizen of Rochester. He first presented the idea to some of his friends and associates and to leaders in the chamber of commerce and civic committee on unemployment. This group indorsed the plan. and it was decided that before the plan was given any publicity in the press it should be tested out among a representative cross section of the residents of Rochester and Monroe County. to provide an organization committee of sponsors for the plan. Mr. Todd and a few friends conducted an informal canvass and procured 486 sponsors for the emergency employment plan. The sponsors not only indorsed the plan. but each individually signed a pledge to spend a total of $701.644 for realestate improvements and other purchases. Among the committee of sponsors were the members of the board of county supervisors. members of the city council. of the city and county judiciary. educational institutions and public schools. and individuals connected with the communitys business. industrial. professional. labor. and occupational pursuits. Virtually all classes and income groups in the community were represented in the committee of sponsors. The campaign to put the plan into operation was conducted under the auspices of the Rochester Civic Committee on Unemployment. with Mr. Todd as general chairman. A campaign manager organized a force of canvassers to present the plan to every potential participant in Rochester and Monroe County. Campaign headquarters were established at the chamber of commerce. The organization and drive were similar to the wartime Liberty bond drives. or a presentday community chest drive. The city and county were divided into seven divisions. comprising certain wards or townships. with two chairmen for each division. These division chairmen themselves selected a ward chairman for each ward or township. and the ward chairmen selected their own block captains. who In turn picked their own block workers or solicitors. The organization personnel comprised 14 division chairmen. 24 ward chairmen. 19 township chairmen. 100 block captains. and 994 block workers. a total of 1.151 active workers for the campaign. There also was a publicity committee. The campaign began on Friday. December 4. and ended on Monday. December 14. A campaign fund of $11.000 was contributed by publicspirited citizens. firms. and corporations. The campaign started with an organization dinner December 4 and closed with a finalreport dinner on December 14. Between those dates five noonday luncheons were held for the workers. when reports were made public as to the amount of pledges secured each day. Stories were carried in the newspapers each day giving the total number of pledges secured and total amount pledged up to date. The expense of luncheons and dinners for the workers. and expense of printing. mailing. stenographic work. and similar services were paid for from the campaign fund. The campaign manager and canvassers received no pay for their work but contributed their time and services on a strictly volunteer basis. About $5.100 was spent for dinners and luncheons for the workers. approximately $1.200 for stenographers and clerk hire. etc.. and the balance for printed matter. blanks. pledges. canvassers manual. identification buttons for canvassers. and other material connected with the campaign. Each of the three daily newspapers donated five pages of display advertising space for the campaign. or a total of 15 pages. In addition each newspaper assigned reporters to assist in giving publicity to the plan and campaign and to help promote it. About three weeks were required to organize the campaign and secure the workers needed. Both men and women were numbered among the volunteer workers. Before the canvassers were sent out each was given careful instructions as to the purposes of the campaign. methods of making solicitations. etc.. and all were given special printed information which would enable them to answer questions put to them by residents concerning the campalgn and its objects. Each canvasser also was furnished with a badge on which was printed Emergency Employment Plan. Official Worker. for identification purposes. and each canvasser was supplied with pledge blanks and cards containing information to the householder as to how to procure workers from the Public Employment Center of Rochester. A large envelope containing the canvassers manual and other printed material. all of which was called the  workers kit. was furnished each canvasser. On the envelope was printed the schedule of dinifer and luncheon meetings. On a 4page folder there was printed the citizens pledge. the performance or fulfillment of pledge report. a page of information to the citizen as to how he could help relieve the unemployment situation. and a page containing a check list of improvements that might be made to real estate. The pledge and performance report were printed on one page. separated by a perforation and numbered in duplicate. The pledge when signed was torn off and turned in by the canvasser to the campaign headquarters and the citizen retained the performance report and the check list of improvements and information concerning how he could help in relieving unemployment under the plan. No definite goal as to the amount of pledges to be secured was set at the outset of the campaign. Sponsors of the plan. however. hoped that $3.000.000 in pledges could be secured in the 10day drive. This figure was almost reached at the end of the sixth day. At the final report dinnermeeting it was found that a total of 10.771 individuals and firms of Rochester city and Monroe County had signed pledges to spend $6.026.351.96 during the ensuing three months for repairs. improvements. or equipment for realestate propertieshomes. stores. plants. factories. etc.-and in buying articles which they needed. but which otherwise they would not have purchased during the next three months. In this total there are included expenditures by a large public utility amounting to about $600.000 for extensions and improvements which it originally had planned to make over a period of three years. but which. as a result of the campaign the company advanced to the present. Up to December 21. the campaign organization had received reports of fulfillment of pledges from 25 individuals and firms. These 25 pledges promised expenditures aggregating $21.000. but the reports showed that a total of $25.000 had been expended. or $4.000 more than called for in the pledges. The campaign organization intends to check up on the pledges obtained and  performance reports received at the end of the three months period from the time the campaign ended. and those who have not sent in reports of fulfillment of pledges will be interviewed by the canvassers who made the original solicitation to ascertain why the performance reports have not been made. One prominent citizen of Rochester who already had made repairs and Improvements to his property and who wished to participate in this campaign decided to Install a garbagedisposal plant at his home. Another citizen arranged .with the public employment center of Rochester to send him a competent carpenter. whom he would give three days work each week around his home or store for the next three months. Mr. Todd. originator of the plan. arranged to expend $7.000 in improving the grounds about his home. In order to make these improvements it was necessary to obtain a carload of brick from a brick manufacturer In Virginia. two carloads of shrubs and plants. etc.. from Ohio and Pennsylvania. and a carload of fertilizer from Buffalo. N. Y. Thus the Rochester local unemployment plan helped out the railroads to the extent of transporting four carloads of materials. a brick manufacturer. and several workers in Virginia were furnished some business and employment. nurserymen and their employees in Ohio and Pennsylvania were given some business and work. and the brick dealer and nurserymen and their employees in Rochester were given business and work by this project. In addition. Mr. Todd has employed 15 workers full time for six weeks making improvements at his home. the force of workmen was reduced to 9 for an additional week and 4 or 5 workers will be given an extra two weeks work on this one job. In the spring he will have some more work for several men finishing up the job. The daily newspapers assigned their own reporters to handle the news stories relating to the campaign and played up  the developments daily in a way to attract the attention of the Monroe County reading public to the employment plan and the campaign. The publicity committee. comprising expert advertising men of Rochester. prepared the advertisements for the campaign. using such headlines as.  Sign the pledge for prosperity to stimulate business and relieve unemployment . Daddys got a job. mamma! Daddys got a job! .  Take a guesteye inventory today. be ready when the agent of prosperity knocks at your door . What can I do to stimulate business and relieve unemployment? .  You personally can do a lot to cure unemployment .  Jobs. wages. prosperityyou hold the key . Have you signed the pledge for prosperity?  Each advertisement was attractively designed and some were aptly illustrated. and each carried a copy of the pledge and a facsimile of the official workers button.

The Senator who insists on that is seeking to furnish crooks with evidence to hide their guilt. to furnish them opportunity to destroy the testimony that will convict them. Mr. President.

I do not want to have to put the criminals on notice. and I ought not to be required to set out in detail that I propose to show that a certain man on a certain day in a certain county at a ce tain place did this. that. or the other thing.

What influence is it that is gradually poisoning the body politic of the Democratic Party? What is it that is crucifying the bold. brave. and courageous spirit of the oldtime democracy that lived in Jacksons day? Why. Old Hickory Jackson. if he were here. would vote to have these ballot boxes seized. and as the criminals were disclosed he would have them apprehended. he would have them prosecuted. he would put them in the penitentiary. if it were in his power. Have we fallen upon a time when men. parading as Democrats. will rise up here in this body and oppose a movement of this kind. which seeks to get at the truth. to disclose facts. to show fraud and corruption in a senatorial election? Why. Senators. would you want to have your names even associated with a move that tended to cloak. to protect. to shield those who were buying elections. who were intimidating voters. who were mutilating ballots. who were invading the sacred ark of the covenant itself. the ballot box. and opening it with impunity. and going into its contents in open violation of the law? Mr. President. these things ought not to be permitted to remain as they are in my State. The Committee on Privileges and Elections moves slowly. It takes it a long time to go into matters. I am going to talk very frankly. I do not think the Senator from New Hampshire is at all in sympathy with this movement of mine. He is on that committee. I do not think the Senator from Arkansas is at all in sympathy with my position. nor do I think the Senator from Washington is. and they tell us that he wants to run for Vice President. along with Mr. Roosevelt. from New York. I do not know what these boys have up their sleeves. I do not know what sort of schemes they hope to serve. but I will puncture a good many of them for them before they get very far with them. I have fought crookedness. frauds. and shams ever since I have been in public life. No man living can point his finger to an act of mine in 26 years in Congress where I have ever been on the side of crookedness and fraud and corruption. I have fought it in the open always. I am fighting it today. and fighting for my rights as an American citizen. for my rights as a United States Senator. I am fighting for the honor and integrity of the Senate. I am fighting for the honor and integrity of my State. I am not reflecting upon my State. God knows. I ought. not to want to reflect on a State that has honored me as. my State has. and a State that rose up en masse and followed me against the combined political machine. reachingi from precinct and county up to governor and United States Senator. to give me a hundred thousand majority in the face of all that. I want to protect them. and I am going to protect them in their right to vote as they want to vote. their right to have their ballots counted as cast. That is all I am asking here. If these ballot boxes disclose that I was defeated. why should not these gentlemen want that fact brought to light? What is it they want to keep hidden? Why not let us get at the truth and take over these ballot boxes? We have had two men in Alabama. One of them has been there for six weeks. and he is disclosing things every day that would startle the Senate. I want them to take charge of the ballot boxes and get the poll lists. Let this committee do that. Senators. and turn them over to the Committee on Privileges and Elections. But do not pull those men out of the field. Why do that? You sent them into Illinois. a Republican State. you sent them into Pennsylvania. a Republican State. Why is it that two or three Senators on this side object when the hallowed precincts of the ballot boxes in a Southern State. in a Democratic State. are being invaded and plundered by ballotbox thieves? I. a Democrat. refused to bow the knee to Al Smith and the alien influence back of him. He bolted my partys platform. and when he did it. excused every Democrat in the country from voting for him. I opposed him. They said then. We will punish you. They said. We will read you out of the party. They did read me out of the party. and resolutions were passed all over the State. by thousands and tens of thousands of Democrats. condemning the committees action. I took my case to the Democrats of the State. and I carried. I believe. every congressional district in the State. and now the election has been stolen from me. and I am telling the Senate that the evidence is in the ballot boxes. But here we are with some Senators complaining that we are trying to get at the box itself and find out the truth. and they are moving around the Senate and whispering about *to get somebody to object to the consideration of this * resolution. I want to know of my colleaguehe has just walked out -of the Chamberwhether he is in favor of a full investigation or not. I will wait until he comes back. and propound *the question to him. We are going to have an open. fair carry it. and the people of my State are going to know the facts about it. Senators. I would not have any respect for myself if I were to try to shield the crooks who had stolen an election. when we had traced the evidence to its hiding place in a ballot box. These gentlemen rise up and say. You are interfering with State rights. I did not hear them complaining when a captain of industry went up into St. Clair -County in Alabama and called his workmen into a community hall and told them that if they voted for me they would lose their jobs the next day. I did not hear them talking about citizens rights and State rights then. When they went to the schoolteachers of my State and told them they were holding jobs under a Democratic administration and they had to vote against me. the teachers answered them. Senator HEFLIN is a Democrat. He is the best Democrat in the State. I know. but he is outside of the party. Yes. and you drove him out. You drove him out because you knew that Democrats would nominate him in the party. They admitted it. The chairman of the State committee told me after they had done it. If they had let you in. Tom. you would have had a cinch. That is an admission that I was the choice of the Democrats. and the Democrats of my State are being punished now by some who are parading as Democrats who object to getting at the testimony and laying the truth of the matter before the Senate. I want to get the testimony in the quickest way possible. .I want to take it out of the hands of those who now have charge of the testimony. Why should there be any objection to that? Of course. the Committee on Privileges and Elections has to try a case on the evidence and the law. but I submit that it is strange. exceedingly strange. that an effort is being made to force me to present the evidence in detail. to name the person or the people I expect to have investigated. prosecuted. and punished. and I hope sent to the penitentiary. Why is that? It seems strange to me that United States Senators would take such a stand on a matter of this character. Mr. President. the situation here ought to be so that the suggestion of fraud in any State involving the election of a Member of this body would so arouse this body. and every Member of it. that they would rise up en masse and say. Go. Bring the testimony. We will not stand for fraud and corruption in the election of a United States Senator. I wonder if we are going to apply one set of rules to the Northern States and another set of rules to the Southern States when fraud and corruption are charged in the election of a Member of this body. This talk about State rights and force. bills will not serve to hide the true position of anyone. The Democrats in my State know who the Democrat is who has carried the standard of the party in all elections for 25 years in Alabama. When some of these gentlemen were never called on to open their mouths in a campaign in my State. I was out battling for the party in every county. They always called for me. The people of my State know my Democracy. They knew it in this election. and that is why every county followed me and I was elected by such an overwhelming vote. Then the ballotbox burglars got together and bodily stole the election from me. If I am wrong in my contention. why not expose my theory and say. That is not true. Here are the ballots. They speak for themselves. Why not go in and get the boxes and let us see the poll lists. let us get at the truth. turn them over to the Committee on Privileges and Elections. even though I know I am going into it with two men who I do not believe are friendly to me in the matter. I am going to ask my colleague herehe has returnedif he is in favor of a full and fair investigation of the 1930 election in Alabama. and if he is in favor of the ballot boxes. many of which have already been opened. being turned over as speedily as possible and made ready for use in a contest before the committee finally."},{"1":"1930","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. ladies and gentlemen of the House. should the House adopt the proposed rate. it will be the lowest tariff on sugar levied by any country in the world. and sugar is selling in the American market today at the cheapest price of any country in the world. I am interested in the statement of the gentleman from Wisconsin who claims that he knows all about the sugar industry. He indicates that it is all done by foreign labor. Sugar beets are raised on American farms. and the labor is performed by American farmers. Beets go into American factories where the labor in producing sugar is American labor. paid American wages. There is but one stage in the manufacture where labor of foreign extraction is in part used. and that is in the handwork in the beet fields. Many Americans do that work. Mr. FREAR carries the idea that in beet culture in the fields the children are crippled physically and mentally by labor out in the open. It the gentlenan from Wisconsin [Mr. F iam ] thinks that labor in the beet fields is detrimental physically. or possibly mentally. to American children. then I offer nlyself as exhibit No. 1. I have worked in the beet fields of western Nebraska. and no one will contend that I am stunted. physically. at least. The best guarantee of a reasonable price for sugar in America. is an American sugar industry. What happened in 1920 when the same people that now claim they plead for the American housewife had control of the sugar output of Cuba and the sugar prices in the United States. They squeezed and squeezed until sugar in Nebraska went from 32 cents to 40 cents a pound. and those are the people who now ask for mercy for the American housewife? What broke the price of sugar in 1920? Not Cuba. not the people who now plead for the Cuban sugar industry. The price of sugar broke in 1920 when the American beetsugar came on the domestic market. If you want to guarantee a reasonable price for sugar. the way to do it is to encourage the domestic industry."},{"1":"1929","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. it is easy to approach a question of the character here involved from a partisan standpoint. It is natural for the party not in power to blame the present plight of agriculture upon those who have been in charge of the Government of the country during preceding administrations. and to look askance at any method of solution proposed by the present administration. If disagreement as to the major issues of the day did not exist between the great parties in this country. there would be no reason for the existence of more than one of them. Nor have I any confidence in the arguments of those who profess a desire to remove this and some other questions from politics. Politics. according to the dictionary. is the science of government. and any question regarding government is a political question. This Is a political forum. It has never been. and can never be. anything else. If politics is to be kept out of the farmrelief question. then that question must be kept out of Congress. But if by politics gentlemen have reference to that thing which leads men to assume positions about which they are not sincere in an effort to curry favor with the electorate. which sometimes causes men to question the motives of other men. not because they themselves doubt them but because they desire to instill doubt in the minds of those who might otherwise rely on their leadership. which places the success of party or the political fortunes of the individual above considerations of good govern-. ment. then I quite. agree with them that not only the matter of farm relief and of the tariff but every other question as well ought to be kept out of politics. The people of the United States by an overwhelming majority have commissioned the present administration to solve the question of farm relief. Personally I believed that a more effective solution might be arrived at under a Democratic administration. but the majority of the people did not think so. I believe that Mr. Hoover. as the leader of the incumbent administration. is approaching the performance of his task in the utmost good faith. It is inconceivable to my mind that any man big enough to be elected President of the United States could do otherwise. I believe he is backing a plan which in his judgment Is best calculated to correct existing conditions. If he were Inspired by nothing else except a selfish motive. he must know that his administration will be judged not by his professions. nor those of his followers. but by the results achieved. It must be. therefore. that he is endeavoring in good faith to measure up to the expectations of the American people in the matter of farm relief. If he succeeds. then he will be entitled to and will receive credit as one of the greatest states-"},{"1":"1928","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I am about to offer a resolution. which lay need a little explanation. for fear it might be construed ts a tariff bill. It will pertain to the staple crop of Mainepotatoes. Maine is not the only State that is interested in this matter. All the Northern States bordering on Canada. from Maine to Idaho. are interested in this resolution. We became quite prominent in the raising of potatoes in Aroostook County some 30 or 40 years ago. We had a hard struggle. We had numerous difficulties to overcome. We tinally secured good railroad facilities into our section and we thought we were all right. We went along. with now and then a year of overproduction. and we had to suffer the consequences. as any State or any section is bound to suffer when there is overproduction in their one staple crop. On the whole. we were getting along very well until prohibition came about. Prohibition came pretty near ruining our potato business. It looked bad for us for two years after Volstead got his law in action. and that condition came about in this way : We had a very fair market. When there are less than four bushels of potatoes per capita raised in the United States we are reasonably sure of a fair price. Wheh there are over 400.000.000 bushels raised in the United States we are sure of a low price. In 1919 and 1920. when John Barleycorn had to go out of business. the good farmers of the Middle West looked around to see what to raise next. They could not raise any more grain for the distilleries and breweries. and a great many of them conceived the bright idea that potatoes would be a good thing to raise. Those two years we raised in the United States about 450.000.000 bushels of potatoes. Our section. which is confined to the potato business. hauled a lot of its potatoes to the dump In the spring after housing them all winter. That is what prohibition did for our potato crop. It caused a very  dry spell there for us. I do not mean liquid dry. I mean there were dry pickings for the potato dealer and the potato producer. The other dry question does not count so much. because we are right on the border of Canada. anyway. This county of Aroostook. which I represent. it might interest Senators to know. is the most prosperous. the highest rated agricultural county in the United States. The county itself in square miles is just about the size of the State of Massachusetts. When it is realized that only onethird of that county is settled up now. the balance of it being in forest. it must appeal to anyon& that for our one crop we need a little protection. The question arises. What is the necessity of protection? After we recovered from the dry spell we had. after the Volstead Act went into force. we thought we were getting along pretty well. The western man made a failure of raising potatoes. and we had our market back again. But who should come in and take it away from us but the Maritime Provinces. The best feature of our potato business is something that has been worked up in the last 20 years. Every winter that I have been South I have always come home with the idea that I had found out something. that if we put up pure seed potatoes we could sell immense quantities of them in the South. The result is that up to the last year or two we had worked up a trade with our southern neighbors who want our northerngrown seed to produce early potatoes in the South. until we were selling them anywhere from eleven to fifteen thousand carloads. This is the best business we had for this reason: The farmer was taking no chances when he planted seed potatoes of certain varieties. because he had them all contracted for in 5. 10. 15. and 20 carload lots to go South. They were contracted before they were planted. They were delivered any time they were wanted. sometimes out of the field. sometimes in December or January or February. according to the section of the South to which they were going. We provided potato houses all along the railroad tracks which were absolutely frost proof. We could ship potatoes to the South at any time they were wanted. But what happened? Prince Edward Island. the greatest competitor we have. came along and said. That is pretty good business. We would like to try it ourselves. I have correspondence which shows that 10 years ago they raised very few potatoes that were shipped to the United States. Five years ago the records show they were shipping a good many. Today they are shipping a great many more. For instance. in 1926 Prince Edward Island raised for our southern market 9.000 acres of seed potatoes. Last year. 1927. they trebled that amount and raised 27.000 acres of potatoes. which came into our markets last fall and winter. I have taken up this matter with the President. hoping to get the little onehalf cent a pound duty which is on potatoes now increased to threefourths of a cent. thinking it was a short cut to getting anotber 15 cents a bushel on potatoes. but after going over tile matter thoroughly with the President he referred me to the Tariff Commission. I nade an appointment with them. I am told by them that in order to get the tariff increased to 50 per cent by the President they must have a thorough investigation. The investigation means that they will have to find out the cost of raising potatoes here in the States and then they will have to go down to Prince Edward Island and through the Maritime Provinces to make an investigation there before they can go any further. and before they can make a recommendation. If they find that our neighbors on Prince Edward Island can raise potatoes cheaper than we can. then the duty will very likely be put on to equalize. Here is what the Tariff Commission will find when they get around to it: In the first place. they can raise just as good potatoes on Prince Edward Island as we can raise in Maine. They can raise no more per acre. and probably not so many. but they can raise as good potatoes for seed as we can raise. We acknowledge that to start with. Their fertilizer costs them about the same as it does us. $30 a ton. but the Canadian Government returns them $10 a ton bonus. so they own their fertilizer for just twothirds what we have to pay for ours. Our section of the Northern States. of course. is all rail from where we produce the potatoes to the market in the South. Prince Edward Island can put potatoes into the southern marketsSavannah. Norfolk. Baltimore. or anywhere along the Atlantic coastfor just half the freight by vessel that we have to pay all rail. This is what the Tariff Commission Is going to find out. They will find that potatoes can be raised in Prince Edward Island cheaper than we can produce them because their land is not so valuable. their labor is cheaper. their fertilizer is cheaper. and their freight is cheaper. The resolution which I am about to offer simply provides for a small appropriation to enable the Tariff Commission to make the investigation. I send to the desk two short items which I ask may be read by the clerk so they may appear in the REcoa)."},{"1":"1927","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Brookhart Caompaign Manager.

I am in hearty sympathy with the Senator from Mississippi in the position he has taken. He is absolutely right in saying that the golden opportunity. which we on this side had to compel the making of fertilizer at Muscle Shoals. has been thrown down and trampled upon today. The Ford provision. requiring the making of fertilizer at Muscle Shoals. I repeat. was in the Underwood bill. and as that bill was amended the provision was stronger than it was in the Ford offer. I -can not understand why our Senators over here could not agree. I regret exceedingly that we have not agreed. I can not understand why those who have supportedthe Ford offer for three years. and have stood here day after day and week after week asking that action be had and that disposition be made of Muscle Shoals. could today cast their votes for another year -of postponement. as provided for in the -billof the Senator from Washington. The Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. of which I am a member. went to the Muscle Shoals Dam. We looked the situation over. We investigated it as best we could. and we talked with Army experts. We came back and reported over two years ago. and we commenced to demand from that time on that Muscle Shoals be developed. and that some disposition be provided for so that we might use the water power as soon as it was available. Today I witnessed the sad spectacle of Senators on this side. and some of them from the South. voting for the measure of the Senator from Washington. which provides that the President shall appoint the Secretary of War. the Secretary of Agriculture. and some other person. to investigate and study the situation. The Senate. elected by the voters of 48 sovereign States to pass upon legislation of this -character. has voted a majority of it to appoint a commission to go out and investigate and come back and tell us what we ought to do with Muscle Shoals. I think it is the most ridiculous performance I have witnessed in this Chamber since I have been in it. Senators voting to designate three men to go and study a situation which we have studied for four years. We have not only studied it. we have discussed it. and we have tried -to tell others some of the thoughts we had about it. and we reach the conclusion finally that we know -nothing about it. that we are incompetent to act upon it. and we want the Senator from Washington. living 3.000 miles away. to come down there and lead us out of the wilderness. and tell us what we want to do with it after we think we know what we want to do with it. and after we have been contending for four years that we would do with it as was provided in the Ford bill. When Ford took his offer out of the Senate we put .the fertilizer provision in the Underwood bill which had been in the Ford bill. and I am consistent when I still support that provision. I supported the Ford provision. and I am still supporting the Underwood provision. or was supporting it until you killed it today. What did you kill it with? Did you kill it with a proposition that requires the manufacture of fertilizer at Muscle Shoals? Not at all. You have killed it with a miserabld makeshift and subterfuge. providing for the appointment of a commission to tell us some time in the. future what we should do with Muscle Shoals. Let me read you what you voted for. I do not know whether some Senators know exactly what it is.

If a Senator can not understand what he wants to do with Muscle Shoals after he has been studying it and discussing it for four years. how does he expect a commission to find out in one year what ought to be done with it? I confess again I do not understand it. Talk about a Power Trust! That Power Trust is operating around this Capitol. That Power Trust does not want fertilizer made at Muscle Shoals. That Power Trust fought to the death the Underwood provision. and succeeded in killing it today. The Fertilizer Trust of the United States claps Its hands with joy as it reads the news this afternoon that the Underwood bill has been murdered in the Senate.

He was then doubtless thinking of the time when his turn would come to lay aside all earthly cares. when he would set sail for that mysterious realm from whence no traveler returns. Mr. PADGETT was my immedfate predecessor. and I felt greatly honored when the people he represented so long and faithfully selected me to fill out his unexpired term. While it is a pleasure for me to take up the work where he laid it down. and to speak words of praise for his noble antl exalted life. yet it brings sadness when I realize that he has gone forever. I knew him well for more than 20 years. I knew him as a private citizen. I knew him as an official. I measured lances with him on the battle field of politics. and under all circumstances I knew him as a true. polite. highclass gentleman. Had he lived until November 28. 1922. he would have been 67 years of age. was born in Maury County. Columbia. Tenn.. in 1855. died at his home in Washington. D. C.. August 2. 1922. His remains were conveyed to his old home at Columbia and laid to rest in Rose Hill Cemetery among relatives and friends who had gone before. He was the son of John B. and Rebecca Phillips Padgett. long prominent in the history of his native county. Mr. PADGETT was thoroughly educated. received his early education in the ordinary private schools of Maury County. In October. 1873. lie entered the sophomore class of Erskine College. Due West. S. C .. graduating in 1876 with the degree of A. B.. which college conferred in June. 1916. the degree of LL. D. Soon after leaving college lie began the study of law and was admitted to the bar and began practicing in 1877 and continued in active practice at Columbia until he began his successful political career. He was one of the Democratic electors for the State in -884. in 1898 he was nominated and elected to the State Senate of Tennessee and served for a term of two years. In 1900. after one of the most noted campaigns in the history of the Seventh Congressional District of Tennessee. he was nominated and elected to the Fiftyseventh Congress and has been reelected to each succeeding Congress up to and including the Sixtyseventh. and had he lived until the 4th of March lie would have served for. 22 consecutive years. serving longer asa Representative in Congress from the seventh district than anyone who had ever represented it and longer as a Representative from the State than anyone else. with the exception of Hon. John A. Moon and Heon. Thetus W. Sims. This is a great record and a record that but few men achieve In this life. This demonstrates his popularity among those who knew him well and speaks volumes for him as an honorable. upright citizen and Representative. He was a regent of the Smithsonian Institution for many years and a distinguished member of the National Monetary Commission. During his long term of service he was a member of several important committees. and while active and attentive in performance of his duties wherever placed. he became more deeply interested in the Naval Affairs Committee than any other. For several years prior and during the World War he was chairman of this powerful committee and studied the intricate problems connected therewith so intently that he became the recognized authority on naval affairs. and his wise counsel and advice no doubt had much to do with the successful operation of the Navy during the war. and kept it free from scandals and grafts that some people claim were prevalent in other departments of our Government. He probably had a better knowledge of naval affairs than any other man who ever served in Congress. and watched with pride its growth as it became one of the greatest navies in the world. In 1880 Mr. PADGETT was united in marriage to Miss Ida B. Latta. daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Sims Latta. of Columbia. and for 42 years of their Ideal married life le was a devoted husband and loving companion. He was almost a lifelong member of the Presbyterian church. and his life embraced everything that stood for good and was a definition of a Christian gentleman. He was a kindly. genial friend to all. lie was of modest demeanor. gentle in his manner. considerate of the feelings of others and unselfish in every phase of life. his affable disposition. his honorable life and integrity of mind radiated and permeated those around him. Mr. Speaker. I have not words to adequately express the appreciation and high value of the service Mr. PADOETT rendered to his friends and people not only in the larger affairs of life but those of minute valuehe was ever ready and willing to listen and consider the wishes of the urchin as well as those of intelligence and celebrity. His services were marked by fidelity to duty which was the outstanding quality in his public work. Knowing Mr. PADGETT as I did I can thoroughly appreciate the devotion to him on the part of his constituents. he was truly their Representative and their interests to him were paramount. In his successful walk in life lie did not covet fame and notoriety and when they came his way as the result of hard work and constant attention to his duties in office lie was found to be the same undaunted man of sterling qualities. His career in Congress won for him much adiiration and devotica from his colleagues and the mention of his name seems to echo love and esteem for him. To his family he was ever held on the pedestal of love as the faithful loving husband. kind. gentle. patient. and loyal father and while they bemoan his loss It is a sweet consolation to them to know that his life in the family circle and before the world was one beyond reproach and his memory to them will ever be a guiding star.

Mr. President. we can not pay the debt we owe--the debt of gratitude. the debt of honor. the debt a mighty nation. saved by their valor. owes to its sons. But we can try to do so. we can in part discharge our obligation. and this we can do in manner contemplated by this bill without emptying our Treasury or impairing our credit. Mr. President. I am conscious of the hour. and am aware that the measure has been elaborately discussed by many eloquent Senators who preceded me. I have heretofore trespassed little. if at all. upon the attention of the Senate in the consideration of the measure. I feel the least embarrassment in proceeding. but I overcome that and shall ask the indulgence .of the Senate if I proceed to a brief analysis of the measure before us. But before proceeding to such analysis of the bill. and the plan for meeting its cash and other requirements. let me pause to ask Its opponents. be they here or elsewhere. whether tlere is such a thing as a moral obligation. and whether they recognize such a thing as a moral obligation resting on a nation. Whatever their reply may beand some of them. not here but elsewhere. seem to sneer and scoff and ridicule at such a thing as a moral obligationthe Nation recognizes that it is morally. if not legally. obligated to do justice to its loyal citizens. We have advancedgivento loyal citizens millions and millions of dollars when there was no legal obligation whatever. In some instances it was questionable. or at any rate questioned. whether there was any moral obligation at all. For example. finding itself in sore need of essential minerals. the Nation called upon its citizens to go forth and prospect for. discover. and produce chrome. tungsten. magnesite. and pyrites. Many citizens of the West responded to the call. animated by patriotism. and perhaps. in some instances. a desire for gain. There was no legal obligation on the Nation to reimburse them. The sudden termination of the war left many of them bankrupt. others with great material loss. I repeat there was no legal obligation on the Government to reimburse them for losses suffered. to compensate them for service rendered. But what did the Government do? We promptly appropriated $8.500.000 to relieve those citizens from financial embarrassment and loss. I take some pride in recalling that I had the honor to introduce. during the late extra session. the bill which ultimately became a law amending the former act. and making it possible for bona fide claimants to receive the amount of their net losses incurred in that enterprise of assisting the Government during the war. We have given. Mr. President. and even now continue to give millions of dollars in the shape of bonuses to civilian employees. stenographers. clerks. and other employees of the Government. In 1918 we gave. in the shape of bonuses to those employees of the Government. over $11.000.000. in 1919. $16.000.000. in 1920. $87.000.000. in 1921. $70.000.000. and in 1922. $34.000.000. We have appropriated over $38.000.000 for the same purpose for the year 1923. In other words. in the shape of bonusescall it what you will. gratuity. bonus. giftwe have- appropriated ind paid out. or will have paid out. $257.919.068 to the civil employees of the Government. The bonus or gift of $240 per year-$20 a monthhas been given to each employee. though his or her salary mounts up to $2.500 per annum. I would have thoughtful Senators. and those elsewhere who complain. to remember the facts which I have thus called to their attention. This bonus of $240 a year given to civil employees. in many instances given to employees receiving as high as $2.500 a year. is far in excess in proportion of ratio of the bonus or gift or gratuity or adjusted compensation which we contemplate giving to the soldiers and the sailors of the Republic. I shall not develop that argument further. Senators own minds will carry it forward. but I here and now say that if it was justifiable. if it was proper. if it was just to give those bonuses to the civil employees who. perhaps went no further In the performance of their duty than from the White House to the Capitol. is it not just to recognize those who went thousands of miles from their homeland exposing life in the defense of their country? Now let me invite attention to something else we have done. We have recognized an equitable right of citizens to reimbursement where they have suffered losses by reason of the sudden termination of contracts. We have not paused curiously to consider technical. legal rights. We have recognized broad. generous. equitable principles and rights. I heard no sound of protest coming up from the feebleminded editors of some of our cities. I heard no protest or whining from certain quarters who now seem to be appalled at the proposition Involved in the pending bill. when we. great. generous. rich Nation. thus recognized that there is such a thing as an equitable right. an equitable principle. to be recognized by a nation as well as by civilized man. Again. Mr. President. we have held ourselves obligated to restore to their owners the railroads taken cntrol of by the Government as a war measure and to reimburse the owniers for losses suffered and to guarantee a fixed net income for long periods. In this behalf we have given over threequarters of a billion dollars. Just right. men say. no complaint. it being regarded not only in this instance as the recognition of the Constitution and principles there engrafted. but also a carrying out of the express or the implied promise of this Nation. Again. Mr. President. we have felt ourselves bound to relieve the sick and feed the hungry of foreign lands and to assist the feeble governments. In so doing we have advanced or given vast sums which will never be repaid. Why did we do it? 0 What impulse moved us? Is there anyone who criticizes it? Is there anyone who is sorry or regretful that we have done this thing? We did honor to ourselves and added new and greater glory to our own great reputation for righteousness and for a merciful disposition toward the suffering of humanity. Mr. President. as a Nation. as the parens patrie. we have on numberless occasions gone to the relief of our own people who have been overwhelmed by fire or flood. Andhere and now. Mr. President. I wish to thank this Nation for its generous aid so promptly given to stricken Sani Francisco in the hour of her appalling disaster. Risen from her ashes. she stands again in majestic beauty. there by the Golden Gate. a living witness. a grateful witness. to the fact that this Nation never fails to respond to those finer sentiments and unselfish emotions that dignify all ennoble the human race. In many of these cases. I repeat. there was no technical legal obligation resting on the Government. but we felt and recognized a moral obligation and we discharged that moral obligation. Now I ask Senatorsand my question may go out to the countrywhat was the obligation in any of those cases coinpared with the obligation we are under to the loyal soldiers and sailors of the Republic? I am not criticizing. I am not censuring anything that has been done. but I am reminding and calling upon this Nation to remember. Mr. President. I take great pride as a humble citizen of this Republic in believing that we are a just and righteous Nation and that our benefactions have sprung out of a sense of duty toward those who served and suffered. If ever a moral obligation rested on a nation to reimburse its sons for losses suffered or to partially compensate them for invaluable services rendered. that obligation rests on this Republic. Now. let us honor ourselves by recognizing and discharging that obligation. Let us not be shamed in the face of the world by failing to do in like manner what other and less great. less rich. less powerful nations have long since done and are now doing. Contemplate what other nations have done and consider their resources and their burdens as compared with our own. Great Britain. Canada. New Zealand. Australia. France. Belgium. each has given more to her soldiers. In proportion to resources and liabilities. than we propose to devote to our soldiers by this bill. The victor nations have deemed It wise anl just to reward their victorious soldiers. but what of the vanquished? Germany. defeated. revolutionized. borne down by enormous debt. her overseas colonies and possessions gone. her once great merchant warine lost. stripped of productive territoryeven Germany. staggering under the colossal burden she bears. has. in some measure. done the same thing toward her soldiers and sailors. Here. Mr. President. I ask that a tabulated statement showing what other nations have done in this regard may appear in the RECORD as part and parcel of my remarks."},{"1":"1921","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Well. for some of them. those who are unable to meet their obligations.

Representatives of the Shipping Board made these statements. as I recollect. and cited the fact that larticular inducements had been offered in sonic instances in order to get control of our shipping interests. The necessity of this legislation is grounded in the fact that there is today in the world a shortage of tonnage due to the great losses from the submarine. At present there seems to be a widespread feeling. basel in part on encouraging statements by our naval authorities. that the submarine peril Is passing. if in fact it has not already passed. I sincerely and earnestly hope it is passing. but I am disposed to look the facts. very ugly though they may be. squarely in the face. What are the facts? The submarine has been. if indeed it is not yet. the deadliest weapon of the war. All the artillery. all the infantry. all time battleships. all the millions of tons of explosives and projectiles the Germans have shot into the air have not inflicted the damage nor cost the allies so dear as a few hundred of these undersea boats. They have destroyed or crippled or kept in harbor more than onehalf the oceangoing tonnage of the whole world. By forcing a convoy system. devious routes. and no lights. they have cut down the effectiveness of what remains nearly onehalf more. They have destroyed more tonnage than all the allies. including the United States. can probably rebuild in the next two years. They have prevented and still prevent effective aid to Russia. They are still sinking more oceangoing tonnage than all the yards of the world were building before the war. As bearing outwhat I have stated. according to monthly statements of the British Admirally. the submarine losses in 1917 amounted to approximately 6.620.000 gross tons. the equivalent of more than 10.000.000 tons deadweight. For the quarter ending March 31. 1918. according to the same authority. the loss was 1.123.51.0 gross tons. or 1.685.265 tons deadweight. This refers to British and allied losses. French Admiralty figures for April. 1918. show losses of 381.631 tons gross. making a total for onethird of 1918 of 1.505.141 tons gross. equivalent to 2.257.71.1 tons deadweight. At this rate. submarine losses in 191.8 will be close to 7.000.000 tons deadweight.. While these figures would show a reduction In the total losses from sikings for the year of 18.000.000 tois over losses in 1917. they are still. in may opinion. sutficiently large to cause concern. While it is possible and perhaps likely that these losses may be reduced. we must not blink the fact thit it is also possible that they may be at any time greatly intreased. I append the following table compiled from monthly statements of the British Admiralty: Losses by submarine. Qarter ending- British. natin Afareh. 1917 ................................................ 911.S40 1.619.373 January. 1917 ................................... 1. 361.370 2.236.934 September. 1917 ................................... 952.938 1.494.473 Decembemr. 197 ............................................ 782. 880 1 272.843 Total ........................................4.000.028 6.623.623 Afarch. 1918 ........................................... 687. 576 1.123.510 It shouhi be borne in mind that these figures represent gross tonnage according to the British method of measurements. In order to get their equivalent in deadweight tonnage. which is the usual standard in which American tonnage is expressed. these amounts should be multiplied by 1.6. Now. in view of this peril. which. as it would seem from the figures above quoted. is by no means at an end. but. on the contrary. still constitutes a very real menace to the success of the allied cause. it miust be apparent to all that every possible precaution should be taken to safeguard our tonnage against tie shortage occasioned by tle submarine. The problem as it presents itself to us has been well stated by Mr. Arthur H. Pollen. Englands distinguished naval critic. In September last. In an article pinhlished il the New York Tribune. Mr. Pollen used the following language: If th United States of America is to maintain an army of 1.000.000 ui on Freneh soil. It is a conservative estimate to suppose that each man will need at a minimum 4 tons of shipping and may need 5. f Iont know what tonnage will be called. for to take over 25.000 aircraft. tie proposed contribution of raw material. and the extra food which lie people of America are to deny themselves for the sake of their fellow figiters In Europe. But clearly if the position in Europe is to be Improved by a larger number of men. Increased supplies of munitions. a greater reserve of food. and a more numerous force for fighting in the air. It is by shipping and by no other means that these benefits are to accrue to us. American intervention. then. calls for more shipping. and at the time of writing It is vanishing at a net rate of at least 500.000 tons a month. By February 1918. the total stock of shipping will be between thirtythree and thirtyfour millions tons. a year later it will be twentyeight ur twentynine millions tons. Allowing only 5.000.000 tons for the purely military requirements of the UnIted States. there will be available for the general purposes of the allies. therefore. 29.000.000 tons at the beginning of 1918 and 24.000.000 a year later. Call the atlies carry ol the war when their oversea supplies are limited to this extent? This depends. of course. to a great extent on lhe amount of food that can be raised by the abnormal efforts of Great Britain and France during this and next year. It depends. too. upon improved methods of unloading and loading ships so that each vessel may do more journeys in a given time. Finally. it depends upon the extent to which the allied peoples In Europe can limit their consumption of food. either voluntarily or by the enforced order of the State. There are too many unknown factors for it to be possible to say exactly what Is the minimum shipping that will see us trough. But It is quite obvious that there must be a certain level that may be called tile vanishing point. It is the object of the whole German submarine campaign to bring the worlds ship ping to this point at the earliest possible moment. it represents the only hope the German high comnmand can entertain for avoiding a final military defeat. At the present moment. 5Mir. Chairman. the loss of tomiage due to submarine depredations has not been replaced. Indeed. in spite of all the efforts of all the allied nations combined. the total net loss has largely increased since Mr. Pollen wrote the words I have quoted. To offset the 191.7 losses the total new construction in all yards of the United Kingdom amounted dpproximately to 1.800.000 deadweight tons. while America was able to place il service in the same year less than 700.000 tons. making a total of about 2.500.000 tons placed in commission in 1917 as against a loss of upwards of 10.000.000 tons in that year. Thus rapidly. Mr. Chairman. we were approaching what Mr. Pollen terms the  vanishing point at the beginning of the present year. Since January 1. 318. the records of the United States Bureau of Navigation and official returns in the United Kingdom show nelw tonnage completed. as follows: Tonnage completed. Month. United United States. Kingdom. 118 Tons. Toa. January ................................................... 91.541 87.852 Febnry ........................................ 123. 100 150.075 Marcls........................................... 166.700 252.511 April ...................................................... 240.000 169.000 iay .............................................. 20000......... Totals ............................................... 1 881.341 659 433 From the foregoing figures it will be seen that in the first three months of this year tile total construction il this country and In the United Kingdom amounted to 871.779 deadweight tons to offset a loss during this first quarter of the year amounting to 1.685.265 tons. This brings fie to a discussion of what we may reasonably expect in the way of new construction ill 1918. If Great Britain maintains the same rate of progress for the balance of this year as in the fitst four montls. she will construct and place in service during 1918 about 2.000.000 deadweight tons. If she does this. she will have attained as high a mark il ship construction as she ltas ever reached in all her history. Indeed. it Is more than likely that she will fall short of this total production for the year. particularly.ns she is short of labor. is understood to be delayed for steel plates. and is depending upon the United States for portions of her steel plate. which we are now with difficulty delivering in sufficient quantity to our own shipyards. How about America? Evidence before the Commerce Comnittee of the Senate in Its recent investigation would seem to indicate that the maximum output of steel and wooden shipping Ill the lUnited States for this critical year of 191.8 will not greatly exceed 3.000.000 tons. Mr. J. W. Powell. vice president. in charge of shipbuilding for the Bethlehem Corporation.. coilprising several large shipbuilding plants and understood to holt contracts for nearly onethird of our ship program. In testifying before the Senate committee said: I am sure that in 1918. nith the various handicaps we are going up against. If the country turns out 3.000.000 tons it will be a very wonderful performance. Such. Ill substance. was also the testimony of Mr. Homer L. Ferguson. president of tile Newport News Co.. nud one of our best and most experienced shipping authorities. Mr. Ferguson thought it would be the end of 1919 before we would be uble to expand our shipping construction to a rate of 5.000.000 tons a year. Mr. Hurley. chairman of the Shipping Board. a few days ago stated what was his opinion and also that of Mr. Schwab. Director General of the Emergency Fleet Corporation. that the expert estimate of 3.000.000 tons for this year can be exceeded. but lie gave no estimate of his own or any figures further than to say that before this year closes we slall be turning out a half million tons each month. The figures for May. which I have already quoted. are but little more than half this amount. When we consider. as we should In this connection. our present inadequate railroad facilities. our difficulties in maintaining deliveries of steel. engines. boilers. turbines. and other necessary equipment for only 2.000.000 tons of steel ships per annum. not to mention the practical obstacles of lack of timber. lack of skilled shipping labor. and lack of steel and wooden ship building management. we may. indeed. think ourselves very fortunate if we succeed in adding a total of 3.000.000 tons to the worlds shipping in 1918. Submlarine losses since April 1 last are not definitely known. since the figures are not yet available. It is believed. however. that vien issued they will show a considerable decrease over those last published. If they amount to anything like 7.000.000 tons for the year 1918. as the figures I lave already given would seem to indicate. is it not apparent that with Great Britain building only 2.000.000 tons and America 3.000.000 tons in 1918 the peril of tile submarine is still with us? We must not forget either that last year the Britisl comptroller of shipping. Sir Joseph Maclay. announced that the United States must be depended upon for 6.000.000 tons of new shipping each year to offset the ravages of the submarine. and Sir Joseph was talking of gross weight. if le had used our term of deadweight tons. his figures would have been over 9.000.000 instead of 6.000.000. Mr. Hurley has recently stated that by the end of 1920 tle Shipping Board will have given s 25.000.000 tons."},{"1":"1917","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. history is the iandwriting of God. men the instruments with which He writes.

The United States Supreme Court first blocked the way by their decision in the Pollock case. During the period that followed this decision. surprising as it was disappointing. its friends continued undismayed to advocate this wholesome doctrine and watched every opportunity to secure its enactment Into law in some form. During these dark years of reverses and failure the Democratic Party was considerate enough of the rights and interests of the people to write In its quadrennial platforms a ringing declaration in favor of this doctrine. The Nationwide sentiment to this effect. which was thus kept alive. grew until in 1909 a Republican Congress found itself confronted by the alternative of accepting a comprehensive incometax law or a less brod provision limited to corporations. Being wedded to class taxation. they chose the latter as the lesser measure of relief which the country would receive. The friends of this tay also wrang from that unwilling Congress the submission of an amendment to the Constitution which when ratified would uproot and overturn the Pollock decision and again restore to the people and their representatives in Congress every phase of this just power of taxation. I congratulate the American people upon the fact that they ratified that amendment. wiped out all judicial obstructions. and cleared the way for comprehensive. honest fiscal legislation. The peoples representatives in Congress. no less alert. no less mindful of the public welfare. now propose to write into law the great principle which the people forever wrote into the Constitution. The general uprising throughout the country in behalf of this tax is due to the longstanding dissatisfaction with existing tax conditions and to the belief. which long since became a conviction. that the masses were being grossly discriminated against through the agency of our tax laws. Every citizen realizes that the General Government is obliged to secure revenues to defray its necessary expenses. and that in doing so It takes annually from the property of the American people in the neighborhood of $1.000.000.000. This can only be accomplished by means of taxation of some kind and in some form. Voluntary contributions. both to the state and the church. as practiced in the early colonial days. are no longer made. No matter how imposed. taxes are never welcomed except to the extent that they displace a more undesirable method of taxation. I should say that there is one exception to this universal rule of human nature. Our manufacturing friends. who have been in a tariff partnership with the Government for more than half a century. strongly favor the high protectivetariff tax for revenue onlynot Government revenue. but revenue nevertheless. During recent years there has been a general agitation and demand in almost every State in the Union and almost every country in the world for intelligent. fair. and practical reforms and readjustments of their tax systems. to the end that every citizen may be required to contribute to the wants of the State or Government in proportion to the revenue he enjoys under its protection. To this end the doctrine of equality of sacrifice or ability to pay is being universally invoked. A glance at the fiscal history of all countries shows a constant struggle on the part of the wealthy and more powerful classes to shift the chief weight of Government taxation to the shoulders and backs of those weaker. poorer. and less able to protect themselves from the injustice and oppression inflicted by disproportionate tax burdens. This conflict has been and is today being waged in the United States. All taxes in this country. whether for National or State and local purposes. fall upon the American people. however. the gross inequalities and injustices resulting from tax evasion by those most able to pay and the shifting of the tax burden to those least able to pay is seen alike in connection with both national and local taxation. This Is the result of unequal and unjust tax laws. As stated. the General Government must annually take from the property of the people about $1.000.000.000. while the States and their subdivisions must annually take a still larger amount in taxes. Let us glance for a few moments at the effect and operation of our National and State tax laws. The States. as a rule. have sought to maintain the general property tax system. A few instances will sufficiently disclose the inefficiency and unfairness arising therefrom and the consequent failure and virtual breaking down of these systems. The State Tax Commission of Massachusetts. according to its published report. recently estimated the value of personal property in Massachusetts that Is subject to taxation at over $5.600.000.000. of which less than onefifth is taxed. The commission also found that the greater part of this remainder. viz. $4.646.265.000. is intangible personalty subject to taxation. but which is not taxed. because its disclosure has never been compelled. By the United States Census inquiry of 1904. New York had $5.500.000.000 of personalty. whereas by the tax returns she had only $1.500.000.000. According to the published report of the special tax commission of that State in 1907. in which the disparity between the assessed and real value of personalty was placed at much wider figures. the following. among other. conclusions were reported: 1. That the richer a person grows the less he pays in relation to his property or income. 2. Experience has shown that under the present system personal property practically escapes taxation for either local or State purposes. The comptroller general of South Carolina. in his recent report for 1912. indicates that the small property holders pay the bulk of the taxes of the State. One real estate firm of Columbia. according to this report. published at the close of 1912 that their real estate sales during the year in that city aggregated over $4.000.000. whereas its assessed valuation was $400.000. or 10 per cent of the price it brought. while the assessed valuation of all property. both in that city and county. was only $10.685.000. although tax assessors assumed to assess it at 50 per cent of it actual value. According to the recent report of the Kentucky Tax Commission. the amount of deposits in the banks of the State on the 1st of January. 1912. was given in for assessment by the taxpayers at $12.847.868. whereas. according to the reports of the banks to the State commission and to the Comptroller of Currency at Washington. the amount of deposits on that day was. in fact. $133.339.871. The mayor of Philadelphia recently stated in the press that the undervaluation of property in that city is more thah $300.000.000. To further illustrate our State and local tax systems by afi Individual instance. the published reports show that Mr. Andrew Carnegie for many years only paid taxes upon a personal assessment of something over $5.000.000. although it has recently been raised to ten million. It may be safely said that with a few notable exceptions. the conditions I have described exist in the State and local tax systems In relative proportion throughout the Union. The small property owner. who can not hide his property nor shift his tax burdens. constantly feels the crushing weight of taxation. while the rich investor in securities. the money lender. and the wealthy business and professional men cover up most of their taxable property. as well as much of their city realty. when the assessor comes around. Intangible personalty. including stocks. bonds. and other securities. almost entirely escape taxation everywhere. A report of the Census Office shows that in the year 1904. while the true value of all property was $107.104.192.410. the ad valorem assessment of this property was only $38.963.381.000. that the true value of personalty was $44.762.719.000. while it was only assessed at $8.873.562.000. and the assessment of realty was less than 50 per cent of its true value. Turning to our present system of national taxes. we find a still worse condition with respect to our customhouse taxation. Our internalrevenue taxes offer no special ground for criticism. Under this system Illinois paid $51.600.000 to the Government for the year ending June 30. 1912. Kentucky. $31.177.000. Indiana. $30.000.000. Missouri. $12.000.000. New York. $43.800.000. Pennsylvania. $25.600.000. and other States likewise paid in smaller amounts. Our system of high protectivetariff taxation violates every canon of taxation and is outrageous in its operation and effects. It is conceived upon the ideathat the people should be taxed. not according to their ability to pay. but according to their needs and. practically. their poverty. No civilized or humane peoplecan longer tolerate this system of diabolical extortion. In contributing three hundred millions to the Federal Treasury the American consumer is compelled at the same time to hand over at least $1.500.000.000 as a bonus to those select individuals given special favors by the high protectivetariff tax. During recent generations our high tariff taxes have degeficrated into a system of special privilege. such as has never before been revealed in the annals of our fiscal history. It is no longer justified either rn law or morals. The public conscience revolts against it and modern civilization turns away from It. This doctrine of taxation. the plain and palpable effect of which requires one citizen to bestow as a gift I)ortions of his hard earnings upon another citizen. has become insupportable here and everywhere. and whatever may be the future developments of the economic policy of the United States. the period of high protection has reached its end. The present average protectivetariff rates appear to be in the neighborhood of 40 per cent. but in fact. when we consider the innumerable rates that are absolutely prohibitive. the average rate must be near 60 per cent. The temptation to discuss at length the evils and unfairness of our high tariff taxes. and the splendid reductions carried in the present bill Is very great. but I shall forego this for the present. in order to consider other phases of our proposed tax system. The American people have completely learned that they are not being taxed either fairly or honestly. they are demanding that the inequalities. abuses. and injustices of our present system of high tariff taxation shall be eliminated. and that a new system of taxes. fair and equitable. embracing a strictly revenue tariff and an income tax. shall be devised. The experience of all countries with respect to every form of taxation has resulted in the universal conclusion that the fairest and most just of all taxes is that which is levied upon the citizen according to ability to pay. and that this result can best be accomplished by imposing a tax on net incomes. Fiftytwo countries and States have taken this step. and wherever given a reasonable trial this form of tax has never been repealed. save in the United States. England. the seven States of Australasi.. and most of the other English colonies. Prussia. aid the numerous other German States. Switzerland. Spain. Italy. Norway. Sweden. Holland. Hungary. Greece. Japan. Dennmark. Austria. and numerous other imiportant countries have this tax in operation. while France is on the verge of adopting a comprehensive incometax law in lieu of numerous other taxes. In many or most cases other countries have adopted and maintained this tax for- the twofold purpose of securing revenue and equalizing the burdens of taxation. In no other way could the burdens be equalized and the rising tide of unrest. discontent. and socialism be so successfully met. By this method alone could every citizen see and know that taxes are being imposed equitably and according to ability to pay. The very fact that this is a just tax means that it will meet with opposition. the beneficiaries of unjust taxation and many who have measurably escaped all taxation will always be found opposing an honest and fair tax upon selfish grounds. Under the present high tariff tax system a poor man with a large family pays more taxes than a rich man with a small family. Hence the man of weath who is too selfish and too unpatriotic to pay taxes will vigorously oppose the imposition of any just tax. as will any creature of class or privilege taxation. The pending measure has already met with the specious suggestion that it is class legislation. and makes a distinction between citizens of large means and those without particular means. It may be replied that the very purpose of the measure is to reach for taxation those who have escaped taxes and who are most able to bear the same. Suppose the bill in chief measure exempted this class of citizens. as other laws have done and now do: the tax would continue to be paid. as heretofore. by the middle and poorer classes. The very purpose of a combination of just tax laws is to reach every citizen in fair proportion. The masses of the people are now paying most of our $312.000.000 tariff taxes and most of our State and local taxes. save in a few States. Then where is the injustice of requiring the receivers of incomes over $4.000 to equalize in some measure these tax burdens by contributing less than $100.000.000 to the Federal Treasury? The objection is also offered. In a tone of injured innocence. that the proposed tax would be sectional in its effects. This measure certainly Is not sectional in its terms. and should it be sectional in effect it would be due to the fact that wealth has first made itself sectional. It would be monstrous to say that the receivers of great incomes which are drawn from every section of the country may segregate themselves and upon the plea of segregation or sectionalism successfully exempt their entire wealth from taxation. They should invoke the plea of segregation and not sectionalism. The very nature and purpose of the income tax is fairly to reach and successfully to cope with such conditions. for long experience everywhere has demonstrated that the only means of getting at the financial resources of the country in fair measure. and taxing classes of persons who would otherwise escape taxation or nearly so. is to levy a tax on incomes. To Illustrate the importance of this tax. during the parliamentary debate of 1909. Mr. Lloyd George said: The income tax Is In reality the center and sheet anchor of our financial system. Mr. Gladstone characterizes it as an engine of gigantic power for great national purposes. This tax in England now produces about two hundred millions of revenue annually. and according to universal testimony gives the taxpayer as little trouble as any form of taxation. The complaint of inquisitorialness has now almost completely disappea red. I shall not consume the time of the committee in commenting upon the results of the operation of this tax law in the various foreign countries. except to say that the masses everywhere have a deepseated conviction that it is fair alike to every citizen and is the only effective method of equalizing tax burdens. This tax. in addition to being fair. is productive and responsive to changes in rates. and is cheap of collection."},{"1":"1912","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Speaker. I have several times stated to the House the position of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce as to granting the consent of Congress for private owners. on their own land. to construct. at their own .expense. dams for the development of water power in navigable rivers. I have deprecated the unfair conduct of obstructionists under the false. misleading. and fraudulent name of conservationists. unjustly assumed. in objecting to consideration by which only debate on specific propositions could be bad and amendments proposed and voted on. Those gentlemen have preferred to hide behind the bulwark of objecting to consideration and then indulge in what they call general debate. which consists in railing at particular individuals. misrepresenting the attitude of the committee. and deluging the country with gush. poppycock. and innuendo. which. boiled down. means unconstitutional centralization as imperialistic and autocratic as that of Xerxes or Ptolemy in relation to the particular matter. The committee had not intended to advert to the subject any more until arrangements could be had for consideration. as talk is worthless without an opportunity foraction. To this end we were endeavoring to reach a basis by which action could be had. That effort has failed. In fact. the conciliatory attitude assumed for the sole purpose of securing harmony and action at this session has been misunderstood and abused. The objections on Monday and the repetition of the old stockintrade innuendos on Tuesday scatter to the winds all hope of agreement and all those efforts are at an end. I have nothing to do with the personal Issues between gentlemen. nor would I be surprised to find some bad men and some bad projects in the development of water power. They are found everywhere in this sinful world. from Eden down. According to the opinions of the gentleman from Tennessee and the gentleman from Illinois. there are two in this House. but I do not agree with their reciprocal statements that they are the two. I do not mean to give offense to any of my colleagues. I have high regard for all who have spoken. What I complain of is that they refuse to consider the principles involved and the scheme under which progress is to be made in this respect. insisting that the committee assume the burden of investigating in detail all the physical features involved. which under our scheme it is the duty of the War Department to do. The reason for this mistake. however. is found in their other fundamental error. that the Federal Government has some right and title to the water powers of the country. although it does not spend one cent nor acquire any property rights to the titles. and that it has the right both to charge rent and collect taxes from the private property of citizens in water power. Laboring under those hallucinations. the charge is repeated that the committee had no hearing nor investigations of the projects involved. and that such a reckless practice is the policy of the committee. The following is the truth. and any contrary statement or contention is fallacious: The right of the Government in the streams is to promote the navigation thereof. The only other right it can ever have is not in the streams. but may arise hereafter to control rates and practices of power companies. if ever they begin to transmit the power generated across State lines. That being the policy as to dams built at the expense of persons other than the Government. the committee. in accordance with the general dam act. refers every bill to the Chief of Engineers through the Secretary of War. They make a thorough and exhaustive investigation in every instance. and the report of the Chief of Engineers on each of these bills shows that that is true. and every assertion to the contrary is false. That investigation covers the relation of the dam to navigation and constitutionally can not cover anything else. In these cases. it is true. the Secretary of War suggested two things entirely ultra vires. contrary to the principles pf our Government. violative of private rights. and regardless of local authority. to wit. that the Government should reserve and assert what it has not and can not have without paying for it. a title in water power. and second. a right to regulate and control the distribution. practices. and rates of power companies without waiting for them to enter the domain of interstate commerce and thereby come within the jurisdiction of the Federal Gvernment. Recognizing those doctrines as heretical. the committee ignored them and followed the findings of the Chief of Engineers. who had thoroughly investigated the subject. The objectors have not aided the committee by offering any information nor valid objection to any of the projects. Further referring to the policy under the general (hin act. this preliminary investigation does not end the duty of the War Department. When a bill is passed. the consent of Congress being granted in accordance with the general dam act. it imposes on the Chief of Engineers the duty in approving plans and specifications of prescribing in connection therewith all necessary provisions for the protection of the interests of the Government. and he has done it in every case under the general dam act. This brings us to the other false charge. a thousand times recklessly repeated in the sensational press and by the men who pander to the sensational press and flourish by their laudation. such flourish as it is. to wit. that no provision is made for the protection of the people. The consent of Congress in every case is granted that the person. natural or artificial. authorized and to be controlled by the State in which the project is located may construct a dam in a navigable stream. The. only additional safeguard necessary to prescribe being that navigation shall not be obstructed thereby. but promoted. The constitutional right of the owner to the use of his property and the constitutional reserved power of the State to sanction or forbid the project. to control and regulate the property and derive revenue from taxing it. are not questioned by our action at all. but required. and the Federal Government has no business or concern with it. The doctrine. implied by some and asserted by others. that the Federal Government can take away from the State every right and duty to regulate the security of property and the rights of its citizens sound very strange to thinking people in this Republic. There is but one way given under the Constitution whereby the Federal Government can derive revenue from water power. unless developed at the expense of the Treasury. and that is by a general. uniform excise tax on all water power and all waterpower sites. Whenever the Government finds itself in such a strait that it must seek to usurp to itself the last vestige of resources for raising revenue and leave nothing on which the States may maintain their government it wilt be a sad day for the Republic. This propaganda. filled with hallucination and innuendo. bristies. however. with one clear and distinct false doctrine. and that is the idea that nothing can be done in this country except by the Federal Government. that private property and morality and business interests can not be fostered under the good old democratic way of supervision and regulation by local authority. The truth is. that is the only way. and whenever centralists and misguided enthusiasts succeed in overturning that plan. progress. honesty. morality. and liberty will be gone forever from the land. If all those gentlemen will suspend their fads and prejudices and devote the next three months to studying the Constitution and the report of Senator NELSON and the letter from Bishop Candler. printed herewith under leave to print. they will return to the next session with much clearer Ideas and with a much fairer and better frame of mind for approaching consideration and action upon this question with a view solely to the following two. and the only two. relevant questioins: First. what can we do under the Constitution in granting the consent of Congress to permit private owners to develop and use their private property in the shape of dam sites and at the same time promote the navigation of the rivers in which they are to be located? And. second. what is expedient in the way of good governmental policy? Shall we do what we constitutionally can do. and less if necessary. to encourage capital to aid in the development and progress bf the country. or shall we continue to blight all hope and prospect of development and prosperity from the source in question by imposing terms so harsh or unconstitutional that certain litigation and uncertain profits will deter all energy and capital from making an effort? Senator NE.LSONs report follows: [Report of the subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary. United States Senate. on S. Res. 44. directing the Committee on the Judiciary to report to the Senate on the power of the Government over the development and use of water power within the respective States.]"},{"1":"1911","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"And it will be noted It follows almost literally the Texas plitform. Bryan was nominated for President on the 1896 platform. and he helped to make that of 1904. and yet lie now favors  free raw material. The last convention at Galveston ratified this idea of opposition to free raw material. because it discriminates in taxation. by an overwhelming vote. Now. the issue is squarely up to the people to say what they will have. I note Mills was for free raw materials -a brilliant Democrat ani :in able man. who has gone to his rewardand I need not s.y that. in common with thousands of otherP I rupported CULBE.aoN in the campaign upon this very question. and he defeated Mills. I need not mention that Horace Chilton. a good. pure man and a clean Democrat. was defeated by BAILEY upon this proposition. Now. I ask the question: Who is juping the State and national platforms in Texas? Whose ideas are inconsistent with the express words of both from 1896 to date? I can not believe that the Democratic Party now. when there is every hope of success. and the tariff must be loweied. that we will go to the Whig doctrine. and while reducing the tariff on mianufactured products we will take it off of the raw material raised by the South and West. It is not just and right. and it is not in accord with Democratic principles and does not meet the requirements of equal rights to all and special privileges to none. We must have a tariff. and we must levy it upon products. and these products compete with those of other countries. and as a matter of fact this term  raw material  is rather indistinct. Land and labor enter into the cost of production of everythingcoal. hides. cattle. lumber. ore. wool. sugar. tobacco. rice. barley. wheat. and so forth. The value of land and labor has all vastly increased. by the way. from 1846 to date. and this is more reason for the rule of 1846. Are these articles to be untaxed because consumers have to have them. while the manufacturers are taxed a revenue tariff. if you please. which will have to be paid by consumers. so that they can go out and grab the foreign markets? But the tariff is a tax and ought to be levied according to taxation principles. What are they.? That everything must be taxed in proportion to value. as Jackson and Polk and Pierce and all the great thinkers of the Democratic Party said. Not to tax the wool. the hides. the cattle. sugar. tobacco. barley. wheat. and rice. while you tax the manufactured products is to  discriminate against the section that produces these things. which means. briefly and fairly stated. a  freetrade South and West and a protected North and East. That is all there is to the doctrine. I shall never give my consent to such a doctrine. Just a word of warning in conclusion: If we do not get back to the old way of making platforms and standing by them. we may expect the growth of the  Isms which are now current. I voted for free wood pulp and print paper and lumber because commanded to by the national platform of 1908. but I knew they ought not to be in it. and were put in. the one to catch the newspapers. the other votes in certain States that had cut all their lumber. and they wanted free lumber from Canada. If I am not bound by the national platform no one else is. and there is no use making them. There has been too much of this catching votes business. and our national platforms are too long. and too many of them read like essays. Let us quit it. Let us do as our Democratic fathers did before the warmake a platform so clear and concise that it can be printed on a postal card. let us say just what we mean and when we get in do it. and then the isms will melt away like snow before the sun.

I rise to support the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey. I have been amazed at the statement made by the gentleman from Illinois that no private shipyards in this country can as now organized construct ships under the system of eight hours for a days work. He says. in effect. that the shipyards in the United States. favored as they are by the laws of the United States In the construction of ships. given a monopoly of the construction of ships flying the American flag. whether used in International or in the coastwise tradethat none of the shipyards. favored as they are by the laws of Congress. are prepared to give to their laborers any of the benefits contemplated by the eighthour law of the United States and the widespread eighthour practice. It is a sad commentary on the shipyards which are subsidized by law and given a profitable monopoly. that It Is now impossible. if It is. for the United States to have any of its vessels constructed under the eighthour law passed by Congress and the eighthour practice which has become universal in well conducted private enterprises. I think. Mr. Speaker. if there are no private shipyards in the United States today able to construct vessels under the eighthour law and under the eighthour practice. it is time that Congress withdrew from those shipyards the highly protective laws of the country which give them a monopoly in building American ships and which have been enacted for their benefit. It is certainly not contemplated by the shipping laws of the United States which give these private yards a monopoly In the construction of American ships that the monopoly is given to them wholly for the benefit of capitalists who build the ships. This monopoly is given them. as has been pretended. at least in part. for the benefit of labor of the United States. and American labor has been committed for many years with the indorsement of Congress and the approval of the great public to the eighthour practice. It seems to me that the gentleman from Illinois In his declaration that no shipyard in the United States is prepared to build ships under the eighthour law has made a very damaging confession. if it be true. and has presented an argument why Congress should adopt the eighthour amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey."},{"1":"1909","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"(reads) : Average iwages paid at the mills of the Elk Lumber Company. at Feranie.

I am going to take up the Fowler bill. if I have time. I want to call the attention of the gentlemen of the House to this proposition which has been advanced by the gentleman from Mississippi . that a tax in some way or other will drive notes back into the Treasury. I have proven that it would not. But let me show you the disadvantage that the United States would be under by paying such a tax on circulation. We have to compete with England. Germany. France. Italy. and Canada. I want to say to you. gentlemen. even if the wages of labor were on an equality here and there the competition with them would be a very unequal one if our farmers. manufacturers. and producers generally are always to be compelled to pay twice as much as they do for the use of the money with which that labor is paid. Now. what is the situation? England has no tax. absolutely no tax. on currency. In France no tax. in Canada no tax. in Germany no tax when covered by gold. Seventyfive millions of dollars besides that of uncovered paper has no tax. and then a taxto get a further issue back? No. to keep it from going out in too great a volume. Italy has a limit of circulation of three times its bank capital. and no tax. What then? After that the banks have to pay all the money received for discountsall or part of itto the Government. and of course that stops its going out too freely. It does not help it to come back. In all these countries the outflow of circulation is controlled by the interest rate. and the inflow takes care of itself. for there is only one issuing power. and there is nowhere else for it to go. There is the situation. and do you say that we are going to organize a new currency system and deliberately put ourselves under a handicap by a tax. in competition with every other nation in the world? I do not think you mean to do that. if you will stop and think. Now. gentlemen. I want to say to you that in my judgment if we are going to continue the bondsecured circulation and perpetuate the practice of paying one debt with another. if we want to do something right now to meet an emergency and tide over until we can think about this matter. my friend. the leader of the Republican side of this House . makes the best suggestion that I have heard. It is this. and I want you to think it over. I have no authority from him to make the suggestion. I am making it because it has been made to me in the course of conversation. The national banks are now limited to the amount of capital in their note issue. Nobody disputes but that the notes are perfectly safe so long as they do not come in too freely and all call for. gold or its equivalent at once. I do not think they will do it if the volume is not increased very much. But the New York banks and many of the large city banks wont take out notes. Did you ever stop to think why? There is a profit of nearly 1 per cent in it. Why do they not take them out? Simply for this reason: They stand in the center of things. and 50 per cent of all the redemptions of the country go through New York City. and under the present law the bank note is redeemable in legal tender. and legal tender is required to maintain reserve. Now. a New York bank wouldcbe foolish to put out a lot of bank notes today that would be coming back tomorrow or next week and take the legal tender out of its reserve to redeem them. So that today there is a margin of about $250.000.000 which could be taken out If it were not for the limit of the capital of the issuing bank. The country banks are not in that danger. because redemption rarely if ever is called for over the counter of the country bank. Strike out that limit and. without changing another word of the law. the country bank can take out the circulation which the city banks refuse to take and the aggregate limit instead of being the capital would be the limit of the bonded debt of the United States."},{"1":"1907","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"preserved Lincolns exact words for tile historian and marked ain epoch in our history.

Oklahoma had been given a most generous school grant. Indian Territory was given $5.000.000 fiat as an endowment to balance. When we came to examine the educational situation in New Mexico and Arizona. the quantity of land which was taken up for forest reserves. the quantity liable to withdrawal under the Reclamation Service. we found that even if we gave this new state as much land as was given to Utah. to wit. four sections. we would be giving it a very uncertain school equipment indeed. because no human being can say. with any approximation to the truth. what is the value of these four sections. It is not as if we were creating a state that has not been settled for a long time. It is not as if we were creating a state where the lands were still open to settlement. As the facts show. valuable land has been taken by private land grants and that land which may be made valuable can be withdrawn under the irrigation act. which I think the Senator approves of. and other valuable land is in the forest reserves. So. Mr. President. even giving four sections. as was given to Utah. we still endow this new state with a much more limited school fund than we endowed Utah with. So we made it up by making a cash appropriation. such as we made to the people of the Indian Territory. To have done anything else for those people would have been one of the greatest pieces of injustice we could have perpetrated upon them. because-"},{"1":"1905","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I do not think there is any estimate of the salaries separate and distinct from the labor. although It is easily ascertainable.

Then comes the estimate of the amount due through the Pan-. ama Railroad Company for material and services. That. of course. does not include labor. Then there is another one of the amount due the Panama Railroad Company from December to June. 1906."},{"1":"1904","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Oh. yes. and we have allowed the whole existing force under current law to remain. so that it gives the Department generous appropriation. With reference to the Treasury Department. more especially with reference to the Comptroller and the Auditors. your committee has been most considerate and allow almost wholly the estimates made. We recognize the labor and the watchful care that have become necessary in the settlement of the unlimited number of accounts as well as a more critical examination. and we have determined. so far as we can. to accept the estimates submitted and to expect in return safe and creditable results. Appropriations for the collection of internal revenue are virtually existing law. Independent treasuries are but slightly increased. There is a limited increase in mints and assay offices. Sometime during the debate of the bill. not at this time. if it is suggested from the other side of the House. under the appropriation for mints and assays. I shall be glad to take up the question of the New Orleans mint. That item can be taken up in debate when we reach the paragraphs. At this time I do not consider it necessary. unless the proposition comes from the other side of the House to change the recommendation which is made in the bill. The allowances for the Territories are somewhat increased in amount to meet the requirements of what is known as the assembling every other year of the legislatures of the Territories. The amount is therefore increased to that extent. To the War Department we consider we have been generous. but we ask for the consideration of this provision as an amendment: Povided. That no person employed hereunder shall be paid anygreater rate of compensation during the fiscal year 1905 than he was paid under this appropriation prior to January 1.1904. except on promotion to fill a vacancy. nor shall vacancies occurring from any cause hereunder .be filled except by promotion of persons employed under and paid from this appropriation. Under the temporary allowance for the current year the Department has had at its discretion the sum of $541.000. We have reduced that allowance to $325.000. but in making that change and reduction we have given a permanent clerical force to the Bureau of Insular Affairs. in number fiftyfive and salaries aggregating $65.240. together with an increase in the Record and Pension Office. which I submit: Record and Pension Offlce.-The Secretary of War having transferred to this Office certain work heretofore done in the offices of the AdjutantGeneral and SurgeonGeneral. there were transferred to the former from the latter two officesseventyfiveclerks: but on estimates submitted by the chief of the Office the force is reorganized. making a reduction of twentyseven clerks. with a compensation aggregating $25.780.

This we think will be ample. aided by the economies which the Secretary of War in his testimony before the subcommittee stated he might be able to carry out. and it is further to be consideredthe fact was disclosed in our hearingsthat the Secretary was abroad under the direction of the Presidentwas not in the city of Washingtonat the time when the estimates were submitted. and. without in any wise questioning the judgment of the Assistant Secretary. his whole testimony led to the conviction on the part of the committee that we could make a radical reduction in the temporary force. In the Navy Department. as gentlemen will recollect. a year ago under existing law the millions of dollars carried in the naval bill for the Increase of the Navy are subject to this provision: That the* Secretary of the Navy may employ and pay out of the appropriations for new ships such civilian experts. aids. additional draftsmen. writers. copyists. and model makers on the designs thereof as may be necessary. In other words. with this vast sum of money. running into millions. the Secretary can. without limit or qualification. under the existing law. employ such subordinate force on his own suggestion or upon the request of his chiefs of bureaus as he may see fit to order. In other words. Secretary Moody a year ago. in reply to a question whether he had such discretion. replied as I read: Absolutely. you could do with me just as you please and I could laugh In your faces. and I could go back to my Department and employ just as many clerks as I care to under the appropriation for the  Increase of the Navy. That exact language was in his testimony before the committee one year ago. In view of the suggestion of the Secretary. opened. I think. in the general hearing by my friend from Indiana . as to the wisdom of his action under existing law. the Secretary and the committee agreed that he should take the matter into consideration for one year. and he now comes to us. taking the clerical and subordinate force now on the rolls. amounting in round numbers to $155.000. and transfers it bodily to the permanent force of the Navy Department. so that the exhibit may be correct. so that there shall be a limitation upon this allowance under existing statutes. He then asks that he may have leeway for draftsmen and such technical men as may be needed. that from the fund for the JANuAiY 12. increase of the Navy he shall be limited to $120.000 the next year. having full knowledge of the increase of the Navy as it now exists. and possibly to some extent as to the recommendations. In addition we allow. as he requests. $30.000 for public workslargely to employ draftsmen and to put it within his power in that character of work. as the work increases. to use perhaps the full amount. or. as the work decreases. to make such changes or removals as he may think justified. This is the whole purpose of the amendment in the bill covering this change in existing law. We had the pleasure of inviting before our committee the chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs [Mr. Foss]. We gave him a hearing and invited him to make suggestions. I do not see him now present. but I think he will be in full accord with our action in the interest of better administration for the reason that this is the earnest recommendation of the Secretary and wholly in the lines of economy. In the items for Department of Commerce and Labor we have made careful scrutiny and have been compelled to make some reductions in the estimates. We feel. however. that as the appropriation for the next year is so much larger than the appropriation made in the current law. this Department shall have opportunity to broaden its field of action throughout all of its bureaus. It would seem. and I make reference to it for no invidious purpose. but to show you that in the testimony of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor he made a statement that his Department. if allowed the estimates submitted. would become the fourth Department of the Government. Your committee feel. in view of his requested allowance. that we might wisely go slowly in the development of the manufacturing bureau as well as the corporation bureau. and. in fact. throughout all the details of this new Department in its proposed development. It appeared in the report on the Department of Commerce. by Senator NELSON. of Minnesota. that the bill then under consideration would increase the salary roll only to the extent of $15.000. and all expenses would reach about $50.000. In the bill under consideration the exhibit shows that the appropriations for the current year amount to $1.667.690. estimated for 1905. $2.799.660. recommended in the present bill. $2.098.270.84. Of course I do not make these comparisons invidiously. but to suggest that we were compelled to make reasonable limitations and reductions for the coming year. If it is necessary as we proceed with the bill to explain any of the suggested changes. I shall have pleasure in doing so. While. of course. some of the amendments in the bill may be subject to a point of order. I would emphasize to the House that every amendment we have submitted is wholly in the line of good administration and economy. We have provided. in connection with the contingent funds of the several Departments of the Government. that the allowances shall be lived up to and no Department shall exceed the law in contingent expenditures. Almost every Department comes to Congress each year asking for deficiency. This is all wrong. Congress in its enactment desires to hold the contingent funds the same as we hold the classified force. It shall not exceed the allowance. and the purpose in putting the limitation upon the appropriation demands a more watchful care over the fund. I will reserve the balance of my time. and as we proceed with the bill will explain any of the paragraphs-"},{"1":"1903","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I wish I had longer time. not to talk about this particular bill. for that is already dead. and we ought not to say anything but good of the dead. but I would like to point out some of the shortcomings of the Republican party in the matter of currency legislation. Now. you have been in power for six years. and session after session you have confessed your incompetency to deal with the currency question. You have brought forward. after six years of assiduous labor. the Fowler bill. which has been condemned by bankers. which has not met the approval of the business interests of the country. and is now spit upon by the Republican membership in this House. and awaits only a few hours to receive some sort of decent form of interment. You brought forward this bill which the gentleman from New Jersey undertook in a very labored argument to explain. but he has convinced nobody. it seems. of its merits. He brought forward five or six .diagrams with zigzag marks on them looking like Mount Pelee in eruption. When we heard that long and extensive speech of his. we thought that so far as touching the financial question was concerned we might as well have witnessed thb eruption of Mount Pelee. I was told that the guides around the Capitol a few days ago. in showing the curiosities. came upon these diagrams. The visitors naturally enough said. What are these curious things? The guides said. This is Mr. FOWLERS illustration of the eruption of Mount Pelee. Now this is the Fowler bill. Mr. Chairman-"},{"1":"1902","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. if the argument of the distinguished exSenator from Vermont be applied to the provisions of the pending bill. how can it be constitutional to discriminate in favor of the shipping of the United States by giving it a special bounty or subsidy without extending the same subsidy to all the different interests of this great country? If shipping is to be subsidized. why not agriculture? Why not mining? How is it that we have the constitutional power to open the door of the Treasury to the wealthy corporations owning the shipyards of the United States and close the same door to the farmer struggling from year to year for the necessaries of life. or the miner shut out from the sunlight. living beneath the surface of the earth in order to gain a precarious livelihood? But the Senator from Maine tells us that to put that clause in the HannaFrye bill. in the bill now before the Senate. would be in contravention of 21 commercial treaties of the United States. Will the Senator from Maine tell us what treaty provision would be violated by such an enactment? Is it possible that we have not a right in subsidizing our own ships to say that they shall carry a cargo to onehalf of their commercial capacity? Is it possible that we have been so suicidal as to take from ourselves this power by any treaty stipulation whatever? The Senator from Maine is a member of the Committee on Foreign Relations. I will yield the floor with pleasure for his exilanation of this extraordinary assertion. as it appears to me. hero are the provisions? What is the proof of this assertion by the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Commerce and President pro tempore of the Senate? Have we bound our. hands so that we can not impose conditions upon our own vessels? If so. by what provision. in what treaty. at what time was this extraordinary conclusion reached? Mr. President. we are told that the great and crucial point in this controversy is that of wages. that we must subsidize our ships in order to equalize the difference in wages. both in construction and running the ship. between those of foreign countries and the United States. The Senator from Maine. with his usual courage and frankness. tells us that subsidy means protection. and he could have said that protection means subsidy. The manufacturers of the United States. the mill owners of the United States are receiving today upon their manufactured goods more than the 35 per cent levied by the tariff upon the consumers of this country. and this is done -under the pretext that we must equalize the wages of the mill operatives of the United States with those of the pauper operatives of Europe. And now we see these same subsidized manufacturers. with a monopoly of the home market. and an exclusive tariff tax which practically excludes all competition from abroad. sending the same goods upon which the consumers of this country are taxed 85 per cent to the countries where pauper labor is found and selling in those markets the goods 80 to 40 per cent cheaper than they are sold to the people of their own country. But some Senator. as I happened to hear. says that this builds up our industries. Mr. President. without the enormous increase of gold. without foreign wars. without failure in crops. the industries of the United States would not have prospered. if prospered they have. by reason of the enormous tariff tax alone. It is singular that we now hear the same argument in behalf of the bill before the Senate. We are told that the difference in. wages is the chief argument for the enactment of this bill into law. that the laborers in the shipyards. that the sailors upon our vessels must by a subsidy be put upon a par with the lower wages that are paid by the maritime nations of Europe in their shipyards and upon their ships. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that I believe the time was when the shipyards of the United States were unable to compete with those of Europe. but I believe that time has passed. If it has not completely passed. it has come so near to the time that the extraordinary remedy of subsidy should not be resorted to. when. the shipyards of the United States are more prosperous than they have been in the last fifty years. The Senators from Ohio and Maine say the wages upon ships are governed by the law of the flag and not by the law of the port. They would have us believe the monstrous proposition that when an American steanship like the St. Louis goes into the port of Southampton and the port rate of wages is $30 a month for ablebodied seamen. a sailor who sees the American flag at the head of the mast refuses to ship upon that vessel unless he receives $45 or $50 a month because it is an American ship. The proposition is so monstrous that. in my judgment. with all respect. it scarcely deserves to be called an argument. The law of the port governs and not the law of the flag. It may be true that racial prejudice would cause the Norwegian to prefer a Norwegian ship and Norwegian sailors with whom to mess. but as a rule. almost without exception. when a ship needs a crew in a foreign port or in a port of the United States the landlords of the sailors boarding houses furnish the crew. and the sailor who ships receives the wages that then obtain in that port. I again call to the stand as a competent witness the Commissioner of Navigation. and I ask the Secretary to read the two following extracts as a complete answer to the argument made by the distinguished Senators who defend the bill."},{"1":"1901","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"As I said in the- beginning. the Senator knows that I would utter no criticism of him in any unkindness. Nothing could induce me to do that. and I do not so mean it. but I repeat that in selecting a committee the Senator from Maine. if he had selected a committee of Senators from the presiding officers chair. would have had represented every interest. He would have put on at least some of the representatives of the farming interest. if they were to be the beneficiaries. He would have put on men whom he had reason to believe were opposed to the views that were presented. so that there might have been a fair and impartial measure presented. I say that for him. If he had been acting in his official capacity he would have made a committee in a different way. Not only that. but the Senator himself said in his speechor if not there. in reply to something said by the Senator from Missouri at some time upon this floorthat heput no man on the committee whom he believed or knew to be in favor of free ships. It may be ignorance. but there are thousands of people in this country who are not ignorant who do believe that the only way to restore our merchant marine and have the American flag float in foreign seas is by giving our people the right to buy ships wherever they can buy them cheapest. It seems to me that in constituting this committee its recommendation would have carried more weight if the Senator from Maine had given each of the different interests representation upon it. But that is only a question of method. and does not go to the merits of the bill. Yet as I said before. the most astonishing thing to me is that the Senator from Maine. usually so fair. of such universally conceded ability. should in the face of this fact tell the Senate that the great beneficiaries under the bill are those engaged in agricultural pursuits. Mr. President. for three years these shipbuilders. these shipowners. the men representing the companies to which this subsidy will go. have urged and sought the passage of this bill in every possible way. They have been in the room of the Committee on Commerce again and again. they have been in the Marble Room in consultation from time to time with the friends of the bill. they have hired newspapers to support the measure. they have sent out tons of literature to all parts of the country. they employed with their money. I presume. a lawyer among the ablest counsel in the United States of America. and yet time Senator from Maine would have us believe that those gentlemen quit their business. spent their money. hired this great lawyer. came here from day to day. and that they did it in the interest of the farming and agricultural classes of this country. It is not reasonable to believe it. It is contrary to human nature. No farmer of whom I have heard has ever come to urge the passage of this bill. The Senator from Maine says that they had a representative before the committee who urged a bounty upon farm products exported abroad. Not a single farmer. so far as I knowI will take that back. I was going to say or anyone who represented a farmeris in favor of the bill. I received some time last fall. I think it was. from the president of some kind of a farmers association in the State of Minnesota a printed letter. in which he urged me to support the bill now pending in the United States Senate. which was the farmers bill. a bill that was originated for their benefit. He said he hoped I would give it my vote. because it was for the benefit of the farmers. Yet I say that the president of the company which is to get the largest amount of this subsidy. the shipbuilders. the Cramps. already immensely wealthy. Theodore C. Search. the head of the Manufacturers Association of the United States. are the men who put up the money. hired the lawyer. and have spent their time and their money to promote the passage of this bill. which is. according to the Senator from Maine. to benefit and is for the benefit of the Minnesota farmers organization. It may be true. but I do not believe it. When we come to see the provisions of the bill I can well understand why this association and these great corporations should support it. I spoke of Mr. Charles H. Cramp. The Senator from Missouri but a few days ago read in the Senate from an article over Mr. Cramps signature. in which he stated that we could compete with all the world in the building of ships. When he wrote that article he stated that by reason of the superiority of American workmanship and the cheapness of iron and coal and for many other reasons we could build ships here as cheaply as anywhere else in the world. I do not criticise him. I presnme it is human nature. but I would not consider as giving this bill any peculiar or particular advantage the testimony and recommendations in favor of this bill of a man who made that statement over his own signature. occupying the high position he does. who now comes. and because he sees an opportunity to get a part of the nine millions. sends out petitions. and I have one here. directed to his workmen asking them to circulate it and get it signed by the men employed by him. stating that the bill was for their benefit.. Later I will send to the desk and have printed in the RECORD the letter from Charles H. Cram in which he tells his workmen everywhere to get up petitions. Yet the Senator from Maine would say that that was evidence of public sentiment amongst the workingmen of this country. He would so say. notwithstanding the fact that the Federation of Labor. the largest organization of workingmen in this country. have already denounced the bill. notwithstanding the fact that grange after grange and farmers organization after farmers organization throughout the whole land have placed their stamp of disapproval upon it. notwithstanding the fact that the men who raise the cattle and the hogs that are to be shipped abroad have also opposed it. Still Mr. Cramp seeks to make us believe that this is the spontaneous action of the workingmen employed by him. [The William Cramp & Sons Ship and Engine Building Company. Charles H. Cramp. president. Office of the president. Beach and Ball streets.] PHILADELPHIA. January 7. 1901. DEAR Sin: There is probably no need at this time of calling your attention to the fact that the shipping bill now pending in Congress is a matter of supreme national importance. Its influence on the prosperity of the country at large will be very great. inasmuch as from almost every State in the Union comes some component part of the building or equipment of ships. From every point of view a measure of this sort is a national necessity. and therefore I ask you personally to give the matter your earnest consideration and request your cooperation in furthering its passage. To this end may I suggest that you write personally to the Senators of your State and to your Congressional Repreoentatives. requesting that they exert their influence and cast their votes in support of the measure? I shall be glad to hear from you on this subject. and shall greatly appreciate any effort you may make toward the success of this measure. Yours. very truly."},{"1":"1900","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I desire to make a statementin connection with this amendment.

It can not be possible that the framers of the Constitution. who had so recently rebelled against the arbitrary authority of the imperial government. declaring that all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. deliberately intended to provide authority in this Government to hold and govern people as subjects without a single right of person or property. If Congress can govern the island possessions without regard to the Constitution. it would be impossible to conceivb of a despotism more absolute. It will be no answer to say that our policy toward them will be liberal and benevolent. for the character of a government is not determined by the manner in which its affairs are administered. but by the presence or absence of constitutional safeguards for time protection of the rights and liberties of the people. A government is none the less a despotism because it has a benevolent despot. It is difficult to believe that the fathers who laid the foundations for the Government had in mind any such a despotic power. This Government. that fifty years ago hardly knew where to find authority to preserve its own existence. must have had a marvelous development indeed if it can now govern vassal states at its own arbitrary will. Our relations with the Indian tribes afford no precedent for such a course. because we justify our treatment of them on the .round that they are aliens. nontaxable. owing no allegiance to the Government. We expect to tax the inhabitants of our insular possessions and require of them allegiance to the Government. The Federal Supreme Court has repeatedly decided that residents of Territories are citizens of the United States and entitled to the privileges and immunities of the Constitution as amply as citizens of the States. The Federal Constitution confers no political powers upon its citizens. Those rights are conferred by the States. and Territories are under the control of Congress. consequently their inhabitants possess only such political rights as Congress sees fit to grant them. Congress has the power to govern Territories by any agencies it may establish. provided it violates none of the personal guaranties of the Constitution. It need not provide any degree of local selfgovernment. but may enact all the laws and regulations for their government. as it does now for the District of Columbia. and it may. in its discretion. continue that kind of government indefinitely. There is an abundance of power to govern Territories by laws adapted to their stage of development. but what I have endeavored to demonstrate is that when territory is annexed to this country it becomes part of the Republic and the Constitution automatically extends over it. and its inhabitants are entitled to the privileges and immunities of Federal citizenship. Among the important rights secured to citizens of the United States by the Constitution is that of free commercial and social intercourse with all the people of the country. We will have no more authority to exclude the citizens of the Philippines from the States than we will have to exclude the citizens of the States from the Philippines. Neither can we tax the commerce of the islands for the privilege of coming into the markets here. This is the important and intensely practical aspect of the situation that I desire to impress upon gentlemen in this discussion. The Constitution declares that all duties. imposts. and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States. We can not impose duties in ports of entry in the islands different from those imposed in the ports of the States. we can not impose a higher rate of internal taxation upon the islands than we impose at home. Chief Justice Marshall. the ablest of a long line of able American jurists. in applying that clause of the Constitution to Territories. said: The eighth section of the first article gives to Congress the power to lay and collect taxes. duties. imposts. and excises for the purposes thereinafter mentioned. This grant is general. without limitation as to place. It consequently extends to all places over which the Government extends. If this could be doubted. the doubt would be removed by the subsequent words which modify the grant. These words are. but all duties. imposts. and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States. It will not be contended that the modification of the power extends to places to which the power does not extend. The power. then. to lay and collect duties. imposts. and excises may be exercised and must be exercised throughout the United States. Does this term designate the whole or any particular portion of the American empire? Certainly this question can admit of but one answer. It is the name given to one great Republic which is composed of States and Territories. The District of Columbia. with the territory west of the Mississippi. is not less within the United States than Maryland or Pennsylvania. and it is not less necessary. on the principles of our Constitution. that uni. formity in the imposition of imposts. duties. and excises should be observed in the one than in the other. Since. then. the power to lay and collect taxes. which includes direct taxes. is obviously coextensive with the power to lay and collect duties. imposts. and excises. and since the latter extends throughout the United States. it follows that the power to impose direct taxes also extends throughout the United States. (Loughborough vs. Blake. 5 Wheaton. 317.) That decision has been cited with approval in repeated instances by the Federal Supreme Court. and the principle has been so frequently reasserted that it is no longer an open question. if. indeed. it ever was. It is useless to speculate about the power of Congress to tax the products of the insular territories seeking a market here. in the face of that constitutional requirement. Much is said respecting the supreme character of treaties negotiated by the executive department of the Government. It is claimed that they are above the Constitution. and that conditions contained in a treaty ceding territory to this country are valid without regard to the Constitution. The treatymaking power is given by the Constitution and is subject to its limitations. Does anyone contend that the powers of Congress may be enlarged. that its limitations may be abrogated by the terms of a treaty? Suppose in ceding Porto Rico Spain should have stipulated in the treaty that human slavery should be perpetually maintained on the island: will it be claimed that Congress. in making rules and regulations for the government of the island. would have the power to foster and encourage that barbarous institution? Or suppose in the cession of the Hawaiian Republic it had been conditioned upon the establishment and permanent maintenance of a particular system of religion by the Government. would that have given Congress the power. in the face of the express prohibition contained in the Constitution. to establish and maintain by law a system of religion? Or again. suppose the treaty of cession should have contained stipulations providing for a system of taxation different from that maintained in other parts of the United States. would that abrogate the requirement in the Constitution that taxes shall be uniform throughout the United States? I assert that the only power on earth that can enlarge. modify. or change the Constitution abides with the people of the country. The treatymaking power is as clearly subject to the limitations of the Constitution as any other department of the Government. What. then. becomes of the opendoor policy of the Philippines? Can a peace commission set aside the Constitution? Uniformity of taxation and free intercourse between all of the citizens of the country constitute the strongest bond of national unity. They have unified sentiment. promoted homogeneity. and made us a nation in fact as well as in name. Among all the provisions of the Constitution none illustrate the exalted statesmanship of the convention that framed that great charter more fully than these. and we can not afford to abandon them now. In this brief discussion of these great questions I have aimed to demonstrate that the newly acquired islands must occupy the status of Territories. covered and protected by the Constitution in so far as its guaranties of personal rights and privileges extend. There can he no doubt that the products of the islands will e entitled to free markets in all the States. The new possessions will increase our annual expenditures at least $100.000.000 a year and diminish our customs receipts at least $50.000.000 a yeara difference of $150.000.000 annually. and the question is. How will we obtain the revenue to make it up? I submit these observations. not for the purpose of criticising the expansion policy. but because they present an important business proposition which w e ststtle at an early date. We can not solve it by pretending not to see it. or by trying to think about something else. because it is a living. burning question affecting all departments of the Government. It maybe that the new policy will bring markets for our wares and opportunities for our people that will more than compensate for the increased expense and the loss of revenue. and I sincerely hope it will. but I am discussing now only the revenue aipect of the situation. It is evident that we must have larger resort to the excise system as a permanent source of income. The country was led to believe that the warrevenue law would only be temporary. but conditions are such that that hope must be disappointed. We should proceed without delay to revise and enlarge that law with the view of its permanency. or we must increase our bonded debt. which has already gone up from $585.000.000 in 1893 to over a billion dollars. and it will be further increased $150.000.000 by the construction of the Nicaragua Canal. an improvement which the country seems to demand. The policy of bperating the Government on borrowed money will not commend itself to the wisdom of the people. We can not lay to our souls the happy unction that since an overpowering destiny brought the islands under our control. a bounteous Providence will provide ways and means for their government.. Means will not come from heaven as manna in the wilderness. but Congress must provide them from its constitutional resources. The expansion policy was inaugurated by Admiral Dewey at Manila. and it was carried into execution by the force of public opinion. and I have no doubt that the country will submit willingly to all reasonable requirement for its perfection. But it may be well to be admonished that while its burdens and responsibilities will begin at once. it will require considerable time to realize its benefits. This great Government has had a succession of brilliant achievements in all its relations. and advocates of the new policy assure us that it will be no exception to our splendid history. Our manufactures and farm products are to find rich markets in the Orient. which will infuse new life and energy into all of our activities. I have aimed in these remarks to call attention to some of the practical aspects of the situation. We must have a larger army. The new conditions imperatively demand it. and our resources are ample to meet all the expenses that will be necessarily incurred."},{"1":"1898","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"As I was saying. we can not have an increase of wages in New England until the South has advanced wages and shortened the hours of labor to the New England standard. Then we shall all advance our wages. North and South together. all our products will grow cheaper in price together. and the laboring man will improve his condition. and both end in lower prices and higher wages. It is notorious that cotton and wheat are produced in this country in excess of the demand. There is an overproduction. I was told by one of the largest producers of wheat in Kentucky year before last that he could make more money with modern appliances in raising wheat at 60 cents a bushel today than he could for a dollar a bushel before 1860 with the appliances then used. No one claims that the tariff is wholly responsible for the rise of the price of wheat. but I want to call the attention of the honorable gentleman from Tennessee to published statistics. showing that the consumption of wheat and corn and all other things per capita in this country was from onequaxter to onethird less under the Wilson bill than under the McKinley bill. Why? Because wages were less. Our market is in wages. The people were out of employment by thousands and hundreds of thousands. and therefore the average consumption of products went down. The increase in the consumption of products today in this country will increase somewhat the price of wheat and corn and oats and of all products of that kind. but not very materially. they are now produced with so little labor. We do not claim anythingof thatkind. We admit. and have always admitted. that the short crop in Europe was largely responsible. was the largest element at any rate. in the increase in the price of wheat in this country. Until the cotton is less in volume in proportion to its consumption. the price of cotton can not materially advance. and every gentleman on that side knows it. and he knows. furthermore. that the coining in of Texas to compete with the rest of the South. with their older lands. in producing cotton. has had more to do with the depreciation in the price of cotton than all other things combined. Just a word about strikes. Why. gentlemen. do you not know that a man working fourteen hours a day and working for 50 cents a day never was known to strike. Do you not know. gentlemen. that the men who strike are the ones who are receiving the highest wages. those that are the most independent and prosperous. those that are the most ambitious to get on?"},{"1":"1897","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. there is no arena which death does not invade.

Others have given detailed accounts of the life and career of Hon. CHARLES F. CRISP. I shall speak mainly of his character and his service in the legislative forum. where I knew him best and where I respected and admired him as a leader and loved him as a friend. I first met him when I commenced my service as a Representative in Congress in 1885. My admiration for himgrew as I became better acquainted with him. and I was deeply impressed With his XXIX55 genial. pleasant nature. and with the promptness and readiness with which he met every emergency. I regarded him as a noble type of American manhood. able. logical. selfmade. and selfreliant. and always courteous. courpgeous. and true. He was firm and sincere in his convictions. faithful to his triends. liberal to his opponents. fair. just. and conscientious. and unceasing in the discharge of his duties as a Representative. He was the faithful friend and champion of the people. He loved liberty. civil. political. and religious. and he was devoted to popular government. He was bothapatriotapd a philanthropist. No man gave greater and more continued evidence of his love of country. and no man was more prompt to aid a friend or give freely to the needy and deserving. He worked for what he regarded as the rights of the people. and did all in his power to protect the interests and promote the welfare and prosperity of the Republic. and the radiance of his integrity and the brightness of his honor were never assailed or questioned. He was devoted to his wife. his children. and his home. and no husband or father was ever the recipient of more love and respect. His family circle was full of affection and sweet communion. and here he illustrated how happy a man could be who was trying to do his duty to his God. his family. and his country. His life and achievements illustrated not only the splendid opportunities of our great Republic. but showed also the honorable success and great renown that will crown earnest efforts. striSt integrity. and steadfast devotion to duty. The first and last conspicuous events in his life showed not only his courage. ability. and selfreliance. but also the confidence. admiration. and love lavished upon him. by those who knew him best. At 16 years of age he proved his courage and selfreliance by enlisting as a soldier in the Confederate army and bravely fighting until the close of the war for what he believed to be right. When he was 51 years of age. the people of Georgia. who had for more than a quarter of a century studied his public service and his fidelity to his State and nation. sought to confer upon him the highest honor in their gift by making him a United States Senator. and practically all of the State senators and representatives elected were instructed by the people to honor him with this great office. but his death prevented this great trust and wellmerited distinction from being conferred upon him. His views on finance. taxation. education. commerce. agriculture. an economical administration of the Govenment. the sovereignty of the people. and the independence of the coordinate departments of the Government. and on all other important questions presented. were often announced in strong and eloquent speeches. which are found in nearly every volume of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD issued since his service as Representative commenced. As an earnest. fearless champion of Democracy. he was always ready to defend his party and his principles. and he loved to uphold and support the teachings and doctrines of Jefferson and Jackson. Itwas as Speaker of the House of Representatives he gained his highest honors and made himself most conspicuous before the country. His knowledge of parliamentary law and procedure. his equipoise. and the ease. dignity. firmness. and fairness with which he presided made him popular with the members of all political parties and enabled him to conduct the business with order and ispatch. I believe the dispassionate judgment of those over whom he presided for four years is that he is entitled to be remembered as one of the ablest and most accomplished of the Speakers of the House of Representatives. The history of Georgia is luminous with the names of brilliant. earnest. and faithful statesmen. Among the ablest and strongest of that great galaxy the name of CHARLES F. CRISP has taken its permanent place. His fame does not belong to Georgia alone. nor to the South. but to the whole Republic. and in Kentucky we will cherish his memory. and his fame will survive along with that of the other dead statesmen. jurists. and heroesHill. Toombs. Colquitt. and Brownwho did so much to make Georgia conspicuous and illustrious. It is written in one of the tender and beautiful legends which the Talmud has preserved that at the moment of the death of a good man memories of his love and charity and good deeds float through his mind to cheer and console him as his spirit soars away from the careq. and conflicts. the joys and sorrows. of life. If this be true. our friend in his last moments. when the darkness of death was settling upon him and the first glimpse of immortality was beginning to be seen. had much to soothe and comfort him. Reviewing his life. his early manhood. his mature years. he could see glittering and glistening along his way good deeds which benefited his fellowmen in the State and in the nation. He could see fidelity and devotion to loved ones at home. he could J uARY 16. see charity and love. fragrant as flowers in springtime. beautifying and chastening a life well spent in the service of his God and hi1s country. and at the end of it all. I believe. he could hear the welcome plaudit. Well done. thou good and faithful servant. enter thou into the joy of thy Lord."},{"1":"1896","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"But I wish to say a word more. A great part of the area of the State of Florida has been taken away from the settlers upon the public lands of the United States who have. by law.. a right to them. We should not be so considerate of the claims of the nonresident people in the shape of corporations as to deprive the people who are to live and labor on this land of their right under the law. The Interior Department should not be allowed to approve and patent land that is obviously not within the terms of the act and which they are prohibited from doing. This is a subject which should have the attention of Congress. Nothing can be more oppressive to the people than to allow the public land to be unlawfully approved in great bodies to individuals and land speculators. agents. and corporations. I have not drawn the resolution with a view of censuring or affecting any corporation. but I have a letter from settlers who in that far region of the South. away down upon the coast near Cape Sable. desire to make a home there. and they are making application for the land and stating that it is high and dry land and suitable for settlement. and they are informed from the Interior Dearitment that without a survey and without examination it has een approved as swamp and overflowed land under the selection of some agent or other. That is the whole of it. and I was further informed by an official letter from the Department some months ago that there was an agreement to approve nearly the whole peninsula of Florida. under the name of the Everglades. by its exterior lines and without an interior survey or examination. to the State. and that would be to railroad corporations and would cover the whole area with a denial of the right to free homes: M Air.

There is no objection to that. What I do object to is the coming in and taking of those things for granted and having the Senate order legislation before the committee have inquired into the facts or into the necessity for it. but if the Senator now consents to the amendment that they shall report such legislation as in their judgment may be necessary.

There is apparently evoked much feeling which. it seems to me. is rather the expression of individuals in their individual capacity than the judgment of Senators in their capacity as Senators. I desire scrupulously to avoid any such line of discussion. I share the sentiments with which the Senator from Delaware so eloquently and nobly concluded the remarks which he has just addressed to the Senate. I believe I can say. without the offense of egotism. that I have been a faithful observer of the principle of duty which he so eloquently and vigorously enunciated. for. from the time when this bill was first under discussion until the last day of Its consideration. I refrained. often against a strong impulse. from occupying any of that precious time which was so fearfully wasted in the long protraction of socalled debate. Sir. I wish now to add no word that shall be or tend to any undue consumption of time. We have heard read from the desk today a petition. brief and to the point. from a large number of the business men of this country. which expresses the aspiration. the eager hope. of the entire people of the country. that this legislative assembly. and its associate in legislation. shall bring to a speedy and a profitable endthis long. wearisome. and exacting struggle. The business interests of this country lie waiting opportunity to take a leap forward. to relieve depression. to assuage suffering. to uplift the hope of our country and our people again. Let us then deal with this question so as to promote that end. What now is the immediate step which we are bound to take? We have passed through that stage of our deliberations which was necessary to the passage by the Senate of a tariff bill. we have sent that bill to the other House loaded down with amendments. expressing the various opinions entertained at this end of the Halls of Legislation. After long conference the conferees representing the two Houses have disagreed. the struggle between the two has failed to bring to us a single point of yielding on the one side or the other so far as the report of the committee of conference indicates. and it is proposed now that the Senate shall insist upon every one of the six hundred and thirtyfour amendments which it made to the bill. Mr. President. without a word of personal crimination. criticism. or reproach. what is the duty. not of an individual Senator. but of this Senate. this great American legislative Chamber in dealing with this contingency? There are three considerations to which Iwish to invite attentionwith reference to our relation to the House of Representatives in respect to this particular measure. . First. the Constitution of the United States gave a certain superiority of place and right in the consideration of revenue measures to the House of Representatives. It awarded to that House the sole privilege of originating a proposal to tax the people. That did not find its place in the Constitution of the United States as a mere prescription of a mode of business. The Constitution was not laying down a rule of order. It declared a principle. and we know whence that principle was derived. It came from the constitution of Great Britain. and it carried into our Constitution the expression of the doctrine. which has been maintained there through the centuries of their liberty. that it was in the Commons. the immediate representatives of the people. that the right of taxation primarily lay. Sir. another thing I desire to mention. a fact rather than a principle. in exact accordance with this to which I have drawn attention. is that in truth the members of the House of Representatives. with whom we are now in contention. are the more immediate representatives of the people. They came to their seats by the choice of the electors in their several districts at the last election. and the great majority in that House in favor of tariff reform is the latest expression of the people of the United States. coming from them after many years of laborious agitation and education. This body contains within its numbers able. honorable. and venerable men. some of whom we might fairly say come down to us from a past generation. they have been here a great number of years. and all of them are entitled to the highestconsideration in every respect. Still the fact corresponds with the very idea in and upon which the Constitution predicated the proposition that taxation should originate with the immediate representatives of the people. Sir. let me add another thing. which appeals. it seems to me. with great force to the Democratic Senators upon this side of the Chamber. We have to deal with a body composed in large majority of members of the party to which we belong. whose principles we reverence as those which alone can preserve the liberties of our country and carry forward true measures of justice to our people. As a more coordinate branch of the Legislature. we owe duty to deal with that body in the spirit of fraternity and conciliation. in the spirit of Democratic kindness. and with effort to agree in expression of Democratic principles in our tariff legislation. We owe that duty generally. indeed in every case. It is peculiarly a duty in respect to revenue legislation. Mr. President. having in view these three propositions. what is the situation in which we find ourselves at this time? That body which possesses the right to originate measures of taxation. after months of arduous labor. sent to us a measure of tariff taxation. not all that tariff reformers desired.but yet such in its completeness and general scheme that its passage through the House of Representatives was the scene of tumultuous joy there. responded to in the hearts of the American people throughout the land. That measure has now been almost six months in this Chamber. and this body. which possesses by the Constitution power only to suggest amendments. has been wrestling with it until it has metamorphosed it. and when at last our long and painful struggle was ended. and we sent it to the House of Representatives for their consideration of the amendments proposed. I grieve to say our enactment did not have the same cordial and cheerful response with which the original measure was received by the people of the United States. And. sir. this proposition is now that we shall insist upon every amendment sent to that body. For what purpose? To compel its submissign to the Senate. which has so changed the bill as that its friends would not recognize it. By what compulsion? Alas. only by public suffering. At what cost? The practical failure to pluck the fruits of victory. the result of the many years of struggle and contest through which the people of this country have passed. Mr. President. what can justify us in taking that extreme position now? Have we found the conferees representing the other House so unreasonable. so unwilling to yield anything. that there is no opportunity for fufther hope? By no means. It may certainly be gathered. from what has appeared through various sources of information. that there has been a spirit of conciliation. a spirit of concession. manifested on the part of the House of Representatives. And upon what particulars do we most insist? Upon them which in nature most peculiarly offend the spirit of the Constitution itself. We have insisted on putting on that measure subjects of taxation which the House of Representatives deliberately declared to be free. We have sought to make those things dutiable which the House of Representatives declared were improper to bear the burden of popular taxation. I feel that in the special feature to which my motion is addressed the attitude of the Senate is so especially uniDemocratic and unjust. that we ought. by receding from it. to tender to the House of Representatives an expression of our willingness to consider proper changes in the bill at the same time that we again send to them conferees with the general instruction to insist. Sir. I am willing to vote for the motion to insist upon every other amendment proposed by the Senate. provided only we take from it this peculiarly odious and offensive tax which is embraced in the article to which I have drawn attention by the motion."},{"1":"1893","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"who has since been made a Democratic Senator. summoned the people to drive out the  robber barons of our manufacturing industries as public enemies.who had their hands to the elbows in the pockets of the people. and declared that this land should be dedicated to free men. free labor. and free trade. The last national platform of the Democratic party was even more radical. as it denounced protection as both unconstitutional and a robbery. The President tells us in the very message which asks for the silver repeal that the Dext movement is to carry out the revenue tariff reform. to which he says  every effort of his Admntration is pledged. It is doubtful whether he ever realized the tremendous significance of such an assault upon American industrial institutions until he hiis recently seen the panic created by the mere apprehension of the tariffsmashing crusade. It promises no more mercy to the American farmer than to the American artisan: and in one of the progressive farming counties in my own district. where the tillers of the soil have subscribed hundreds of thousands of dollars to build a railroad now nearing completion. to furnish access for their Americ in agricultural productsto the American consumer. they are confronted by the Democratic partys threat to throw down all the barriers that protect their farms from foreign competition. and to lend the practical aid of the American Government to the Canadian farmer in underselling them in our own markets."},{"1":"1892","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. we have here a bill the merits of which will not be questioned. I believe. by anyone present. But even if the merits were to be questioned. the fact that every single armynurse bill that is presented here as a private bill at our Friday evening sessions goes through practically without objection is a sufficient argument. it seems to me. to quiet the mind of anybody as to the right. or. at least. as to t he wisdom. of passing a general bill. It has often been suggested here onFriday nights that instead of having so many private pension bills for aimy nurses we ought to have instead one general bill. The committee has responded to that call and has presented a bill with very close restrictions. Every army nurse who claims a pension under this bill must have served six months in the asfual care of the sick and wounded. not simply as an attach of the hospitals. but as one who actually cared for the sick and wounded at the bedside. Every claimant under this bill must also be now dependent upon her own personal labor for support. thus making a case of dependence. Now. if there are any questions to be asked about the bill I am prepared to answer them. but as time is of more importance to us than speechthis afternoon. I would prefer that the bill should be laid aside without further argument. However as I have said. if anyone wishes to ask me any questions I shall be glad to answer them.

I propose to vote against this bill on its final passage. as I have voted against it at every stage of the proceedings. I vote against it as a matter of principle. I have found it all I could do during my life to meet obligations that I fairly made. I have tried to do that. and I think I have fairly done so. That is all that this Government can be called upon to do. I do not believe there is any obligation on the Government to take upon itself this additional burden. The men who have worked in the navy yards and armories were glad to get the work. They took their places with their eyes open. They knew what their pay was to be and the hours of labor when employed. and I do not believe after these many years in the Government coming forward and paying them what is substantially a bounty. That is all there is of it. It is a bounty to a certain clas. it is a discrimination against the great laboring masses of this country. a discrimination against the many in favor of the few. and in the name of the laboring masses of this country. in the name of the men in my own State who work upon the prairie atnd in the shop. Iprotest against this class legislation. Why is the man working in a Government armory or navy yard better or entitled to more consideration than the farmer on the western prairie. the miner in the mine. or the artisan in the shop? It is not just. it is not right. and it is surely making a very. very bad precedent. If we are going back to attempt to right all these things. why not go back and pay the soldiers who were paid in greenbacks at half their value in gold? Why not equalize their pay? They are entitled to it ten thousand times more than are these few men. these favorites of the Government. who have always been seeking for these positions. and who were not obliged to take them unless they were willing to take them under the conditions which were offered.

I have not any doubt that as soon as this treaty has gone by the board we shall have a good many cases already manufactured. turned loose for the purpose of manufacturing opinion in this country. and I think if this debate should continue from now until Christmas it would be a great benefit to this people. so that as a matter of fact the fishermen could demonstrate to thecountry the advantages of ajoint ownership of a fishery on the Atlantic coast. I do think that there is not anything harder to arrange. anything more difficult of adjustment. than a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common in fisheries situated on the coast of Newfoundland. Labrador. Prince Edward Island. or wherever they may be. and whatever reasonable arrangement can be devised by which our fishermen and the Canadian fishermen can have a manner of proceeding provided by which they can keep the peace and still enjoy the riches of the seas in the yield of fish would be something that would attract the attention of this country. and the people of the United States would applaud us for not forcing conclusions when we are getting along so comfortably and peaceably as we are now. I am quite awareI have been aware all the timethat if this modus vivendi had not been established. or if the Government of Great Britain or the negotiators of this treaty had not tendered to us the modus vivendi. there would not have been such extreme anxiety to push this treaty overboard. Of course it is a conclusion that necessarily follows that if the treaty is defeated that concession on the part of the British Government would cease. and then would flare up again all the evils that have occurred under this treaty of 1818. such as have occurred every time that we have not had some accommodation. some arrangement with the British Government by which our fishermen could in peace and quietness enjoy the rights they have under the treaty of 1818. I therefore prefer. if I can have the indulgence of the Senate. to submit a few remarks on that subject before I get to the main question of the treaty. for the question of the treaty. Mr. President. is one that stands by itself. It is a question of fundamental and organic law. It is the same sort of question that I was speaking about in the remarks that the Senator from Ohio quoted awhile ago. when I said I saw no difficulty so far as concerned fundamental or organic law between the United States and Great Britain. If that Senator had thought a moment he would not have quoted that against me as relating to these arrangements for fishing. which are not fundamental and do not enter into the organic law of the treaty. do not measure any right of the British Government or British citizen. but relate only to the measures and regulations in force and necessary for the peaceful. quiet. and orderly conduct of the fishing rights and fishing ventures in that quarter. I say yet. as I have always said. that the organic law. the fundamental law as settled between the United States and Great Britain in the treaty of 1818 is a broad. plain. definite. and distinct arrangement. Some details were omitted. some are proposed to be added to it by an amendment in this treaty. some have been added to it by conciliation and concession. on two occasions at leastone at the time when the treaty of 1871 expired by our requirement in the middle of the fishing season. and another which was a supplement or appendix to the treaty now under consideration. The two arrangements that I have mentioned have been made to the satisfaction of the country. I think. I know that the arrangement now progressing. under the protocol to this treaty. is a very opportune one to keep down strife. I have heard of no conflict. no trouble. since this treaty was sent in to the Senate of the United States. and I should like very much indeed to maintain the status quo upon that. If we could get along just as well in our fishing matters with the Canadians for the next fifty or a hundred years as we have been getting along since this treaty was negotiated we should have very little cause for disturbance. We have seen that whenever we have abandoned some agreement. some arrangement for the settlement of this very intricate and joint right. on every occasion difficulties have sprung up. and of such a serious character that on frequent occasions both sides have had to send their navies into those fishing grounds for the purpose of protecting their people. In other words. the arm of war has had to follow along this peaceful work for the purpose of keeping the peoples in the enjoyment of their right in common of fishing in those waters. I desire very much indeed to do all that. lies in my duty and in my power to prevent any occasion or necessity for embroilment between ourselves and Great Britain or any other country. I think that is the highest and first duty of a Sengtor. And I think. as we are engaged here in negotiating a treatyfor that is the function we are performing nowit is our duty to look overthe entire field calmly.and not to rush to conclusions about it. It will not make very much in favor of the American people if the peace between Great Britain and the United States as to the enjoyment of these fishing rights is preserved for a month longer. I can see no reason for hurrying this treaty to an end. unless it may be some political reason. I do not know what we are going to gain by the destruction of this negotiation all of a sudden. I hear of no complaint against it anywhere in its actual operations. I do not know that we are suffering any detriment from it. I have heard no report of that kind. none comes up to the Senate. and none comes to the Department of State so far as I have heard. The urgency. it seems to me. for hurrying up the vote on this question must be of a partisan character. I have seen no reason of a public character suggested at all in regard to the operations of this treaty and its effect on the morale of the two countries that would indicate that there ought to be any haste in this discussion. Yet there seems to be great eagerness in it. great determination. Of course Senators must have their way. But I again announce that unless some reason is shown in public necessity for the destruction of this treaty right away.

I had shown that it will draw closer our relations with Mexico. and that the route will be under the protection of a strong and substantial power. upon whose neutrality no government can intrude without flagrant violation of the law of nations and shocking the opinion of mankind. that we can move troops to its protection when called upon by Mexico over a land route with abundant railroad service. by lines easy to be defended (it is within 200 miles of Vera Cruz and 300 of the city of Mexico itself). that the forces that defend it will be stationed in a healthful climate. that it will complete the control of the G alf of Mexico by these two allied and friendly republics. I am always sorry when I hear in the Senate. as was heard from the honorable Senator from Alabama the other day. or from any person in public station in this country. anything which indicates a disposition to disregard or undervalue the rights of Mexico. I am sure that no considerable number of American citizens today look upon Mexico with any other feeling than that which is due to a cherished sister republic. having the same institutions. the same destiny. the same hopes as we have ourselves. There is no purpose on the part of any considerable number of American citizens. as General Grant well declared before his death. to obtain by encroachment or wrong any portion of her territory. Commercial and business relations. blessing both sides. are all that it is the desire of the people of the United States to cultivate with her. If she think. as some of us think. that she sustained a great wrong at the hands of the United States more than a generation ago. she will. I am sure. remember that it was the first act of the restored unity of this Republic to enter the emphatic declaration which compelled France to take her tyrannous hands from the throat of that republic and call home her invading army. Certainly if we have been guilty of a wrong toward Mexico. it has been our great good fortune to confer upon her the greatest benefit. in preserving her autonomy and independence. which one nation can ever bestow upon another. I do not think that any considerable number of persons in the Senate or elsewhere share the opinion of the Senator from Alabama that the Gadsden treaty is now in force. The reading of that treaty shows that it related to a particular proposed plankroad and railroad long since abandoned. and it would be incredible that there should be any proposition on the part of the United States to renew any assertion of right under that treaty. Mr. President. I was also stating further that this plan saves us the ClaytonBulwer question. I have read carefully the diplomatic correspondence of Mr. Blaine and his successor and his predecessor. England certainly claims that the ClaytonBulwer treaty is in force. She claims that she relinquished her Mosquito protectorate to the demand of the United States that it was in violation of the engagement of that treaty. and that thereupon the Government of the United States expressly declared itself satisfied. In 1866 Mr. Seward directed Mr. Adams to suggest a negotiation having as a basis the continued existence of that treaty. Mr. Adams reports a discussion with Lord Clarendon on May 29 of that year. in which both parties refer to that treaty as in force. and express their sense of the particular international obligations which it creates. April 26. 1873. Mr. Fish. then Secretary of State in the administration of General Grant. instructs Mr. Schenck. our minister at St. James. formally to remonstrate against any trespass by British subjects upon the territory of Guatemala. as an infringement of the ClaytonBulwer treaty. Now. if this treaty were in force in 1873. by whom and when was it abrogated? There has been no other public act which bears upon that question except the action of Mr. Secretary Blaine about five years ago. during the administration of President Garfield. The Government of the United States must speak to foreign governments as a unit. It is one and the same. President Cleveland can net say that he differs from President Taylor. or President Grant. or President Garfield. The past declarations of oui representatives. including Mr. Blaine. have made it impossible for us with honor to treat the ClaytonBulwer treaty as annulled. Mr. Blaines dispatch to Mr. Lowell. dated November 19. 1881. little more than five years ago. and by his express direction communicated to Lord Granville. declares that that treaty is still in force. states to what it binds the United States. what advantages it secures to Great Britain. and directs Mr. Lowell to attempt to obtain certain specified modifications. Ten days after. November 29. Mr. Blaine renews his proposal to free the treaty of its embarrassing features and leave it as its framers intended. a full and perfect settlement for all time of all possible issues between the United States and Great Britain with regard to Central America. Now. Mr. President. unless this Government chooses to abandon her ancient policy. her ancient honor. her ancient faith. unless she chooses to imitate Great Britain in declaring that her interest and her desire are the sole rule and law for her public conduct in dealing with other states. we cannot enter upon this great public transaction in Central America in defiance of the obligation of the ClaytonBulwer treaty. Five years are but as a second. but as a heart beat. but as the pulsation of an artery in this mighty national life of ours. and it does not comport with the honor of a great and free people to assert one thing yesterday and another today. But. Mr. President. I also declared my opinion that the reasons which operated in entering into that treaty are still in force. It is not. in my judgment. for the interest of the United States to elect the armed occupation of this littlestrip of land in the tropics. whose entrance is commanded and blockaded by Great Britain. to fortify the swamps of Nicaragua. to maintain a navy equal to that of England. instead of the shipcanal and the neutral zone to whose protection the faith. and the power. and the interest of all Christendom shall be pledged. If we ever meant to violate the last injunction of Washington and to leave our own to stand on foreign soil. the time to do it was when we were offered St. Thomas and San Domingo. When we rejected the offer of Denmark. pending I think for nearly ten years. the treaty negotiated by the President but not consented to by the Senatewhen about the same time we rejected the San Domingo treaty. we forever turned our backs upon the policy of insular annexation and of tropical possession. Without the acquisition of those islands. or one of them. we can never permanently hold a canal at Nicaragua. It was no temporary. or transient. or shallow feeling that led Seward to hail the ClaytonBulwer treaty as one of the great steps in the worlds history. It was an American policy and an American triumph. declaring forever the indissoluble marriage of commerce and peace. General Taylor sent a message. which has remained in the secret archives of the Senate until last year its publication was authorized. in which he declares his sense of the transaction in which his administration had just been engaged. I ask the Secretary to read the sentence which I have marked."},{"1":"1886","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"A donation out of a fund that belongs to the States. certainly. and if Congress consents that a State shall resume its original right. that would scarcely be a donation. I continue the reading of the decision of the Supreme Court: We will now inquire into the nature and extent of the right of the United States to these landsThe lands conveyed by these deeds of cession. by the treaty for the purchase of the French territory. and the Spanish treaty under which we acquired FloridaWev will now inquire into the nature and extent of the right of the United States to these lands. and whether that right can in any manner affect or control the decision of the case before us. This right originated in voluntary surrenders. made by several of the old States. of their waste and unappropriated lands to the United States. tinder a resolution of the ol Congress of the 6th of September.1780. recommending such surrender and cession to aid in paying the public debt incurred by the war of the Revolution. The object of all the parties to these contracts of cession was to convert the land into money for the payment of the debt. and to erect new States over the territory thus ceded. and as soon as these purposes could be accomplished. the power of the United States over these lands. as property. was to cease. Vhencver the United States shall have fully executed these trusts the municipal sovereignty of the new States will be complete throughout their respective borders. and they and the original States will be upon an equal footing in all respects whatever. We. therefore. think the United States hold the public lands within the new States by force of the deeds of cession. and the statutes connected with them. and not by any municipal sovereignty which it may be supposed they possess. or have reserved by compact with the new States. for that particular purpose. The provision of the Constitution above referred to shows that no such power can be exercised by the United States within a State. Such a power is not only repugnant to the Constitution. but it is inconsistent with the spirit and intention of the deeds of cession. I read now the conclusion of this opinion: Alabama is therefore entitled to the sovereignty and jurisdiction over all the territory within her limits. subject to the common law. to the same extent that Georgia possessed it before she ceded it to the United States. To maintain any other doctrine is to deny that Alabama has been admitteo into the Union on an equal footing with the original States. the Constitution. laws. and compact to the contrary notwithstanding. * S * * * * By the preceding course of reasoning we have arrived at these general conclusions: First. The shores of navigable waters. and the soils under them. were not granted by the Constitution to the United States. but were reserved to the States. respectively. secondly. the new States have the same right. sovereignty. and Jurisdiction over this subject as the original States. thirdly. the right of the United States to the public lands. and the power of Congress to make all needfiul rules and regulations for the sale and disposition thereof. conferred no power to grant to the plaintiffs the land in controversy in this case. The judg. ment of the supreme court of the State of Alabama is. therefore. affirmed. The United States can not even buy a lot of land in Alabama of one of her citizens on which to build a fort without the consent of the Legislature of that State. so strong and exclusive is the sovereignty of Alabama over the territory within her political jurisdiction. And the same is true of every new State that has come into the Union. They are all equal to the original States in every right. What then has become of these seven great trust estates ceded to the United States by the States I have named fbr the benefit of each and all ? Much of it has been donated to the people by the votes of the representatives of the people. and much to works of internal improvement in like manner. Much to schools and universities . much to theStates. and much has been sold to the people. and the money has gone into the common Treasury. In this way all the States have got the benefit of the fund according to the original contracts with the States. Even in the Louisiana purchase and in the treaties with Mexico and Spain the interests of prospective States have been provided for in a like manner. This ownership of the soil is property of the United States which the Constitution expressly empowers Congress to dispose of. It is property to which there is annexed a use. by contract. which Congress should respect far more than it has done. That use could not be better executed than to apply the lands or their proceeds to the education of the people. nor can better agents be found than the States. to all of whom. as States. the beneficial interest in the lands is expressly reservedreserved not to the people of the different States. but reserved to the States. The beneficial use of these lands is not reserved to the people as such. but to the States. Now. can the Senator from Florida show me in the Constitution any such a grant of the taxing power to Congress to raise money for the benefit of the States as I have shown the Senate the grant that does exist under these deeds of cession from the States to the United States of all the public lauds in trust for the benefit of the States? The proposition is too plain for denial or debate. that when we pass the title of land to any private holder we do it as the trustee of the States under a power conferred by the States. and we are compelled to apply that money. if we honorably comply with our obligation. to the uses declared in the deeds of cession. But I will not undertake to amplify a decisionwhich is so entirely plain as that in Pollards Lessees vs. Hagan. If I was trying this case before a justice of the peace I should think I had established enough to show the distinction between the execution of a trust confided in Congress by a deed of cession made by a State and the power of Congress to tax that people for some other purpose. I have shown that the whole power of Congress over the public lands ceded by the original States was derived from actual cessions made in trust for the States of the Union. that the power of Congress over these lands came from the States by express grant upon defined conditions. Can he show any grant of similar power to Congress to tax the people at large to raise subsidies for the States? Before proceeding further in this debate I must most respectfully protest against the assumption of the Committee on Education and Labor that Alabama is a land of darkness. a lazaretto of ignorance. whichthis committee describes it to be. If we are to be masqueraded here in the garb of a mendicant people. so as to excite the pity of Congress to give us liberal almswhich more resembles the backshish given to an Arab donkeydriver than that healing and comforting benelaction of sweet charity. which the right hand gives without the knowledge of the left handlet us at least have credit. in our misery. for good intentions and honest efforts to relieve ourselves from this humiliating condition. The committee say that in 1880. six years ago. the census tables show that we had in Alabama 433.447 people who could not write and were over ten years old. I do not believe this statement. Let us make a few comparisons. In 1860 the census returns credited Alabama with 38.000 people who can not read and write.  and of these 455 were free colored people. That census. in this matter. only related to free people. Massachusetts had in 1860 46.921 illiterates. in 1870 she had 74.935. in 1880 she rose to 92.980. New York in 1860 had 121.878 illiterates. in 1870 she had 163.501. and in 1880 she rose to the dizzy height of 219.600. I do not believe these figures either. but a the bill is based on the census of 1880 1 must argue it on that basis. Of the people whom we attempted to educate in Alabama up to 1860 only 38.000 were illiterate. In 1870. after five years of war. and five more of robbery. which was worse than war. during which the school revenues were despoiled almost to annihilation. we come out with 31. 001 white female and 17.429 white males over twentyone who were unable to read and write and 43.629 over ten and under twentyone. Total of white illiterates. 92.059. The illiteracy of the negroes was then greatly underestimated at 257.712. That census was a mere travesty on the true statistical history of the country. The census of 1880 is a mere estimate or approximation to the truth. It estimates an illiteracy of 38.1 per cent. of the white race over ten years of age in Alabama. There is not a member in either House of this Congress that does not know that this is a false estimate. In 1880 we had a white population of 662.185 of a total population of 1.262.505. of this number 421.328 were between five and seventeen years old. Our school ages are between seven and twentyone years. and it is on this basis. and not on the basis of the census of 1880. that we must make our estimate of the illiteracy which we intend to try to cure by law. Now. to say that 38 per cent. even of these person! of school age can not write is certainly a rash statement. whether it is applied to blacks or whites. The number of persons of school age in Alabama by the latest school census. taken in 1885. was 420.413. Of this number 143.037 white children and 90.872 colored were enrolled as pupils in the public schools. In all 233.909. an increase over thb preceding year of 18.331. Our system of education is free. but not compulsory. We paid last year 3.565 teachers of white schools. an increase of 107 teachers. and 1827 teachers of colored schools. an increase of 103. The total school fund for the year 1885 was $511.540.05. This does not include $16.500 forthe education of the deaf. dumb. and blind. nor $24.000 paid to the University of Alabama. nor $20.280 to the Agriculture and Mechanical College. in all $60.500. which are included as a part of the expenses of the State government. Nor does it include the sum of more than $50.000 of additions to the educational fund and paid in salaries to the State superintendent and his clerks. The cost of education is over $600.000 per annum to the people of Alabama. and this is a tax of more than 50 cents per capita upon every human being in the State. A small matter to us. but it is. with the polltax. $6 a year to a man with a wife and eight children who may prefer a private or neighborhood school. If this bill proposed to reduce this burden it would at least be humane. but it proposes only to give another sum equal to this. taken from the people by Federal taxation. for eight years. which means forever. so as either to double the number of teachers or to double the amounts of their salaries. It seems to me that 5.392 teachers of the public schools1 teacher to 43 pupilsis not a scant allowance. The people of Alabama and the entire South have always educated their children chiefly in private schools and neighborhood schools. Their expenditures in that way must be twice or three times as great as the sums raised by taxation for public schools. They will be a long time in giving up this favorite plan. They have excellent reasons for this preference which I do not feel called upon to discuss at this tine. Christian people always have a care as to how their children are taught and ts to who teaches them. For the ordinary expenses of our State government we paidlastyear $485.126. which does not include $333.723 paid as interest on the public debt. When we are paying more to schools than we pay to the current ordinary expenses of the State government we are scarcely to be rated among the derelict States that the Senator from New Hampshire berates for their crimes or else commiserates for their poverty. When we are increasing our wealth at the rate of $7.000.000 a year. he need not fear that we will falter in the duty we are so successfully performing of reducing the number of illiterates among our children. This bill confines its benefits to persons of the school age. It does not propose to educate the ignorant mass of voters over twentyone who now fill up the ballotboxes with votes that express nothing but their ignorance and a blind and slavish obedience to the will of their educated leaders and bosses. Being a measure to refbrm the people so that ignorance shall no longer rule in this great complex system of dual governments. it omits to teach the voter to read and write. and attempts to save the country by teaching his children to read and write. That seems to be a good remedy. but it fails to reach the seat of the disease. Alabama would rather take her chances to relieve the afflicted who are suffering an epidemic of ignorance by the good old remedy of common sense and good nursing than to risk the new doctor among her people with this new patent medicine. The doctor says he will not come unless he is invited. but that he has the right to come without being called in. I am afraid that if he comes he will never go away. He will set the State up on crutches for eight years. and at the end of that time either the United States or the people of Alabama will have to supply the school system with a new set of props. Its powerful limbs will have shrunk from disuse. and it will falter in a path in which it now marches like a conquering army. The school system. forced into unnatural growth by the stimulus which raises its revenues from $500.000 to a million in a single day. will be the master of the State. and with its organized and organizing power will decree that the State in every policy shall obey its behests. When at the end of eight years the United States withdraw their support. the taxes of the people for the public schools will have to be doubled. or else the schools will go down. But. it is exclaimed. your people will make money even at that rate of taxation in the increase of the knowledge of reading. writing. and arithmetic. Our State does not want to make the people rich by taxing them. We tried that fifty years ago in our Statebank exploit. and wound up with a debt of $15.000.000. on part of which we are still paying the interest. We prefer to get rich by having an economical government and allowing our people to enjoy all they can of what they work for and in the way they think best. The argument as to the policy of this bill is not all on one side. I read now from the Nation. a weekly paper of high order. established more than twenty years ago in New York. The article from which I read is headed Connecticuts warning against the Federal education scheme. All the pleas for Federal aid proceed upon the assumption that such aid will bea good tiing for the South. It is this assumption which we combat. We maintain that the worst thing which could befall the cause of education in the South would be a series of liberal appropriations from the national Treasury for a series of years. We mean. of course. the worst thing in the long run. for no judgment upon such a matter is of any value which is not based upon a long look ahead. We are ready to admit that more Southern voters might be ableto read ten years hence if $i00.000.000 should be appropriated by Congress for use chiefly in Southern schools than if the States were left to their own resources. but we insist that this temporary gain in intelligence would be purchased at the cost of a permanent loss in character vastly more importantthe loss of selfreliance and selfrespect. One fact counts for more than a volume of theorizing. and it is. therefore. most fortunate that the demoralizing influence of outside school funds can be conclusively demonstrated from the experience of one of the oldest States in the Union. When Connecticut sold her Western Reserve lands the proceeds were devoted to a school fund. in the expectation that this assistance would serve materiallyto elevate the standard of public education. The fund proved veryproductive. the income during the early part of this century varying from $70.0 o $100.000 a year. which was a large sum of money for a small State in those days. when the cost of maintaining schools was so much less than now. Before they had this outside income the people of Connecticut supported their schools entirely bytaxation.just as the people of the South are doing now. Whatwas the effect of receivingthis assistance? The answer shall be furnished by Mr. C. D. Hine. secretary of the State board of edication. a recognized authority in the matters of which he speaks: The school fulnd derived from the sale of Western lands yielded an income last year of $120.855. which amounts to s0 cents for each person of the school age. he average expense of educating each of these persons throughout the State is $10.31. so that the fund now furnishes about 8 per cent. of the total cost. In those towns and cities where the people insist upon good schools no reliance is placed upon these permanent funds. Indeed. the history of our State shows conclusively that at the time when the fund was most productive. yielding $1.40 or $1.50 for each person of the school age. and when towns depended upon it. as they generally did. for the support of their schools. the schools themselves were poor and short. In fact. this was the darkest period of our educational experience. A very striking deterioration took place as soon as the fund became productive and the income began to be distributed. Before that period schools had been maintained at least six months. and at most nearly the whole year. according to the size of the district. After. and not long after. this new source of income was opened. the usual length of schools was reduced to only three months. or just the time that this fund would maintain the schools. The sums which came as gratuities relieved the people of responsibility and deadened their interest until the schools were continued only so long as the charity lasted. Happily the danger from this direction is past and can not return. The fund has probably reached its greatest productiveness. and the per capita will constantly decrease. The public schools must draw their sustenance from the people who are directly or indirectly benefited by them. The Blair bill simply proposes to do for the whole South what the Western Reserve fund did for Connecticut. Human nature is much the same everywhere. and if one were to try differentiating it. he certainly would not find the Southern character less likely to be demoralized by subsidies than the Northern. The men who had this fund set apart for the benefit of Connecticuts schools undoubtedly thought that they were doing the State a great service. but it has proved a curse. and the people are now congratulated that the danger from this direction is past. because the growth of population has forced them to tax themselves in order to educate their children. The Christian Union and the people who share its opinion that Federal appropriations for Southern education would be simply the payment of a debt due by justice. are honest in their desire to benefit the South. but if they could accomplish their design they would have proved its worst enemies. The truth is thatthe South can educate herself. and is already beginning to do so. It will be a hard job. but her people. black and white. will be more manly. more selfreliant. more intelligent. in the long run. if they are left to work out their own salvation. The most hopeful sign for the Souths future is that clearheaded Southern men are protesting against the efforts of wellmeaning but shortsighted Northerners to give the South school money out of the Federal Treasury. which these Southern men see that she ought to raise and can raise herself. Mr. President. that is the sober second thought of Connecticut. and that article is based upon the experience of more than onehundred years. Connecticut having sold her Western Reserve in Ohio for money which she made the basis of her school system. relieving her people from all taxation and from all necessity of using energetic means to organize a good and sound school system. she finds herself at last really damaged by this great endowment. and she is appealing to her own people to go to work and strengthen their own sinews. so as to master the difficulties of life as they arise and to let the Southern people alone and let them do the same thing. I wish that that writer had known in respect to my State that she is gathering wealth upon a value of assessment (which we all know is very much lower than the actual value of property) at the rate of$7.000.000a year. Then he would have understood that there was a strong. courageous. powerful. and dutiful people that are engaged there in a work to which they are thoroughly committed and with which they are much in love. so much indeed that they spend more money every year for schools than they do for the current expenses of the State government. That is progress enough for me. I confess. sir. that I am not in favor of going too fast with anything. I would rather go a little slow and keep inside of the line of the Constitution. I would also read an article from the Morning Star. a paper published in North Carolinavery ableif I had the attention of the Senate. though I run some risk in it. because that editor is rash enough to call this bill the paternal pedagogue bill. and I think he has a remarkably good name for it. When the Senate adjourned on Thursday I had commenced to discuss the proposition that this bill. if enacted into a law. will be a great and dangerous abuse of the taxing power confided to Congress by the Constitution. I had read from decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. of which there are many. that declare that this is the most dangerous power that Congress can exertthe power to destroy. even when unlimited or unrestrained. and that the framers of the Constitution must have intended to place checks and restraints upon this power which would at least preserve the people from destruction. It is utterly absurd and inconceivable that men who had fought at Concord and Bunker Hill before a Congress existed because the Parliament of Great Britain had asserted the right to tax them. and had organized a rebellion and defended their new government until it struggled to its feet as a free. sovereign. and independent power. fighting and suffering as fewpeople have ever donethat they should. after all that. deliberately place in their organic law a grant of power to Congress or to any body of men to tax them to the utmost for any purpose that Congress might in its discretion hold to be necessary or proper to promote the general welfare. No written constitution in any State of this Union or of any free country in the world has ever contained such a grant of power to any legislative tribunal. The most despotic autocrat that rules in any civilized country would feel that his scepter was a mockery when compared with a grant of power like that which is claimed for Congress. Here are Republicans and Democrats claiming this absolutism in Congress as a doctrine bequeathed to us from fathers who had suffered for many decades and had fought for six years to restrain the power of taxation within bounds that would not be fatal to liberty. I will read again to the Senate the statement of that bold and dangerous heresy as it is written in the report of the Committee on Education and Labor and as it is crystallized in this bill. In the last report made to the Senate. the one which we are now discussing. accompanying this bill. the committee say: The report referred toMade by the same committee at the former sessionThe report referred to. and hereby adopted by your committee. is as follows. Now I read extractsOur leading proposition is that the General Government possesses the power and has imposed upon itself the duty of educating the people of the United States whenever for any cause those people are deficient in that degree of education which is essential to the discharge of their duties as citizens either of the United States or of the several States wherein they chance to reside. Again: Now. the right of selfdefense. which is the right of selfpreservation. is the right to live and to be. The right of the people to be at all implies and includes the right to constitute and maintain the statethat is to say. governmentand to prescribe its form. for human existence is impossible without government. The governing power must know how to govern or it can not govern. Can a man do that which he knows not how to do? The people have distributed the functions of government between the national and sectional or the State authorities. and have retained in themselves the initial exercise of all power through the ballot. The ballot is the republican form of government both in the nation and in the State. I read again: But Congress has express power to provide for the general welfare of the United States. and to exert its utmost power of taxation to promote that which was one of the six greatest ends enumerated in the preamble. and to secure wh ich the Constitution itself was ordained and established by the whole people of the United States of America. That people well understood that without intelligence it would be impossible to preserve the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity. It goes without argument to say that in noway can the general welfare be so promoted as by the general diffusion of knowledge and the discipline of the mental powers of the masses of the people. which can be accomplished by common schools maintained by governmental power. I read again: . Only ignorance is convertible into brute force. Ignorance is slavery. Butfor ignorance there would have been no slave. But for ignorance among the nominally free there would have been no rebellion. The contest we now wage is with that still unconquered ignorance of both white man and black man ii. all parts of the country which hurried us by remorseless fate to fields of death four long years. Besides this. we confront the demands of hordes incoming from beyond both great oceans. and of the advancing generations of men. I do wonder if any man who was ever in the confederate congress or in the confederate army or in any way identified with that period of trial and strife among the people of the South read that report and permitted it to go upon this record to disgrace the country. But for ignorance among the nominally free there would have been no rebellion. Was it the ignorance of New England that brought slaves into this country and sent them all over this land ? No. sir. it was the wealth and the power. it was the luminous intelligence of those people that caused them to go abroad. capture slaves in Africa. bring them here. and sell them to the people of the South."},{"1":"1885","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. it is not my purpose to detain the Senate long in submitting -the remarks upon this motion which it is my desire now to do. but if Senators will give me their attention for a few minutes I think I can present this case in a manner that will give it clear understanding to the mind of every Senator. In the very heart of the State of Iowa there are living today more than one thousand families to whom the passage of this bill means more than I can tell or we can realize. These families include many persons now in the winter of life. Years of adventure. hardship. and toil are behind them. all of which were expended in hopeful endeavors to secure and improve homes for themselves and their families on the lands to which this bill relates and which they now believe of right belong to them. For more than a quarter of a century have many of them lived where they now live. having commenced their terms of occupancy in full belief that the end would be perfect titles to peaceful homes. Relying on the good faith of the Government and depending on the assurance of written public law. they entered upon the struggle through which homes in the West were then secured. As they pursued the even tenor of their ways the wilderness was subdued. waste places were reclaimed. civilization advanced. homes were established. farms unfolded their beauties. families multiplied. and happy communities evolved the elements of thrift and prosperity. They had no suspicion of danger to the titles to which they looked for an assurance to them of the results .of their willing sacrifices and sturdy endeavors. It was no fault of theirs that governmental action and inaction induced the presence of conflicting claims and controverted rights. Twentyfive years ago the. section in which these lands and homes are situate was the frontier of Iowa settlements. No one then had reason to believe that the conditions which now exist relative to the titles to the lands there situate would ever transpire. and these settlers began their work in that new region in full beiefthat under and in pursuance of the land laws of the United States perfect titles would eventually come to them from the Government. They didknowwhat Congress. the Secretary of the Interior.. the Commissioner of the General Land Office. and the State of Iowa had done. This they were bound to know. But they did not and could not know what these powers and officers might do or attempt to do in the future. Nor did either pradence. duty. or the law require them to enter upon inquiries Telative to the possibilities which might appear in that uncertain field obf action. and they now believe that whatever was subsequently done could not lawfully affect their rights. It is not necessary for me here to affirm that vested rights can notbe .divested by an act of Congwess or by the misftake or unlawful act or decision of an executive officer of the Government. We all know that it can not be done. Whatever rights these settlers had they. in contemplation of the law. now have. in spite of legislative or executive actioi. whether it be that of the United States or of the State of Iowa. And this dodtrine will apply with as effective force to the bill which we are now considering in the event of its enactment by Congress as it doesto the acts which have cast a cloudupon the titles to the lands which constitnute one of the most beautiful sections of the State of Iowa. Hence no one can be harmed bythe passage of this bill. Eventhe temporary disturbance which may be occasioned by the commencement andprogrem of the actionwhich it directs shall be instituted on behalf of the United States by the Attorn7General will be more than compensated by the perfecttitle to be assured by thejudicial determination of the coiltroversy. And this view of the case leads me to remark that the contention which it is the office of this bill to terminate is not wholly measured by the private rights involved in it. It is one of those disturbances whichaffeet a considerable region of country in all of the relations which influence values. contentment. prosperity. a right progress. From this aspect of the case a public question results. This broadens and intensifies the character of the bill. Its object embraces the interests of all of the people of the region immediately affected. indeed of the entire State of Iowa. and of the inaviduals. residents of other States. who claim title to any part of the lands involved adverse to the settlers. Each and all of these are definitely interested in obtaining. at the earliest practicable day. a final judicial determination of the controversy which rests like a blight upon the titles of all. I do not state the case too strongly when I say that the controversy which it is believed the methods -provided by this bill will settle rest* like a blight onill of the titles to the lands affected. .No one who has not come personally into contact with the facts and effects of this ease can fully realize or perfectly appreciate how absolutely this blight has settled upon its every feature. But every person in interest knows full well how malign its influence has been and still is. and it will get no better but rather grow worse until in some such way as is now proposed a definite judicial remedy shall have been applied. and I am surprised that the Des Moines Navigation and Railroad Company ad all of its assigns and grantees do not join in asking for the passage of this bill. for the title of that company and of its assigns and grantees will remain in doubt. challenged and uncertain. until some such remedy shall have been provided and applied. Iany of the settlers who are -irging the passage of this bill. I am informed. are grantees of the said company. having endeavored to perfect their titles by purchasing that claimed by the corpoiation also. Still others.who have no title but such as they have derived from the comphny by purchase. approve this measure and ask that it be enacted into a law. My information is to the effect that these several classes of claimants and grantees can neither sell their lands nor raise money on them by incumbrance. Every phase of the title is regarded as in some way imperfect. and is the subject of suspicion. Nor will this condition be remedied by any worryingout process on behalf of the resisting corporation. Athousandfamiliessome of whomhavebecnoccupying these lands ashomesfora third of a centuryandmany ofthem.as I have already stated. for more than a quarter of a centurywill not give up the contest even though this bill should fail of passage. They are not asking that the rights of others be interfered with. but simply that their own shall be protected. They claim that in fact and in law the legal title to all of the lands covered by this bill is in the United States. that having complied with the laws relative to preemption and homestead entries they are entitled to patents for the lands on which they have settled and made their homes. that as to the remaining. concerning which no adverse claims exist. they are content to have them confirmed to tohd said company or to its grantees as this bill provides. That is the wholS case as these settlers present it. They simply ask that all of the ques. tions involved in the conflicting claims to these lands shall be judici! ally determined. alleging that in none of the cases cited ajainst them has this been done. In this latter allegation they do not stand alone. as is abundantly evidenced by the fact of the universal suspicion which rests upon the titles involved. The cases cited are not free from the taint of alleged collusion. I make no charge in this regard. nor shall I enter upon an examination of the said cases. It is sufficient for my purpose and in Justiflation of this bill to say that in none of the said cases has the United States asserted its title. and the settlers who ask for the passage of this bill have had no opportunity which would allow them to do so. The representatives of those settlers tellme that they and all of their associates will promptly and peacefully yield to the result of the judi! cial proceeding which this bill proposes to institute should it prove to be adverse to them. It may be responded to thisthatin so doingthey would but be obeying the law and performing a duty incumbent oii every good citizen. Thisis true. butit is also true that it involvesth6 surrender of the results of the labors of their lives. the loss of homes which have sheltered them. andin which theirfamilieshave been reared. and another start in the struggle of life with too many of their years gone for those yet remaining to move upon them freighted with hope and goodly promise of success and fortune. Mr. President. the citizens who ask for the passage of this bill have long importuned Congress for relief. They have been patient and respectful. It does not seem just to deny their prayer. They can not put their case in the courts. But the Government can go thereunder the provisions of this bill. These citizens arehumble. but their rights. though they may embrace merely claims to titles to small holdings of lands on which they have spent the best years of their lives in hardy endeavors to found and possess homes. should be as sacred in the contemplation of the Government as though they were the owners of principalities of lands and millions of invested eapital. Agovernment ca4 be as truly great in guarding the comparatively insignificant rights of its humblest citizens as in contests for empire. We can give the protection prayed for in this case not only without injustice to other citizens. but in a manner which. while it protects private rights. will also promote the public welfare. For it must be seen by all that even though the remedy proposed shall fail of that full measure of good result which would secure to these patient settlers their homes. it certainly will quiet the titles to all of the lands whose conditions are disturbed and values unsettled by this long existing controversy. Hence. whatever the final issue may be. a good result will have been reached. A conflict of many unpleasant features will come to an end. I can but hope that the end will assure to these patient people their homes. But should it fail of this. it will give rest and perfect title to one of the most beautiful and fruitul sections of the State of Iowa. The Government will have doneits full duty. and the citizen will feel that it is not unmindful of him. though he may be poor and his home humble. This will tend to remove unrest and establish contentment. and noresults of government are more to be desired than these. With this description of the case I am willing to submit it. so far as I am concerned. to a test of the motion made by the Senator from Alabama."},{"1":"1884","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I am inclined to agree with the .Senator from Kentucky that if that is possible to be done it would be a wise thing to do.

It is well for the Senator to do it. but if the committee dared make the recommendations for increase on exactly the same recommendations of the .engineers and of the Secretary of War. it would have swelled this hill not to seventythree millions. as I have estimated it by a careful computation. but to $100.000.000. I thajnk the Senator for calling the attention of the country to the little appropriations which the committee without a word of commient. from reading the reports of the engineers. thought in justice to the Government would be sufficient to be of some avail for those --harbors on tie coast of Michigan. and which they have seen fit almost withont any argument to put into the bill. For thirtein years in the House and here in the Senate I flind that .if anybody wantsto justify himself in making the most extravagant *clinands of the Committee on Commerce for an increase of appropriatibps. and there is one word said by as humble a member ot that . eommittee as I am. h has ready written out. he has ready the pages i and the lines in thereports of the engineers. and he shelters himself tbehind the. action in regard to Michigan. Sir. the call of the people .of Michigan in their pressure here for appropriations for the great mational highways of the mighty lakes that run around that coast is moderate. is reasonable. is judicious. if I may.say it without offeas it is sensible. There is nothing personal in the remark. but it .1s usible. Michigan has 1.596 ailes of navigable seacoast. .Throlgh.Michigan runs that great channel of interstate commerce from Duluth to the Saint Lawrence. It has had large appropriations. it has them in this bill. Why? Because up and down that channel of commerce floats nearly onehalf of the entire commerce of the United States. Over a million dollars was expended on the Saint Clair flats in Michigan. along the edge of the Canada line. in a faroff sunken region of the delta of the Saint Clair. with no inhabitants living in that neighborhood. unless the fisherna with his cabin upon piles in the marshes. What is that to Michigan? Through that channel pass every day of the eight months of navigation between 275 and 300 vessels of an average tonnage of 500 tons. There are 48.000 passages of vessels in the course of a single season of eight months. Look on your map. gathcr your statistics. where else in this world is soch an aceniunation of vessels of that tonnage passing back and forth. with the freightage of halfa continent? Nowhere. sir. in no river of Europe. in no harbor of the UnitedStates. Not onethird the number of vessels enter into and depart out of the harbor of Now York. the greatest in this country. The Saint Clair flats improvement was built on Michigan marshes. Take another instance. There is the Sault Sainte Marie Canal. It has had an appropriation of over a million dollars. and Hay Lake Channel $200.000. connecting the great lakes Superior and Miehigan. comineting the great States of Wisconsin. Minnesota. Northern Io wa. the Territory of Dakota. and all through the Rocky Mountains in their commerce to the East and their supplies from the East. That was built on Michigan soil. on the Michigan side of the dividing waters of the Saint Marys River. around its falls It has cost a million and a quarter of dollars. What benefit was it to Michigan? There is a little hamlet there. It is no benefit to that immediate vicinity. It is a -worldwide project. through which the products of the Old World reach to the New. developing the mighty regions of the West. 1 say. and I say it now because there are so many of these taunts about Michigan appropriations from some of my friends here. that I think there should be some time when they should look at the East and see whether these are works for Michigan or whether they are works for the world and its commerce to travel upon through the soil of Michigan. Since we commenced the specific appropriation in 1869 until this time. strike out those works which are of great national importance and have no more immediate concern with the State of Michigan than with any other State bordering upon the great lakes or their waters flowing front them. and the State of Michigan. with almost sixteen hundred miles of seacoast. with its harbors all around that coast for the benefit of all the rest of the States. sinks into insignificance in comparison with the appropriations that have been made for that worthy State which the Senatr represents. The zeal of the new convert is proverbial. Thc zeal of thine house hath eaten ic up. Itwas but within a few years that Soith Carolina utterly refused an appropriation for the. im torovement of her rivers and harbors. and that. if I mistake not. by the act of her own Legislature. While the Northern States were getting little appropriations. while they believed in internal improvenents of rivers and harbors by the General Government. the State of South Carolina (and I say it not invidiously) and many of the other Southern States. through their representatives here. denied from day to day and from year to year the right of the Government to appropriate anything for their great harbors. It was not until 1869. when a bill was passed making specific appropriations for the rivers and harbors of the United States. and when the Committee on Commerce of the House notified members from States and notified members who believed that there was no constitutional right to make internal improvements that they must wait until the voice of their State was heard. through themselves or through other representatives. admitting both the constitutionality and the propriety of carrying on these works. that appropriations were made at all. That conversion I have noticed from year to year. The conversion of the Staterights men. the conversion of those men who clung to the old reading of the Constitution. their conversion from believing and asserting and voting that the General Governniot had no right and nopower to improve their harbors. to this brief tiie in tea years when they come. and. like the daughters of the horsemech. cry continually Give. give! is wonderful. I na glad that it is so. I believe that this great Government should open the chiannes of communication. open its waterways. and open its harbors and build its lighthouses and establish its lifesaving stations aui send out its revenuemarine vessels to relieve the shipwrecked mariner and save the ship where possible. I think that is the duty oft his Government.

(1 Peters. 546.) and the case of Benner vs. Porter. (9 Howard. 235.) In the case in 1 Peters the opinion was delivered by ChiefJustice Marshall. and considering who delivered the opinion its language is very suggestive: Perhap .the power of governing a Territory belonging to the United States. which has net by becoming a State acquired the means of selfgovernment. may result necessarily from the facts that it is not within the jurisdicton of any particular State and is within the power and jurisdiction of the United States. The right to govern may be the inevitable consequence of the right to acquire terri tory. Whichever may be the source whence the power is derived. the possession of it is unquestioned. It will be seen the ChiefJustice does not refer to the property clause of the Constitution as the source of this power. The great ChiefJustice who never faltered before. nor afterward. to my knowledge. confronting the question. what clause of the Constitution gave a power he asserted the existence of. hesitated here. and said. it might result from one thing. it might from another. but whichever it resulted from or wherever it came from. there was no doubt of its existence. If it was not ChiefJustice Marshall who delivered this opinion. it would remind one of the motion that was made to quash an indictment for thirtythree reasons. The judge after hearing a long argument on the snbject. decided that there was nothing in any one point. but taking them altogether he thought he would quash the indictment. and he did. In the next case. in 9 Howard. there is no allusion to the subject whatever. Judge Nelson. delivering the opinion of the court. says: The distinction between the Federal and State jurisdictions. under the Constitution of the United States. has no foundation in these territorial governments. and consequently no such distinction exists. either in respect to the jurisdiction of their courts or the subjects submitted to their cognizance. They are legislative governments. and their courts legislative courts. Congress. in the exercise of its powers in the organization and government of the Territories. combining tho powers of both the Federal and State authorities.-Benner et at. v&. Porter. 9 Hosard. page 24. But to what clause of the Constitution that power can be traced he does not suggest. Again. the ChiefJustice. in 13 Wallace. inadvertently misquotes the Constitution. He says the courts are the legislative courts of the Territory created in virtue of the clause which authorizes Congress to make all needful rules and regulations respecting the Territories belonging to the United States. Now the Constitution says this. in the last clause of the third section of the fourth article: The.Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rulaes and reg. ulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States. The word other here has no significance whatever unless the word territory is construed to mean property. That word undoubtedly means there. the public domain. the public lands. or territory. in the sense in which the word was used before we had any governments called territorial governments and is a totally different thing from our present use of the word when we speak of Territories of the United States. We mean now. by the word Territories.those communities organized under acts of Congress into social order and held for the present in that condition. but the Constitution made no reference to Territories as communities at all. The Government at that time had a vast public domain. and it had other property. and this provision is that Congress may dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States. Now. compare this with another provision of the Constitution. and see again how carefully words are used in the first article: The Congrees shall have power to make roles for the government tad regulation of the land sod naval forces. In the one case it is a power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory. meaning the public land. or other property. not for the government of the territory or other property. but when you come to a body of men and Congress is to be clothed with power over them. the provision is. Congress shall have power to make rules for the government of the Army and Navy. It may be inquired to what clause of the Constitution this power is referable and whether I have not succeeded thus far in disproving my own premises and that territorial courts are courts existing without any provision in the Constitution and from mere necessity. I know that thissubject has been so fully discussed that for an obscure individual to advance a new theory about it is like setting up against fate almost. and yet I believe that the clause of the Constitution to which the power to govern the Territories is properly traced is the power of Congress to admit new States. The Constitution was formed when the whole country away from the seaboard was a wilderness. it was territory. it was public land. and without people. citizens of the United States. Those portions of the country would be filled up by gradual emigration. Ohio for instance. so of Indiana. so of Wisconsin. and the other Territories. Emigration tending westward would produce the result of a certain number of individuals settling within certain lines of territory. If that was to be made a new State. and Cougress had the power to admit it as such under the Constitution. something must be done to prepare it for that condition. Congress cannot admit Territories. it admits nothing but States. and a State cannot be organized without some legal provision from some source allowing it to be organized as a State. In order to make Wiscousin a State for instance. when a certain number of people came to reside in it. citizens of the United States upon the public lands of the United States. it was necessary to protect them there as a civil society. it was necessary to throw over them the shield of the law. it was necessary to administer justice. it was necessary to do all the things which we are daily doing in the Territories for the purpose of schooling and training and bringing that community to a condition entitling it to become a State. MAtc1. 6. Now. Congress is authorized to raise armies. The Military Academy at West Point is not much of an army. but it is a school for the Army. it takes boys. trains them to become members of the Army and nobody doubts that the power to raise armies covers the power to employ this establishment as a means to that end. So the power to govern the Territories springs from the power to admit new States. In a great speech made by General Cass in this body after the publication of his celebrated Nicholson letter.-many of the premises of that speech I should not agree to and I certainly dissent from its conclusions.-he demonstrated. if demonstration can be predicated of any mere legal question. that the power to govern the Territories could not be referred to the property clause of the Constitution. that it existed. I believe he thought. from necessity. I do not remember as to this. for I have not read his speech for many years. but I do remember how logical and how clear and how certain he is in his demonstration of the fact. that the power could not be traced to that clause of the Constitution. But I think it inheres in the power of Congress to admit new States. and stands as firmly upon that basis as any of the incidental powers which we are daily exercising under other provisions of the Constitution. It is to be borne in mind that the Constitution was made to indicate the subjects to be committed to this Government. The single provision. the Congress shall have power * * * to establish postoffices and postroads. is the only authority for our immense postal establishment. but it indicates that the subject was taken om the States and given to the Union. and so Congress proceeds under that provision of the Constitution. builds up a civil and criminal code upon it. assumes the monopoly of transmittingthe mails. punishes as a crime any man carrying. I believe. more than a mile. any sealed package whatever containing written matter. and has done all this under that one clause of five or six words which simply indicates that the subject of postoffices and postroads and the transmission of mails was regarded and treated as a Federal and nob a State subject. So the power to admit new States carries with it the power to prepare a community to be a State to be admitted. and that is thefoundation in the Constitution for establishing territorial governments. When we have passed a law establishing a territorial government. and creating courts for the administration of justice in the community. the mere creature of the statute. the mere child of Congress in every respect and particular. and that court goes into operation and hears a cause and renders a fudgment. does any man suppose that Congress. because it created the court. can interfere with or set aside one of its judgments? Can it interfere if a man is tried there and sentenced to be hanged? If the President does not pardon him. can Congress pardon him 9 Can Congress snatch him from the gallows? Certainly not. and why not? Because doing so is not exercising legislative power. This bill proposes not to peform any act of legislation. not to provide how a courtmartial shall be held in future for trying offenses. nor what shall be the punishment of offenses. nor does it make any regelation for the future government of the Army whatever. It has ailthe character of an executive order. It is a decree. it is afiat of the Government as to a past transaction. When that courtmartial had held its sessions. had concluded upon its judgment. had sent its sentence to the President and Abraham Lincoln gave his approval to it. and the court was disbanded. that record was closed. that subject was ended. and there never has since been any power to reverse it. or to open it for any purpose whatever. and there never will be. and it never can be reheard this side the bar of God. Congress cannot do it because the court which did it was created by an act of Congress. any more than it can in the case of the District of Columbia or of the Territories. Now let me come to courtsmartial. The Constitution provides that: No State shall. without the consent of the Congress. * * keep troops. or ships of war in time of peace. I do not know that even consent could make it law. But: The Congress shall have power * * To declare war. grant letters of marque and reprisal. and make rules concern-. in captures on land and water. o raise and support armies. but no appropriation. &c.. To provide and maintain a navy. To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces. That is the power of Congress. Now. what does it mean? Does it mean that Congress shall govern the Army? Not at all. any more than it means that Congress shall exercise judicial power in the seat of Government or in the Territories or anywhere else. Congress in no place. under no pretense. wider no circumstances. can exercise any but legislative power. Legislative power is prescribing what shall be done in the future. The Army is to begoverned not by Congress. it is tobe governed by nes prescribed by Congress for its government. But when those rules are prescribed and when a courtmartial has been provided for. the mere trial of a particular cause is as much without the reach and beyond the power of Congress as the trial of a particular cause in the courts of this District or in the Territories. and for precisely the same reasons. Congress has made rules for the government of the Army. It has pointed out in great detail what shall be military offenses. It has provided how courtsmartial shall be constituted to try them. what sentence may be pronounced. and how it is to be executed. The whole subject has been regulated by Congress. This is done in exact conformity with the state of things existing in England before our Constitution was adopted. The English army was a thing as to which our people were well informed. They had seen it. they had felt it. they had handled it. they had beaten it. they knew what it was made of. they knewhow it was governed. and when it was provided that Congress should make rules for the government of our Armyof course the great model of the British army wasin view. just as the powers of Parliament were in view in constructing the legislative articles.of the Constitution. The British government was the model to which our fathers referred under all circumstances. All the provisions of our Constitution are either taken from the great Charter and the Bill of Rights of England or suggested by a defect of those instruments. and every provision. except it be local as to publie lands. &c.. may be traced to something in the history of England. All the amendments. from the first to the eleventh. inclusive. are merely the Bill of Rights or suggested by the inconveniences that had sprung up in England owing to the imperfection of the great charters of English liberty or to the crimes that were committed in the name of government before they were adopted. So the Constitution as much provides as though it said it in words. Congress shall. in providing for the government of the Army. have power to authorize courtsmartial. It does not sayin regard to the District of Columbia. that you shall have the power to organize a court. You have simply the power of legislation. but we know that in thenature of things courtsmay becreated bylegislation. and always have been. The Supreme Court of the United States is the only judicial tribunal in the United States named in the Constitution. Every other is a statutory court. The circuit courts. the district courts. the courts in the Territories and the District of Columbia. are all statutory."},{"1":"1879","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I do not justify the brutality of the treatment of those Chinese who are here. it is greatly to be regretted. it is greatly to be condemned. but you must deal with things as you find them.

I think it is a good deal cheaper and more direct way to avoid the trouble by preventing the immigration. I have heard a good deal about their cheap labor. I do not myself believe in cheap labor. I do not believe cheap labor should be an object of legislation. and it will not be in a republic. Yon cannot have the wealthy classes in a republic where suffrage is universal. legislate for cheap labor. I undertake to repeat that. I say that you cannot have the wealthy classes in a republic where suffrage is universal legislate in what is called the interest of cheap labor.

I say that to my honorable colleaguewhose whole life has been consistent and uniform in defense ana advocacy of the interests of the laboring classesthere is not a laboringman on the Pacific coast today who does not feel wounded and grieved and crushed by the competition that comes from this source. Then the answer is. IWell. are not American laborers equal to Chinese laborers? I answer that question by asking another. Were not free white laborers equal to African slaves in the South? When you tell me that the Chinaman driving out the free American laborer only proves the superiority of the Chinaman. I ask you. did the African slave labor driving out the free white labor from the South prove the superiority of slave labor? The conditions 5Ire not unlike. the parallel is not complete. and yet it is a parallel. It is servile labor. it is not free labor such as we intend to develop and encourage and build up in this country. It is labor that comes here under a mortgage. It is l.bor that comes here to subsist on what the American laborer cannot subsist on. You cannot work a man who must have beef and bread. and would prefer beer. alongside of a man who can live on rice. It cannot be done. In all such conflicts and in all such struggles the result is not to bring up the man who lives on rice to thebeef and bread standard. but it is to bring down the beef and bread max to the rico standard.

It throttled the prosperity of a fine andfair portion of the United States. and a worse than slave labor will throttle and impair the prosperity of a still finer and fairer section of the United States.

They have never lived for one month on their side by the terms of the treaty. A treaty. I repeat. which is interminable. so far as its own language is involved. when one party or the other desires it to be terminated. must be terminated by jest such action as this bill proposes. That question out. the only one we have to regard is whether on the whole we will devote that interesting and important section of the United States to be the home and the refuge of our own people and our own blood. or whether we will continue to leave it open. not to the competition of other nations like ourselves. but to Poese who. degraded themselves. will inevitably degrade uts.

Mr. President and Senators. the immediate occasion of the resolution now before this body grows out of a call on the President for information with respect to a raid on Rio Grands City. and a jail dolivery there by Mexican robberson the 12th of Augustlast. I willread to you a letter written by a gentleman of Rio Grands City. in reply to one froni General Ord. asking information on this subject : Rio GANV- Crr. dlunc 8. 1875. GLsxaAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of inter. rogatores. dated at San Antonio. Texas. May 25. 1875 in rlatiu to the affairs on thetio Grando. In answer. have to say: Ihavresiaed atioGrandoCityStarr County. since 1848. From 1848 up to 1859 armed bands of marauders croesse from different parts of Mexico into the State of Texas. robbing and murdering the citi. zens thereof. but not so frequent as they have done since 166. Onthe24th davof December. 1559. about four hundred and fifty armed men. with two pices of aitil. lery. commanded byJuan Ifepomuceno Cortina. efoesed from Matamoras and other towns in lexico. and robbed this town. and murdered four citizensof this county. and remained here until Major Hointzelman drove him to Mexico. Thofourclilzens were murdered for no other reason or cause than their great desire to rob and murder Americans. and they. at that. time. finding it to be a lucrative business. have made their raids into Texas almost daily ever since. The followingnamed citizens have been murdered by said bands at marodors from Meoxico. in this county: William Medinnoy. Thomas Robinson. JamesParks. James Patten. Silas Campbell. Jesus lRtveoWilliam U. Robertson. Captain Spears. John Box. Santos Garcia. James Dunn. Thomas Rolan. Thomas Murry. Pat For. Joseph Morel. James 3lcokwith and son. about twelve years old Jamsl Hill. William Hill. Joseph Steno. Stephan Cesac. Leon Cruvalla. Thomas iavard. John Conicy. Baney Lyons. two soldiema belonging to United States Itinth Cavalry. and many others whose names your relatr does not remember. and for no other cause than they worn Americans. Itwonld be impossible for me to make an estlnto of the amount of stock stolen by the said hands of marauders from Meoxico from the stockraisers of Tons. but I will aywith all confidence that they have stolen ever two hundred thousand head from them sincfe 1885. all of which have heme sold in Mfatmors. Montroy. and other towns in Mexico. Two hundred thousand head at $10 a head would be two million dollars worth of cattle. and hero is a hot fromono county. the county of Starr.-of twentysix Americans killed whose names are given by this man who was the county judge of that county. and all done by Mexican marauders. I asl if there is any Senator in this body who doubts as to the truth of the allegations that have been made of the insecurity of life and property and the depredations upon both that have been wrought by these marauders from Mexico? If there is a gentleman who doubts it I ask him to state his doubt. I challenge him to produce a single scintilla of proof and I will bring to sustain the affirmative of the issue the testimony of every Federal officer who has served in the State of Texas in the Army or in the civilcustoms service since 1865Gueneral C. C. Augur. than whom a more gallant and true soldier does not live. General E. 0. C. Ord. General Potter. now hero at the Soldiers Home in this city. transferred from Brownsville. Texas. an honored soldier of the Army of the United States. I refer to both general and subordinate officers. I refer to the messages to the Legislatures of Texas by the governors since 1865. I refer to the resolutions which have been passed by every Legislature that has convened since 1865 and to the resolution of the constitutional convention of 1875. I refer to the concurrent testimony of all the citizens. of every man who has spoken with reference to the condition of that country. I call upon them all. and I challenge contradiction when I say that that section of country has been overrun. has been despoiled. and that its wealth has been stripped from it. its people murdered. and in some instances its women violated. and children taken away. That section of country since 1658 has been more scourged than any portion of France under the advance of the Prussian army during the late European war. There is no portion of the South that was so utterly stripped of its values during the recent civil war as has been this country between thdRic Graude and the Nueces since 1865 by marauders from Mexico. Does any one doubt it.? I will refer to another report which speaks on this subject. There was a commission formed by a joint resolution of Congress in 1872 to investigate these depredations in the country of which Ispeak. The President of the United States was authorized to name three commissioners to go to the country and look into the matter. They went upon the ground. Let me read you a portionof their report: The commissioners feel fully warranted in expressing the opinion that for years past. espeiallysinee l8tS. and even before. armed bands of Mexicans have continally employed the safe refuge of an adjoining territory and the favorable river frontier to cress from Mexico into Texas. in strong parties. collect and drive away into Mexico unnumbered herds of cattle from this region. These thieves have. with astonlshing boldness. penetrated at times one hundred miles and oven farther ino Texas. and yday andnighthave carried on this wholesale plundering. employingforceandintimldationinalenseswhero resistanceorremonetrancowasmetwith. Conftderates living alon the banks of the river have been used in this nefarious trade. while honest ruidents hare been forced to keep silence or flee. 0 The Mexican bank of the Tho Grande (lravo) is occupied by numbersofranehes. furnishing a convenient rendezvous for these marauders. whence they carty on openly their operations. often leading to conflicts. Purssit to the riverank tIn many cascs has been mocked at. the ineffectual efforts of customs officers and inejlctors have brenjered at. and this region made to suffer from the continual sceurgoof these thieves. The butchers of ebfrontier Mexican towns. the stockdeal. erg. and in many eases. thoheads of the various ranches on theflexican side have vrticipated in the proits. encouraged the work. and protected the offenders. The uexiscan local authorities. as a le. civil and military. have been cognizant of these outrages. and have (with one or two honorable exceptions) protected the offenders. defeatedwith technical objections attempts at recoveryof the stolen property. awsisted In maintaining bands of thieves. or directly and openly havedealt in ihe plunder or apprepdated ft to theirpersonal uses. In all cases coming before theso corrupt officials. thoroughly acquainted by personal and official notification and public notoriety wththis seiious and continual breach of international rights. th.v have either protected the criminal and shared with him the propertv stolon. or elso have confessed an inability to check the outrages and punish the offender. (Executive flecnment Horse of Representatives. No. 59. Fortysecond Congress. third eeseian.) There were two sets of commissioners. one appointed in 1872 and the other in 1875. lask you. Mr. President. if it is not strange. if it is not wonderfully strange. that in twelve years there is ne man of authority in the State or National Government who has been to that country who has not given the very description of these outrages that is given in these reports. A great many of these occurrences transpired while I was the governor of Texas. and I speak whereof I know when I say that at one time during my administration there was imminent danger that every American upon that border would be assassinated. To escape assassination the people surrendered everything. crops. herds. and that too under the very shadow of the flag of the United States. and fled to the towns for safety. These reports are true. They are true. and they are substantiated by testimony tbatno man can gainsay. They enumerate the outrages. the men and women killed and wounded. the robberies committed. they give you the testimony of General Ord and General Augur. the two generals who have commanded in Texas. whose testimony is full upon every point. besides that of a great number of other witnesses. I ask that these reports be given the credit that is due to them. . If it should cross the mind of any Senator that these depredations perhaps will cease now.I recall you to the letter that I read from Rio Grando City. dated June 8.1875. giving the names of twentysix men who have been killed in that county by these naranders. and stating that two hundred thousand head of cattle had beendriven from Texas. I ask you to remember that that is the very county. into which the raid was made. on the 12th of August last. the jail broken open. the county attorney and the jailer and his wife shot. prisoners liberated. and whence the malefactors returned to Mexico. pursued to the banks of the Rio Grande by United States troops. These outrages have been occurring every day since 1865. I cll the attention of Senators to the fact. if they need any additional testimony of the good faith of Texas in presenting her claims for protection bere. that about $1.300.000 since 1865 have been ekpended by the State of Texas in arming. equipping. and maintaining troops upon her border for the defense of her people against Mexican and Indian raids. and the demand for reimbursement is pending hero new and will be urged as a just claim against this Government. because the Government is constitutionally bound to afford to the people of these United States and to each State protection against invasion. and when a State is left to take care of herself. as Texas has been. it should at least refund the money expended for that purpose. I have only to cite the sworn testimony of the most worthy officials of the Governmont of the United States to prove that Texas has been invadedcontinually since 1865. I find another letter on this report from General Ord. from which I take the following: flavff examined the country and visited many of the ranches and places named find. from best seures of information. that the within statements ar generally rliableThat is. the affidavits. letters &c a few of which I have read. which were forwarded to the War bepartment and submitted by the War Department to the committee who made the report.. and which with a mass of other testimony accompanies the report. He continues: And that while there are quite a number of useful and peaceable M exicanus settled on the east side of the Rio Grande. like all Mexicans not jte d razorn. they submit docilely to any power or force that chooses to override them. so that. the country being now overridden by the Mexican raiders. civil authority ever. awed or elected by peons in their interest. the military powerless for the reason that. while really it is a time of war and public danger. no proclamation to that effect has been made by the President. and the aforesaid civil authority (Mexican) is paramount. and every judge and sheriffof the State. knowing the facts. assd d me it was impossible to convict any raider. murderer. or offender who may be connected with or under the protection of the raider bands. The circumstances are almost identical with the piracies on our commerce once committed hy the Algerians. who fled in safety with their prizes to their own ports. There the effenses were aommitted on thoopon seas. hero they are committed with the came case and atrocities. on the open pains. In both cases the pirates found a ready sale for their captures in tho ports where their expeditions were fitted ot. namel.. Algiers and Tripoli. for the Moors. and Matamoras. Reynosa. Camargo flier. and Guerera. for the Mexicans. and in both cases the pirates were rewarded . by promotion. The leader of the band that murdered Lovell in May last. and plundered the customhouse at Carizo. is now captain of the guard at Mlier. An honored Mexican officia!I I have to ask that these papers and this letter be referred to the Secretary of State. Very reectfully. your obedient servant. E. 0. 0. 01D. .Brigadiereneral. United Stat Armny. Commanding. AkDJ=TAxTGFAL U msrD ST.&TES ARMY. WasMngf on. D. C. Can any one doubt when such men as these speak ? I have not taken the testimony of any obscure man to vex this body with. but here are a great number of depositions made by men who are known among the people. and who are as honest and true as men can be. I have simply taken the testimony of officials who are trusted. who are under oath. and who speak with a full knowledge of the responsibilities attaching to what they say. I assume. then. that it will be believed by this body and by the American people that the section of country in the State of Texas between the Rio Grando and the Nucces River. commencing at the mouth of the Rio Grando and running three hundred miles up that stream and extending to the Nueces has been overrun. its commerce destroyed. industries paralyzed. and a great proportion of its property taken by the strong hand. while hundreds of the inhabitants have been cruelly butchered. and all done by robbers and cutthroats from Mexico. Thus. Mr. President. these things are shown to be true. The reports of Mexican outrages in Texas. which for twelve long years have been discredited as the fabrications of designing people for unworthy purposes. are established by an overwhelming array of testimoiy to be true. It is also from the same testimony seen that since 1865 the depredations upon that country have been continuous. that they have never ceased. and the transactions at Rio Grande City of the 12th of August last will convince the Senate and the country that this predatory war still continues. and that the condition on the Rio Grande is a standing menace to the lives of the American citizens on that border. that the time when General Ord certifies in his testimony that the country is in possession of these raiders from Mexico hs not become yet a thing of the past. and if not new an existing reality. that the danger of its being so again is imminent. These facts I desire to impress upon the Senate and the country. It has been represented that Texas wanted war. It hasbeen said to me a number of times in this Hall. You Texans are trying to rush us into a war on the Rio Grande. you want to get up afight to make money out of it. In answer to that suggestion I call gentlemen to the record. I call them to the facts. I call them to the sworn testimony . I call them to the representations of honorable men and officors. State and Federal. civil and military. We want no war in Texas. The life of Texas has been a stormy one. In 1836 she achieved her independence through a baptism of fire and blood. In 1845 she ranged herself under the flag of the United States. and in the war with Mexico. which grew out of annexation. wherever the fight was thickest her hosts were found. Her cons died upon every battlefield of the great civil war. We want no more war. We want peace. We have seen enough of NomvhEnr 14. fields of carnage and of the desolations of war. We want peace. we want commerce. we want trade. -we want recuperation. we want development. The clash of arms is no music to our ears. We have forborne upon the Mexican border. Texas has forborne. Mr. President. it is an easy thing for one to summon a great deal of philosophyto hisaid in bearing the ills and woes of others. Texas has borne her own. and the other States of the Union have not felt them. She asks her sister States now not to waste all their charity ipen her despoilers. but to dispense some of it at home. We have no complaints to male. but we do ask if forbearance is as great a virtue now as it was twelve or fifteen years ago. for Texas has. suffered sorely for that length of time. we ask if forbearance has not ceased to be a virtue. at least so far as the wrongs of the despoiled and robbed and murdered people on our border are concerned. We ask it of this Congress. -we ask it of the American people. As to our suffering since 1865. we are willing to shut the mouth of every man. woman. and child in the South. except the officers of the Federal Government. the military themselves. and rest the issue on their testimony. Forbearance is no longer a Christian virtue in this matter. The honor of this country. the honor of the flag which floats over this Capitol. demands that Texas be left no longer to wage this unequal fight. With all her resources surrendered to the Federal Government. with her treatymaking power. her warmaking power. her resources for revenuo surrendered to the Federal Government. she should be no longer required to defend the integrity of a national boundary. I repeat. the national honor. no less than constitutional justice to Texas. demands it. while the prestige and respectability of American citizenship require it. Lot it beknown that to bean American citizen is to invoke the power of the Government in 1is behalf against spoliation from abroad as well as -wrong at home. That is all we ask. and surely it is not more than we are entitled to nor less than a just Government will grant. As my colleague showed a while ago. Texas is faultless. she is blameless. not a single raid has over been made from Texas on the otherside. I assert that to be a fact. The proof is in this volume from which I have quoted. Secretary Fish. in his correspondence with the Mexican authorities. challenged theproduction of an instance. There are thickly populated settlements on the other side of the river. The people have but little to live on. no agriculture scarcely. and but little stock. A large proportion of them on and near the river live by theft and robbery. Our people have been the victims. They are too busy trying to take care of themselves to go on the other side of the river.7and the truth is that no raid has been made from the Texas side. None can be alleged. The next question which arises is as to the remedy for the great evils of which we complain. How can our people be protected and our border defended? Some gentlemen will say. We shall have to go to war with Mexico in order to defend you. I do not thinkso necessarily. The national Mexican government seems disposed to deal justly and do right. If the orders of the national Mexican government wore obeyed upon the Rio Grando frontier. we should have no trouble. but they are disobeyed. The federal Mexican officers on that border commanding troops. when ordered to execute the treaty of extradition. resign. Whatthen? Shallwe try to getup another treaty? When we can make a treaty which will execute itself without the intervention of men to execute it. it will do very well. but as long as Mexicans have to interpret and to execute treaties. what confidence can -we have in such an expedient under such a government? Take the experience of the recent past and it wilt dispel the delusion that any one may labor under that any justice or security is to be expected from that source. What is that experience? When these criminals from Mexico went to Rio Grande City. broke open the jail. tooktho prisoners and carried them off. the Mexican authorities returned one of the prisoners and two of the raiders upon our demand. I think there were between fifteen and twenty of the raiders and five released prisoners. President Diaz required his officers upon the frontier to arrest all and deliver them over. Did they do it ! They arrested some of the raiders and the prisoners. and because the treaty only provided for the extradition of citizens of Texas fleeing to the other side of the Rio Grande on our part and of citizens of Mexico fleeing to this side of the Rio Grande. and hence did not apply to citizens of Mexico who came over and committed crimes and went back. they refused to deliver them. I It is laid down by Vattel to be. and it is. an undisputed principle in the system of international law. comity. and courtesy which -prevail amongeiviized nations. that when a citizen crosses the boundary into a friendly country and commits robbery. murder. or any other grave felony. and flies back to his own country across the boundary. if the government of the country which has jurisdiction over him fais to deliver him up. it thereby adopts and indorsb the offense. The legal effect of the conduct of a government which fails to deliver up a great criminal. although no extradition treaty exists. when the knowledge is brought home to that government of the heinousness of the offense. is an indorsement of the crime. and it becomes responsible for it. I assert that to be a principle of international law. subjectonlyto one qualification which does not obtain in this case. and that qualification is that where a friendly power makes use of that spirit of comity in order to prefer unfounded charges and got possession of and annoy and oppress citizens of another power. that other power is justified when it comes to that conclusion. in refusing to deliver. But in the Rio Grande City ease there is no pretense that the parties are not guilty. on the contrary. their guilt is expressly admitted. What would another treaty embodying this principle of international law hvail. when the principle is recognized as of binding force among the civilized nations of the earth independent of any treaty. and is disregarded by Mexico. or rather by the extradition authorities of the Mexican state of Tamaulipas! The national Mexican authorities make treaties. hut the agents who are supposed to execute them are the local state authorities on the frontier. The judges at Matamoras. at Camargo. and at other towns on the Rio Grande. are elected by a rabble. a felon rabble. maintained in office by a criminal lazaroni. and dominated by a community of freebooters. -ho live by the lance and the spur. These are the judges to whom. forsooth. we must look for the extradition of their criminal constituents who invade our country! II usestrong language. but the testimonyjustifies it. I quote the language of the congressional report so often referred to: When we now look upon the fearful history of rapine. murder. and wholesale robbery which from that day to this present dato has desolated and in still dolatag ear bordor. the rbber commumiies that hae sprng up and are constantly increasing. a whole population living on mum hat they plandor fr their neighbors. and a sot of local authorities conniving at and participating in the esils et these notorious crimes. grown to be aregular means of livelihood. we cannot wonder at this result when we reflect et the rendition of a gorament which had to confer rank and position en a success!falrobber in order to avoid his hostility. President miax did order the delivery of the Rio Grande city criminals. :His officers were forced by public opinion to resign. Tire state authorities of Tamalipas. acting as extradition agents. us officers on the borderaiwnys do. amenable only. as they contend. to Mexican federal authority. refused to execute the treaty. We have this snt of case. then: we have a treaty with the national Mexican government which cannot he -enforced. and. on accout of tie excessive magnanimity of the Government of the United States. its extreme patience and forbearanceif this alone be relied qnthe peopie of Texa must continue to suffer in future as they have done in the past. I ma ke no opposition to another treaty with Mexico which may be deemed mere efficacious than the existing one. I only protest against a reliance on any sort of treaty alone for relief. I have laid the facts before this body that the country may know them. in order that we may have peace. in order that no more shams. that no more promises iade to be broken shall be made. but that the strong right arm of this Government may be interpoed between my people and the foreign bandits who have made war upon them. Treaties are all right . they do very well as a part and parcel of a plan of defense. but they will not do to rely on alone. 1Prepeat that the authorityupon the border of the Mexican Repreblie. so far as we are concerned. so far as we most look to it. resides not in the central government. but in the local authorities on the hank of the river. Hear what General Ord says on that subject on page 29 of the report: The number of ceeaus who have been driven by revolution and by their awn lawless nte from Central and Southern anxico up to the order of the ile ceando. probably to escpe the result of their offenses. has filledihat country with lawless ant desperate a rea.

It is ai example of their excellence. it unfolds their beneficence. it illustrates most grandly their equality. .His selfexertion was the key to his sumcess. He was born in ohseurity amid the wilds and snows of New Hampshire. Without friends. without influence. extreme poverty forced bim at an early age into a close eompanionship with daily niuaiiai tillage of New lampshires sterile soil. He was cheerful. iotlthy. manly. contented. and industrious. His early years were spent in the Spartan simplicity and purity of New England life. Without books. he coveted knowledge. This very want created that very independenco of Thought which afterward became so prominent an element in his life. Selfwioughit. selfreliant. HENRY WILSON was molded in that massive New ilampshire manhood of which Woodbury. and Chase. and Webster were the grander and more conspicuous [ypes. Subsequently agricultural labor was exchanged for the mnanufac[are of shoes. In 1855. by selfculturo ard industry and study. the shoemaker of Massachusetts becomes the reprcsentativo of Massachisetl sin this Representative Chamber of eqnals.

This is not the time nor am I the person to enter into time consideration of the public character and services of HENRY WIL+SON. interwoven as they have been with the history of our country during periols of intense sectional excitement. including as they do a gigantic bloody civilvar. HENnR WILSON was in my judgment sire ofaui enithnsiast aiid of a politician thasnof a clear. philosophical. wellbahsriecd statesman.. Liberty to him was aii extravagait daydrea!nI Its very xcess. without limitation without restriction. in violation of law. was with him an accomplishment most earnestly. most constantly. and most sincerely desired. Could HENRY WILSON have known it there were other states men in southernportions of the old thirteen States who. could they have willed it. would have gladly removed slavery. There were others. too. statesmen aid patriots. bright luminaries in the Shae ill which H ENRY WILSON was born. and the State in which lie subsequently lived. and where he now sleeps. who would have rejoiced to have seen slavery removed. But these wise moii would have iecn regulated by law. They wonld have taken no step which did not find its Sasction in the Constitutioi. Such statesmen were part and parcel of the brave men who won our liberties and then intrencihed them in a system of selfgovernment. bhiding together in a bond of constitutional brotherhood the glorious old thirteeei Stats. that revered American Union which is reflected above us with the standard. shield. and isignia of every State always above usathat Union which was horn of and created by the Constitution of the United States . that Union which its founders from every State of the original thirteen solemnly declared and pledged themselves should be perpettal. but in which the nascent zeal of some of their descendants. I lament to sayc did not concur. But I forbear. The life. public character. and statesmanship of HfENRY WILSO will be on ansotlM ocasion and at another time intrusted to other hands. Be mine the privilege on this mournful occasion to speak only of traits in the character of the departed which cosinasded my admiration. and upon which. now that he is gone. I shall long dwell rpon with melancholy pleasure. I knew lImENcY WILSON for eighteen years. When I entered the louse if Represen0atives in 1857 Mr. WILSON had taken his seat in this Chamber hit a short time before. My intercourse was formal but friendly. When I suibsequently entered the Sentte in 1871 lie rceived me with a kindness and a cordiality which I can never forgot. The official conduct of Mr. WILSON was always unexceptiontible. As a Senator. lie was dignified. urbano. kind. and respectful. As its presiding officer lie was just. honest. and iipartial. and sought always to do right. No isan could have bcen mnore simple and Iiorc nnosteitatios il his tastes. or. as it secured to me. more selfdenying and frugal in his expenditures. But it is just to sb.y that my intorcotrso with VicePresident WILSON extended only to public auid iersonal intercourse in these halls.

On the 20th day of September last lIon. WILDER D. FOSTER. a Representative from the fifth district of Michigan. sank to his last rest. He mot the last sinimons in the midst of family and friends. receiving every kind attention that devoted affection could suggest. Ilis last visious on earth were of scenes most endeared to him by the nmonries of the past. atd Ie ended his esrthly career in the city of his homo. where as neighbor. friend. husband. and father he had been longest known and was best appreciated. Mr. FOSTER was born iu Orange County. New York. on the 8th of Jaunary. 1319. In the year 1337 he moved to the State of Michigan. and the year following found him toiling as a mechanic in the village of Grand Rapids. His industry. sound judgment. and integrity were the sure passports to business success. and from a humble beginning he advanced to a prominent position among the manmfacturers and merchants of what is now the second city of our State. For thirty years lie was identified with the interests of that oity. and no man enjoyed in a greater degree the confidence and respect of its citizens. While hesought no officiad recognition. the clear. sterling sense of his neighbors sought him out. as the man who. tried by years of experience. was the proper depositary of official responsibility. For a quarter of a century he was a member of the board in whose charge the educational iiterests of Iis city were placed. Me filled repeatedly the offices of city treasurer and mayor. He was a inember of the State senate for two years. He was elected it 1871 to the Fortysecond Congress. and was reelected to the Fortythird Congress by the largest majority ever given i the counties composing the district. Mr. i.osivn was possessedof vigorous constitution and hadenjoyed uniform good health. The cares and confinement of congressional life had. during the last sessiouimpaircd it. but when he left this Hall in March last he did it with a hopeful confilenee that wasted vigor would be restored by change of scene and relaxation fron labor. but the heavy liand of disease had. fastened itself upon bin . human sympathy and still wern alike unavalliug to alleviate its rigor or lighten its weight. and arranging his worldly interests in view of the approachhig cud. he went down into the dark valley with the confideuce that is horn of a clear conscience and au honest life. It was my fortune during the last session of Congress to live nider tlhe same roof with my late colleague--to meet him daily at the same board. and I therehad abundaut opportunity tolearn his worth. appreclate his excellence. anti prize his friendship. As a legislator le was marked by clearness of apprehension. soundness of judgment. and sterling integrity of purpose. As a mau lie possessed the generous inpulses and the winning frankness which secured for hi popularity anI esteem. Knowing him as 1 did. I could well understand why the tidings of his death were to his constituency the announcement of the loss of a longtried atoll valiable friend. He had no enemies. Performing his own duties iu private life. titd making his own record ill public life. as his conscience and judgment dictated. he won alike the respect of political friends and foes. Thereis nuch. Mr. Speaker. in the contests of political parties which savors of uncharitableness. of unfairness. and of bitter detraction toward candidates for place. but it was a bright contrast to this prevailing tendency when the political opponents of Mr. FosienR assembled in convention to nominate his successor. They prefaced their deliberations by a resolution bearing public testimony to the psurity of his character and the worth of his services. It was a departure from the usual routine of convention work. and it showed how a good mans life disarmed the hostility of partisan warfare. By his death the State loses an honored citizen and a faithful Represontative. The city of his residence misses tine who was foremost it every good workof deve]opn nt and iuprovomenu. The poor will nies a ciid counselor andi geueroustfrienul. But it is within the saietuary of his own home that the darkest shadow rests. It is where he was best known and most fonlly loved diat the blow falls with most crushing weight. But even to these mourners this loss is not without its consolttions. The legacy of a stainless reputation is to them more precious than the competence which his industry hd carned. The eonsciosness that tm respinsibilities uf his life had been well met. Ihat its duties had been well performed. is a satisfactiot even it the hour of sorrow. and the tribute that we pay to his memory in these feeble utteratnces. and in the expression which this [teuse is about to make. 3vill tic a grateful recollection to those who mourn.

As a further mark of respect. that this ouse do now adLiourn."},{"1":"1873","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. this is one of the mrest important questions. I thi k. that has been presented for our censideration since we have had a history as a nation. and it presents itself as well in a political as in a moral point of view. 1b is grave question presents itself in a double aspect. In one aspect. it is wholly a matter of fat. having no personal relation whatever with any one involved in or connected with it. in the other. it is essentially a personal uratter. I athe former. it is proposed to set aside an election. in the latter. it is proposed to purge the Senate of a. inember considered not fit or proper to be in it. by expelling him. Is the former. a. mero mjority only is required to effect it. in the latter. a vote of twothirds is necessary. The importance and significance of the difference between the two are at once seen. It is provided in the Constitution of the United States thatEach House shall be the judge of tha elections. returns. and qualifieations cf its own members. And. again. thatEach Hlouse may. with the oneurrence of twothirds. expel a member. In the exercise of she former power. we are to Juirge. and that infers. I take it for granted. that we are to judge of the facts as presented upon the case. and determine their force and effect. In the exercise if the latter power. so unlimited is it in terms. that we may exercise it without a reason or cause. although policy and every sense of right would dictate. if they did not absolutely imply. that it should never be aprieiuusly. wanstonly. or unjustly exercised. It is said. and truly said. that the same powe s are conferred upon this body and the House of Representatives to judge of the elections of their respective oruibers. Both Hlolses are addressed at the sano time and in the same language in that clause of the Constitution. which grants these powers. Bet still is it not apparet that this power. so granted. to judge of the election ef meembers. mast be qualilied or applied differently. as the constituencies of each House. if I may so speak. are so entirely and radically different? The exercise of this power. I admit. will be the same ia both cases where the sam. cendition of things exists. When we get beyond this. and the very elcmonts of the electio change. the application of this power may also clange. Members of the Horse of Representatives are choser directly by the people. Senators are chosen by the legislatures of the States. The Crestitution is explicit here: The Senate of the Tilted States shall be composed of two Senators fiom each State. chosen by the legislature thereof for six years. Eaeh person. therefore. in votingforaniomher oftlieloirse is bruiiglit in his segregated and individsal capacity iu direct relation to that body. In elections. however. to tis body. the legislature. not the memers of the legislature. bnt tIre legislatro rits ai political entity. as anr organized body representing irs this very act of eltoosing Senatcrs the sovereign power anid dignity of the State. and as the solemn act of the State itself. is brought only i direct relation to this body. not the individul nmembers constituting the legislature. bt the legislature as err organized power speaking for the State and annourring the action of the State. Each State shall have two Senators. Therefore the action of the legislature can be the only subject for the judgment of this chamber in determining the election of Senators. And no dorbt. nuder this power. we may inquire whether it was a legislature that chose at Senator or whether it was not some unautlsorized body. whether. as in the case of Asher and Robbins. the legislature had the power at the time tre Senator was chosen todo it. and whether it was done according to the mode and aranuer as prescribed by law. Tio louse of Representatives can equally inquire into tie fact whether the persons voLirng for membors of that House hal the right to vote. but then the inquiry may extend far beyond this as the relal ions between the voter and the House will justify it. The difference ill the application of this power to the act of a legislature in electing a Senator. and that of a person in electing a irnber of the House. niay be plainly illustrated. In the case of the election of a member of the louse. the qualifications of the voter can unquestionably be inquired into. but does any one pretend to claim the power that we can inquire into the qualifications of merrbers of a legislature in order to judge and determine whether a choice of Senators has been made by legally qualified members? Can such a power as this be admitted for t moment to be vested in this body l Never! And why it? Becans. in the lirst place the legislature is a sovereign body. and referred to in tie Constitution ms the only body tifrich eon exercise the right of choosing Senators. and because. next. the legislature is the creature of the constitution of the State. which is air expression of the supreme will of the State. and organized with the power to judge of the qualifications of its owes niemhers. and which. too. as a pririal law in representative government. is irdispeisable to the political entity and moral being of any State. No other power can iefringe upon this right and the bodypolitic remain an independent and free State. Allow any other power to determine who nre to constitute a legislative bod3. and it is the end of a free representative goresrment. Concede to this body the power to inquire as to who shall constitute a State legislature. and therefore to determine who are the members composing it. and you yield at once your whole form of government. Admit this power. and yea make this body the judge. not only of the electiou of its own members. but the judge of the election of urembers of other bodies intended to be of equal power aind dignity within their sphere w ith our own body in its sphere .ad to be as iree as we ourselves are. ard with as full powers of solfprotection as we ourselves posss as a legislative body. I think it unst be observed that there is a manifest qualification of the power when applied to the act oft legislature as eontradistinguished frorn the iirdividual voter for a Representative to the other House. Therefore. as we cannot inquire into the qualification of a member of a legislatire. how is it that we can go behind its expressed will and inquire into the motives of members to ascertain the reason for it? It is the solemn act of a bodypolitic. and it is the act. the result of their expressed will. that is the only effective ting. and that which alone car be considered. and not the segregated conduct of individials. Iciinot. therefore. entertain ing these views. vote for the resolution reported by the committee declaring in substance the election to be void. Always disinclined. as I am. to the exercise of any power not clearly granted. I always regret the exercise of any doublfel power. and have always hitherto opposed it. ard. conceding for the sake of the argumeunt that this is even at doubtfrrl power now attempted to be exercised in setting aside this election. I am. fror its very extraordinary character. and from what I apprehend to be its dangerous tendencies. the more resolutely opposed to it. Why not resort to a power we do possess ir this case. the power of expulsion ? Why not. rather than to a doubtful power. ait all events a power that is contested on this floor as uo power at all by sonee. however clear it may be to others. as the rightful exercise of an undoubted power ? True. it requires mt reater nirtber of votes to effect results. but if the facts show a ease ior avoiding the election on acconos of fraud and bribery. and with the complicity of the Senator on trial. there can be no moral difficulty in asserting our undoubted power of expulsion. I desire to be understood in the exercise of this power of expnlsin. I would that it should never be resorted to bat upon the strictest principles. and never perverted to base uses. I would look witlr solicitude and with apprehension ulion its exercise for acts comnitted before the election of a Senator. ari which the people and their representatives in the legislatre might be supposed to know before th election. Alter the election they are concluded. the Senatoreleot has passed beyond their power. and afterward can only be amenable to this body for his conduct. Happily. in the ease before us we are not pressed beyond tse reasonable exercise of our powers. the acts were eommitted in and about the election. and consummatedsince. in fact all of them being of the res .qut. and because of which the whole thing constitutes one act frono its ineipieney before the election. through the electior. and up to the time when the sioney was paid and the oath of offien taken. Therefore. in every aspect of the ease. I prefer tir exercise of tire latter power. and shall vote accordingly. It is stid that unless we assort this power of setting aside an cleter. -ailrouads audotherpowerfrl corpo etions and combinations may corrupt with impunity riotibers of legislatures. and secure the return of Senators to this chamber entirely in their interest. and yet at the same time the Senators themselves not be criminally cognizant of the corrupt moans used to send them hero. and thus. so fir as their own personal conduct is concerned. not be subject to our censure. and perhaps ought not to be amenable to our power. This is an apprehended evilindeed. I may admit that it. is an irpeniding evil. but still. prudence would suggest that we do not rush upon the exercise of doubtful powers. much less of those not granted. in order to prepare for the redress of evils not yet upon us. and especially when we have. as in this case. the admitted power to redress the wrong alike committed upon the people and upon thi body. I sensitively shrink from the exercise of a power that places the solemn action of a State legislature. and which it is admitted is the absolute right of the legislature under the Constitution. and required by it to ih done. in the grasp of a more majority of this body. I appreciate ti power. and fear as much as any one the influences of railroads and other corporations. of capital antd conubiaations of wealth. in sending Senators into this chamber. but may not. upon the other hand. this more majority be approached by those poworful influences and combinations to unseat a member who might be obnoxious on account of his purity. honesty. and independence. as well as to seat one in their interests ? Examples are not wanting. even in our own brief history. to show that majorities are to be no more trusted here than elsewhere. I can well conceive from my historical and personal knowledge and experience. that tlere are tilues and occasions when I would sooner trust majorities upon the outside of this chamber than a majority in it. A more majority to do these things. either to set aside an election or expel a meniber may have the strongest motives to do either. while generally there must be a total absence of any motive. except that of strict right. with.the twothirds. For twothirds could not well be called upon to expel a member in order to accomplish any legislative objeet. when a majority could do it as well. Mr. President. it was not my purpose to say much upon the legal or constitutional aspect of this ease . it was only to express to this chamber the views that shall regulate tiy conduct in giving tny vote ott this question . but I cannot avoid hero for one moment noticing an argumnt or two submitted by the honorable Senators from Ohio [Dr. Tnuint~iev] and Georgia. [Mir. Nonavoon.) antI. if I itistake not. if I rtuderstood hin. Ihi Senator from Misseeri. [Mr. Scttuax.] It struck me that the whole tendency of their respective arguments was this. that there should be some body somewhero with power to act as the censor of the miembers of the legislatures of the States. It struck tie that tie certainly was the tendency of the argument of lmy honorable friend from Oisio. It was the sum and substance of the arguient of my ionorable friend from Gedrgia that there should be sotue power residing somewhere to judge. dotormine. and correct the rmiscotdnet of members of the legislatures of the States in the election of Senators. atd they iunhesitatiugly said that if there were nosuei power in express terms granted in the Constitution. it ouglht to be. But they asserted that that power was fully confbrred upon this body under that provision which authorizes it to judge of tile elections of Senator by thm legislatures. Now. Mr. President. have we come to this ? Are the States. are the members of the legislatures of the sovereign States of this Union. to pass under the censorship of this body ? True. they may be corrap true. they ray act badlythe people everywhere teay act badlya whole nation may not baidlybut how cat that be helped. nid where but in the people themselves does the retiedy lie? Are we to determine--aro we seaventyfour Senators. botling our offices for six years. responsible to nobody. not either responsible to our own States or to the people. for that period of timeto set ourselves up itt this chamber as censors on the conduct of members of the legislature? Are we to go hehind their act as a body. anl inquiro into the motives of meibers for doing it I Are wo to ask their reasons ? The Senator frouc Maine is to comae into my State. aid inquire into the motives of represtntativts of the people there. supposed to be good unu. luid. if not. that is our misfortune. It is otar misfortuno if they are not good and pure men. and tIme peplo there ought to apply the roittedy. as they have the power and we have not the power to do it. If they send :iupure men here. it is both a shame aud a wrong. but tie rest of the eouutry nst bear with it until rectified by the people or by ourselves when we can properly and legally do it. Let the remaining Senators hold us accountable for our legislation arid personal conduct. If ve are corrupt here. turn us out. lhold us amenable for our conduct as Senators. But let nob this body. let not Senators outside of my State. the Senator. for example. from California. sitting hty me. cone into my State. atid undertake to put the members of may legislature o triol. and inquire of them. How did you conie to east youtr vote for Mr. l:IAMlTtoN. cr Mr. DENNIS We avant to know your reasons. Was ttotey given to you. was office held out to you. was a pistol drawn upon yo . were you threatened. were you intimidated. so that under fear you cast your vote ? And hero I will observe. speaking about fear and duress. and about which so much has been said. that it iust be that whon it goes to the impressment of a legislature as a body and affects it ts a body. I spoke about a pistol being drawn. upon a member. it was upon the occasion of a. senatorial election. and an illustration here. If I mistake not. that occurred in the State of Pennsylvania. that is. if my information is true. and 1 have no reason to questio it. for it is very hard to beat the honorable Senator from rennsylvania [Mr. C. s nur.oa] when either democrats or republicans are in power in that State. especially when the legislature is closely divided in its politics. We Ituow that from experience. W know. orat all events are advised. that when Mr. Bucktlow. lately a Senator here. was elected by one or two votesthere being a democratic inajority in the legislaturethat a member voted with a pistol by his side. Now. in illustration. say upon that occasion there were fifty oin one side and fifty on the other. and this one vote determined the election. Would you call that duressatd niore particularly a dnress of the body of the legislature? One utan there. for the sake of the argument. was under duress out of the hundred. ant would this give you the power to inquire into and set aside the act of that legislature in the election of a Senator ? And for what. if so? Because Otto uiun was fighteued out of one hundred b e. being a democrat. frightened to do what he ought to have done without any idnceument or threat. while all around bim were cool and calm. and never dreamed of hurting or of being hurt. Would Sot undertake to assume jurisdiction. inquire into. and set that election aside? Would you undertake to inquire and to determine whether that member voted in fear. or because he was a deumocrat. and therefore. in allegiance to his party. voted for the democratic candidate? It would be both a troublesome and a delicate inquiry. and would lead to all kinds of assumptions of power. 1. fur one. do protest against tis hotly Pining into my State aiid trying the memnbersof ti legislatre as to thour casousor motives for pterforating a legislativeo futiction. whether from fear or from fatvor. for otfice or for motley. -whther frotit State conssiderations or from personal feelings. whether to seek vengeance or secure favor. for if your power to inquire for one thiig is admitted. you at once miakoit limitless. You may rut the action of tie legislature upon trial. you may ascertain whether it was a legislative body. and whether its action was in conformity to law. You ttay possibly inquire whether one hundred members voted or whether cue hundred muskets voted ill their stead. and this would refer to tire question of duress. if such a term can be applied to a functional legislative body. The honorable Senator from Missouri. [Mr. Sonune.] for the purpose of establishing a distinction or prineile that I cannot precisely ntuderstand. asked a question of the honorable Senator from Delaware [Mr. BiyAtn.] whether the Senate was notthe creation of the Constititiou. Of cotrse it is the creation of the Constitution ! Therefore. is it not an independent body. and has it not aright tojudgc of such things so eitirely connected with itself as the election of its own tuembers?1 I givo the substance asitear a e an. not hiswords. True. bttitcan only jud(ge nder the owers coniferred by theConstittitno. Admit that Senators are not here in an enihassadorial capacity. we are still here utler the limitations of the Constitution. and can only exrise the powers therein granted. we can judge. or do any other thing. only so far as it is authorized by the Constitution. We are here to represent what? To represet the States. thei r sovereignty. rights. and powers. The Constitution says that each State shall have two Senators. to do what. to determine what ? To do and performn all acts and things as prescribed aid required to be done by the Constitution. and nothing besides. The States did not scud us here. nor does the Constitution give us the power. to sit in judgment and decide who composed the members of a legislature. and much less their reasons for any aoeo. however absurd or wrong it may appear to be. if the Constitution fails because of the corruptions of tie people. our form of government fails. and all is brought to a disastrous end. If we cannot get along under the Constitution without undertaking to uproot and upturn all our previots ideas connected with its limited powers. lot us m tknowledge the failure. and let us set towork to make a different nad a better one if we can. If this power ought to exist to hold in check and conect the corruptions of the people or their representatives. lot us make it. let us have it amended. and let us have it fixed that we are to sit here as censors upon tie acts and conduct of the menibers of our legislative bodies in the States. Then let us have fall powers to judge and determine reasons. motives. conduct. everything. This being at body respensible to no 0110 for six years duration.it may be able. I haveio doubt. in the opinion of ate. to give ats fair an examinatio and as impartial a judgment as evei Cate the censor did. But so far as I am myself concerned. I never would give to this body. or to any other. such a power over the members of the legislatures of sovereign States. Such a poer wold be consolidation itself. I have thus briefly commented. and in a very imperfect maenner. upon the legal part of the case. Now let me turn imy attention to its moral condition and political relations. Mr. President. this is a most painful duty we are now obliged to discharge as Sotators. I know the Senator upon trial. Our relations have been friendly and pleasaut. and his deportment and cotidnet upon this lor have beea ntnexeeptionable. His great misfortune lit his aspirationts for a seat in this chamber was that his plane or thought and feeling did not rise higher than the atmosphere of Kansas. The testimony shows a horrible condition of things there both in a moral and a political sense. The honorable Senator from Illinois iMr. Lotxre] has criticised. and I an iot here to say that hte has nfiairly criticised. ihe charauctr aud testimony tnd concldt of some of the prominent wittesses against Mr. CALDWELL. and has denounced them as bad. corrupt tieit. miii unworthy of belief. But however bad and corrupt these titt may MAARdu 20. be. the trouble of the Senator on trial is that they were his associates and friends. or at least coworkers in this matter . and it is admitted by lim that he paid $15.000 to one of them. Carney. and a written agreement to that effect was executed and delivered. under a contract that he. Carney. should not be a candidate for this seat. It is also proved. by a friend of Mr. CaiDWELL. Mir. L. Smnith. that an additional $7.000 went to Carney. in the slupe of expeuscs. mkiig $22.000 altogether. though Carney. while admitting the payment of the $7.000 by"}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
