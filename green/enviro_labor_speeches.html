I would simply say with respect to one of these bills. the Debt Management and Fiscal Responsibility Act. I dont know whether that bill requires the House to do the same. but certainly both the executive and the legislative branches of government need to have a responsible fiscal program and analysis so that. in fact. we can move toward fiscal balance. I look forward to having that discussion next week on the floor. Mr. Leader. we had a prayer breakfast this morning. It was a moving and very. I think. unifying time here in Washington where we had Republicans and Democrats and a lot of people from around the world attending. We talked about coming together. We talked about respecting one another. talking to one another. and serving our country and our people in a way consistent with our various faiths. In that context. I am going to ask the gentleman some questions on the scheduling. but I am hopeful that the Speaker has indicated that he wants to consider some broad issues. He refers to five in particular: national security. jobs and economic growth. health care. poverty and opportunity. and restoring the Constitution. I am not sure exactly what that last phrase means. but in any event. I think all of us want to make sure the Constitution is honored and certainly adhered to. However. it also appearsand we had this discussion last weekthat substantive legislationthat is. translating thoughts and objectives and visions into legislationmay not occur in 2016. I dont know that to be the case. but I fear that to be the case. that we will not offer to the American people in this critically important election year specifies as to what we might do. I mention specifically the Affordable Care Act. which I know the gentlemans party believes is not good policy. whether or not we were going to consider an alternative to do what your party has said it is going to do for the last 5 years. and that is repeal. but replace with policies. I think that would be a useful discussion for us to have and do so in a way that respects the integrity of each persons view as to what the best interests of our country are. In addition. one of the pieces of legislation would be the Voting Rights Act amendment. I bring that up now because Speaker RYAN said yesterday. as I understand it. that he was in favor of doing a voting rights bill. I dont know that he went into specifics. We believe that we need to address this bill because we believe it was substantially undermined by the recent decision of the Supreme Court some few years ago. He indicated that that was not going to be brought to the floor because of Mr. GOODLATTES Opposition to that or. perhaps. the failure of","Mr. Speaker. I sure do appreciate that. and I appreciate you being down here with us. I enjoy this time of the evening. It is a little quieter on Capitol Hill. Folks are coming and going. but I always learn something that I wouldnt have learned otherwise. For all the differences that we have here. when you talk to each other 15. 20 seconds at a time. those differences get accented. When you listen to one another for an hour at a time. it is easier to find those strains that bind us together. I hope that I am able to touch on some of those topics tonight myself. Mr. Speaker. I have got the House budget on my mind. It is budget week. I dont know if everybody else is as excited about it as I am. This is budget week in Washington. D.C. I just finished a hearing in the Committee on Rules. and we had folks come up and testify about all of their different budget ideas. What it means for it to be budget week is that we just voted in the Committee on Rules to make every single budget that any Member of this body. whether they be the most liberal Democrat. the most conservative Republican. or anywhere in between. north. south. east. and west. youngest to oldest. any Member of this body that has an idea about how to grapple with the budgetary challenges that face this Nation. Mr. Speaker. their idea is going to get a vote on the floor of the House this weekthis week. Now. it is heavy duty writing a budget. Mr. Speaker. I serve on the House Committee on the Budget. One of the reasons it is so hard. and you cant see it. Mr. Speaker. but I have here a pie chart of the spending in the United States of America. Now. you and I go through bill after bill. day after day. month after month of talking about appropriations bills. But as you know. Mr. Speaker. appropriations bills. they just deal with what I have shown here in the blue areas. the kind of nondefense discretionary spending and defense spending. Candidly. that is what everybody thinks of as being the budget. They think of transportation. roads. bridges. they think of the environment. parks. they think of the judiciary. they think of law enforcement. they think of all of these components of government. Well. the truth is. all of those things. Mr. Speaker. we have to jam into this little bitty piece of the pie. these two blue pieces of the pie. the things that Congress focuses on every year in the appropriations cycle. This red piece of the pie is all of that spending that is on autopilot. Now. I have read the Constitution. just as you have. Mr. Speaker. It says that all spending is going to originate in the U.S. House of Representatives. Well. you have been here 3 months already and you have not gotten a vote on this spending at all. I have been here 4 years. and I havent gotten a vote on this spending at all. This is spendingall of this that is represented in redtrillions of dollars a year. because some of our colleagues in the House 10 years ago. 20 years ago. 40 years ago. even 80 years ago. voted \"yes\" to turn on an autopilot spending bill. That bill is still on autopilot and still spending today. Our opportunity to grapple with this red area. Mr. Speakerthis that they call mandatory spendingis by outlining a strategy in a budget. Now. Mr. Speaker. for 4 years. I have had the voting card of the Seventh District of Georgia. It is an honor to carry that card every day. And for 4 years. we have been doing Budget Committee work in this institution that should make every American proud. It should make every American proud. But as you know. Mr. Speakeras I think most Americans knowthe Senate has not quite been as fortunate. They have been stymied over there. trying to pass a budget. Now we have a new American Senate that is working sidebyside with the House. because if the House can pass a budget and if the Senate can pass a budget and if we can come together and reconcile those differences. we will have a governing document that begins to allow us to deal not just with the small blue part of the budget. Mr. Speaker. but the entire budget-$3.5 trillion in FY 2014. Why is that so important? It is important. Mr. Speaker. because we have borrowed $18 trillion from our children and our grandchildren. Now. I say it over and over and over again. I am going to say it again tonight. It is immoral. It is immoral. and it is not even intellectually defensible. If you are from the part of the Congress that doesnt want to raise taxesand I am in that part of the Congressdont pretend that borrowing a dollar today so that you dont have to raise taxes is failing to raise taxes. It is not. If you borrow a dollar today. someone is going to have to raise taxes sometime in the future. They are going to have to pay that dollar back. plus interest. A vote to borrow money is a vote to raise taxes. It is just not a vote to raise taxes on you. It is a vote to raise taxes on the next generation. Conversely. if you are in the part of this Congress that likes to spend moneyI am not in the part of this Congress that likes to spend moneyI want to shrink the size and scope of government. I want to make it more accountable. more effective. more efficient. but it is hard to do with $3.5 trillion. I want to shrink the size and scope of government. but if you are on the side of this Congress that wants to grow spending. a vote to grow spending without paying for it todaya vote to borrowis a vote to cut spending on someone else years from now. We have seen it in all of the countries around the planet. Mr. Speaker. that are struggling with economic collapse. When government has to shrink. when austerity measures kick in. the people that pay the price are not the wealthy in society. The people who pay the price are those who are most dependent on government benefits. A vote to spend money today that we dont havea vote to borrow todayis a vote to cut the benefits of our children and our grandchildren. who will need it more than we do today. So. whether you are focusing on balanced budgets from a tax perspective or whether you are focusing on them from a spending perspective. Mr. Speaker. we should be able to come together and decide that grappling with those issuesputting forward a plan to deal with those issuesis better than hiding our head in the sand. This is why. What I have graphed here. Mr. Speaker. with the red line is traditional revenues. It is tax revenues in this countrytake all the taxes that we bring in together. I charted them as a percent of GDP. gross domestic product. What that means. Mr. Speaker. this looks like a level line but. of course. the economy continues to grow. And every time the economy grows. tax revenues grow. And so this is level as a percent of the size of our economy. but it is a growing number of taxes every yearagain. up to $3.5 trillion now and $3.8 trillion for FY 2016. Well. these blue lines represent spending on those mandatory spending programs I just talked about: those programs that are on autopilot. those programs that we dont deal with in this institution every year. those programs that escape the collaborative scrutiny of this body. Here is what you see. This chart goes back to 1965. Mr. Speaker. Back in 1965. interest on the national debt was a small part of our economic pie. Social Security was a large part of our economic pie. but smaller than it is today. Medicare was a very small part. Medicaid was a very small part. What you see on this chart. Mr. Speaker. is that they grow larger and larger and larger. Now. that is not larger and larger and larger in terms of actual dollars. They are growing larger and larger and larger in terms of actual dollars. but this chart is reflecting them growing larger and larger and larger as a percent of everything the United States produces. And what you see. Mr. Speaker. is that even though all the tax revenue we have been able to squeeze out of this country. whether it was a Republican as President or a Democrat as President. whether it was Republicans running the country or Democrats running the country. America was unwilling to contribute more than about 17 to 18 percent of GDP in tax revenues. Well. Mr. Speaker. if you go out to the end of our budget window here. which is about 2025. you will see that. based on current law. current spending. spending just rising at that rate of inflation as required by current law. the combination of Medicaid. Medicare. Social Security. and interest on the national debt will consume every penny that the Federal Government raisesevery penny. I showed you on this chart earlier. Mr. Speaker. what Congress deals with here in bluedefense and nondefensewhich most people think of as the government. That is only about a third of the pie. Social Security. Medicare. Medicaid. interest on the national debtthose mandatory spending programsis where most of the money is being spent today. That wasnt true 30 years ago. Back in the 1960s. 40 years ago. Mr. Speaker. I would say about a third of government spending was what we will call these income support programsthese direct spending programs on behalf of citizens. About twothirds of what we spent was investment in America. We were building things: the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System. the National Institutes of Health. the Centers for Disease Control. We were building things. We were defeating the evil empire. National security was a larger piece of the pie in those days. Twothirds of the budget was an investment in America. But today. Mr. Speaker. those numbers have exactly inverted. We spend about onethird on investment in national security and twothirds on income support programs. By 2025. Mr. Speaker. those programs threaten to consume every penny the Federal Government has. Look out there at the end of this window. Mr. Speaker. We are not talking about raising taxes a little. We are talking about just to fund these programsno parks. no courts. no judges. no prisons. no roads. no environmental regulations. nothing except Medicaid. Medicare. Social Security. interest on the national debtwe would have to increase taxes almost 50 percent just to pay for those programs. That is not sustainable. Everyone in this Chamber knows it is not sustainable. And my frustration. Mr. Speakerand I hope you havent found the same one quite yetis that we all know what the truth is. but we dont all want to admit what the truth is. There is no question that we cant pay for these programs. There is no question that Social Security is headed towards bankruptcy. Who is doing anything to solve it? Social Security Disability is going to go bankrupt 18 months from now in the year 2016. Social Security Disability Insurancethat trust fund that is available for folks who have been stricken with disabilities and can no longer workruns out of money. Everyone in this Chamber knows it. That is not Ron WOODALL. conservative Republican. predicting that. That is the Social Security Disability Insurance trusteesthe nonpartisan trusteestelling us that we are going to run out of money. The nonpartisan trustees of the Medicare Program are going to tell us it is going to run out of money. The nonpartisan trustees of the Social Security retirement program tell us it is going to run out of money. Where are the reform proposals from this institution? It is hard. Mr. Speaker. We all know what the truth is. but folks dont want to admit it. I am going to bring us back to budget week. What I love about this week. Mr. Speaker. is that we focus on those big problems. those big drivers of spending. those social safety net programs that are so essential to so many Americans. This is the week we lay out our plans to save them. This is the week where we talk about doing the heavy lifting that we dont talk about the rest of the year. I want the courage that we show in this week. Mr. Speaker. I want the ideas that we discuss this week to be the outline by which we live the rest of the year. I always hope for that. I dont always get that. I am hoping for that again this year. Lets talk about the plan. Mr. Speaker. that came out of the House Budget Committee. Now. the House Budget Committee is a fabulous group of people. If you have not gotten a chance. Mr. Speaker. it is budget.house.gov. It is completely transparent. You can see anything you want to see about the Housepassed budget and our deliberations. We just had a markup last week. Mr. Speaker. We started about 10:30 in the morning. We finished just a little after midnight that day. We came back the next day and went for about an hour more. We discussed every single amendment that anyone had to offer. Mr. Speaker. We talked about the big ideas. We talked about unemployment. We talked about job creation. We talked about job training. We talked about national security. We got deep into every single issue that matters to families back home in my districtevery single oneand back home in your district. Mr. Speaker. And this is the plan we have laid out. What I have charted here. Mr. Speaker. is the path of debt. The path of debt runs from back in World War II. where we had to borrow about 100 percent of the size of our economy. Granted. the economy was much smaller then. but as a percentage of the size of our economythat is the way the economists take a look at what we do to make sure that we are still on good financial footing100 percent of the size of our economy to defeat the Nazis to win World War II. Mr. Speaker. we are almost back at those same high levels today. You see it represented here by the dark blue line. We are almost back there today. Do we have severe economic challenges today? Of course. we do. Is the world a dangerous place today? Of course. it is. Are we united as a nation and fighting those challenges the way we were fighting World War II? Of course. we are not. Of course. we are not. But by engaging in this degree of borrowing when we are not facing an international challenge of the size of winning World War II. we are trading away our opportunities to face that challenge should it arise in the future. We are borrowing today. Mr. Speaker. for consumption when we borrowed in 1945 for investment. We are borrowing today to pay the current bills of just running the Nation when we borrowed in 1945 to defeat evil. What are we going to do when we are forced to confront evil of that magnitude again? I am not sure. because we have traded away. through borrowing and spending on todays consumption. the opportunity to spend big to win those global challenges. So look at beyond the dark blue line. Mr. Speaker. This is what you are going to see there. The red line of debt. which you see rises far above World War II level borrowingin fact. double World War II level borrowingthat red line is what happens if we close the doors of the Congress today. If we turn out the lights and never pass a new law. if we turn out the lights and never make a new promise. if we turn out the lights and promise not to spend one more penny than that that is already required by the laws on the booksand the White House does the very same thing. turns out the lightsthat red line represents the level of borrowing necessary simply to keep todays promises. No new promises. Todays promises. I laid out the future that we are trading away. I laid out the opportunities to react to crises that we are trading away. I laid out the burden that this is putting on future generations. That is just where we are today. If we do nothing and let current law continue. the problem doesnt just get worst. It gets twice as bad. But. Mr. Speaker. I am tired of hearing folks complain about what happens here and there. I am tired of hearing folks say. I know what all the problems are. but I dont have any solutions to offer. I just want to tell you who to blame for your woes. I dont want to be responsible for providing solutions. Nonsense. nonsensethis body is not filled with men and women. Madam Speaker. who came here to find blame. This body is filled with people who came to solve problems. Blue line. problem solvedthat blue line. that light blue line. Madam Speaker. represents the House Budget Committee mark. If this institution passes the budget for FY16. for the next 10year window. if they pass the budget that we worked out in that Budget Committee. we dont just avoid the economic catastrophe that is represented by current law. we reverse the trend. Madam Speaker. it is hard. Golly. I want to be able to tell children and grandchildren across this country that we are balancing the budget tomorrow. We are not. We are not. We cant. Unless you want to raise taxes right through the roof and crush working American families. unless you want to cut spending right to the floor and crush our opportunities at national security. you cant balance the budget tomorrow. The problem is too big. We laid out a 10year glide path. It doesnt put the tough decisions off for 10 years. but it begins making the tough decisions today. begins bending that curve of borrowing today. Madam Speaker. $4.7 trillion in interest is what we are projecting to spend in the 10year window-$4.7 trillion on interest alone. Madam Speaker. the budget for the entire United States of America last year was only $3.5 trillion. We are only proposing. as a budget for next year. $3.8 trillion. Our interest payments. borrowing at the recordlow teaser rates that we are borrowing at todayrecordlow ratesare going to see us pay $4.7 trillion in interest over the next 10 years. It is like taking 18 months off. Think about that. If our budget is about $3.8 trillion for FY16. $4.7 trillion. that is about a year and a quarter off. Again. turn out the lights. send everybody homeno more national security. no more schools. no more roads. That is what debt is costing us. a year and a quarter of productivity out of the next 10. and that is when we take these important steps to begin to curb it. Compare the difference in vision. Madam Speaker. This blue line represents our vision. The light blue line represents our solution to the red line. which represents current law. Madam Speaker. why is this so hard to do? Because this chart represents the Presidents visionleadership is a twoway street. We need folks leading on both sides of the aisle. We need folks leading on both sides of the Congress. We need folks leading on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. Leading often means taking something that you disagree on and selling the other guy on why you are right. For us. Madam Speaker. we take our balanced budget proposal. We take it to the other side of the aisle. We take it on the other side of the Capitol. We take it on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. and we try to sell it. We believe that balancing the budget is the right thing to do. We believe that borrowing from our children and grandchildren is immoral. The President takes a different view. and I dont fault him for taking a different view. I question his math. I question the economic guidance that he is relying on. I dont question his motives. His viewwhich is represented by the deficit here in blue. our annual deficits are represented in redrepresent the budget the President sent to Capitol Hill this year. Now. this budget is substantially similar to the budgets he has sent to Capitol Hill every year. If the President was standing here tonight. Madam Speaker. I dont think I would be mischaracterizing him if I say what he would tell you is he wants to freeze our debt as a percent of the size of our economy. and as long as our economy is rising then. he believes we can continue to let our debt rise. He calls that primary balance. when you lock in your debt as a static percent of GDP but continue to borrow foreverforever. What I am showing you here on this chart. Madam Speaker. is our budget alternative. produced by the Budget Committee. to be voted on in the House tomorrow. What our budget does is take deficits for about $350 billion next year down to zero. I dont even know if you know this word down on the end. Madam Speaker. It says \"surplus\"-no reason you should know it. We havent seen one in your time on Capitol Hill. I would argue we havent seen one in my lifetime. We talked about them happening in the nineties. but as you know. that was a little funny math there. the Social Security trust fund and other issues. It has been a long time since we have seen a surplus in our budget. but that is what our ideas produce. That is what our tough choices produce. That is what our commitment to solving problems produces. The President. on the other hand. raises taxes over $1 trillion. new taxes over $1 trillion. and continues to spend. so much so that in the years that we are balancing. Madam Speaker. the President is borrowing an additional $1 trillion a year. He would tell you that the reason he is borrowing it is because investment in America is important. and it is. He would tell you that the reason he is borrowing is because. if we dont invest in challenges today. we are not going to be able to reap the benefits of those challenges tomorrow. and he is right. We are not arguing in this institution. Madam Speaker. we are not debating in this institution. we are not grappling in this institution about the merit of investing in America. We all believe that we should. What we are talking about is whether or not we should pay for that investment. If we think it is a good idea. should we find the money for it today? Or do we just think it is enough of a good idea for our children to figure out how to pay for it or our grandchildren to figure out how to pay for it? But it is not so much of a good idea that you and I would actually burden ourselves with making the tough decision todaynonsense. I reject that vision. I reject the Presidents growing deficits out. I reject the Presidents budget that says: Not only am I not going to balance tomorrow. not only am I not going to balance in the next 10 years. I am not going to balance the budget ever. Now. that is not a small thing we are arguing about. This isnt just some sort of partisan sniping that happens between Republicans and Democrats. There is a fundamental disagreement about who we are as Americans. about what the role of Federal Government is. The House Budget Committee says: Lets try to balance this budget in the next 10 years. The time to stop burdening our children and our grandchildren with debt is now. The President says: I have spending priorities for America. Lets grow the amount of money we are borrowing every single year. Lets balance the budget never. I dont know if you get this in townhall meetings back home like I do. Madam Speaker. but folks say: ROB. why cant you guys just work this out? Why cant you get together. close the doors. work this out? We have serious problems. You need to solve the serious problems. Madam Speaker. I have got a President who is prioritizing balancing the budget never. and I have got a House Budget Committee that is prioritizing balancing the budget in the next 10 years. Those arent small differences. The differences could not get much larger. I dont expect to sell everyone in this institution on the Budget Committees ideas for balancing this budget. Madam Speaker. I am not going to get every vote in this Chamber. I am going to keep selling it. but I am not going to get every vote in this Chamber. I recognize that. What I am going to prioritize is selling folks in this Chamber on the fact that if we choose to borrow money. we are either taking it from the next generations benefits. or we are taking it from the next generations tax bill. The bill is going to come due. These deficits that the President proposes are going to come due. These deficits that we have already run are going to come due. Its either a benefit cut for the next generation or a tax increase for the next generation. There is no free lunch. Now. I dont purport to have all the answers. Madam Speaker. though we have got a pretty good blueprint here. What I do propose. though. is that we are going to be closer to finding the answers if we bring all of the ideas together. I see my friends from the Rules Committee sitting here in the corner tonight. Madam Speaker. They have been upstairs grinding through the paperwork. It was a little more complicated rule tonight than it ordinarily is because we took every single idea that any Member of this Chamber had about balancing the budget. If you wanted to write your budget. it is made in order for debate this week. budget week. I dont know which budget is going to win. Madam Speaker. though I have my preferences. What I do know is that if you are in the solutions business. you had your shot this week. If you are in the solutions business. you had a chance to put your money where your mouth is. literally. your money. all of our money. all taxpayer money. these budgets together. in a document. We are going to debate some doozies this week. We are going to debate some budgets that purport cutting spending virtually in half. and we are going to debate some budgets that virtually double taxation in this country. We will see where those chips fall. Madam Speaker. that didnt sound like the exciting thing that it is. That is what is so interesting to me about the work that goes on. Everybody is out in front of the cameras all day long. every day. talking about the issues that the pundits want to talk about. What our reading clerk just did here. in 15 uneventful seconds. is set into motion the most open. the most comprehensive. the most optimistic week of public policy debate this institution will see in 2015. I am honored to be just a small part of that. Madam Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.","Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I shall consume. I knew the majority would come here and talk about the middle class. They are trying to escape from their failure to help take action to provide jobs for middle class Americans. They also. by the way. so far havent helped out to provide the continuation of the unemployment insurance for hundreds of thousands of people. so many in the middle class. who have lost their jobs. Look. I quoted from CBO. and I guess I will have to quote again. This is in February. \"In CBOs judgment. there is no compelling evidence that parttime employment has increased as a result of the ACA.\" I will quote again from this study of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. and it is headed this way: \"Health reform not causing significant shift to parttime work. but raising threshold to 40 hours a week would make a sizable shift likely.\" I quoted why they say that because the number of people who are working 40 hours or thereabouts. that number is so much larger than those who are working 30 hours or thereabouts. and so any employer who wanted. essentially. to shift the burden from them to others. they are more likely to do it under this bill than under the present circumstance. That is the reason why it has been said by CBO that it would force 1 million people out of employerbased health insurance. and it would add $74 billion to the deficit since it is not offset. You havent refuted a single one of those statements. If they are not true. I would like you to say so. I would like you to say CBO is wrong. and also wrong when they say it would increase the number of uninsured by half a million people. Those are three CBO statements. They stand here to refute the myths that are being brought here in defense of this bill. So you raise the middle class banner. At the same time. you essentially. with this bill. would take away health insurance from many. many. many. many. many middle class citizens. That is what you would be doing here. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.","Madam President. it is so true. These men and women. for example. who are assistant U.S. attorneys. they do not punch a time clock. They do not bill hours. how much they can make an hour. They take care of the needs of this country. If there are bad guys out there. they prosecute them. FBI agents. people who work for the U.S. Marshal Servicethey serve warrants to some of the most dangerous people in the world. They are home now. They are home. They do those jobs. I say to the distinguished President pro tempore of the Senate. because they chose public service. I will be a little bit personal here. I have four boys and a girl. a daughter. I love my children as only a father could love his children. My daughter is married to a lawyer. She is a schoolteacher. My four boys are all lawyers. My next youngest gave up a job and took a pay cut of $200.000 a year so he could go to work as a city attorney in Henderson. NV. That is what public servants are all about. They are not in it for the money. They are not in it for the glory. They are in it because it is the right thing to do. As I look over this Chamber. I see two of my staff in the back row. I look at one young man who is a graduate of Stanford Law School. It is either the first. second. or third best law school every year in America. Could he go someplace else and make more money? You bet he could. He is an expert. He is an expert in finance. the budget process.","Mr. President. I wish to recognize the outstanding leadership and accomplishments of Mary Pat Seurkamp. Ph.D.. president of Notre Dame of Maryland University. The College of Notre Dame of Maryland was founded in Baltimore by the School Sisters of Notre Dame to educate women and the poor. The institution was chartered in 1895 and was known as the College of Notre Dame of Maryland until September of 2011. when it was officially renamed Notre Dame of Maryland University. The undergraduate Womens College of the School of Arts and Sciences remains at the heart of the university and is the only womens college in Maryland. Under Dr. Seurkamps leadership. Notre Dame of Maryland has flourished as one of the Nations strongest womens institutions. fully embracing its role in preparing young women to understand and meet societys challenges. Under Dr. Seurkamps leadership. the college has also found new ways to meet societys needs. The Accelerated College was founded to help working women and men earn their undergraduate degrees. Now known as the College of Adult Undergraduate Studies. this division has continued to adapt to the needs of working adults and community institutions. offering courses on the Baltimore campus and at regional higher education centers and partnering hospitals. Dr. Seurkamp. responding to expanding job opportunities in the area of health care. worked to found the Notre Dame of Maryland University School of Pharmacy. the second pharmacy school in Maryland and the first at a womens college in the United States. The School of Pharmacy. like the new School of Nursing and the School of Education. offers professional education rooted in the Catholic tradition of the liberal arts and service to others. As part of the implementation of the campuss 20year master plan. Dr. Seurkamp worked not only to enhance the beauty of the university grounds but also to ensure that university buildings are environmentally sustainable. Dr. Seurkamp has been honored with numerous leadership awards. as well as the papal honor of Dame of the Order of St. Gregory. Her work reminds us of the critical role that higher education plays in defining our countrys workforce and shaping our countrys future. I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Seurkamp on her 15 years of outstanding accomplishments as president of Notre Dame University of Maryland and in wishing her well in her retirement.*","Mr. President. I guess we are technically still talking about our reauthorization of the SBIR and STTR Programs. Senator SNOWE and I have been working through the week to manage this bill on the floor. and I wish to again say how pleased I am with the progress we made this week. I know we have had about three or four votes on amendments. and there are others that are pending. but we have made progress. I truly appreciate the cooperation of all the Members. This is a very important program. We have struggled. as I have said. for 6 years to get this program reauthorized. While everybody is running around fussing about programs that do not work. it is important for us to focus on those programs that do work. particularly those programs that work to create private sector jobs. It is important for us to stay focused on reducing and. hopefully. eliminating our Federal debt and reducing annual deficits. That is going to be done when we do a couple of things all at one time. It is not going to be done by standing on the sidelines. slashing and burning discretionary domestic spending only. particularly some of the best programs in America. It is going to be done by thoughtful cuts and eliminations of some programs that dont work. some thoughtful eliminations and cuts to the Defense budget. It is going to be done by raising revenues where appropriate to close some of the gaps and taking back some of the excessive grants to highend taxpayers. particularly those making over $1 million a year. in the view of this Senator. It is going to take some investments that can actually save taxpayer money in the long run. and cutting some mandatory programs. We knowand I think it is becoming very clear to the American peopleas this debate over the House CR and the debate over deficits and debt goes on. people are understanding this better and better. So one of the reasons I am personally happy to be on the floor this week is because I know the bill I am supporting and offering here to the Senatehopefully getting to the House and then eventually to the Presidents deskwill create private sector jobs and close this deficit gap and begin to chip away. in a substantial way. at the debt. We need to grow our economy. I have a chart I will put up in just a minute. but before I do that. I wish to show again a specific example of a program I am talking about so people will be very clear. Projects such as this were won by iRobot. This is just one example of the hundreds and thousands of small businesses that received either a contract or an award through this very important program. DOD has the largestover $1 billionportion of their research and development budget. Prior to this program. almost 100 percent of that money went to big businesses or to universities and big businesses. Small businesses were summarily overlooked. Regardless of whether they had good technology. they really werent let in the front door. This program we are talking about reauthorizing for 8 years creates that door and opens it for the small businesses in Louisiana. in Colorado. in New Mexico. in New York. and that is why we are going to fight hard for this program. to get it reauthorized and to the Presidents desk. Let me give one example. The DOD needed more reliable. costeffective robotic devices for going into caves. checking and diffusing IEDs. I dont think I have to explain to anyone listening or any Member of this Senate the challenges our soldiers face in Afghanistan. I have been to Afghanistan. I have not been in caves in Afghanistan. but I have visited our troops there. I have heard their stories. I have seen pictures and read enough books to know the frightening thousands of miles of caves and crevices our soldiers are having to go into to hunt down Osama bin Laden. who still has not been found and captured. and to protect our forces overseas. We have been in some ways as a nation kind of caught off guard about the terrorist attacks and military strategies using explosive devices. I guess we knew this could be a tactic. but. honestly. we did not have what we needed to protect our troops to win the battles. So this program steps up and says: OK. this is what we need. Lets go out and see who has the best technology. Instead of spending billions and billions and millions and millions of dollars giving a contract to a big company and getting them to go through all the rigmarole to develop itit is kind of an offtheshelf technology almost. except that we develop the idea and give a small business the opportunity. Unlike large businesses. these small firms approach the project unencumbered by past research and approaches. They start with a clean slate. They often have innovative approaches that would be challenged by conventional large businesses. They often attract researchers fresh out of a university. such as iRobot. which started with two MIT students and their professors. Ideas that started just off the MIT campus have turned into a company with a market cap of now $400 million. with strong military and private sector sales. My colleagues have probably heard of the private sector spinoff of the military robot. the Roomba. a product that vacuums while one is at work and has now sold over 5 million units in the United States. This is a different product than the IED robot I will speak about in a minute. but it is an example of one of these programs. When our forces needed to go into caves and find IEDs. there was some technology that was developed in order to do that. The Navy has many examples. The Army has many examples. I am encouraged to see these outstanding opportunities. This was in Bedford. MA. This is the iRobot I mentioned. I will get the chart for the IED explosive in just a moment. This is an example of some of the projects that have been funded. This is not just good for our soldiers. but obviously this company then became a company that went on to sell other products in the conventional market and created jobs along the way. I know Senator BINGAMAN wants to speak on energy. and I am going to yield the floor and then come back later and put a few more things into the RECORD before this week ends so that when we come back in a couple of weeks. we will have built the strongest record possible for a vote as soon as possible on a program that works. that is costeffective. that really creates some new technologies that help our soldiers overseas and help us vacuum our floors here at home and create American jobs in the process and help us to close this deficit and debt gap. I yield the floor.","Mr. President. I rise to address the DoddFrank financial reform bill and to share the reasons it makes a great deal of sense to restore the lane markers and traffic signals to our financial systemlane markers and traffic signals that were ripped away carelessly. thoughtlessly over the course of a decade and led to the economic house of cards that melted down last year. doing enormous damage to Americas working families. There may be many in the financial world who feel pretty good about the most recent billiondollar quarterly profits or milliondollar bonuses. but families in Americas working world are not feeling so good. They are looking at their retirement savings being decimated. They look at the value of their house and realize it is worth less than it was 6 years ago. For many families. the amount they owe on the house is more than it is now worth. Families are looking at lost jobs and lost health care that went with those jobs. They are looking at an economy that struggling to recover. that is providing them few opportunities to get back on their feet. The meltdown triggered by the economic house of cards built up over the last decade is enormous. It is not only the damage done to families. it is the damage done to the economy as a whole. We cannot talk to any room with owners of small businesses and not hear stories about frozen lending. about credit lines cut in half. about opportunities to expand a business. but. despite a regular banking relationship extended over a decade. that bank cannot now extend the loans that would enable them to seize that opportunity to create jobs. We still have massive disruption in our securities market that provides the credit that fuels not only home mortgages but many other parts of the economy. This economic meltdown has been a huge factor in contributing to the national debt. In every possible way. the absence of responsible lane markers and traffic signals has wreaked havoc on the American family and the American economy. We are here now to set that straight. to restore those lane markers and traffic signals. What really happened? It can be summed up in two words: irresponsible deregulation. Lets get into the details a bit further. Lets start with irresponsible deregulation that led to new predatory mortgage practices. One of those practices was liar loans. loans in which the loan officer was making up the numbers and putting them in because they knew they could turn around and sell that loan to Wall Street and have no responsibility for whether that family succeeded in making the payments. Another predatory practice was steering paymentsmortgage originators getting paid huge bonuses to sign people up for mortgages that had in the fine print hidden exploding interest rates. so the family could easily make the payments at 5 percent. but when that hidden language triggered 9 percent. there was no way the family was going to be able to make those loan payments. Since most of those were on a 2year delay. we can think of it as a 2year fuse. a ticking timebomb. a ticking mortgage timebomb that was going to go off and destroy that familys finances. Then the prepayment penalty that locked people into those loans. These retail mortgage practices resulted in irresponsible deregulation. Then we had the securities that were made from those bad mortgages by financial firms. packaging those bad mortgages. putting a shiny wrapper on them. and then selling them with AAA ratings to financial institutions. to pension funds. to investment houses. tossing those mortgage securities hither and yon without full disclosure. When those mortgages that were in those packages went bad. those securities were going to go bad. That is what happened in 2008 and 2009. It melted down this economy. Another piece was the irresponsible deregulation lifting leverage requirements on the largest investment houses. Bear Sterns in a single year went from 20to1 leverage to 40to1 leverage. That means they were going to make a lot more money when everything is going up. but it means the moment things turn down. they cant cover their bets and they are going to go out of business. Then we had credit default swaps. That is a fancy term for insurance on the success of a bond. That new insurance was issued by AIG without any collateral being set aside to cover the insurancecomplete failure to deregulate this new product. Those insurance policies. those credit default policies created an interwoven web in which if one firm failed and couldnt pay off its responsibilities under the credit default swaps or insurance policies. then the firm that it owed was going to fail. It set up a web of potential collapse. Those are the types of dramatic issues created through irresponsible deregulation that we must address in this body and that are addressed in the DoddFrank financial reform bill. First. the bill ends those three predatory mortgage practices I spoke of. It ends liar loans. It creates underwriting standards. My colleague from Tennessee mentioned he would like to see underwriting standards in this bill. They actually are in the bill. That is a very important part of this legislation. This bill ends the steering payments. the bonuses paid to mortgage originators to basically guide people into tricky mortgages with hidden exploding interest rate clauses. This bill stops prepayment penalties that were used to lock families in. If you are in a mortgage and you have to pay several pounds of flesh to get out of that mortgageand by that. I mean perhaps 10 percent of the value of your housewhere is that 10 percent coming from? You cant do it. so you are locked in. You are chained to the steering wheel of a car going over a cliff. We have gotten rid of that practice. The second main thing we have done is establish realtime consumer protection to end scams and tricks and traps in financial documents. There was a woman from Salem. OR. who wrote to me. She wanted to share her story. just one of the little pieces of malfeasance that had occurred. She had paid her credit card bill on a timely basis month after month. year after year. She was very surprised when she received a letter saying she had a late payment and owed a fee. So she called up the credit card company and said: How can this be? I always pay on time. The person on the other end said: Yes. we received your payment. as you indicated. But your contract says we dont have to post your payment for 10 days. and so we didnt post your payment right away. We posted it at the end of that 10day period. At the end of the 10day period. your payment was late. So you owe us this fee. It is all in your contract. She said: How can that be fair? That is why we need a consumer protection agency for citizens across the country. Members know what I am talking about because virtually every one of us has opened up a statement and gone: Wait. how can that be fair? We did have the delegation of consumer protection responsibilities to the Fed. but the Fed had its monetary mission in the penthouse of their office building. They had safety and soundness on the upper floors. but they put consumer protection down in the basement. They ignored it. They didnt act on the responsibilities they had. So we put those responsibilities in an organization. a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that has a single missionnot a third mission or a fourth mission. not a forgotten mission. not a mission we put in the basement. but a first missionso that Americans can choose from responsible financial products. not ones that compete to see who can have the biggest scam. the biggest deception. the biggest trick or the biggest trap but instead can compete on the cost of the product and on the quality of the service. The third thing this bill does is redirects banks to the mission of providing loans to families and small businesses. This is the core function of the banking world. What happened over the last few years is some of our banks said: It is a lot more fun to bet on highrisk investments than it is to make loans to families and businesses. But that is not the mission of the banks that have access to the Fed window for discounted funds from the Federal Reserve. That is not the mission of the banks that we insure their deposits. The function of those banks is to make sure there is liquidity in the hands of our businesses so they can thrive and so families can thrive. This bill redirects them to that mission. Let me put it this way: Highrisk investing is a little bit like highspeed car racing. You know as you watch cars going around the race track they are going to push the boundaries. the limits of speed and traction. and they are going to do quite well. They are going to try to nudge ahead of the rest of the cars. But then. eventually. one is going to hit some rubber on the track or some oil or some gravel or get bumped by another car and the race car is going to crash. When you go to the track. you pretty well know in advance you are going to see a car crash. That is the way it is with investment houses. They are competing with each other to find the best opportunities for the highest return. so we know they are going to crashthat some of them willand we accept that. This is an important role in the formation. aggregation. allocation of capital. But we want them to crash on the race track. not to crash out on the streets of the city or the streets of the countryside. That is why this bill moves highrisk investing out of the banks that should be dedicated to the mission of providing loans to small businesses and families. Another key thing this bill does is restore integrity in the formation of securities. Let me put it to you this way. Imagine that an electrician comes to your house because you are asking that electrician to wire up your basement. The electrician leaves. and you find out he or she took out a fire policy on your house. I think you might be a little worried about the quality of the wiring that was done in your basement. Or consider this possibility: You buy a car and you find out the person who sold you the car took out a life insurance policy on you. Well. you do not like the idea. I do not like the idea. of the possibility that someone would sell a car that is defective so they can take out a life insurance policy and maybe cash in. Yet that was what was happening with securities: companies taking bad loans. putting them in a shiny wrapper. selling them. and then taking out an insurance policya credit default swapso when that security went bad they could cash in. Well. we need to have a level of integrity in the formation of our securities or our bonds. This bill takes us in that direction. This bill puts the sale of swaps on organized markets. What are swaps? Again. they are insurance policies. based on interest rates. insurance policies. based on exchange rates. insurance policies. based on the success of securities. You cannot sell insurance to the general public without setting aside reserves. but these swaps were sold without reserves. So this bill before us today says reserves are necessary so the bet can be covered if the event you are insuring should happen. It also creates a market for them so the customerthat is normally a business that wants to hedge its interest rate risk or its exchange risk or its investments in securities. that wants to hedge and protect itself against the possibility that those will go down or changethey can get that at a much better price when they can do so through the power of a transparent. organized market. So being able to hedge risk at a much cheaper price is a huge contribution to the formation and allocation of capital in our country. Finally. this bill allows a systematic way to dismantle failing firms in the financial world so it minimizes systemic risk and so the industry itself picks up the cost of their failure. so we the taxpayers are not in a position of having to pick up that cost. I know some of my colleagues on the other side have simply asserted the opposite to try to confuse the issue. Well. I think that is irresponsible because so much was done in this bill to make sure American taxpayers are never again on the hook for the failure of financial firms in our Nation. This is the type of responsible lane markers and traffic signals we need in our system. Certainly every one of us here believes there are further strides that could be made. There are standards in this bill that I would like to have crisper. There are terms for which I know we will need fierce. vigilant regulation to make sure those terms are not expanded into loopholes. This bill does not do as much as I would like to address the issue of perverse incentives in the system of rating securities. something the Presiding Officer was a huge advocate for. and put forward a terrific policy to address. We are going to have to keep working on that piece. But in each of these areas I have described. this is a quantum improvement. I think colleagues on both sides of the aisle know that. So beware of efforts to confuse the debate trying to say what is north is south and what is east is west. So these are the reasonsthese core improvements to our financial system that enhance the ability to aggregate and allocate capital efficientlywhy I am supporting this bill. I applaud the chairman of the Banking Committee. who steered this bill through enormous sets of obstacles. It is reported that Wall Street hired 1.000 extra lobbyists to try to torpedo the bill that is before us. That is a lot of obstacles to get through. These are complex issues that required thoughtful analysis and had to be worked and reworked. So I applaud the chairmans work in taking us to this point where we are prepared to send this bill on to the Presidents desk. I would like to particularly thank my colleague. Carl Levin. who teamed up to work with me on a proposal to take highrisk investing out of the bank holding companies and to improve the integrity of bonds. That was work that came straight out of the committee work he did in such a capable and timely fashion. So with that. I conclude by saying we need a financial system that is not about quarterly profit margins on Wall Street. that is not about the size of bonuses on Wall Street but is about providing a foundation for business to thrive. for employment to be increased. for families to find work. and to build financial foundations for the success of those families over the next several decades. That is the type of financial foundation we need. and this bill certainly is a huge stride in accomplishing that. Mr. President. I yield the floor.","I appreciate my friend yielding. I cant think of one. This will drive so many jobs overseas. Its like somebody Is sitting back thinking. How can we further hurt the economy? Lets do that. And some genius came up with capandtax..","Mr. Speaker. in the days after the 9/11 attacks. politicians. journalists and assorted experts rushed to claim that America and the world had entered a new era and that the battle with al Qaeda would define the first decades of the 21st century. As the fight against al Qaeda has continued and intensified. we have come to see the impact of that fight on a key national security paradigm of the post Cold War era: the quest for energy security in an industrializing and everflattering world. The United States has long recognized that our global leadership and economic strength depended on cheap. abundant energy from the Middle East. Disruptions to that supply as a result of the 1973 oil embargo. the Iranian revolution of 1979 and the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait had demonstrated our vulnerability to events halfway around the world. Rather than taking the steps necessary to wean ourselves from Middle East oil. we sought to create stability in the region by aligning ourselves with proWestern autocrats whose powerful internal security forces kept restive populations in check. Capacity and price. the first high and the second low. stayed our hand. Cheap and plentiful oil powered the American economy to preeminence while solar. wind and biomass energy were expensive. Environmental concerns. including increasing evidence that the burning of fossil fuels was altering the Earths climate. were relegated. to secondary status. All of that has now changed. The 9/11 attacks and the Iraq war have highlighted the seething political instability in the Middle East. The rise of China and India have increased competition for oil even as the global supply has remained stable. Finally. the Earths climate is changing more rapidly and more profoundly than many scientists had forecasted. leading to a global consensus that humanity must take immediate steps to curtail the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. This confluence of political. economic and environmental factors is one of the greatest challenges that this Nation has faced in its history. but just as we have risen to meet other challengesfrom the Revolution to the Civil War to the Great Depression and the totalitarian dictatorships of the 20th centuryI am confident that we will emerge from this crisis stronger and better positioned than our economic rivals to prosper in this new world. As for the other problems that we have faced. finding a solution will require us to put our faith in American ingenuity and in our enormous capacity to fund and focus research and development efforts. In the last 2 years. we have dramatically increased funding for research into renewable energy. but we must do even more by declaring a new Apollo Project for energy independence. Even as we provide incentives to accelerate scientific research into reducing the cost of renewable e:aergy. we must also act now to reduce our fossil fuel imports. The cheapest and quickest way to accomplish this is to reduce energy and fuel use through fuel efficiency. energy efficiency. conservation. and green development. We can also reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and foreign oil in the slhort term by a responsible increase in domestic production. but this must be viewed for what it isa shortterm expedient and a bridge to a future based on renewable energy. We cannot convert our economy from one dependent on fossil fuels to one that is based on renewable energy overnight. but we must take the position that our continued use of oil and gas will be largely phased out in the coming decades and that renewed. environmentally responsible exploration is intended to ease the conversion to a postfossil fuel economy. As a threshold matter. we must improve the fuel efficiency of our cars and trucks. as Congress mandated last December. and develop plugin hybrid vehicles to drive further efficiency. Doing this will not only break our addiction to oil. it will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent. This effort should be undertaken in conjunction with the national effort to improve our public transportition system. which still receives just a fraction of the investment that we put into roads. Congress has acted to increase public transit. but more necds to be done both at a local level and. more importantly. at State and regional levels. We must also make our homes more energy efficient by installing rooftop solar panels. switching to energyefficient appliances and enabling consumers and businesses to pay lower prices for electricity at night so that we can reduce the daytime spike in electricity usage that requires utilities to keep highprice power generation on call. Companies have invested and workers have trained themselves in industries that were supported by our past Tax Code and its provisions. Climate change legislation will change those incentives. and while many hightech American industries will prosper. some industries will suffer. For example. in my home State of California. solar and geothermal are growing by leaps and bounds. There are startups throughout the State building solar energy plants and installing solar energy systems. The silicon shortage that h3s slowed solar development in the last 3 years is fading as new factories come online. But this new development is still dependent on the tax incentives that Congress has still not extended past the end of the year. We must not let these tax incentives expire and. instead. extend them -for several years so that this expanding industry can become a driver in the economy. Mr. Speaker. my constituents are telling me they want Congress to take the steps necessary to transition our Nation to clean. renewable energy. I urge us to do exactly that. They have told me that the energy crisis has imposed enormous hardship on them and on millions of other Americans. But. as in crises past. they also believe that our ingenuity. our cando spirit and optimism will enable us to bequeath to our children and grandchildren a world that is cleaner and more prosperous. I share their hopes and their determination. . 2015","Mr. President. the vote we are about to have should give all Members of the Senate a sense of deja vu. we have been here before. We are about to vote on an amendment that is reminiscent of a rather significant debate we had in the fall of 2002 in connection with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. The issue at that time. as.is the issue this morning. is the question of whether we are going to have collective bargaining for the transportation security agency. The public spoke rather loudly in the fall of 2002 in the form of Senate elections that year. They thought collective bargaining for transportation security workers was not a good idea. The public was correct then. and I think that is the public view today. In the ongoing debate over Iraq. it is easy to forget the success we have had in fighting terrorism. and chief among that is the fact that America has not seen a terrorist attack at home in 51/2 years since 9/11. There is one reason. and that is the heroic work of our soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq and the tireless efforts of our homeland defenders in detecting. preventing. discouraging. .and disrupting those attacks in our country. Yet. today. these two pillars of our post9/11 security are being put at risk by those who have the audacity to put union work rules above the national security. It is no secret that big labor expects something in return for last Novembers elections. But Americas security should not be on the table. It is ironic. that Democrats who campaigned on the pledge that they would implement all of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission are now forcing us to consider something that wasnt in the report at all. This measure was not in the report and they are blocking. us from considering something that was in the report. I am talking about the proposal to give all 43.000 airport screeners the ability to collectively bargain. Not only was this proposal not. in the 9/11 report. it would end up undermining the commissions recommendation. A key recommendation of the 9/11 Commission said: The United States should combine terrorist travel intelligence. operations. and law enforcement in a strategy to intercept terrorists. find terrorist travel facilitators. and constrain terrorist mobility. That is in the 9/11 report. We saw this during the U.K. bombing threat in August. TSA workers who showed up for work at 4 a.m. that morning in the United States were briefed on the plot and trained immediately in the new protocol. Within 12 hours. we had taken classified intelligence and adapted to it. There was no noticeable impact on U.S. flights. It was a different situation over in Great Britain. where unionization is the norm. Dozens of flights had to be canceled as they worked out an understanding on how they would respond to .the new threat. travelers were delayed. and backups ensued literally for days. We saw the importance of mobility earlier that year when TSA acquired new technologies for bomb detection. It trained nearly 40.000 airport screeners in the new methods in less than 3 weeks. The TSA says that under collective bargaining the same training would take 2 to 6 months. We are not going to let big labor compromise .national security. The President has said hewill veto a 9/11 bill if it includes collective bargaining. We have the votes to sustain that veto. The House has just announced it has the votes to sustain a Presidential veto. This bill Will not become law with this dangerous provision in it. The only question now is why we are being kept from passing a 9/11 -bill that focuses on security alone. The President made it clear he will veto the bill if it includes a provision that compromises security. The American -people have already made clear where they stand on collective bargaining. Remember. as I stated. we have been down this road before. We had a huge debate in Congress over collective bargaining when we created. the Department of Homeland Security. Americans didnt like the idea of labor slowdowns among security personnel in 2002. They. said so at the polls in November of 2002. the answer. I am afraid. is clear: This new attempt to insert this into the 9/11 bill is a show that was meant to aDpease a voting bloc. We know how this charade is going to end. Republicans wont let security be used as a bargaining chip. We are not going to let it happen. It is too bad Americans will have to wait even longer for this bill to be signed into law because of the efforts to satisfy organized labor. Mr. President. I yield the floor.","Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I might consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of this landmark postal reform bill. Members of the House have worked for over a decade to reform this important part of our national communications system and our economy. I am indeed. pleased to serve in the Congress that is making this reform a reality. I want to commend and congratulate Chairman TOM DAVIS and Ranking Member HENRY WAXMAN for their tremendous commitment and dedication to making this truly a bipartisan effort and for the tenacious way in which they have worked to bring us to this point this evening. I also want to commend Representative MCHUGH who has been the point person for the Republican side of the aisle on this matter for more than 10 years. who has stayed with it. stuck with it. and one of the reasons that we are here today is because of his tenacious work. I also want to thank all of the stakeholders. the unions. the mailers and others. who are greatly affected1. I want to thank the Board of Governors and the Postmaster General. Mr. Potter. for their willingness to work with us. And I want to think the other body. the Members of the Senate who were willing to negotiate. to engage in the giveandtake that is so necessary to make bipartisan. bicameral legislation a reality. This bill is a prime example of bipartisan negotiation and collaboration. It is *a compromise that will modernize the postal system and help it remain healthy and affordable well into the 21st century. I represent much of the city of Chicago. one of the primary postal hubs in the Midwest with over 12.000 postal employees who deliver mail daily to 1.2 million homes and businesses in the Chicago area. I also represent numerous printing and mailing companies that rely upon the movement .f mail. Therefore. ensuring a healthy postal service is a key issue of great concern to me. This bill has many highlights. It provides for ratemaking flexibility. rate stability. universal service. high quality standards. and collective bargaining. In addition. I am pleased that the bill advances fair business practices related to employees who are women and/or racial minorities. For example. I am pleased that it includes a study on the representation of women and minority members in supervisory and management positions within the postal service. It is important to understand how well the postal service is doing in opening up its senior positions to groups who historically have not had that kind of access. The bill goes even further by requiring measures to incorporate the affirmative action and equal opportunity criteria into the performance appraisals of senior supervisory or managerial employees. This change helps ensure that management will be held accountable for adhering to the organizations goals of equal opportunity. And I want to sincerely thank Mr. WAXMAN for his vigorous support for this diversity provision. I am also pleased that the bill includes a study of the number of contracts with women. minorities and small businesses to ensure that all groups have access to the postal serv- unions. the postal service.

The Valle Vidal is located in the heart of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in northern New Mexico and is home to abundant populations of Rocky Mountain wildlife. including the largest herd of elk in our State. This \"living valley\" is an incredibly important ecological treasure whose value lies in its wilderness and natural beauty. not in its finite supply of energy. The Valle Vidal is a special place for New Mexicans and people from around the world who come to relax in its alpine majesty and enjoy outdoor recreation and sporting opportunities. Boy Scouts from all over the country have come to the adjacent Philmont Scout Ranch for decades and each year spend thousands of hours doing conservation work and earning merit badges in the Valle Vidal. Over the past 2 years. I have followed closely numerous events concerning the Valle Vidal. I have traveled to the Valle Vidal to witness its beauty. spoken with my constituents and others from the State. tracked political developments. and reviewed regulatory or policy initiatives undertaken by this administration. I have also received thousands of calls. emails. faxes. and letters against drilling and practically none in support of it. As a result. I have come to the inescapable conclusion that the Valle Vidal should be protected from oil and gas development. The modern history of the Valle Vidal dates back to 1841 when Mexican Governor Manuel Armijo granted 1.7 million. acres. the largest single landholding in the western -hemisphere. to Guadalupe Miranda of Taos and a French trapper named Carlos Beaubien. This land grant. which included the 100.000 acre piece now known as Valle Vidal. is probably the most famous ever made by Mexico. It later became known as the Maxwell Land Grant after Lucien Bonaparte Maxwell. a Kansan who married Beaubiens daughter and later became the sole owner of the vast property. Thirty years ago. the Pennzoil Company purchased nearly 500.000 acres of this land. which they used as a hunting park. Pennzoil maintained the area as such until 1982 when it donated a 100.000acre parcel of it to the Federal Government. which was at the time the largest donation in Forest Service history. Interestingly. no drilling was ever done in the Valle Vidal when Pennzoil owned it. What an ironic travesty it would be for the government to now turn its back on this unique gift and allow the area to be blighted. I do not want the Valle Vidal to be opened up for drilling. New Mexicans and thousands of Americans are overwhelmingly against drilling in the refuge. These concerned citizens realize that the Valle Vidals minimal contribution to our energy needs now is not worth despoiling such an important ecological and watershed system. The consequences are just too great. Moreover. many of my constituents. as confirmed by recent economic studies. recognize that the protection of special public lands like Valle Vidal is good for local economies. and. in fact. exploration of these places for a few hours of energy- will hurt longterm economic growth and community sustainability. Fundamentally. drilling in the Valle Vidal to create more energy is a false choice. We must consider alternative and more effective measures for solving our Nations energy needs. For example. an increased use of renewable fuels and improved fuel efficiency standards would contribute greatly to solving many energyrelated problems. The key is to* make the best renewable and alternate energy systems competitive with todays nonrenewable sources of energy so they can be developed for use in the United States and even for sale abroad. We simply cannot hope to drill our way to energy independence. The fact that this special place is being targeted for oil and gas leasing .radically demonstrates what is wrong with this administrations energy policies. In this case. the Forest Services commitment to a leasing environmental impact statement. before the agency has even prepared a forest plan amendment. demonstrates that legislative action is necessary to ensure that the Valle Vidals nonmineral resources and values are given the attention and protection they deserve. Moreover. the Forest Service. even with irrefutable reason to do so. is without the legal authority to permanently protect this special place from mineral development. New Mexico is home to a strong oil and gas industry which I openly support. I believe there are many places suitable for oil and gas drilling. Valle Vidal. however. is not one of.them. Mr. Speaker. to that end. today I am introducing the Valle Vidal Protection Act to permanently protect the Valle Vidal from mineral extraction. In so doing. my legislation does not interfere with the Forest Services Forest Plan Amendment process. That process is allowing the Forest Service to exercise its expertise and listen to the people and thereby establish a longterm management plan for the Valle Vidal commensurate with its importance as a critical component of our natural and cultural heritage. In my view. which I know is shared by many of my constituents. the Valle Vidals ecological health and integrity should be restored and protected and enjoyed to the utmost by current and future generations. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues both in the New Mexico delegation as well as in the entire Congress to join me in passing this legislation and protecting the Valle Vidal permanently. This ecosystem is too valuable to the people of New Mexico and the.nation. and the energy gains -too miniscule to justify the potential damage to this pristine area. We must protect it.","Mr. Speaker. we do not have a substitute. and that is the bottom line. I would think that we should not have to beg and scrape and ask them to give us a chance. Are we asking for a chance to win? No. Do we believe that we have enough sugar and incentives that we can buy votes? No. We do not have that in our bill. We do not turn over the collection of taxes to private sector people. We do not have the ornaments that the gentleman from Washington will tell my colleagues about. All we have got is a fair bill to create jobs in the United States of America. That is all we have got. We do notbuy votes. We just try to sell without their profits.","Mr. President. I rise in very strong support of the Murray amendment. I commend the very able Senator from the State of Washington for coming forward with this initiative. It is a critical issue for millions of Americans across. the country. and I know how concerned she has- been about this issue. I am very happy to join in supporting it as a cosponsor. This. historically. has been a bipartisan issue. Unemployment insurance benefits were extended four times during the Reagan administration and three times during the Bush administration. The recent unemployment figures offer very strong support for acting on the Murray amendment. Last week it was reported that the unemployment rate rose to 6.4 percent in June. This is the highest unemployment rate in over 9 years. We have to go back to April of 1994 for a higher rate. Mr. President. 9.4 million workers are unemployed. the most since December of 1992. This. of course. doesnt account for those who are so discouraged that they are not looking for work. Were we to count them. the unemployment rate would be well above 7 percent. The economy has lost 394.000 Jobs since January. We have lost jobs each of the past 5 months. Since this administration took office. private sector employment has fallen by more than 3 million. Two million workers have been unemployed for more than 26 weeks. which is the period covered by regular unemployment insurance benefits. This morning. the Labor Department reported that an additional 439.000 workers filed initial unemployment insurance claims. More than 400.000 workers have been filing initial unemployment insurance claims for 21 consecutive weeks. The last time there was a longer streak of initial unemployment insurance claims over 400.000 was in September of 1992. more than 10 years ago. Furthermore. the number of continuing claims is at its highest level in 20 years. You have to go back to February of 1983 to find continuing claims at the level which we are now experiencing. There are over 1 million Americans who have exhausted all of their unemployment insurance benefits and are still not able to find a job. not because they dont want to work but because there are not jobs to be had. Under current law. extended unemployed insurance benefits last only 13 weeks for most workers. Those in high unemployment. States receive 26 weeks. This amendment would provide an additional 13 weeks to those who have already exhausted their benefits In most states and a further 7 weeks for those in high unemployment States. It is not as though this proposal is excessive historically. In previous recessions. we have passed extensions comparable or. indeed. beyond what is contained in this amendment. When we had a recession from July of 1990 to March of 1991. we extended unemployment benefits until April of 1994. At the programs peak. benefits were available for 26 to 33 extra weeks. That was in the previous Bush administration. It is bad enough to get this level of unemployment in these administrations. That is a breakdown in policy. But it is even worse not to provide these benefits to help people go through the period of unemployment that they are experiencing. as the Senator from Washington so aptly stated in detailing the problems. Let me make one final point. We build up an unemployment insurance trust fund in good times to fund the benefits when we encounter an economic downturn. The cost of this amendment. as I understand it. is $2.5 billion. I ask the Senator from Washington if that is correct.","But the Republican response to that is these students are going to become lawyers and doctors so they will be able to afford it. Would not both my colleagues agree. we have a shortage of 2 million schoolteachers in this country? What we are talking about is schoolteachers. We are talking about social workers who we are trying to help. We are talking about those who would be childcare providers. We are talking about police officials and nurses. These are the ones who are entering low wage professions. trying to make it and to be responsible and pay off their debt. They are the ones who are going to find education virtually priced out.","Mr. Speaker. I would like to commend our good chairman of the Committee on Resources. the gentleman from Utah . for his support. and our ranking member. the gentleman from West Virginia . for his endorsement of this important legislation. Mr. Speaker. as has been so eloquently stated by the gentleman from Guam . the commission to review reparations for the people of Guam. who were subjected to death. forced labor. forced marches and internment during World- War II is long overdue. Guam was the only land under the jurisdiction of the United States to be occupied by Japanese forces during World War H. The people of Guam could have. I suppose. Mr. Speaker. greeted Japanese military forces with open arms and perhaps spared themselves some of the misery they suffered during 3 years of brutal occupation by Japanese forces. but they did not. These native Guamanians were proud Americans since the annexation of Guam by America in 1898 after the SpanishAmerican War. In response to their loyalty. 56 years after the Secretary of the Navy was authorized to adjudicate these claims. we are still debating whether we should establish a commission to study whether the people of Guam who suffered during this occupation should receive reparations. Mr. Speaker. it has been 56 years. Even the Department of the Navy supported reparations decades ago. Direct action on the part of this Congress is long. long overdue. This legislation has been introduced in every Congress since Guam has had a delegate in the U.S. House of Representatives to address the war. the subject of the World War II atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers against these loyal Americans. This is my seventh term now in thisChamber. I can personally attest that the gentleman from Guam has been trying to get this issue addressed since he has been here. and our former colleague. Mr. Ben Blaz. did the same before him. and before Mr. Blaz. Mr. Tony Won Pat in the 1970s. Mr. Speaker. I support this legislation. I also feel compelled to speak out that we should be doing more. A similar bill passed the House late last year. and I appreciate the leadership agreeing to take up this bill early in this Congress so the Senate will have more time to act on it. Mr. Speaker. the territory of Guam stands today as one of our most important strategic centers throughout the Asian Pacific. region. Our Nation has established well over a $10 billion military presence in Guam. a firstclass Air Force base that has proved so crucial in bombin7g operations during the Vietnam War. and a naval installation that is critical to provide resources and support for our armed forces throughout the AsianPacific region. Mr. Speaker. I want to reinforce these points to my colleagues in the House as to why this legislation is so important and why it needs the support of this body. One. some 22.000 native Guamanians were the only Americans living in the land area under the sovereignty of the United States that was occupied for some 3 years by Japanese military forces during World War H. Two. I am not going to ask why it was the policy of our government to evacuate only U.S. citizens living in Guam. but leave the native Guamanians. who were all U.S. nationals. subject to the control and sovereignty of our own government. they were left to fend for themselves for these 3 years while the Japanese occupied the island of Guam. Mr. -Speaker. for 3 years. these United States nationals were subject to some of the worst atrocities committed by Japanese military forces during their occupation of Guam from 1941 to Mr. Speaker. this is not a pleasant story to share with my colleagues today. but we need to put ourselves in the shoes of some of the descendents of these families who suffered so much. It is not a pleasant story to hear when the head of ones father has been decapitated by a Japanese soldier. or if ones mother or sister or wife was being raped by these Japanese forces. I only say just a fraction. from talking to some of the descendents who are still living today. of the atrocities. and just the forced marches. The way that these people were treated. I say it even borders on genocide. Mr. Speaker. I plead with my colleagues today. let this bill pass. We owe it to these proud Americans.","The truth is. the 8(a) program has no reason to fear the HUB Zone Program. In fact. they should be able to work nicely together. The 8(a) program helps to seek minority programs own a greater stake in the economy by focusing on ownership and development of small business. The HUB Zone Program. on the other hand. focuses on developing jobs and opportunities in distressed areas. many of them still minority communities. One brings jobs. the other brings ownership. The two programs are two prongs of the same fork. HUB Zones in 8(a) should not fight with each other but focus on the common threads. such as contract bundling that hurt them and all other small businesses alike. Yesterday. I was pleased to receive a letter from my friends at the National Black Chamber of Commerce in which they recognized how these two programs must work together. Harry Alford. Chamber president and CEO wrote: To date. the Small Business Administration and other agencies have not aggressively pursued the utilization of this valuable vehicleReferring to HUB Zones. There is a false perception that it is here to replace the 8a program. The author has been guilty of that same fear. In further research and reflection. it appears that the anxiety is unjustified. 8a is in the suburbs and nothing is in the inner city. It will be the HUB Zone activity that will spur a renaissance where economic activity is lacking. We must support the HUB zones. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent the letter from Mr. Alford be printed in the RECORD.","Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I am pleased that the Subcommittee on Civil Service has moved quickly to schedule floor action on H.R. 416. the Federal Retirement Coverage Corrections Act. Though this bill passed the House during the 105th Congress. the Senate failed to act on it or its own bill. S. 1710. before adjournment. By moving expeditiously this year. we can get the bill through the House and have ample time left to work with the Senate to enact legislation that will bring relief to the hundreds of Federal employees who find themselves in the wrong retirement system. I want to give special thanks to the gentleman from Florida . the chairman of our subcommittee. for making sure that this bill .came to the floor as fast as it has and for the bipartisan manner of cooperation that we have experienced. This is a complex bill that up to now has included essential Social Security and tax provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of other committees. Unfortunately. these provisions cannot go forward at this time. Nonetheless. the gentleman from Florida and I have elected to bring the core of the bill to the floor now and will continue to work with our colleagues on the Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Finance and Governmental Affairs Committees to iron out the differences between us. Few things in life are more important to a working person than having an adequate and secure retirement plan in place to provide for their future or that of their loved ones. When a workers retirement security is jeopardized by an employers administrative error. tremendous emotional and financial pain can result. unless- a remedy is available that assures its prompt and fair correction and avoids economic harm. The Office of Personnel Management has a web site that explains the rationale for the Federal Governments establishment of the Civil Service Retirement System. It states. and I quote. \"A- strong retirement system is a significant part of the attraction to work for an employer. and the Civil Service Retirement System has allowed the Federal Government to attract and retain a professional and dedicated workforce.\" The web site also conveys the words of a chairman of the former Civil Service Commission who noted that our retirement system should operate. and I quote. \"for the mutual benefit of the government and employees. contributing more effectively than ever to good government. to good working conditions. and to happy retirements.\" Employees caught in the wrong retirement system are far from happy. In 1997. the Subcommittee on Civil Service heard the testimony of four Federal employees who had been the victims of enrollment errors made by their employing agencies. In each case. the employee was initially placed in the Civil Service Retirement System. then years","Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of this bill and would like to commend the work of both the Chairman. Mr. PACKARD. and the Ranking Member. Mr. HEFNER. Further. I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the work and friendship of Mr. HEFNER. He is truly one of our finest members and it has been my distinct honor to have served with him in. this body. The Committee has done an outstanding job in crafting a bill which addresses both the military needs and quality of life concerns for the men and women in our armed services. Make no mistake. our military personnel deserve the best that we in Congress can offer. and this bill takes many of the necessary steps required to improve the quality of life for our military families. The focus this bill places on family housing. child development centers. medical facilities and treatment centers is critical if we are going to continually recruit and retain our best people. While this bill does not meet every deficiency in our military facilities. it continues the approach of&lt;budgeting for the highest priority needs of our armed services. Additionally. I believe it represents a firm commitment by this Congress to our men and women in uniform to continue our efforts to improve their living and working conditions. Further. I would like to express my appreciation to the Committee for their quick response to fund the Continuous Processing Facility at Indian Head. As many of you know. an accidental explosion damaged a portion of this building in February. Although my funding request was unexpected. the Committee responded to this priority by providing funds for a facility which in the long run will be more efficient and flexible in meeting the Defense Departments energetics requirements. Lastly. I would like to thank the Committee for supporting the Administrations request for the replacement of the Annealing Ovens Facility at Indian Head. This new facility will function in a more efficient fashion and address important environmental concems in my district. Again. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member. and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.","Mr..Speaker. I am a member of the Committee on the Budget. Last week Alan Greenspan. the Chairman of the Federal Reserve. came before our committee. Today Secretary Rubin. Secretary of the Treasury. came before our committee. They made. I think. a very important point that everybody should be aware of. That is that Social Security has very serious problems for the future. Mr. Speaker. I would just like td talk about some of the things that are happening in Social Security that means that the benefits for existing retirees are threatened as well as the potential for retirement benefits for workers that are going to retire in the future. In terms of the Federal budget. Social Security uses up now 22 percent of the total Federal budget. What is happening is we have a system in Social Security where existing workers pay their taxes in to support the retirement benefits of existing retirees. a pay as you GOPAC.. That is the way it is today. That is the way it always has been since Social Security started in 1935. What is happening is there is a fewer number of workers. The birth rate is going down. so we are seeing a fewer number of workers paying in their taxes to support an increasing number of retirees. For example. in 1945. there were 42 people working paying in their taxes to support the benefits of each retiree. By 1950. that went down to 17 individuals working paying in their taxes to support each retiree. Today there are three people working. paying in their taxes to support each retiree. What has happened at the same time is an increasing number of retirees. The life span is much longer. When we started Social Security. the average age of death was 61. even though the retirement age was 65. And today the average age of death is almost .74 years. If you are fortunate enough to live to be 65 years old. then the average age of death is 84 years old. So a tremendous increase in the number of retirees which is going to be compounded by the fact that the baby boomers. that huge population growth after World War II. are going to start to retire in about 2011. So everybody is guessing we are going to run out of money. there is not enough money coming in to pay the outgo after 2011. Dorcas Hardy. a former Social Security Commissioner. estimates that we are going to run out of money as early as 2005. Let me give you an example of the increased cost of Social Security. This year on average we are paying out for Social Security benefits $700.000 a minute. By 2029. we will be paying out $5.600.000 a minute. Today $700.000. by 2029 it is going to be $5.600.000. A tremendous increase in cost. How do we solve the problem? I have introduced -a bill last session. that makes 12 modest changes for future retirees. that holds safe existing retirees. but it slightly slows down the increase in benefits for higher -income retirees. It adds an additional year that you are going to have to work to be eligible for retirement. It has some changes in the bend points. It makes changes in the requirements of a spouse receiving Social Security benefits that did not work. but the point is how do we make the changes. How are we going to come to grips with changes in a- program that has been called the third rail. that if politicians start touching this like they did Medicare. they are going to be chastised in the next election. I urge my colleagues to come forward. Let us start taking our heads out of the sand. Mr. .President. I ask you. Secretary Rubin. I ask you. colleagues. I ask you. let us start dealing with this program. If we delay the solutions of solving Social Security. that simply means that the solutions are going to be much more drastic. It is important that we start today working on these solutions for Social Security. I invite my colleagues to examine my bill. Let us run this idea up the flag pole. Let us come up with better solutions. but let us not put this decision off by simply appointing a commission that is going to come back 2 or 3 or *4 .years later with three different proposals on how to solve it.","Mr. Speaker. I yield myself 1 minute and 30 seconds. Mr. Speaker. the point was madeearlier that this practice of a lot of continuing resolutions coming directly to the floor and not going to committee. is highly unusual. I think it is important to point out for the record that in fact it is not unusual. In 1985. when the Democrats controlled the House of Representatives. we had three continuing resolutions that went directly to the floor. In 1986. there were six continuing resolutions that went directly to the floor. two in 1987. five in 1991. three in 1993. The point is nobody likes the process that we have engaged in. but we are where we are because the President vetoed three of the major appropriations bills just before Christmas. prompting the expulsion of thousands of Federal employees from their jobs at Christmas time. And the other bill. the labor HHS bill. was hung up in the Senate because it was filibustered for 9 months until really now. So as distasteful as this whole process is. it has been done before. It will be done again. The old adage that you do not look at sausage and laws being made because it is troublesome is painfully apparent in this particular process we are working our way through. I think for the Democrats. the minoritys position seems to be to vote against this bill and close down Government because they do not like provisions that are being discussed in the conference in H.R. 3019. that is ludicrous. It just does not even make sense. Mr. Speaker. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio . the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Interior.","I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the balanced budget amendment. and I do so for several apparent and vivid reasons. First. just to put it in the Constitution and have it as a discipline for the Members of Congress is reason enough to support the balanced budget amendment. But if one looks at it more analytically. one will find even additional rationale for strong support of this amendment. In my judgment. and it has been said in various ways throughout the parts of the debate that have preceded this. our Social Security funds. our trust funds to which there has been reference. our pension system. our budgetary problems. our deficit. everything is on the table and will be helped when we reform a balanced budget. Social Security. actuarially. will be even more sound than it is today. Veterans benefits -will stay in. place and be strengthened when we reach that balanced budget. So why do we clamor for a balanced budget? To solidify our economy. to stabilize our debt situation. to make it possible in the near future. 2002. borrowing power on the part of citizens will be greater. Mortgaging and lending that will allow the building of homes and the building of busine.sses will be. made ea.ier once a bal-. anced budget has arrived. Why? Because everyone in America knows that when the Federal Government comes to a point that it will cease to borrow from the private sector in order to finance debt. then that money no longer required by the Federal Government because we have reached a balanced budget. that money will remain in the private sector. And 1o and behold. the banks and lending institutions and all who are interested in the availability of private capital for -creation of jobs. for reduction of unemployment. for increasing workers benefits. for then considering the raising of the minimum wage. all those. other matters that come with prosperity will be given. a yeomans. chance if we reachand I say when we reachthe balanced budget in the year2002. We must balance the budget not just to insert into the Constitution.. as valuable as that. is. the language of balanced budget. but rather to do so for the spirit. of America in reaching flnancial sanity through the balanced budget that will free us all. including our citizens. for the enterprise of the future.","Thank you very much. Madam Speaker. I am going to talk alittle bit about health care myself this evening. I am going to talk. and hopefully be joined by some of my colleagues in this effort. about the taxes that are included in a variety of health care bills that are before this Congress. and try to put into perspective why some of us -are concerned about how health care will be paid for. if in fact some of those particular measures pass. - But what I really want to do is begin by putting this into a little larger context because I believe the debate about health care also characterizes the debate going on in the country and a number of other arenas. In Washington today the debate is often characterized as between conservatives and liberals or Republicans and Democrats or varieties of other kinds of groupings and that we have these battles that involve those kinds of political factions. In my belief. that is not the real battle that is going on here. The real battle in Washington today and in the Congress is between those who believe that Government is too big and spends too much and another faction that believes just- as sincerely that bigger Government means a better America. Now. I number myself among those who believe that Government is too big and spends too much. Many of my Republican colleagues. I think. would probably be in that same category. although not all. Even some Republicans would agree that bigger Government means a better America. But the health plans that weare considering here are very much involved with those two kinds of philosophies. In one case you have some health plans that -stem from the idea that Government is too big and spends too much. and they are plans oriented toward keeping the present system of private care. private choice. and having the free enterprise system have a chance to. work In health care. That particular system has produced. the .best health care system in the world. Many of us think it ought to be kept. Those who believe that bigger Government means a better America have fashioned some new bills in Washington. some of which are coming before us in the form of the ClintonMitchell bill and the ClintonGephardt bill. In those cases they are also not only remaking the health system but they are figuring out ways to pay for it that involve new taxes. which is the subject of our special order this evening. This is happening in the context of an America where more and more people are coming to the conclusion that they need to take more responsibility for their own lives and that other people need to take more responsibility for their own lives. They also believe Government needs to have more accountability. It should not grow bigger. as a matter of fact. it ought to get smaller and be more accountable to the people. And they want some idea of a hopeful future. They want some hope about what future generations are going to have in this country. In fact. many Americans think that one of the goals that we should be pursuing is the renewal of the American dream. Now. I would contend that it is very. very difficult for more people to assume responsibility for their own lives if you raise their taxes. if you cut their wages and you take away their jobs. I would also contend that it is very difficult to hold people more accountable within their own communities and hold the Nation more accountable if what we are doing to Americans is raising their taxes. cutting their wages and taking away their jobs. And I would suggest there is very little hope involved in any kind of measures that pass the Congress that in fact raise the taxes of Americans. cut the wages of Americans. and take away the jobs of Americans. And yet. and yet. the proposals that have been brought to us in the form of the ClintonMitchell health care plan and the ClintonGephardt health care plan would have exactly that impact on the country. I am not going to discuss the problems that it would create for health care. I believe that these are plans that would create massive problems in the delivering of health care in the country. but I am not going to talk about those this evening. I am going to talk about the economics of the plans. and in those plans I am going to suggest that those plans have the potential for raising taxes. cutting wages. and taking away American jobs. and that is. in fact. a major concern. I think. for all of us if that is. in fact. what this Congress is going to do. I believe it is. and that will be a part of our discussion this evening. What I would like to do is yield. first of all. to my colleague from Colorado","Mr. Speaker. I rise to run a lap for the regulatory relay team. Led by the gentleman from Texas . the regulatory relay teakm has been coming to the floor of the House each week to discuss a different Federal regulation which is harmful to business and the economy. Federal regulation of businesses costs hundreds of billions of dollars every year. When a business spends money to comply with Federal mandates. It is diverting money which could be spent on new plants or equipment and creating jobs or paying salaries. Not all Federal regulation is bad. In fact. many Federal regulations are needed to protect the health and safety of workers or society at large. However. sometimes Federal agencies are overzealous and inflexible in their Implementation of regulations. Many times they do not take into account the cost of regulations to businesses or look for ways to minimize the cost of compliance with regulations. I want to give my colleagues an example of a wellintentioned regulation run amok. The Department of Labor has promulgated a regulation. called Hazardous Occupation Order 12. or H.O. 12. which prohibits anyone under 18 from operating machines used to manufacture paper. Included in the regulation is the operation of paper balers in grocery stores. Now this is a regulation which is necessary. After all. paper balers can be dangerous machines if operated improperly. The regulation seeks to protect teenagers from baler accidents. However. it goes so far as to prohibit 16- or 17yearolds from simply tossing a piece of paper. such as a piece of cardboard or even a candy wrapper. into a baling machine which is not even operating. The Department of Labor claims that this is \"assisting in the operation\" of the baler. This is similar to saying that when someone places a box inside a car when the engine is turned off. he is assisting in driving the car. Of course. this is ridiculous. Faced with this regulatory dilemma over paper balers. many grocers have stopped hiring 16and 17yearold employees. Grocery Industry representatives requested that the Labor Department review the regulation to see if it is justified and consider possible alternatives to the rule. The Department has refused to do this. Enforcement of the regulation has been extremely aggressive. Grocers report that the Department acts as investigator. prosecutor. judge. and jury and is using the regulation to intimidate businesses by imposing hefty fines. Some report that. the regulators are failing to take into consideration company policies against teenagers using balers and is basing fines on unsubstantiated statements by former employees. In addition. instead of working to prevent future injuries. the Department is going back in time looking for violations which may have occurred up to 2 years in the past. A grocer in my own district in central Illinois tells me that the Labor Department used this regulation to question former employees about past use of balers and fined him $8.000 for a few alleged violations. To grocers. it seems that the Labor Department is more interested in collecting fines and harassing businesses than in protecting the health and welfare of teenage workers. As I mentioned earlier. this inflexible regulation has caused grocers to avoid hiring teenagers. The President is currently seeking $320 million from Congress to create summer Jobs. but this onerous regulation Is killing jobs for teenagers. The administration could help create jobs for teenagers simply by improving this unreasonable regulation and enforcing it in a fair and rational manner. And the H.O. 12 regulation can be altered in a way which will not threaten the health or welfare of anyone. This regulation is a good example of the regulatory overkill our Federal bureaucrats frequently use. It is about time the Federal Government got off the backs of businesses and let them do what they do bestcreate jobs.","Mr. President. I rise today to Introduce legislation to provide shortterm relief for our Nations small water systems. which are struggling to comply with EPA regulations Issued under the 1987 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. Although Congress did not intend the Safe Drinking Water Act to have a punitive effect on small communities struggling to provide economical. safe drinking water to their citizens. the cost of compliance with some of these rules is proving to be prohibitively high. All over New Mexico. and in many other States as well. small water systems are faced with a terrible choice that is really no choice at all: Going broke. or being fined by EPA or their State environment departments for failure to comply with Safe Drinking Water Act regulations. Mr. President this is simply an economies of scale problem. The lead and copper rule and the phase II and phase V rules for synthetic organic and inorganic chemicals will require these small systems to test for over 100 contaminants on a frequent basis. But small. particularly rural. water systems do not have the means to make these tests themselves. and will have to contract with laboratories or larger municipalities. The cost to these small water systems could run Into the thousands of dollars every year. These costs would ultimately be borne by the water users. and result in large increases to Individual water bills. Mr. President. the intended benefits of the Safe Drinking Water Act will be negated if implementation of the regulations forces the shutdown of community water systems and Jrlves families back to unsafe water sources. I am not advocating a rollback of standards necessary to ensure safe drinking water. But these small systems need a temporary reprieve to buy the necessary time for EPA and Congress to address the economics of safe drinking water. The bill I am introducing today directs the Administrator to extend the deadline for compliance with the national primary drinking water regulations for lead and copper by 1 year. It makes a similar direction for the phase II regulations for 26 synthetic organic chemicals and 7 inorganic chemicals. and the phase V regulations for 18 synthetic organic chemicals and 5 inorganic chemicals. These rules have already been promulgated. Mr. President. my amendment just extends the deadiline for implementation for 1 year. This legislation also requires the Administrator. during the course of that year. to conduct research on the degree of health risks from noncompliance with the regulations by small and mediumsize water systems. and the economic cost of compliance with the regulation. It Is not at all clear. Mr. President. that It makes sense for all of the Nations drinking water systems to test for all of these contaminants. all of the time. Based on these findings. the Administrator will present a report. complete with recommendations for any legislative changes that may help small communities. to Congress. Mr. President. this is not Intended to be the final. comprehensive solution to the compliance problems of small water systems. It Is intended to provide shortterm relief until Congress can take up the Safe Drinking Water Act In the 103d Congress. This legislation will also buy EPA some time to work with communities on innovations and compromises that will remove the immediate threat of penalties and fines. These efforts notwithstanding. it is also incumbent upon the Federal Government to fully fund the Safe Drinking Water Supply Program. We must give the States the means to comply with the laws that Congress passes. In conclusion. Mr. President. I note that my colleague from New Mexico. Mr. DOMENIC. has also introduced a bill related to the Safe Drinking Water Act regulations. He has. had a longstanding concern about this issue and has made very constructive contributions to dealing with the problems. It is my hope that we can work together to address the needs of small water systems.

I understand an amendment to H.R. 644 will be offered by my colleague from New Mexico. Mr. RxcHARssoN. to his own bill today. I wish to speak in opposition to his amendment. First. I object to the manner in which this amendment is being sought. I sit on the Mining and Natural Resources Subcommittee of the Interior Committee. That is the subcommittee that should have reviewed and debated the issue of foreclosing a mining claimants opportunity to receive a patent to his or her valid mining claim. Mr. Speaker. this is a very important part of the coming debate on the viability of the mining law of 1872. Our subcommittee chairman. Mr. RAHALL. introduced a bill in January to repeal this law and substitute a leasinglike system. albeit one without royalty provisions. Senator BUMPERS introduced a bill during the first session of this Congress to substitute an outright leasing system for the mining law. The revision of the location and patent system for \"hardrock\" minerals on the public lands of the West is a stated goal of many environmental organizations. I understand that only 178 acres of placer mining claims would fall within the protected river corridor in this bill. Nevertheless. it is the principle of amending the mining laws effect upon existing mining claims. no matter how few. to which I object. particularly when other recourse is available. Second. Mr. Speaker. the offered amendment is totally unnecessary because it does not bring effect to the purposes for which the withdrawal is being made. that is. protecting the East Fork of the Jemez River from degradation. Under existing law. the patent that may issue for a mining claim within a wild and scenic river corridor is limited to the mineral estate only. unless a vested right to a full fee patent exists. The Department of the Interior has interpreted this to mean that entitlement to a full fee patent exists only for those claims for which patent applications had been filed and all the adjudicatory steps had been completed by the date of designation. The placer claims within the corridor that this bill would designate have not reached such stage of adjudication as yet. Im told. In all likelihood. therefore. the miner here will receive a patent only to the mineral deposit and not the surface estate. Why then are we embarking on this course of action? I agree that the resources of the Jemez and Pecos Rivers segment to be designated are worthy of protection. My question is how will denial of a title to the mineral estate achieve this end? The amendment offered specifically states that it does not preclude mining operations on valid claims. Mr. Speaker. I submit that the real intent of this amendment is to indeed preclude mining by taking away the right to a patent. Why? Because with a patent in hand. even one limited to the minerals only. the claim owner could more effectively resist unreasonable and burdensome regulation of activities upon his claims. I believe that the Congress should own up to the fact that by passage of this amendment it is simply attempting to defeat mining without having to buy out these claims for which a private property right has been. or very likely will be. established. As such. Mr. Speaker. I must strongly object.","Mr. Speaker. not long ago we heard thenVice President Bush proclaim he was an environmentalist and deride his opponent for failing to act. Well now. Mr. President. Prince William Sound in Alaska looks worse than Boston Harbor. Otters. seabirds. and other wildlife are dying from the exposure to the oil spilled from the tanker Exxon Valdez. And the damage is spreading. Besides the disastrous affects on the ecosystem of Prince William Sound. and the livelihoods of the local communities. the oilspill is already impacting national park resources at Kenai Fjords National Park. The oil slick could also effect both Katmai National Park and Lake Clark National Park. Seabirds at isolated islands n the Gulf of Alaska are dying after they dive into the oilcovered water hunting for food. In an effort to protect these resources. the Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands will hold a hearing tomorrow on the oilspill threat to Alaskan national parks. I am also glad to see that other committees in Congress have begun investigating the ollspill and ways to control the damage. We in Congress must get the information we need and we must act quickly to protect our national parks and the other natural resources from the spreading path of oily destruction.","Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of S. 557. the Civil Rights Restoration Act. and I urge my colleagues to join me in sending to the Presidents desk this critical and overdue antidiscrimination measure. I have long been a supporter and cosponsor of legislation in the House to overturn the U.S. Supreme Courts 1984 decision in Grove City College versus Bell because I believe that it Is our duty in Congress to hasten the demise of all forms of discrimination in AmerIca. For nearly 20 years. our Nations fundamental antidiscrimination laws were applied broadly to any institution that received Federal aid. under the theory that the taxpayers did not want their money to support prejudice or discrimination In even an indirect manner. The Supreme Court changed these circumstances drastically with its Grove City decision. Grove City was specifically concerned with title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1072. which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. The Court ruled that only the particular programs. departments. or divisions within agencies and institutions that received Federal assistance were required to abide by antisex discrimination laws. The institutions themselves were thus exempted from this coverage. The impact of Grove City worked as followsif a particular universitys biology laboratory were receiving Federal funding while the universitys athletic .departmqnt did not. sex discrimination within the athletic programs could go unchallenged. This marked a serious departure from the prior means by which our civil rights laws were enforced. Moreover. even thounh Grove City was seemingly only about sex discrimination. in its wake the impact of three other fundamental Federal antidiscrimination laws were severely curbed. The Civil Rights Act of 1964. the Rehabilitation Act of 1974. and the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. which prohibited discrimination on the basis of race. disability. or age. ceased to be effective guardians of our civil liberties. The Grove City ruling. especially when it was viewed in the context of a Justice Department that already paid scant attention to the civil liberties of minorities. women. the aged. and those suffering from diseases such as AIDS. greatly concerned many of us in Congress. We in the House have endeavored ever since to overturn this euling. and this year. despite the fervent objections of the Reagan administration. the Senate overwhelmingly acceded to this momentum. Mr. Speaker. by coincidence this week marks the 20th anniversary of the release of the Kerner Commission report on race relations In America. While we have made great strides in the battle against prejudice and poverty In America. many of the dilemmas of the underclass In our cities have gone unaddressed. I believe it is fitting to ponder the issue of race relations in America as we consider this major civil rights legislation today. and I am Inserting for the RECORD articles that discuss the faces of poverty and discrimination 20 years after the Kerner commission report. (From the New York Times. Mar. 1. 1988]","Mr. Speaker. suffering is not something new for Jews. Problems. faced by Jews in the Soviet Union. is especially not new. Acts of antiSemitism have been prevalent throughout the history of Russia. Indeed. was the wrath of the pogroms that first brought thousands upon thousands of Russian Jews to this country at the turn of the century. Certainly. things have improved since the time of Cossacks slaughtering whole towns and burning down synagogues while human beings remained locked inside. Life in the Soviet Union. however. is still not good for Jews. A new leader with a clever public relations cadre and a catchy ad campaign does not change basic policy. Despite the vaunted Glasnost. repression continues in its most brutal and inhumane forms. Recently. the CBS television series \"60 Minutes\" portrayed the plight of Soviet Jewry in an inaccurate light. seriously hurting the cause of fighters for justice. I feel compelled to read to you the letter sent to Mike Wallace by Pamela Cohen. national president of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jewry. an organization of over 77.000 members who have fought for the cause of Soviet Jewry for more than a decade. [Letter] DEAR MIKE WALLACE: I found your 60 Minute segment of March 22. which purported to examine fairly the situation of Soviet Jews. to be dangerously misleading. By irresponsibly distorting the balance of easily available witnesses. It gave the Soviet Union an undeserved propaganda victory against the human rights movement that mocks the direct evidence our network of rescue workers collects every day. In so doing. you may have caused irreparable harm to the aspirations of refuseniks who put their lives on the line simply by seeking freedom. By what standards of research and accuracy could you balance a single Jewish refusenik with a long parade of Englishspeaking court Jews. e.g.. a Soviet \"Frank Sinatra\". a Russian \"George Burns\". a viciously antiSemitic Samual Zivs. an English teacher who denies the indisputable trend of Jews wishing to learn and speak Hebrew even when Hebrew teachers are routinely arrested. harassed and sent to jail. a class of smug. British accented students. as if the Soviets dont discriminate against Jews applying to university. and as if Jewish children are not generally ostracized and vilified by their schoolmates? Could CBS not afford a proper translator of its own? Where were the Russian activists. the hunger and labor strikers. of the Jewish refusenik movement? Where were the dozens of current and former prisoners of conscience? How obscene to trot out to the Potemkin village of Birobijhain. Have you forgotten Thierlesenstadt? By whose authority do you claim that \"1.5 million Soviet Jews live more or less satisfying lives\" in the face of statesponsored antiSemitism and the nearly 50.000 refuseniks who have risked all for the legal right to emigrate to a land of their choice. to say nothing of the 400.000 who are known to want desperately to leave the USSR? Is It the eyewitness testimony of the Sharanskys. Orovs. and Sakharovs to be discredited by a few smiling. ironic faces tolerated by the KGB? We of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews. the 77.000member rescue organization. offered your producers our assistance in finding truly representative refuseniks and prisoner families to interview. Contrary to your statement. this has never been hard to do even in the worst periods of repression. I repeat the offer today. Indeed. I seriously urge you to let us help you repair some of the grevious damage you have done to the fragile cause of rescue. I urge you to give us equal time by scheduling another. blacker side of the story. Your program did dangerous disservice by letting entertainment values masquerade as news and comment. Surely. CBS News is capable of a competent. careful. and well researched presentation of the plight of Soviet Jews. Sincerely.","Madam Speaker. let us pretend. Just for the sake of argument. let us pretend that drug tests do work. Let us forget about the fact that a poppyseed roll at breakfast can accuse an innocent person of being a heroin addict. Let us forget that some overthecounter pain relievers taken before a drug test can have you fighting the label of \"junkie\" for the rest of your life. Let us also pretend that we can suspend the Bill of Rights. that we never heard of presumption of innocence. illegal search and seizure. and probable cause. and the protection against selfincrimination. Let us even pretend that the President is right. that America would be better off if every citizen tinkled for him on Tuesdays. Took lie detector tests on Wednesdays. blood tests on Thursdays. personality tests on Fridays. and maybe genetic tests on Saturdays in order to get and keep a job. Madam Speaker. let us pretend these things because we know that we are dealing with an administration that pretends. They pretend to want to get Government off our backs while gleefully putting Big Brother In our bedrooms. our bloodstreams. and now even confiscating our urine. Even if we pretend the President is right. how are we going to pay for this dubious effort? We all know the sad answer. Mr. Reagans pretend war on drugs is financed by reducing border guards. by reducing funding to the cities in their fight against suppliers. and by reducing our drugfighting commitment overseas. Instead. we get a farcical raid on Bolivian drug peddlers who were not there and a war on our own Government workers. Madam Speaker. imagine instead what could happen if we spent $100 million defending our borders and educating our children. With this administration that would be just pretending.","Madam President. I am pleased to join with many of my colleagues in commemorating this 20th anniversary of the Medicare Program. The Medicare Program had its roots in the Social Security Program which was adopted at a time of crisis in this countryat a time when some were questioning whether our fundamental institutions were capable of coping with the problems of the 20th century. I am pleased to say that when my father was a Member of the U.S. Senate. he campaigned for a broad program to provide for the needs of the less fortunate in this country and my father voted for the Social Security bill of 1935. The Social Security Act of 1935 translated the basic good sense of American society into a practical solution to the problems of economic security for those who face the problems of old age and unemployment and for children in need. Subsequent amendments have added similar protections for those who have become severely disabled. The signing of the Medicare bill by President Johnson on July 30. 1965. in Independence. MO. President Trumans hometown. filled the last major gap in the economic security of the elderly of this Nation. Today. Medicare provides health insurance protection to over 27 million persons 65 and over. Medicare also provides protection to persons under 65 who have been entitled for a period of 24 months to Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits because they are disabled. and to certain workers and their dependents who need kidney transplantation or dialysis. It was my privilege to manage the Medicare bill on the Senate floor. and it was my pleasure to accompany President Lyndon Johnson to Independence. MO. where he signed the bill in the presence.of former President Harry Truman. Madam President. I am proud to have been a member of the Finance Committee which enacted this major bill to provide health. protection for our senior citizens.","Mr. Speaker. I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to tone tragic case of Tania Zelensky. Ms. Zelensky was a young woman. a U.S. citizen born in the United States. who was beaten to death by a misguided Individual. solely because of her Russian heritage. Her death stands as a sobering testimonial to the painful cost of our geopolitical conflicts. and our failure to seek a greater understanding of the plight of peoples on both sides of the Iron Curtain. I am inserting for the RECORD a copy of a letter written by Tanias father to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. and Mr. Solzhenitsyns reply: Mr. AisKSANDR I. SOLZHENITsYN. Cravendish. Vt. DEAR MR. SOLEHENCITSYN: On October 24. 1983. in Pittsfield. in the heart of Vermont not far from your place of residence. our beloved daughter Tania Zelensky was brutally murdered. She was killed by a local resident. According to those who knew him. he was a gentle. hard workingman with a college education. He loved animals and nature and had many relatives and friends. As reported by the local press. his motive for the murder. according to his own admission. was Tanias RussIan descent and his suspicions that she was a \"Russian spy.\" Furthermore. according to the papers. remarks made by the County States AtLorney indicate that the direct cause for the slaying may have been the events in Beirut which took place on the eve of Tanias death. On that day. terrorists. possibly supported by the USSR. staged an attack on a UA. military compound. which resulted in the deaths of over two hundred of our Marinos According to other accounts in the press. Tanias killing was motivated by a \"violent act of patriotism.\" Evidently. in this persons mind. the Soviet Union and Russia represent e.quivalent concepts. and all Russians. including Americans of Russian descent (Tania was born in the USA) are inherently cotanuaists. The burden of guilt for the senseless and tragic identification. which equates two such mutually exclusive and incompatible entities. does not lie with the wretched killer alone. The full measure for morai and perhaps even legal responsibility to the American people for the creation of the fortile ground which breeds this kind of identification. rests with the news media and with many political leaders of this nation. Day in and day out they combine and Interchange the intrinsically divergent terms: \"Russial USSR. Russian/Communists. Soviet/Kremlin.\" inevitably leading to the destructive conclusion: Russians equal communists. At times this occurs due to ignorance. but often is used in full consciousness with a definite. evil purpose in mind. This brutal. fanatic act cut short a young life so full of boundless energy. ceaseless search. love for all people. love for her country and a fervent hope for the liberation of the land of her ancestors. Tania once wrote: \"Greetings. Earthl Greetings. Thy people! My name is Tanta Zelennky. Oh. how I love you all!\" Not i. not I alone should cry with my weak voice (or the world to hear of her innocent blood spilled so senselessly. It Is not for me to be the lone voice crying in the wildermons about this fatal equalon of doom. the evils of which are many and they forcefully transgress all levels of personal irage dy. Not knowing how to eradicate evil. some powerful institutions as well as separate individuals continuously sow the seeds of hatred. Instead of denouncing the oppressars. they denounce the oppressed. Should tills distorted attitude prevail. the very first victims of communism. the Russian people. will become victims once more: victims of a hostility that is both misdirected and Irra tional. My brother. let us prevent thial I ask you: Who. if not us? When. if not now? Countless exiled Russians tried. with lit le success. to explain the simple truth which still remains incomprehensible to the west: The Soviet Union is not Russia. Russians are not communists.\" All of their efforts fell upon deaf ears and the sinister misconcep. tion remains Intact. Until Tanias death. their efforts seemed the only conceivable plan of action. But nluw. seeing the futility of such conduct. new means must be Implemented in order to .prevent this monstrous wrong from occure.ng again. Withl this message. I am enclosing a copy _1 the letter received from the tiny village where Tania was killed. It was signed by all who were not absent. people of all ages and trades ... farmers. lumberjacks. carpenters. merrhants. office workers. and teachers. This letter speaks for itself and points the way to a new path to follow. The time has come. when not just Russian exiles. but all Americans in general. must act to put an end to this thoughtless identification of Russian people with communism. Inspired by your word. the people will raise their own voices with a call to end all unjust linking of Russians to the murderous deeds of the Soviets. The success of such action will deliver an irreparable blow to communism. because the greatest asset for the Soviets has always been the worldwide illusion of unity be tween them and the Russian people.

This bipartisan effort. signed by 120 of my colleagues. creates a structured working group. Individuals representing education. business. labor. parents. students. and others. will be selected by a bipartisan committee. A specific agenda will be put in place and the outcome of the regional meetings and the conference will be evaluated to determine its effect. It Is not a study. It is not acommission. It is a mechanism to avoid a costly rush to judgment on education. It is a mechanism to provide a way in which to include Americans in the discussions of their system of education. It is. I believe. a strategy for success. I am very encouraged with the bipartisan support we have received and I am equally encouraged by the support that we have received on this legislation from all of the leading education groups. including the NEA. the AFT. and the PTA. I appreciate the full support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFLCIO. I ask my colleagues to encourage the Senate and the administration to support our bipartisan efforts here In the House to create a National Summit Conference on Education.","Mr. President. first. let me commend the minority leader on his amendment. For all the reasons which have just been so eloquently stated by my friend from Maryland this amendment should be adopted. Without this amendment. this is not a jobs bill which is before us. That is the critical point. Without this amendment of the minority leader the gasoline tax bill before us is not a jobs bill. As a matter of fact. without this amendment for some of our States this gasoline tax bill is a jobs export bill. The State of Michigan is one of those donor States. We have been on the losing end of this deal for many. many years. As I look at the Senator from Texas. I know he has done a good deal in this session to try to correct it. with some success. may I say. He has been doing extraordinary work. But the State of Michigan. I am afraid the facts are. has been receiving back about 83 cents of the dollar. We have been exporting about $63 million a year under the gasoline tax formula-$63 million a year for the last 15 years. We cannot afford that kind of hemorrhaging in a State with 17.2 percent unemployment. We simply cannot afford it. Even though my good friend from Texas has done great work in building in a. floor of 85 cents back on each dollar sent to the Federal Government. .1 am afraid that means that States like Michigan. instead of being 17 feet under water. are only going to be 15 feet under water. and we are drowning still. So despite that effort by my good friend. this gasoline tax bill. without the minority leaders amendment. is not a jobs bill at all. but. again. leaves States such as Michigan with a jobs export bill. The President talked about a user fee. that people who use the highways ought to pay for them. Indeed. that makes sense. The trouble is that for the donor States. in the bill before us the people who are using the highways in our States are paying to build highways in other States. With the kind of unemployment we have in Michigan. we simply cannot afford a jobs export bill. So this amendment adds the jobs component. It is a coherent response to the disastrous economic situatirs which confronts our country. The country demands immediate action and this amendment would provide that action. Mr. President. we have a fullblown depression in Michigan. With all the semantics as to what constitutes a recessionis there a recession. are we on the verge of a recessionwe have a fullblown depression in my home State. The unemployment rate in Michigan now exceeds 17 percent. Some economists are now predicting that the nationwide unemployment rate may go above 11 percent nationwide. . For my State. this will mean that the already intolerable suffer ng will become even more extreme. I just looked through the current computer printout of the unemployment data for Michigan townships. Let me tell you. the unemployment rate has already exceeded 20 percent in far too many. Something must be done. This package which is being offered today looks to the need for action. both in the short and the long run. As a first step. we must extend the period of eligibility for unemployment benefits which individuals are currently receiving under the Federal supplemental benefits program which was enacted as part of this years tax. Individuals are now exhausting their benefits under that program in record numbers. and all that has happened in the meantime is that the nationwide unemployment rate has increased from 10.1 to 10.8 percent. In my State of Michigan it has increased from 15.9 percent to 17.2 percent. It is only reasonable that the Congress respond to the worsening jobs picture. as we have twice in the early seventies. by increasing the period of eligibility for unemployment benefits in order to assist those who have been unemployed for a substantial period of time. and those who are still looking for jobs but for whom no jobs can be found. Mr. President. if this comprehensive amendment Is not adopted. I intend to offer. with help on both sides of the aisle. this portion of the amendment that relates to the extension of the period of eligibility for unemployment benefits. I am determined that before this session of the Congress ends we have an opportunity to vote on at least this portion of this comprehensive amendment. I state that determination because of the blood that is being sold by my people in Michigan to pay for food for their children. The blood donor banks in Michigan are receiving record numbers of blood donations from unemployed people to receive a few dollars from each little bit of plasma that can be used to buy food for their children. people who have run out of unemployment benefits. Again. Mr. President. I am determined that before this session ends we have an opportunity to vote on the extension of unemployment compensation benefits. If this amendment falls. I will be offering an amendment which contains the extension of the unemployment compensation benefit portion of this amendment to the Senate either on this bill or on the continuing resolution. This is an amendment which has been supported by so many people in this Senate on both sides of the aisleSenators DIXON. METZENBAUM. RIEGLE. and others. But again. I will be of fering this before this session ends. and I am determined that we have the opportunity to vote on it: that it not be tabled. that it not be subject to a point of order. assuming that the cloture petition is finally filed on this bill or some other bill. that before the continuing resolution is finally voted on we have the opportunity to look at the unemployment benefits issue. This package also provides $2 billion for the creation of 300.000 jobs in community public works programs. These are jobs which can be filled in the very near future and which will be directed toward improving the Nations public capital facilities. It is true that when compared to 12 million unemployed. 300.000 is just a small poercentage. But for the person receiving a job under this program. its benefits are very real and significant. For displaced workers. a prime concern in my State of Michigan as it is throughout the country. this amendment provides $200 million for advance funding under the Job Training Partnership Act to retrain and relocate skilled workers from industries such as auto and steel. In 1978. the employment level in the U.S. auto industry was over 750.000. Now it is set at 448.000. Certainly. when the economy picks up. some of those jobs will return. But we have to recognize that it is unlikely that every currently unemployed autoworker will be able to find reemployment in the auto industry. It would be cruel to create the illusion that expanded economic growth will be sufficient to totally revitalize the auto industry and bring it back to its highwater mark. That is why it is important to take steps now to institute a retraining program on an accel. erated basis. Finally. this package modifies the third year of the tax cut and. thereby. not only funds the jobs Initatives. but also provides additional revenues to reduce the deficit. This modification would preserve the third year of the tax cut for most Americans. and ask for a measure of sacrifice from those upper income individuals who have thus far benefited disproportionately from the tax and economic program. The goal here. then. is to take a step which would reduce the deficit so that the private economy can expand without being crowded out. and ultimately stalled. by massive Federal borrowing. I urge my colleagues to support this package. While it is true that it is being offered from this side of the aisle. I believe that it is consistent with the concerns which were expressed by a majority of Americans in the recent election. They spoke out loudly and clearly that unemployment is too high and that action must be taken to alleviate the suffering it is causing. Passage of this package will enable us to show them that the U.S Senate is listening. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.","Mr. President. I am today Introducing along. with my colleague from Nevada. Senator CANNON. legislation that would authorize the recreational use of the Ruby Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in Nevada and direct the Secretary of Interior to seek to balance the recreational use of the refuge with the wildlife conservation management. Mr. President. the Ruby Lakes National Wildlife Refuge. commonly known as the Ruby Marshes. covers 37.600 acres and stradles the boundaries of Elko and White Pine Counties In Nevada. The area is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The original pturpose of the refuge was to provide a breeding ground for Waterfowl and wildlife. and was established In 1938. However. recreational usage has increased significantly over the past decade as has the number of visitors to the area. Several years ago the Fish and Wildlife Service completed an environmental impact assessment on boating at the refuge. The EIA maintained the boating was adversely affecting nesting canvasback and redhead ducks. The basis for this finding has been disputed by many people with knowledge of the situation. As a result of a lawsuit filed in the District of Columbia. the Interior Department issued regulations that effectively prohibited recreational power boating and fishing on the Ruby Lakes. Unfortunately. both the Fish and Wildlife Service and the courts failed to consider Information provided by the refuge manager. which clearly established that waterfowl production had not been adversely impacted by the increased recreational usage as claimed. Mr. President. I believe all Nevadans agree that the wildlife at the marshes should be protected. As a matter of fact. prior to the lawsuit which I have men.tioned. the Fish and Wildlife Service. after listening to State and local concerns. had drawn up regulations that would have protected the wildlife at the marshes and still allowed some recreational opportunities for northern Nevada sportsmen. Frankly. I find it unconscionable that the desires of Nevadans to pursue a multiple use policy at the Ruby Lakes were usurped by a group of outofState environmentalists who presented their case to an eastern judge. rather than Comning to NeVada and arguing facetoface with Nevadans. The legislation Senator CANNON and I are Introducing today would simply provide a mechanism whereby the Department of the Interior could Issue new regulations that would allow reasonable recreational use as well as wildlife managemnent. We feel that recreational boating and the maintenance of wildlife habitats are not mutually exclusive. I have high hopes that the administration will be supportive of this approach. and that Congress will permit the citizens of Nevada to once again enjoy this wonderful recreational area. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the REcORD.","Mr. President. on behalf of the minority. I am happy to accept the amendment. predicated on those two points. I have long been a strong advocate of alternative systems of energy development. especially renewable sources of energy. the potential we have there and not realized. but I want to make certain that we not make this at the expense of the other ongoing programs. I would have liked to have seen this brought about through deducting that $6 million from the warhead program. but I realize the political realities of that problem. So. in lieu of having it brought about through that system. I am happy to accept this amendment. as stated. by the Senator from Louisiana and the Senator from Massachusetts.","I thank the gentleman very much for his contribution. I would just like to conclude by saying that there are several aspects of this that bother me. There is a human rights aspect. of course. in that the President of the United States has pledged to the President of Mexico that those citizens of Mexico who are in this country illegally will receive the same protection of the law that a legal resident of this country would receive. It would have a tremendously detrimental effect upon our relationships with not just Mexico but all of the countries of the Western Hemisphere if. by adopting this language. we began to take steps which will be construed as discriminating against the very large number of undocumented workers. largely Hispanic. in this country.","Mr. Chairman. today the House of Representatives considers H.R. 15. the Elementary and Secondary Education Act Amendments of 1978. I would like to take this opportunity to offer my support for this legislation. I am satisfied with virtually the entire bill. for it brings much needed additional funding to my State. The emphasis which both the administration and the Education and Labor Committee place on the basic skills of reading. writing. and mathematics. is commendable. This \"return to basics\" represents a rebirth of Americas system of education. Perhaps quality education in the public school system now shall become a reality instead of a dream. As a former title I coordinator. I am especially concerned with this portion of H.R. 15. My only dissatisfaction with the entire bill comes from this section: the formula change which substitutes the use of the 1976 survey of income and eduction (SIE). instead of the 1970 census. for the population estimate. This will result in a $32.000 loss for Hawaiia loss which. though relatively small. will be felt. I am extremely pleased with the new program to provide supplemental assistance to States with compensatory education programs. The qualifications for Federal assistance-$2 for every 1 State dollarare clear and fair. Any liberalization of this section would result in a weakening of its thrust. Hawaii qualifies for the additional funding by virtue of its extensive compensatory education program. This includes the comprehensive school alienation program (CSAP). which provides additional services to youths aged 9 to 19 identified as dropouts or potential dropouts. Also funded by State compensatory education money is act 4. which is devoted to educational improvement projects for the children of Hawaiian home lands lessees. The intent of the incentive grant program is to encourage other States to develop compensatory education programs such as these. I oppose any weakening amendments which would make it easier for other States to qualify. As a former teacher and principal. I can predict the reaction of educators to the provision in H.R. 15 which will permit 3year applications for grants instead of annual applications. This will greatly reduce the amount of paperwork required for school districts and allow educators to concentrate on the real business of education. Likewise. I admire the provision for increased parental involvement in title I programs. Such involvement is necessary so that a childs education will continue even when he or she leaves the school grounds. Of additional assistance in this area of continuity in education is the emphasis which H.R. 15 places on cooperation between Federal and State administrators. Such cooperation can only result in more effective programs for the students. In Hawaii. the emphasis in education is on basic language skills and mathematics. Many of our children come from homes where little English is spoken. and it is left to the schools to compensate for this disadvantage. For this reason. I am especially pleased with the reauthorization of the national reading and mathematics program for 5 years. through 1983. The program which includes authorizations for grants and projects aimed at improving reading and mathematics achievement. will be administered by the State rather than by the Federal Government. I am certain State administrators will welcome this provision. for they. more than others. know where within the district. the needs are greatest. Another program which will now be State administered is the Special Projects Act. I welcome the addition to title VIII of the new section on minimum competency standards. This section would authorize aid to States in developing standards by which a students competency level may be tested. I hav.e previously remarked on my States emphasis on basic skills. Additional attention to the measurement or testing of these basic skills will be of great assistance to our students. I believe that we all recognize the importance of the Emergency School Aid Act (ESAA) within our educational system. In Hawaii. ESAA dollars assist numerous minority students. and. as you well know. the needs of such minority students are great. Additionally. under ESAA. districts will be allowed to submit applications for grants of up to 5 years rather than 1 year. Again. this will reduce paperwork freeing administrators and teachers to develop more effective and farreaching programs. For example. programers may now take the time to effect research into ways in which a childs culturalminoritybackground can assist in his or her English language instruction. Bilingual education is of major importance in Hawaii and must be treated accordingly. I applaud the defeat of the administrations impact aid proposals. Hawaiis need for these funds is great because of the number of Federal workers employed there. The increased aid to heavily impacted districts will most definitely assist in compensating my State for the cost of educating children of Federal workers. I support the expansion of public housing impact aid. Public housing children come from school districts with the greatest need for additional Federal aid. It has been said that there is a direct connection between large concentrations of public housing and the financial needs of the school district. In a State where a large proportion of the population is immigrants. adult education assumes greater and greater importance. Increased emphasis on the flexibility of course offerings. location of classes. and logistics in terms of day care and transportation will be of enormous assistance to adult students in Hawaii. These students must not be forgotten: they. too. are in need of basic skills training. I reiterate my support for H.R. 15 and urge prompt and favorable consideration.*","Mr. President. I wish to announce that there will be a meeting of the Subcommittee on Oceans and International Environment of the Committee on Foreign Relations on Thursday. March 31. 1977. at 10 a.m. in room 4221 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building to receive testimony from executive branch and public witnesses on Senate Resolution 49. expressing the sense of the Senate that the U.S. Government should seek the agreement of other governments to a proposed treaty requiring the preparation of an International Environmental Impact Statement for any major project. action. or continuing activity which may be reasonably expected to have a significant adverse effect on the physical environment or environmental interests of another nation or a global commons area. The hearing on this resolution. which was previously scheduled for Wednesday. February 23. has been cancelled.","Mr. President. Paul Ringler. formerly chief editorial writer for the Milwaukee Journal and past chairman of the executive board of the International Press Institute. knows something about freedom of the press. In a recent address to the Milwaukee chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. Sigma Delta Chi. Mr. Ringler outlined the state of the free press around the world. There were some bright spots. but more bad news for freedom. He told his audience: Keep in mind that press freedom is Indivisible. that what diminishes it in one country tends to diminish it in all. that tyranny knows no borders. that the foes of freedom learn from each other. that press freedom is the guardian of all freedoms. and is ever the very first victim of the tyrant. So far in our beloved country. we have not had to fear a tyrant that would snuff out freedoms fires. But we do have abroad in this land that has protected freedom in other lands with our sons blood a misunderstanding of freedom of the press. That misunderstanding could some day lead to consequences that could prove dangerous to our form of government. We came close just recently to opening the door to an unconstitutional precedent. But. fortunately. members of a House of Representatives committee thought twice and did not press to find the source of a reporters information. Yet constantly. every minute of every day. we tolerate what I believe is an unconstitutional abridgment of the free press. I refer to the existence of the socalled fairness doctrine and the equal time rule that prevents broadcast journalists from doing their jobs freely. One of the words used in the dictionary definition of \"abridge\" is \"diminish.\" Mr. Ringler chose well when he selected the word \"diminish\" in warning of dangers to press freedom around the world. If we continue to permit the freedom of broadcast journalists to be diminished we are asking for wouldbe tyrants to exercise their judgment for our collective judgment of information about our Government available in the pressand not just the broadcast press. When the day comes that the power of government can be put behind a complaint about the way news Is toldin newspapers as well as over the airwe will be In the same position as the citizens of countries Mr. Ringler tells about. Our first amendment is premised on the faith that as long as the government cannot influence what is published about it. there will be no need to fear for freedom. That means that each citizen is able to think for himself. to make his own judgments. We dare not forget that. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Ringlers remarks as published in the Milwaukee Journal last Sunday be printed in the RECORD.","Mr. Speaker. the necessity for eliminating the inflationary reward which Government receives as a result of our present progressive rate of taxation has never been of more importance to Americans than it is today. I have Joined with a number of my colleagues in cosponsoring legislation which would reverse this trendthe Cost of Living Adjustment Act. At the present time. as the Wall Street Journal notes In a recent editorial. \"If prices double and real incomes remain the same. nominal incomes are doubled and all workers are pushed into higher brackets. The Governments revenues not only keep up with Inflation. but the Government actually increases its claim on real resources.\" Recent statistics compiled by the Joint Economic Committee show that real Income tax rates for middleincome families last year rose 26.5 percentwhereas the inflation rate averaged 12 per cent. The largest price increase was In the cost of Government. While food rose 11.9 percent and transportation rose 14.3 percent. the income taxes paid by a middleincome family Increased 26.5 percent. Those who have joined in cosponsoring this legislation are concerned over the fact that the Federal Government is the only real winner in the current inflationary economic situation. At the present time. the Governments income is superindexed in the sense that its real income is Increased by inflation. Since it is Governments policies which cause inflation. a real conflict of Interest Is Involved. Those In the Democratic Party who express great concern on a regular basis for the average workingman have not been quick to Join in supporting this measure. I urge them to consider this material carefully. and to decide whether they wish to pursue policies which enhance Government power or. on the other hand. to support a proposal which permits hardworking Americans to keep more of the real fruits of their labor. The Wall Street Journal notes that. \"Had the tax schedules been tied to prices last year. on January 1 of this year tax brackets would have been adjusted upward across the board to reflect last years 14percent Increase in the Consumer Price Index. The effect would have been a tax reduction of about $15 billion. and a pure economic stimulant with such favorable supply and demand effects that Treasury might even come out ahead ay revenues. Instead. the administration and Congress dithered for months. before agreeing on a $22.A billion package of eonomia stimulation that has. aln st no desirable supply effects.\" It is high time that Congress turned its attention to the Cost of Living Adjustment Act.. legislation which would index taxes. deindex Government spending. and eliminate the vested interest Government now has in continuing inflationary pollcies. I wish to share with my colleagues an editorial on this Important subject which appeared in the Wall Street Journal of May 6. 1975. and insert it into the REcORD at this time: AexrnvSaaY O AN EDrrORTAL On. this- day one year ago we urged consideration of an idea that. with the benefit of hindsight. woud surely have helped prevent seine of the nation&amp; ctrrent economic traubles. had it beers impiemened: Deindexing the federal goveurnment We- return to. the theme. disappented that there has. been alMost no national diseussios of the. idea even though it seems foolproof. i.e.. neither politicians. academicians nor bureaucrats could botch it upp. The idea L9 simply to put the federal government on the same footing as the people during this inflationary era. doing so. by making annual and automatic adjustments in the personar incometax schedules. As it now stands. the federal government harvests an inflationary reward tlhrough the progressivity of the tax system. Consider: If prices double and real incomes remain the same. nominal incomes are doubled and all workers are- pushed into higher brackets. The governments revenues not. only keep up with inflation. but the government actually increases its claim on real resources. Had the tax schedules been tied to prices last year. on Januar5 I of this year tax brackets would have been. adjusted upward across the board to. reflect Ist years. 14% increase in the Consumer Price Index. The effect would have been a tax reduction of about $15 billion and a pure economic stimulant. with such favorable supply and demand effiects- that Tleasury might even come out ahead on revenues. Instead. the. administration. and Congress dithered for months before agreeing to $22S\" billion package of economic stimulation that has almost no desirable supply effects. Whats. more. because inflation is stll inexorably increasing the governments claims on real resources via thisprogressive tax trap. what stimulation there might be in the $=2z8 billion package is! probably being. offset. In a real sense. the tax om capital is still being increased daily bT pushing income from dividends. interest and capital gains up the tax schedules. and of course. it is even clearer that the tax on laborwages and salariesis similarly affected. If a systenm of taxschedule adjustment were enacted now._ the economy would benefit immediately even though no adjustment would be made to the schedule until Jan. 1 1976. The market would perceive that this fiscal drag had. been removed from the economy. that the government would no longer be able to expand claims over real resources through Inflation.. and investment would expand. Workers bargaining for wage. increases sufficient to both maintain real incomes and offiet- their rise- into higher tax brackets because of Inflation would no longer need worry about the. Itter. wage demans would be reduced accordingly. Despite those attractions. the idea is not seriousIr being advanced. by any. politician save James Buckey. Senator from New York.","Mr. President. I express deep appreciation to the Senator from New Hampshire. He has the ranking position on the Commerce Committee and has understanding and insight. From a practical standpoint he has Incisively gone to the heart of the problem. It would be a delusion to set up a commission or imply it will handle a tremendous problem like this. We will not argue who should be on the commission or how it should be made up. The bill provides for 13 members. 5 to be appointed by the President from private life. I do not imagine the President intends to appoint unemployed persons to that commission. They will be busy industrialists. or labor leader or academicians or consumer spokesmen. busy people who will jet into Washington for a commission meeting and return to their regular work. The bill provides that four members shall be from the executive branch. These are also four officials burdened down with other responsibilities. and every commission meeting will come out of the ordinary executive responsibilities they are carrying on now. I ask my distinguished colleague from California. who has had experience with the Senator from Illinois in serving on the board of directors of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts: How many times are we able to give undivided attentionhere it is. right in the city of Washingtonhow much time can we as U.S. Senators. representing the Senate on that board. give? The Senator from Illinois was not even able to go to the meeting the other day that involved the liability suit against members of the board of trustees. a half a million dollar suit against us. because the work of the Senate in other areas was more pressing. yet two Members of the House and two Members of the Senate will be given this responsibility. We are fortunate even to get them to a meeting. much less give any attention to a particular problem. Not one of us will be experienced in this field. We have people from business and Industry in the Senate and in the House. but I know. having been out of industry now for 8 or 10 years myself. that the Senator from Illinois is not intimately acquainted with materials problems. shortages. and the related nuances. We should address ourselves to one task on a shortterm basis and thus utilize the best talents of all the commission members. That task should be to decide the correct organizational structure and quickly recommend it to Congress.","Mr. President. I am today introducing legislation to fill a serious gap in current law. Although we 37732 CO] currently have strong Federal and State laws which control the movement of diseases and insects into this country and in interstate commerce. there is no Federal law to prohibit. regulate and restrict the importation or interstate movement of noxious weeds. My friends in the Weed Science Society of America estimate that weeds cost us $5 billion each year in this country. They point out that many of these weeds are introduced from other parts of the world. including the recent example of hydrilla in Florida and witchweed in the Carolinas. No one knows the exact number of weed species that populate the earth. However. it is estimated that there are more than 30.000 which are known to have wide distribution. About 1.800 of these cause serious annual losses to man. Most of our major cultivated crops are subject to infestation by as many as 200 species. Between 20 and 30 cause serious yield reduction in our crops. and must be controlled by cultivation and the use of chemicals each year. In addition to reducing crop yields and lowering the quality of crops and livestock. weeds are harmful to man in several other respects. They impair human health and reduce the efficiency of labor. Poisonous weeds infect nearly 2 million persons each year with skin poisoning or other skin irritations which cause an annual loss of 333.000 working days. Weeds harbor insect vectors of human. plant. and animal diseases and serve as a reservoir for diseaseproducing organisms. They also ruin lakes. ponds. waterways. parks. and other recreational areas. Of course. it is not possible to exterminate the harmful weeds which are already entrenched in this country. Farmers and others who are faced with weed problems will continue to be faced with the annual problem of controlling undesirable weeds. However. we can take positive action to prevent the introduction of new species of noxious weeds into the United States and the spread of these weeds among the several States. The bill I am introducing today has already been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman FREY. It would give the Secretary of Agriculture the needed legal authority to both control the importation and interstate transportation of noxious weeds and to enter into cooperative weed control programs with the States. individuals. and the Governments of Canada and Mexico. Under the legislation the Secretary would be authorized to designate as noxious weeds those weeds which are new to or not widely prevalent or distributed throughout the United States and which may be injurious to crops or other useful plants. livestock. or poultry as well as other interests of agriculture. including irrigation or navigation or public health. The act would authorize thu Secretary to promulgate quarantines and to issue regulations requiring inspection of products and articles moving in interstate commerce in such manner as he deems nec-","That is certainly correct. I appreciate the remarks of the distinguished Senator from North Carolina and the contribution that he has made to this debate. I certainly agree with him that passage of the bill could have an extremely adverse effect upon labor unions. that it could completely destroy or vitiate the seniority system of unions. that it could provide that unions must take into membership individuals that they do not want to take into the union. and that it could require employers to employ people contrary to the express provisions of the collective bargaining contract that has been reached between the employer and the union in armslength dealings. Not only could it destroy the seniority system of unions. it could also destroy the apprenticeship program of unions. Union apprenticeship programs would be drastically altered. Failure to comply with EEOC edicts would make it possible for unions to be denied representation status under the National Labor Relations Act. thus removing protections against raiding or displacement by a rival union. Moreover. an employer would no longer have any legal obligation to bargain with a union whose representation status has been canceled by the National Labor Relations Board. That would be a fine union. I have not had a single union man tell me that he favors this bill. not a single one. Yet it has been stated on the floor that organized labor is in favor of the bill. I have not had a single member of organized labor ask me to vote for the bill. In short. under S. 2515. the EEOC would be empowered to tell a worker and an employer which labor organizations were officially approved for membership and which were deemed unsuitable by the Federal authorities. In other words. the EEOC would be empowered to tell one that it is all right for him to join some unions. but not others. This. to my way of thinking. Mr. President. seriously jeopardizes the freedom of expression and .the freedom of association guaranteed by the first amendment to our Constitution. One real effect of S. 2515. therefore. would not be to promote equal employment opportunities for American workers. but to expose and punish persons and organizations who give countenance to views regarding freedom of expression and association which are inimical to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Here again is the everpresent and coercive threat of punitive action against those who do not give strict adherence to the social and political philosophies of those who wield power. Here. in the name of \"equal employment opportunity.\" it is demanded that we pass a law which would permit a Federal bureau to arrogate unto itself the power to examine. pass judgment. and extinguish the essential freedoms of expression and association. The Senate of the United States cannot afford to let the EEOC be a law unto itself regarding the most sacred and fundamental rights of the American people. Mr. President. if S. 2515 is enacted into law. we can add industrial relations directors and union business agents to the list of endangered species. What do we need industrial relations directors and union business agents for if the EEOC is going to tell us whom to employ. So they may well be classified with others of the endangered species that we hear of in the new environment. which so many people. including the junior Senator from Alabama. are so much interested in preserving. And to that list we might as well add academic freedom and States rights. Not even Jimmy the Greek would cite odds on the chances of their survival. One of the prime tenets of AngloSaxon jurisprudence is that a man is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. While the bill before us does not presume to go so far as to repeal this concept. it certainly subverts it. It arrogantly undermines and brushes aside the guaranteed and fundamental principles of due process and invokes a panoPly of represssive procedures as alien to justice as the rack and the thumbscrew. Under the bill. the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission would be given a \"judicial\" function. permitting it to order respondents to \"cease and desist\" from alleged unlawful employment practices with such orders subject to limited review in a U.S. court of appeals. What is government by cease and desist? Government by cease and desist is government according to the personhl convictions. inclinations. predilections. and precipitant notions of government bureaucrats rather than government by certain and uniform laws applying alike to all men and institutions in like situations. This being true. it is no wonder that Justice Jackson. in the wellknown Flag Salute case eloquently declared: The very purpose for a bill of rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of public controversy. -to place them beyond the reach of majorities and to officiaily establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. Ones right to life. liberty. and property. to free speech. a free press. freedom of worship and assembly. and other fundamental rights. may not be subm tted to vote. they depend on the outcome of no elections. Subsequently. Mr. President. Justice Jackson declared: If there is any fixed star in our national constellation. it is that no official. high or petty. can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics. nationalism. religion. or other matters of opinion. or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein. One of the real difficulties in connection with the type of authority being sought here is the attitude of the Commission and its staff. The Commissioners and the staff of the Equal Employment Commission are appointed because of a particular philosophical bentit is expected. however. that they are to be objective and impartial advocates of equal employment opportunity and to conciliate charges found to be supported by the facts adduced in their investigations. The Commission. however. has not been and is not now the impartial agency it was supposed to be and as charged to be by law. Instead. the Commission has been a rabid advocate of its own preconceived ideas of fair employment opportunity and has been spending much of its time assembling arguments in behalf of its obsession with obtaining from Congress the power to issue coercive orders. The Commission has degenerated into performing a private pressure job for cease and desist authority. The mingling of the functions of conciliation and compulsion in this agency would be tragic. The EEOC conciliator. in such instances. cannot. in any light. be viewed as a friendly counselor. but only as an incipient prosecutor. In other words. when he also possesses the power not only of prosecuting. but also of rendering an enforceable judgment. his persuasion takes on the immediate character of coercion. Yet. this ambitious bill would lodge in an unelected Federal agency the unfettered authority to act as investigator. prosecutor. judge. and juryall racked up in one powerladen package. S. 2515 does this by granting the Commission the power to receive complaints. granting to the Commission the power to investigate complaints. granting the Commission the power to prosecute complaints. and granting the Commission the power to pass judgment on complaints and to fashion a remedy enforceable by a cease and desist order. As if this were not bad enough. the bill also grants the Commission the power to be the complainant. It is proposed that a member of the Commission may file a complaint. and. although the Commismissioner filing the complaint may not participate in the hearing. he is not forbidden to sit in judgment on his own complaint. Mr. President. I am sure all will agree that the other members of the Commission would be less than human if they did not give special attention to complaints filed by one of their own members. It is difficult to see how this Commission. in rendering decisions on a complaint filed by one of its own members. could act objectively and in an unbiased manner. Remember. the member filing the complaint would be privy to all of the discussions leading up to the final decision of the Commission. and I say that it would be asking too much of human nature to expect his colleagues to embarrass him by dismissing a complaint which he had filed. One would have to be blind indeed not to see that this particular aspect of the bill overbalances the scales of justice against defendants in ways that do absolute violence to the best of AngloAmerican judicial traditions. It is true that appellate review of orders by the Commission is provided. But the fact that an employer or a labor union may be entitled to go to a U.S. court of appeals carries no assurance that he will get there. On the other hand. if a respondent is able to defray the expense of long. drawnout litigation. the restrictions and the limitations placed on the courts by the bill will make it almost impossible for the court to rectify a prejudicial order by the Commission. Let me point out. Mr. President. that the court entertaining the review would be limited by the record of the hearing examiner as reviewed by the Commission and would be required to affirm the Commission upon a finding of some evidence supporting the Commissions decision. And what would the record of the Commission consist of? Let us not forget that many of these charges of discriminatory employment practices will be made by persons who are motivated by revenue. cruelty. persecution. and perfidy. This is especially true inasmuch as S. 2515 removes the requirement that charges must be made under oath. In addition. the bill permits the Commission to deprive the accused of the customary and timehonored rules of evidence and procedure. Hearsay evidence with its inflammatory effect can easily be the entire basis of a finding by the Commission. What all of this boils down to is that this bill seeks the enormous power of \"cease and desist.\" and yet provides no safeguards against a possible arbitrary determination by the Commission. The Commission can. therefore. proceed to issue a complaint and institute a proceeding which could lead to the exercise of enforcement powers based on a tenuous claim of discrimination and the courts would be powerless to touch it. In other words. the bill makes an out and out mockery of our dedication to due process of law. This is not government by law. It is government by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. for better or worse. Mr. President. I turn to the most preposterous and repugnant feature of S. 2515. The bill seeks to vest in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission autocratic and despotic power over the internal administration of State and local governments. As a consequence. S. 2515 is completely incompatible with the constitutional doctrines of the sovereignty and indestructibility of the several States. Even apart from this consideration. S. 2515 is inimical to FederalState relations inasmuch as it would place in the hands of the Commission a legal club by which it can browbeat State and local officials into submission and thus assume outright control of the functions and power of State and local government in vital areas of our life. The proposal to substitute federally controlled employment practices for State and local personnel is in direct violation of the 10th amendment to the Constitution which states: The powers not delegated to the United States. nor prohibited to it by the States are reserved to the States respectively. or to the people. The proposal is also in direct violation of the ninth amendment to our Constitution which states: The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights. shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. I. of course. realize that many of the proponents of S. 2515 regard the ninth and 10th amendments to our Constitution as obsolete. or at best. treat them as mere truisms. I also realize that the rights guaranteed to the States and their people under the Constitution have been severely abused and invaded in recent years. But there is no provision in our Constitution which. by the wildest stretch of the imagination. can provide a legal cover for the extraordinary authority sought in this bill. If enacted. this bill would permit an agency of the Federal Government to enter the political field in the appointment of State and local government employees. It is true that many State and local job requirements are. in part. unrelated to the job. But it is wholly in keeping with our political traditions to give our State and local leaders. and our national leaders for that matter. the discretion to give reasonable weight to factors other than job fitness in filling jobs. Frankly. it is difficult to imagine a more intolerable interference by the Federal Government with the rights of the States than to dictate their employment practices. The States power over employment -practices is basic and essential to the very existence of State sovereignty and. consequently. to our federal system which was devised by our forefathers and which they intended to be held forever sacrosanct by the Bill of Rights. If we deprive the States of their basic functions. it is pointless to maintain that we have a dual form of government. History makes it crystal clear that the Constitution of the United States would never have been ratified by the requisite number of States if they had not been assured that it would subsequently be so amended as to embrace the principles and guarantees enunciated by the ninth and 10th amendments. Let us recall that in 1787 when the Constitution was written. the States were absolute sovereign. They had joined in the Declaration of Independence. They had fought through eight long. terrible and bloody years to wrest themselves from the British Crown. In essence. they stood independent and free from any other sovereignty on earth. This amendment. by the way. provides that powers not delegated to the United States nor prohibited by it to the States are reserved respectively to the States or to the people. people being synonymous with the States. The proposal is also a direct violation of the ninth amendment which reads: The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights. shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. There is no provision in our Constitution which. by the wildest stretch of the imagination. could provide a legal cover for the extraordinary authority sought in this bill. Therefore. when the representatives of the free. independent States met in Philadelphia to determine what form of government would succeed the tryranny of the British Crown. they had deep feelings about their State sovereignty and jealously guarded it and were determined to protect against any undue invasion. The delegates were not about to surrender any more than absolutely necessary of their sovereignty in their endeavor to form a national government and they were resolute in holding this to a minimum. The deliberations and the debates at the Convention and. of course. in the very drafting of the Constitution and its ratification by the several States make it abundantly clear that the Constitution would have never come into existence if the sovereignty of the States and the rights of the people had not been positively recognized in the Constitution itself. Yes. Mr. President. of all the liberties which the founders of our great Nation enshrined in the first 10 amendments they specifically designed the ninth and 10th amendments as the impregnable guardians of the sovereign rights of the States and of the people. They delegated to the Federal Government the powers necessary to enable it to discharge its limited functions as a central government and left to the States and to the people all other powers. It was the strong belief in the concept of government by the people that inspired Thomas Jefferson. author of the Declaration of Independence. to declare: The laws which must effect the happiness of the people must flow from their own habits. their own feelings and the resources of their own minds. In those few words. Mr. President. Thomas Jefferson expressed the thoughts and beliefs of the framers of our great Constitution. who knew that the States. with their State governments. their county governments. and their city governments. would ever be citadels of liberty. They knew that their concept of a government by the people demanded full recognition of the rights of the States. Nowhere is the doctrine of the separation of powers more eloquently described than by Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase in his opinion in Texas against White (7 Wall. 700) when he said: Not only. therefore. can there by no loss of separate and independent autonomy to the States through their union under the Constitution. but it may be not unreasonably said that the preservation of the States. and the maintenance of their governments. are as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the maintenance of the National Government. The Constitution. in all its provisions. looks to an indestructible Union. composed of indestructible States. Have these rights become any less meaningful to us today? Are the dangers of the exercise of arbitrary power by a centralized government any less? I say no. Senator William E. Borah. of Idaho. a giant among men. once wisely warned: When the people lose control of their Constitution. they have already lost control of their government. I wholeheartedly agree with Senator Borah when he added: It is an old story that when the people lose power. they lose liberty. The exercise of the powers sought under this bill would so tip the balance toward the Federal Government. particularly the executive branch. that the division of authority as envisioned by our Founding Fathers and as yet contained in our written Constitution would become pass6. The Constitution would no longer serve as a safeguard for the right of the people to govern themselves. Consent would no longer flow from them. Even Alexander Hamilton. who advocated and believed in a strong central government. would have been scandalized at the interposition of the Federal Government into State and local affairs as envisioned by the provisions of S. 2515. I submit that if one of the delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 had proposed that the Federal Government be empowered to interfere with the domestic policies and domestic institutions of State and local governments. he would have been laughed out of Independence Hall. Surely such a departure from a written Constitution that expressly assures the rights of the States is reason enough to sound the death knell for legislation which conceives such a recommendation. If we deprive the States of their basic functions. it is pointless to maintain that we have a constitutional Federal Government. When the Constitution of the United States was written in that hot. tiresome summer 185 years ago. provision was made for amending it. If our Constitution is to be amended in the drastic manner proposed by S. 2515. it should be done so in the orderly process provided for in the Constitution itself. by the people themselves. who hold title to that great document. The Senate has no right to amend the Constitution by legislative flat. We not only have no authority to do so. but we are betraying a trust to the people and an oath to ourselves when we attempt to do so. Any proposed changes in our Constitution should be submitted to the people in the form of constitutional amendments. and. as I have said. this magnificent document should not be changed except by the popular mandate of the people themselves. Giving to a Federal bureau the power to control and form the practices of State and local governments would. in the judgment of the junior Senator from Alabama. be. in effect. an amendment of the Constitution. because the Constitution does not envision any such power to be placed in the Federal Government or any bureau or agency thereof. George Washington stated the proposition eloquently in his Farewell Address when he said: If. in the opinion of the people. the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be. in any particular wrong. let it be corrected by an amendment. in the way in which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation. for though this. in one instance. may be the instrument of good. it is the customary weapon by which - free governments are destroyed. Mr. President. there may be those who think that the system of government that was devised in this country nearly two centuries ago is obsolescent. In answer to any such thinking. I should like to point out that one of the most baffling problems that faces contemporary democracies arises from the deadening effect of sprawling. impersonal. overcentralized governments. The bill would centralize in a bureau or any agency the control over the employment practices of every employer in the country who employs as many as eight persons. It would give to such bureau or agency power over the employment practices of every State. county. and city in the country. over every agency of every State. county. and agency. and over every educational institution in the country. be it a college. a university. a private school. a churchsupported school. or. for that matter. a secondary or an elementary school which would be included in the term \"educational institution.\" How does one keep democracy fresh. vivacious. and close to the hearts of the people in the face of the ponderous and monolithic machines of government? We have the answer. Mr. President. We have always had it. The federal system which was devised by our forefathers in the 18th century provides the brightest hope for the survival of real democracy and the rights of free men in the 20th century. If we tamper with the basic tenets of the system bequeathed us by our forefathers. if we trample upon this precious heritage. we will deserve the fate that will undoubtedly befall us. Mr. President. this Nation has become historys finest illustration of how people can enrich their lives. can raise their level of wellbeing. can fulfill the goals of their pursuit of happiness when they are given liberty. freedom. and the encouragement for initiative and incentive under a democratic system made possible by a blueprint of democracya written Constitution. I can find nothing in S. 2515 to merit the approbation of a free people. I say again that its. farreaching and drastic provisions will destroy and negate much more individual rights and liberties than they could possible protect. Far from securing the rights of our people. they particularly constitute a grave threat to the precious rights sought to be held forever sacrosanct in the Bill of Rights. They are. to be sure. an affront to the authors of the American Constitution and the idea of limited governmental authority they sought to safeguard. If this legislation ever becomes the law of the land. we will have placed our people and our free institutions on the threshold of a tragic era from which they may never recover. We will have moved one step nearer to complete control and regimentation of all aspects of our lives by a centralized and allpowerful Government in Washington. Let us not turn our backs on the magnificent heritage and the system of government of and by free men. the indestructible union of indestructible States that have come down to us at such great sacrifice. Mr. President. I urge the adoption of this amendment and the defeat of S.2515. Starting at 12:45 p.m.. there will be a period of 1 hour for argument of the cloture motion. The time will be equally divided. During that period I will conclude my remarks on the question of the amendment or the motion for -cloture. I yield the floor.","Mr. Speaker. the noted economist Milton Friedman has finally laid to rest the myth of wage and price controls in a very effective and concise manner. With the hope that the article will receive the serious consideration of all of my colleagues. I am pleased to insert It point: The Johnsun Administration tried wageprice guidelines. The guidelines failed and were abandoned. The British tried a wageprice board. It failed and has just been abolished. The Canadians tried voluntary wageprice controls. Their Prices and Incomes Commission recently announced the program was unworkable and would be abandoned Jan. 1. Yet. In the U.S.. the Committee for Economic Development. an influential organization of businessmen. issues a report recommending (though with some vigorous dissents) a wageprice board on British lines and voluntary wageprice controls on Canadian lines. Arthur F. Burns. chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. supports the recommendation for a wageprice board. The Council of Economic Advisers second \"inflation alert\" uses stronger adjectives than the first to describe price deveiopments. Mr. Nixon. In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers. tried mild jawboning. calling on labor and business to exercise restraint in the national interest. Surely. this must mean that the experience of the Johnson Administration. of Britain and of Canada Is the exception. that there are other examples of the successful use of incomes policy to slow inflation. Not at all. I do not know a single successful example and the current proponents of an incomes policy do not claim that they do. The refrain is rather. \"despite the limited success of these measures elsewhere. they offer promise.\"","Mr. Spealker. 6 months ago the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act was signed by the President. The safety features of the new law became effective on April 1. 1970. Following the tragedy at Farmington. W. Va.. which took the lives of 78 coal miners. the Nation demanded action to protect those who dig out the coal in Americas most hazardous occupation. A new public policy was given effect in the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act. It is tragic that this new act is not being enforced in a proper fashion by the Bureau of Mines. I have written the following letter to the President to underline serious deficiencies in the enforcement of the law: Hon. RICHARD My. NIXON. President o the United States. The White House. Washington. D.C. DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: Since the safety provisions of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act went into effect on April 1. more coal miners have been killed than during a comparable period last year. It is clear that these deaths are the result of a failure by the Bureau of Mines to enforce the law. I appeal to you as the Chief Executive. Sharing my concern for law and order. to see that the letter and the spirit of the law are enforced. I appeal to you to give positive meaning to your eloquent support of coal mine safety. in your special message to the Congress on March 4. 1969. when you so well stated: \"Acceptance of the possibility of death in the mines has become almost as much a part of the job as the tools and the tunnels. The time has come to replace this fatalism with hope by substituting action for words. Castrophes in the coal mines are not inevitable. They can be prevented. and they must be prevented.\" I appeal to you to erid the \"benign neglect\" which has apparently gripped those charged with enforcing the mine safety law. The coal miners of the nation are once again trapped by the system. as the goal of production outweighs protection. The one agency charged with protecting the public interest has lost its backbone. its will. and even brushes aside its express authority granted by Congress to protect those human beings who labor in the coal pits of the nation. Perhaps the most flagrant violation of the law which Congress passed and you signed on December 30. 1969. is the requirement for one spot inspection per week of coal mines with a history of hazardous conditions. This provision covers some 200 mines throughout the nation. but instead of 200 inspections per week since the safety provisions became effective. there have been an average of scarcely 20 per week. Coal miners have gone to\" their deaths in many uninspected mines. The record of Injuries is mounting. As a Representative of one of the largest coalproducing counties in the nation. I can report to you that the coal miners In myarea are angry. restless and bitter over this benign neglect. Their hopes werd raised after the Farmlngton disaster of November 20. 1968. when a shocked nation demanded that positive steps must be taken to protect those working in the mines. The Congress acted. and declared as national public policy that \"the first priority and concern of all in the coal mining industry must be the health and safety of its most precious resource--the miner.\" Please. Mr. President. dont let this dangerous situation get completely out of hand. The rumblings of revolt in the coal fields are real. Right now the coal industry is mounting heavy pressure to revise and weaken the law in order to put even greater emphasis on. production rather than protection. The Bureau of Mines has adopted a posture of complete neutrality. bending to the pressure for production instead of aggressively moving to enforce the law and protect the miners who have little voice. In this crisis. it is my feeling that only the President of the United States can effectively step in and insist that the law be enforced for the protection of the coal miners of the nation. When you signed the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act on December 30. 1969..\"you stated: \"It represents a crucially needed step forward in the protection of Americas coal miners.\" Nearly 150.000 coal miners throughout the nation eagerly await your decision.

The infancy and adolescence of the United Nations have produced neither the unqualified successes foreseen by its champions nor the international doom which critics prophesied. Like all humans and all human institutions the United Nations has proved to be imperfect in practice. But the failures of the United Nations simply mirror the human conditionwhich is imperfection. The U.N.s accomplishments should provide all with real hope and restrained confidenoe. its failures should not plunge us into total despair. In this very Chamber almost a half century ago. the death knell was sounded for the League of Nations. The League of Nationsthe spiritual ancestor of the United Nationswas sapped of its vitality and its effectiveness through the refusal of the United States to join. Although I disagree with the judgment of our predecessors on that vote. I must admire their frankness and resolution. They met the issue squarely and voted on it. Will this same Senate be the pallbearer for \"that last best hope of mankind\"the United Nations? Will we. by our chronic apathy. offer the requiem for the U.N.-not with the forthrightness of a record vote. but rather by the cruel silence of indifference? The choices available today are not between a total war of which we cannot conceive or the total peace which we cannot achieve. Our national choicein a world fraught with grave perils and great possibilitiesmust be to fortify our institutions of peace and to dismantle the structures of hostility. This Senate has before it four conventions on human rights. They are not confusing or complex documents. They deal with forced labor. slavery. the political rights of women. and genocide. The Senate can and should take a major step right now toward endorsing the United Nations by ratifying these four conventions. The United States needs the United Nations and the United Nations needs the United States. I see no better way for: the Senate to affirm this support and this mutual need than by immediate ratification of the human rights conventions on genocide. forced labor. slavery. and political rights of women.","That was done because here. in a real sense. there is the partnership between the employer and the employee. and we are helping the partnership to operate by being fair to the employee in connection with tips. I shall read from the report: The -bills tip provisions provide enough .flexibility to account for a practice as Inconsistent as tipping. I shall read further: It should also be noted that at present \"wages\" include the reasonable cost of board. lodging. and other facilities customarily provided by the employer to his employees. As the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Texas well know. in the resorttype hotels in what were once remote mountainous areas. and even perhaps along the shoreline in New England. a considerable number of the employees stay on the property. This is not tiue of a city hotel. because the employees live in their own apartments or .houses. Sowe have included this provision. which helps with reasonable allowances for the lodging and food furnished by the hotel. In committee. the Senator from Vermont also was conscious of this problem as it affected his State. as were other Senators. I feel that as to the amendment which I offered. and which was accepted. providing an increase in tip credit from 45 percent to 50 percent. and considering the reasonableness of an allowance for lodging and food being included as wages. the committee has been eminently fair. I wish to say this to the Senator from Virginia. who has his amendment on the floor of the Senate for consideration.","Mr. President. I regret very much what took place in Wisconsin. Minnesota. and other areas of the country. But at the same time I cannot help remembering that there was another quite serious flood in that area of the country several years ago. The Appropriations Subcommittee on Public Works took up the question of providing. not relief. but ways and means to prevent such floods. We asked the Corps of Engineers to survey the problem to find exactly what would be required. The local people were at first very cooperative. Then the sun came back out. and for some reason the local interest died away. The assurances of local cooperation were withdrawn. Mr. President. I would like to insert at this point in the RECORD a memorandum on what was experienced in regard to projects on the Minnesota River at Mankato and North Mankato. It points out clearly that if the corps had been able to proceed with its work. we would not now have to be faced with a request to liberalize the Federal Governments policies with respect to emergency and disaster aid.","Mr. Speaker. the time has come for us to again vote our conscience in the cause of civil rights. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee will explain the major amendments adopted by the Senate. I approve them. Five months ago. the House debated the civil rights bill for 10 days. and passed the bill by a vote of 290 to 130. The bill was then comprehensive in scope yet moderate in application. subject to effective judicial and administrative safeguards. The bill returns to the House. from whence it came. comprehensive in scope. with the individual States clothed with more authority and responsibility in the enforcement of the legislation. than when it left the House. In short. the bill comes back to the House tempered to and softened by the sober judgment of the Members of the other body. yes. even by the wishes of the people. Much inaccurate information has been circulated about the legislation both as it left the House and as it is now before the House. In view thereof. I wish to negate only a few of the most glaring inaccuracies that have had such wide dissemination. First. The bill now before the House does not permit the Federal Government to tell a bank. savings and loan company. or other such financial institution to whom it may or may not make a loan. . Second. The bill does not permit the Federal Government to tell any home or apartment owner or real estate operator to whom he must sell. rent. lease. or otherwise use his real estate. Third. The bill does not permit the Federal Government to interfere with the daytoday operations of a business or labor organization. Fourth. The bill does not permit the Federal Government to require an employer or union to hire or accept for membership a quota of persons from any particular minority group. Fifth. The bill does not permit the Federal Government to destroy the job seniority rights of either union or nonunion employees. Sixth. The bill does not permit the Federal Government to interfere with a farmers operation of his farm. Seventh. The bill does not permit the Federal Government to impose minority quotas upon farmhands or tenants. Eighth. The bill does not permit the Federal Government to interfere with membership in farm organizations. Ninth. The bill does not permit the Federal Government to deny or interfere with an individuals rights to receive social security or veterans benefits. Tenth. The bill neither authorizes nor permits the Federal Government to interfere in a States right to fix voter qualifications. Eleventh. The bill does not permit the Federal Government to interfere with or destroy the private property rights of individual businessmen.","Mr. President. last week. when an increase in interest rates was viewed as the most likely means the administration would take to curb the outflow of American dollars. I urged several alternatives which I believe should be tried before interest rates are increased. Obviously. the administration had no intention of trying anything else first. As is usually the case with those in the moneylending business and those in charge of moneylending regulations. raising interest rates is considered a desirable end in itself. Regardless of what party controls the machinery of government. interest rates will be raised for any reason that can be made to sound plausible. I would have the American people mark it down that the increase in interest rates is one more cost that they must add to the foreignaid program. I say that because we could have avoided higher interest rates if we had been willing to reduce our outflow of dollars by cutting foreign aid. But. again. no matter what party controls the reins of government. foreign aid is \"the sacred cow\" that roams where it pleases. roughshod. costing the American people around $4 billion a year. and now costing us an untold amount in higher interest rates. Mr. President. I wish to say that the interestrate increase which the Kennedy administration has approved amounts to an additional tax on the American taxpayers. At the same time the administration is talking about reducing taxes. The administration cannot have this one both ways. In my judgment. this is an economic sleightofhand performance that is not to the credit of the Kennedy administration. and I deeply regret the economic course of action announced today by the President of the United States. Frankly. I am not impressed with the recital. in the Presidents message. of how well things are going in Western Europe. All the President is really telling us is that our financial relationships with Western Europe are not getting worse. The President says we will honor our obligations to carry a fair share of the defense and the development of the free world. But he does not say what Western Europe is going to do in order to carry a fair share. The time has come for the President to give us a blueprint. a specific agreement. item by item. as to what our NATO allies are willing to do. before the President underwrites an additional tax on the American people by way of an interest rate increase. The Presidents message in that respect is more significant in what it does not state than in what it does state. It does not state that our European partners will fill the ranks of NATO so that American boys can come home. It does not state that France will add a single soldier to the NATO line. We all know the dereliction of France in walking out on its obligations in respect to NATO. time and time again flaunting us. with De Gaulle making perfectly clear in a thumbtothenose attitude that he has no intention of filling those ranks with French boys. Rather than raising interest rates. we ought to bring thousands of American boys home out of Europe. That would help our balanceofpayments problems much better than continuing to surrender economically to our NATO allies. which. in my judgment. have welched on us in respect to their clear NATO obligations. Nor does the Presidents message state when the other wealthier members of NATO are going to help us furnish military aid to the poorer members. What about Turkey or Greece? I ask Great Britain. France. West Germany. Italy. and the rest of the nations. \"When are you going to contribute to the millions of dollars of American economic aid to Greece and Turkey? Are they not important to your defense? If they are. the time has come for you to contribute so that we shall not have to contribute so much. and so that we will not be required to go through the great economic mistake which the President has underwritten today by way of increased interest rates.\" The Presidents message does not state that Britain and France will send troops and financial aid to South Vietnam and relieve us of some of that burden. almost all of which the American taxpayer is now paying. It does not put a number on the defense forces that will be brought home. or tell us what foreign aid programs and missions will be curtailed or eliminated. The Presidents message contains no specific blueprint in regard to the savings that will be made. The American taxpayers are crying aloud in asking this administration for such a blueprint before we have imposed upon the American people an indirect tax by way of increased interest rates. The message tells us that our net outlay for defense abroadexclusive of foreign aid. of coursehas declined from $2.7 billion in 1960 to $1.9 billion in 1962. But the most that is promised by way of future reduction is perhaps $500 million more by 1966. That is not good enough. When any administration tries to correct the situation with an increase in interest rates. it owes it to the American people to show concrete reductions in oversea outlays first. There is an American expenditure running into hundreds of millions of dollars which is not carried in the foreign aid bill. For that reason this morning in the Foreign Relations Committee a group of us made an official request that the staff of the Foreign Relations Committee prepare a memorandum for us containing every expenditure of every American dollar under every program to which we are now committed abroad. That includes figures on the cost of maintaining the American forces in Europe. the American forces in South Vietnam. and American forces anywhere else in the world. for the foreign aid bill does not contain such figures. Many people. looking at the foreign aid bill. make the mistake of thinking that $4.5 billion is the total cost. It is not. The total is hundreds of millions of dollars beyond $4.5 billion. Mr. President. as one member of the Committee on Foreign Relations. I will insist that the total figure of foreign expenditures that the American taxpayer must pay be made a matter of public information. for it is the business of the public. I desire every voter in our country to know now. so he can make up his mind what his position will be at the ballot booths. and whether he wishes to approve a program of such great extravagant expenditures that characterizes American foreign policy expenditures at the present time. Mr. President. cutting foreign aid and retrenching our military forces overseas are not the only steps we should have taken before we raised interest rates. We should have restricted foreign borrowings in the United States. and even the outflow of investment capital from the United States. The President is wrong in singling out capital as the one inviolate. untouchable element in our international dealings. The tap on the wrist he proposes by way of any interest equalization tax on foreign borrowings here in the United States indicates that he does not mean that all capital is inviolateonly the investment Americans wish to make abroad. I point out to the administration that if we can curb foreign borrowings here. we can curb American investments abroad. We are urging Latin American governments to do exactly that. We do not expect them to raise their domestic interest rates as a means of doing so either. because their domestic interest rates are already astronomical. One of the things we have been urging on Latin American countries in connection with the Alliance for Progress program was to have them take the necessary steps to stop the flight of capital out of Latin America into New York. into Swiss banks. and into investments abroad. We have been saying that they ought to invest in their own economic future. They ought to stop the flight of capital. I happen to take the point of view that what is good enough for Latin America in that respect ought to be good enough for the United States. American companies have some obligations. too. in regard to keeping a healthy economy at home. In any event. both curbs should have been imposed before interest rates were raised. I do not believe that there is any right to investment abroad which takes precedence over the responsibility of the U.S. Government to insure full employment and a healthy economy at home. When we talk about the subject of investments abroad. I suggest that we not forget that we are dealing with American jobs at home. I happen to believe that. in view of the extravagant expenditure of the largess of the people of this country under a foreign aid bill. the time has come that the bill should be drastically cut down. We ought to come to grips with some of these economic problems which in my view were evaded in the Presidents message today. I also desire to say that. as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. I have been sitting through some of the markup sessions of the committee. The blizzard is on. The snowstorm is upon us. A coverup job is being attempted. But as far as the senior Senator from Oregon is concerned. there is no hurry in the consideration of the foreign aid bill. To the contrary. I am for considering it step by step. item by item. and rollcall by rollcall in the Foreign Relations Committee. I intend to give my respected colleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee an opportunity to go on record time and time again. by one rollcall after another. session after session. That is why I announced earlier today that I shall object to any meeting of the Committee on Foreign Relations when the Senate is in session. because I intend to devote my time and attention to the foreign aid bill. and I cannot be in two places at once. The first responsibility I owe to the people of my State is to be on the floor of the Senate. When the Senate is in session I shall be here. When it is not in session I shall be glad to attend meetings of the Committee on Foreign Relations for a slow. steady. thorough. persistent markup of the foreign aid bill. Moreover. I think it is also regrettable that. while Secretary Dillon called for a tax cut to be coupled with the rise in interest rates. the move on interest rates did not wait for the tax cut. They have the cart before the horse again. In my judgment the Congress should have taken action on the tax cut first and then given whatever consideration it might merit to the interest rate issue.","Mr. Speaker. there has been considerable debate today on H.R. 10650. the tax revision bill. The proposed 20percent withholding tax on dividends and interest income provision is among the most controversial and. in my opinion. most objectionable features of this bill. If adopted. this provision would impose unnecessary hardships on both the savings institutions and the investors and savers. Yesterday. I received a very thoughtful letter on this subject. which presents an excellent analysis of the objections to the proposal. It was written by a bank official in my district. Charles H. Randall. Jr.. trust officer of the Plymouth National Bank of Plymouth. Mass. I commend this letter to the attention and consideration of my colleagues. PLYMOUrH. MASS.. March 26. 1962. The Honorable HASTINGS KEITH. House Offce Building Washington. D.C. My DEAR Mn. KEITH: I am writing to urge you strongly to vote against the proposed withholding tax on dividends and interest. iy objections are twofold: the resulting hardship on the small depositor and investor. the resulting hardship on the banks and the corporations. There are millions of persons who have little or no real knowledge of the intricacies of the present complicated Federal income tax laws. In spite of complete publicity many will never recover withheld taxes. There are the elderly people who have no net taxable income and will never be required to file an income tax return who will suddenly be confronted with the perplexing problem of filing exemption certificates or filing tax returns that are in effect claims for refund of taxes withheld. Likewise. there are the parents who have started savings accounts or purchased a few securities for their minor children. The children who have no taxable income will be forced to file tax returns or exemption certificates. Even if exemption certificates may be filed by minors. corporations and banks will be responsible for elimination of exemption as minors come of age. The burdens which fall upon the banks and corporations will be even more onerous. First. they will lose goodwill. Just. as labor now regards \"take home\" pay as their true earnings. stockholders and depositors will come to regard their net dividends andinterest as their true earnings on investments and savings. The banks will be blamed by .depositors for their failure to provide greater income. Much Ill will as well as ususpicion will be created as banks are required to withhold from owners of U.S. market securities a portion of each interest coupon presented for deposit or cash. Secondly. corporations and banks will be subjected to greatly increased costs. I am particularly aware of the problems which will be created for the corporate trustee. They will be more pronounced for the less experienced individual trustee. Trustees will have toestablish new systems of accounting in order to account for the true income of beneficiaries. If securities are held in a nominee account in which some taxpayers have filed exemption certificates and others have not it will be impossible to separate income and allot it to the proper account without double records and much additional clerical help. Trustees fees based upon income will have to be adjusted and this is not possible under legislation in some States. Withholding of the tax on dividends and interest will result in the filing of millions of additional returns. there will be more erroneous returns filed because of the complexity of \"grossing up\" true income. there will be many more refund payments. The result will be a greatly increased expense to the Government in administration of the tax law. The Government now has the information necessary to collect these taxes without withholding. For years every corporation A2451 has supplied the Treasury Department with a detailed report on the payment of dividends. All interest payments of $600 or more have also been reported. With the electronic equipment which the Treasury plans to install. the Treasury will be able to check against individual returns or the lack of such returns without placing upon private industry the uncompensated burden of collecting taxes. I feel that it is in the best interest of our country that this proposed legislation be defeated. and I ask your best efforts in achieving this result. Very truly yours.","Mr. Speaker. some persons have been telling lies to a number of ministers of the gospel and their parishioners in Iowa. I suspect the lie originated with opponents to Federal aid to education. with perhaps an assist from unscrupulous political workers of the same type who were responsible for spreading the literature of hate which we saw during last falls election. Mr. Speaker. as the chairman of the general Subcommittee on Education. I have been the target of a barrage of mail urging defeat of H.R. 4970. on the grounds that it makes provision for Federal support for private elementary and secondary schools. The letters quite plainly equate H.R. 4970 with the latter proposition. Some refer to President Kennedys campaign pledge to respect our laws regarding separation of church and state. and imply lack of faith by him. Most of the letters are from Iowa. I have heard from ministers as well as others. It is quite clear to me that a deliberate misrepresentation has been made to these good people. It is quite possible that a few people could confuse H.R. 4970 with other proposals providing financial help to private schools. But when I receive so many letters based upon a completely false assumption. I can only conclude that the instigation was deliberate. Let me set the record straight. The bill H.R. 4970. Is a public school bill only. It was introduced by our colleague. the gentleman from New Jersey . It embodies the recommendations of President John F. Kennedy. When President Kennedy sent his education message to the Congress. he stressed that the program was aimed at supporting public elementary and secondary schools only. The position of the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church is in sharp disagreement with that of the President. For this reason it has been facetiously remarked that \"John Kennedy is the best Baptist President since Harry Truman.\" Mr. Speaker. the Congress may or may not authorize a broad program of grants or loans to private schools. It may or may not do this by amending the Presidents program. or by a separate bill. That remains to be seen. With or without a socalled parochial school amendment. some people are opposed to Federal aid to education. Many others. including the President. are in favor of aid to public schools only. But let the record be clear. H.R. 4970 is a public school bill. I trust this will allay the fears of so many good people in Iowa to whom. I believe. a deliberate misrepresentation has been made.","Mr. President. I should like. however. to read a few words from this work I have quoted to detail my charges that this is a political group working for candidates and issues at the Federal level and spending money for the same. of which I am unable to find any record in the office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives. When Mr. Childers interviewed Mr. Taylor. of the ADA. Mr. Childers asked Mr. Taylor if a statement I had made was correct when I said the ADA receives 35 percent of its money from the UAW. Mr. Taylor saidAnd I am reading from the statement I have placed in the REcoRDthat this was not true as ADA actually receives \"slightly less\" than 35 percent of Its total moneys from the UAW. He then stated that I must remember that ADA got support from \"many unions\" other than the UAW. He admitted that labor unions contributed most of ADAs total funds. What I read next is interesting because it points out what these funds are used for. I quote again from the statement: Next. I asked exactly what ADA does with these funds it receives. I was told that ADA tries to influence the outcome of as many elections as it can. Men and women are sent to States. towns. and cities to support candidates favorable to ADA policy. If no favorable candidates exist. as much influence as is possible is exercised on the unfavorable candidates. One other thing that I think would be of interest to my colleague is another part of this summary. when Mr. Childers asked Mr. Taylor another question: I asked Mr. Taylor if he would favor a plan to confiscate all the money and private property in the country. line up all the citizens in a row. and give each man a proportional share. The answer was one word\"Yes.\" I was amazed. Mr. President. I have read these excerpts from the report I have included in my remarks to point out that here is a political group that does not come under the reporting requirements of the recently passed clean elections bill. and this is only one of a number of organizations that I could name which receive money from labor unions that participate in politics.","Mr. Speaker. there appeare4 in Newsweek magazine of April 13. 1959. a most lucid and comprehensive analysis of the diversity in expert opinion today on the questions of economic growth and price 9tability. The authors of this timely and informative article are Editors Sandford Brown and Hobart Rowen. of the magazine. I believe it will be of great interest to Members on both sides of the aisle. Under leave to extend my remarks. I therefore offer the article for inclusion in the RECORD: Unwatched- by TV or tabloids. devoid of Inflammatory words or fifth amendment thugs. a congressional committee this week began an investigation whose enormous scope transcends by far its lack of dramatics. The subject before the Joint Economic Committee was nothing less than the whole future of the U.S. economy and everything that leans on it. And that future could be boiled down to a single issue. As Senator PAUL DoUGLAs. Illinois Democrat and committee chairman. defined it: \"The central problem of our times is how to combine price stability and growth.\" The answers to that problemwhich undoubtedly will be based on political as well as economic beliefswill determine how much the Government spends in the future for what. and how much it collects in taxes from whom. In short. the answers will affect every person in the country.The drytalking. charttoting economists called by the committee to give advice on the problem were stepping into a redhot debate tlat has been raging for months wherever a businessman. labor leader. politician (or. for that matter. an economist) pushed back his chair and rose to make an afterdinner speech. One one side are those whose main worry. is economic lassitudethe fear that the economy may be growing too slowly to meet the demands upon it. On the other side are those whose principal anxiety is economic explosionthe combustible inflationary forces that might be ignited by too rapid growth. The problem of growth vs. inflation is hardly a new one. In fact. it is as old as the economy itself. Whats more. the state of the economy at the moment seems caculated to soothe anxieties on both sides of the great debate. The Nations total output of goods and services was still rising fast (up 2.4 percent in the first quarter over the fourth quarter of last year). personal income. retail sales. industrial production were all hitting new peas. At the same time. the Consumer Price I~ndex stands at 123.7 percent of the 194749 average. exactly where it stood when the recovery surge started. Why. then. a great debate at this time?","Mr. Speaker. it is most gratifying for me to make note of the Presidents interest in the United States Department of Agricultures watershed control and floodprevention program. which is authorized by Public Law 566. 83d Congress. Until recently. the budget request for this program for fiscal year 1959 was only $14 million in comparison to the $25 million appropriated by the Congress last year. In a special message to the Congress. the President. on March 12. requested an additional $14.780.000 to carry on the very effective work of this program which is beneficial to many sections of the country where huge floodcontrol dams and reservoirs are not warranted. In my own State of Massachusetts. which has been plagued by periodic devastating floodsthe most recent in August of 1955many foresighted people see in Public Law 566 a suitable answer to floodprevention problems for many communities where. for one reason or other. larger dams and projects are not legally authorized and where smaller projects would be practicable. In fact. Massachusetts now has six watershed control projects approved by the Department of Agriculture. one of which is in a deferred status. Nearly $200.000 has been channeled to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by the Agriculture Department for watershed surveys and plans since the program was authorized in 1954. It will be recalled that Public Law 566. 83d Congress. authorized the United States Department of Agriculture to inaugurate certain limited programs to prevent floods and protect watersheds through the building of small check dams. channel clearance. terracing. soilconservation practices. and planning. The program appears to be particularly suitable for smaller areas and is not competitive with the projects of the Army Engineers. Funds are furnished for this work to local communities and groups on a matching basis for the soil restoration and conservation phase of the program. The 84th Congress liberalized the program to some considerable extent by authorizing 100 percent Federal contributions for the floodprevention aspects of Public Law 566 projects. The objective of the watershed control program is to reduce the peak flow of floods. cut down on the flow of silt. debris. and rubbish. halt soil erosion. build up moisture in the subsoil of farms. and keep wells from going dry. Considerable progress has been made in my State on Public Law 566 watershed surveys. So that my colleagues in the House may have some indication of the progress we have made in Massachusetts on Public Law 566 projects. I would like to discuss each individual project and its objectives of trying to cope with the water and soil problems of the watershed area in which it is located. The Town River watershed project was the first to be approved for Massachusetts by the Department of Agriculture. This action was taken on September 9. 1955. after initial surveys had been made and State approval obtained on Aug Lst 26. 1955. The project has been channeled to USDA through the soil conservation districts of Plymouth. Bristol. and Norfolk Counties. The Town River. a tributary of the Taunton River. is located near Brockton. and the watershed area comprises some 34.560 acres of land with about 100 farms in the area. The bottom land is mainly level while the upland areas are gently rolling. The bottom land is subject to periodic and rather frequent flooding. with much of the flood damage usually resulting from the spring thaws. Watershed surveys show there is a slight amount of erosion on the upland areas. As a result of intensive cultivation some sediment accumulations have resulted in the stream channel and a considerable acreage in the flood plain. once in cultivation. has now been abandoned due to inadequate stream channel and the need for drainage outlets. Preliminary surveys indicate that land treatment measures are needed in the watershed as well as channel improvement and enlargement. The Public Law 566 project for the Town River contemplates channel enlargement and the reduction in height of one dam on the channel as an improved outlet for drainage of the flood plain. The second USDA project for Massachusetts deals with the Sudbury. Assabet. and Concord Rivers watershed. It is better known as the Suasco project. The soil conservation districts of northeastern Worcester County and Middleeex County forwarded the application to the Department of Agriculture on August 3. 1955. and it was approved by the Department on November 17. 1955. after State concurrence had been granted on September 13. 1955. These streams are tributaries of the Merrimac and are located near the towns of Framingham. Concord. Maynard. and Hudson. There are about 243.200 acres in the watershed area and approximately 2.885 farms involved. The area is densely populated and includes parts of 34 communities with a population in excess of 400.000. Some floods result from intense local rainfall during the summer on the smaller streams. Major flood damage results from prolonged rains and the melting of ice and snow in the spring. More than $5 million worth of damage was caused to the area by the 1955 flood. After the 1955 flood. surveys showed many of the reservoirs previously used for water supply purposes and control works were in need of extensive repair. Silt bars hampered the flow of water in the main channels and several small dams were completely filled with silt. The Public Law 566 project for the Suasco watershed contemplates channel improvement and waterretarding structures in the upper reservoirs to regulate flow. Groups and communities in the area have expressed interest in multipurpose structures for floodwater retention and municipal water supply. Local interests have expressed interest in pollutionabatement programs and the recreational aspects of the watershed project. The third project for Massachusetts deals with the Baiting Brook watershed near Framingham. This stream is a tributary of the Sudbury River. which flows into the Merrimack. and is a subwatershed of the Suasco area just previously mentioned. Project sponsor is the Middlesex County soil conservation district. USDA approval of the project was made on January 8. 1957. after State concurrence on December 10. 1956. Baiting Brook has flooding and watercontrol problems and the project contemplates flood prevention by land treatment and structures. conservation. development. utilization. and disposal of water as well as the elimination of stream pollution. The Monatiquot River near Quincy is another watershed project approved for Massachusetts. the fifth such project to be authorized for the State by the Department of Agriculture. The Norfolk soil conservation district is sponsor of the project. which was just recently approved for planning by the Agriculture Department. The Monatiquot is a tributary of the Weymouth Fore River. The watershed with an area of approximately 12 square miles has been plagued by floods on many occasions and there has been extensive damage in the area. In 1955. it is estimated about $300.000 damage was done to property and industry. Railroad property was damaged and highway bridges were washed away. Watershed control measures contemplate the planting of trees in the Braintree highlands. floodwater retarding structures and channel improvement works. The sixth Massachusetts project deals with Smelt Brook. a tributary of the Fore River. near Weymouth. The sponsor is the Norfolk County soil conservation district. The project was just recently authorized for planning by the Agriculture Department. Here also we find periodic damage to property. delays. and inconvenience to traffic and interference with business activity from the flooding of a portion of the East BraintreeWeymouth Landing business district as a result of stormwater runoff from the Smelt Brook drainage area. Inadequate channel capacities. inadequate culverts and stormwater inlets aggravate the flood problem in this area. The project contemplates study of the feasibility of an earth or masonry dam at the outlet of Pond Meadows to serve as a storage reservoir for the drainage area and the installation of culverts in the vicinity of the New Haven Railroad. under the Washington Street business district at Weymouth Landing. and also above Stetson Street. I have not touched upon the fourth approved project for Massachusetts until now because this project. dealing with the upper Blackstone watershed. has been placed in a deferred status by the Department of Agriculture. This action was taken. I am told by Department officials. because \"the State Conservationist and the local people agreed on November 14. 1957. there is no critical need for a watershed project at this time.\" The sponsors are the soil conservation districts of southern Worcester County. northeast Worcester County. Middlesex County and Norfolk County. When the Agriculture Department approved the upper Blackstone project for initial surveys. it took into account the historic watershed problems of the area. which include periodic flooding. lack of water control and the maintenance of a uniform flow. The watershed area embraces 205.400 acres with a population in excess of 260.000 people. In October and November of 1955. I held extended discussions with Dr. Benjamin Isgur. who is now the USDA State conservationist for Massachusetts. about the desirability of instituting some Public Law 566 projects in area. hit by the 1955 floods. The Blackstone Basin appeared to be ideally suited for watershed survey since the West Hill Dam and Reservoir and the Worcester diversion tunnel. the two major Army Engineer flood control projects. were then in the early planning stages. Congress has since provided the necessary funds to begin construction of the Worcester diversion project and complete the preconstruction planning of West Hill this year. However. it must be emphasized that these two projects. once completed. do not provide a solution to the water problem of the Blackstone south of Worcester to Uxbridge. The Worcester diversion tunnel will provide protection for the Webster Square area of Worcester by diverting water from the Leesville Pond through a bypass tunnel. West Hill project is planned on the West River just below the NorthbridgeUxbridge town line in order to provide flood protection on downstream points along the Blackstone. The Blackstone area between Uxbridge and Worcester has been of deep concern to me. Several times I have made known to Brig. Gen. A. K. Sibley. the New England division engineer. and his predecessor. Brig. Gen. Robert J. Fleming. the apprehension of residents along the Blackstone in this area and my own apprehension about the possible increased flow of the Blackstone once the Worcester diversion project has been completed. . Last September. General Sibley wrote me in part as follows: \"Studies which have been completed for this project substantiate previous conclusions that the diversion project will not have any measurable effect on either Millbury or downstream communities. The project. which shortens the distance from 7 miles of river through Worcester to about 3 miles of tunnel and channel. diverts the flood waters from Kettle Brook directly to the Blackstone River in Millbury. The same amount of water will flow in the river at Millbury. with or without the diversion. and any change in the pattern of flow will have negligible effect on flood stages.\" General Sibley pointed out that the initial design of the diversionary works included large manually controlled gates. This objectionable feature has been eliminated from the project. Dr. Isgur. the State conservationist. in November of last year wrote me that further planning for the upper Blackstone watershed was being deferred. He said: After a conference with the upper Blackstone River Watershed Association. it had been mutually agreed that it would be unwise to plan the watershed under Public Law 566 assistance at this time. The Army Corps of Engineers. the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. and the city of Worcester are in the process of making studies and plans in the watershed area. We will wait until definite recommendations are made by these various groups and then make a decision as to whether or not to request approval of the watershed as a Public Law 566 project. Dr. Isgur has been most cooperative and helpful in making available to interested groups the full facilities of his staff to discuss water and related problems. It is largely through his help that initial study of the Blackstone has been made in cooperation with the soil conservation districts of southern and northeast Worcester County. Middlesex County. and Norfolk County. From this survey there came the creation of the Upper Blackstone Watershed Association which is continuing to devote full consideration to the water problems of the area. I hope that at an early date this fine group will go forward with further planning of the watershed because there is no question that such planning looks toward adequate solutions of the problems of land treatment and conservation development utilization. spheres of activity which are outside the scope of any flood prevention plans of the Commonwealth or the Army Engineers. I have every expectation that the Department of Agriculture will approve the seventh watershedcontrol project for Massachusetts in the very near future. This is the project sponsored by the Quaboag Watershed Association to deal with soilreclamation and floodprevention work along the Quaboag River in the western part of my District. Communities involved are Spencer. North Brookfield. East Brookfield. Brookfield. West Brookfield. Oakham. New Braintree. Warren. Rutland. Sturbridge. Paxton. Leicester. Charlton. and Palmer. In recent talks with Agriculture officials I was given assurances that the Quaboag project would receive early approval so that detailed planning of the watershed area could go forward. The Quaboag watershed appears to be. Ideally suited for this type of floodprevention program since the Army Engineers do not contemplate the construction of the West Brookfield Reservoir on the Quaboag River. a project authorized by the Congress in the Flood Control Acts of 1936 and 1938. The Engineers classify West Brookfield as inactive due to a lack of economic justification. In addition. the Engineers have been unable to approve a $50.000 local protection project at West Brookfield under Public Law 685. the McCormackBush Act. In this respect. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a report I received last September from Brig. Gen. A. K. Sibley. the New England division engineer. on the West Brookfield Public Law 685 project. with the text of my reply.","Mr. President. on behalf of myself and the Senator from Montana I Mr. MANSFIELD]. I introduce for appropriate reference. a bill to permit weekly newspapers to suspend publication for 2 weeks a year without loss of secondclass mailing privileges. This bill is identical to the one introduced in the last Congress by the very able Senator from Montana. and I am pleased that he has agreed to join me in cosponsoring this measure today. The rural areas of Montana have much in common with the rural areas of my own State of Colorado. Both are dotted by many small communities which are served by small weekly newspapers. Often these newspapers are only a I- or 2man shop. In most cases these small publishers are literally chained to their jobs. because Federal regulations governing secondclass mailing privileges. plus State laws relating to legal advertising. require that they continue publishing week after week. continuously and without interruption. These publishers do not have the trained personnel to permit them to rotate their employees so that they can enjoy an annual 1- or 2week vacation. Mr. President. the proposed legislation which the Senator from Montana and I are introducing is permissive in character. It merely gives the individual publisher the right to suspend publication for 2 weeks each year if he so chooses. Rural America Is still the storehouse of democracy. The voices of our rural citizens must be heard. and they must have an instrument by which their audience can be reached. The small weekly editors across the country. who are near to the people and reflect their thoughts. have provided an irreplaceable medium of news and independent editorial opinion. It seems to me that every measure should be taken to strengthen the small local pressnot discourage it. Centralization of the press and news media in general is a most dangerous thing. The tendency has been toward more centralization and consolidation. and it is time we did something to encourage and stimulate the small independent news outlets.","Mr. Speaker. under leave to extend my remarks in the RECORD. I include an address delivered by our distinguished colleague. Representative BENJAMIN F. JAMEs. at the commemorative exercises marking the 250th anniversary of the birth of Benjamin Franklin. at the Government Printing Office. January 17. 1956. We all know that the gentleman from Pennsylvania is a valuable and able Member of the House and an impressive speaker. I have particular knowledge of and admiration for his ability. because we work together on the Committee on Appropriations. His selection. however. as the principal speaker for this commemorative occasion was peculiarly appropriate. He is not only the namesake of the great American patriot. but also now owns and operates the printing business which Benjamin Franklin established and operated. I know that his remarks at the ceremony will be of unusual interest to this House: Let me say at once I feel highly honored with the privilege of having a part in this fine program commemorating the 250th anniversary of the birth of the amazing Benjamin Franklinthe first civilized American and the patron saint of printers. From the earliest time that Benjamin Franklin became a popular subject for authors. biographers. and orators. until the present250 years after his birthsomething over 1.000 separate works about him (some of them very extensive indeed) have been compiled and published. There has been a tendency in Franklin scholarship that has emphasized the philosopher. the scientist. inventor. diplomat. the man of broad international culture. the patriot. and the author. and even the lover. all at far greater extent than Franklin the printer. This despite the fact that Franklins phenomenal success as a printer and a publisher was the springboardeconomically and politicallyfor his advancement in the many and varied fields of endeavor that claimed his interest. Eulogies in vast numbers have been pronounced on many occasions. The shortest and pithiest of these was by Whitelaw Reid. himself a distinguished journalist. who once said. rather incidentally in a speech about something else: Appendix \"I honor the memory of Benjamin Frank. lin because he was a philosopher who wrote commonsense. an officeholder who did not steal. and a journeyman printer who did not drink.\" Then there is the little story of a young scholar whose class was given the assignment of writing a brief composition about Benjamin Franklin. This lad turned in the following: \"Benjamin Franklin was born at a very early age in Boston. on a street called Milk. He went to school for 2 years and then went into the printing business with his brother. He didnt like his brother so he took a boat and went to Philadelphia. He was very hungry when he got off the boat so he bought two loaves of bread and carried one of them under his arm while eating the other. This made a young lady smile at him. so he married her and discovered electricity.\" That is brevity in rare form. but it does make the point that in the public mind two things about Franklin are preeminenthis association with the printing business. which was real. and the completely false notion that he discovered electricity. This evening I should like to speak particularly about Benjamin Franklin. the printer. It seems most appropriate that I should do so here in this. the greatest of all printshops in our day. It will not be my purpose. however. to trace an orderly account of his career in printing. of his experiences as an apprentice with his brother. James. or with his partners in Philadelphia and also in five of the colonies. in Jamaica and in Antigua. However. some discussion of the social and economic climate in which Franklin learned his trade and then followed it as the leading master printer of his time will be helpful to an understanding of the role of a printer in colonial America. The printer then was a jack of many skills and trades. which in these times of specialization and modern equipment are all separate and distinct callings. Were we able to compress into one person a typographer. pressman. advertisting man. author. magazine and newspaper publisher. reporter and editor. stationer and bookseller we would have an amalgam somewhat resembling the early American master printer. At the time that Franklin became an apprentice in his brothers shop in Boston the printer had not yet achieved an honorable and influential status in the American Colonies except possibly in the city of Philadelphia and doubtless that exception was owing to the broad. tolerant policy of William Penn. As late as 1733 the Governor of New York felt obliged. for some offense. real or imagined. to stop the press then running in that city. In 1718 the Governor of Virginia. when advertising a reward for the capture of pirates. was compelled to send to Philadelphia to have the handbills struck off. On another occasion that same Governor thanked God they had no press in Virginia. Earlierin 1686. Governor Bradford of Massachusetts had forbidden anyone to print without his consent. Four years before that. the General Court of Massachusetts had decreed that there should be no printing press used except one at Cambridge. and that one only under the supervision of two licensees. These restrictions were apparently deemed necessary to prevent editorial and printed abuse of the constituted and privileged authorities. Even in Philadelphia in those days printing was not regarded as a preferred occupation. but the road to better conditions in that city in the printing trade was yet to be plotted by Benjamin Franklin. Albough printing dealt with making books. of which the youthful Benjamin was so much enamored almost from babyhood. he was not inclined to look with favor upon learning the printers trade. However. the decision was his fathers and he was apprenticed. or bound. to his brother James. a master printer in Boston. for a term of 9 years. His fathers first choice for the boys future had been the trade of the cutler. but the terms demanded by the master cutler required that he be paid a sum equal to about $100. whereas the price named by James Franklin for his brothers instruction in the printers art was equal to about $50. It might be said. the want of $50 made Benjamin Franklin a printer instead of a cutler. In addition to the payment of a lump sum for instruction. his brother would. of course. have his free services during the term of the apprenticeship. A rather elaborate contract had to be drawn between Franklins father and his brother James. in which Benjamin was bound to a number of obligations such as keeping his masters secrets. gladly performing his lawful commands. he must not frequent taverns. inns. or alehousesplay at cards. dice tables or other unlawful gameshe might not contract matrimony nor absent himself from his master day or nightbut. above all. demean and behave himself toward his master during all the said term. In consideration of all this. the master also assumed a few obligations. The following is from the document given by James Franklin to the father of Benjamin Franklin: \"The said James Franklin. master printer. for and in consideration of the sum of ten pounds of lawful British money. to him in hand paid by the said Josiah Franklin. the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged. the said apprentice in the art of a printer which he now useth he shall teach and instruct. or cause to be taught and instructed. the best way and manner that he can. finding and allowing unto the said apprentice meat. drink. washing. lodging and all other necessaries during the said term.\" Further terms of the contract are quaint and somewhat amusing. The master was obliged to provide apparel for the apprentice. described thus: \"A pair of deerskin breeches coming hardly down to his knees. which. before they could be allowed to come into the presence of ladies. at meeting. on the Sabbath. were regularly to be blacked upon the preceding night. in order to give them a clean and fresh appearance for the Sunday. a pair of woolen yarn stockings. a thick and substantial pair of shoes. well greased and ornamented with a pair of small. brass buckles (the latter however to be a present for his good behavior)-a speckled shirt for all the weekand a white one for Sundaywhich was always carefully to be taken off as soon as he returned from meeting. folded up and laid by for the next Sabbath.\" A445 Franklin once commented that the leather breeches. after several years of wear. became greasy as they grew old and could only be kept flexible when worn. by the superflux of youthful heat. Thus was Benjamin Franklin. a lad of but 12 years. launched upon a career destined to land him. when only 42 years of age. at the port of wealth and influence. and bring him. In his riper years. greater and greater distinctionnot only in his beloved land. but throughout the civilized world. James Franklin proved to be a mean taskmaster and occasion presenting itself. Benjamin broke the indentures that bound him and though but a lad of 16 years. fearlessly started out to make his way elsewhere. He arrived in Philadelphia on a Sunday morning in October. in the year 1723. and though his apprenticeship in point of time had been but half completed. he was even then a competent journeyman printer. as well as something of a writer. He found ready employment in the shop of Samuel Keimer. one of the two printers then established in that city. Keimer was slovenly in person and in business. according to Franklin---suspicious and something of a knave withal. This employment was not happy nor did it last long. The following year a trip was made to Boston at the suggestion of Governor Keith of Pennsylvania. who had become attracted to young Franklin. but who proved to be a very unreliable patron. At Keiths suggestion Franklin sought assistance from his father. Josiah. to the purpose of starting a printing business of his own in Philadelphia. His father. however. took a dim view of the lads plans. saying that \"Keith must be of small discretion to think of setting up a boy in business who still wanted 3 years of being of mans estate.\" Though help was refused by the elder Franklin. advice was generously given. \"telling me.\" as Franklin says. \"that by steady Industry and prudent parsimony. I might save enough by the time I was 1 and 20 to set me up. that if I came near to the matter he would help me out with the rest.\" In December 1724. Franklin sailed for England. again following irresponsible advice and promises by Governor Keith. which were never kept. The journey was not without profit. however. for he spent nearly 2 years there working for two of Londons foremost printers. much Improving his knowledge of the business and his skill as a craftsman. In 1726 he returned to Philadelphia. again went to work for Keimer. forthough still determined to go into business on his own. earnings were neeeded in the meantime. An incident occurred at about this time of lasting interest. for he fell ill of the pleurisy and in the certainty that he was about to die. he wrote the famous epitaph. which to this day remains one of the most remarkable and widely known writings of its kind. In it he proudly identified himself for posterity with his craft. just as he did later. in his last willas Benjamin Franklin. Printer. In the spring of 1728 there was a day to mark the beginning of a new era in the history of printing in America. The types and press ordered earlier from a London firm by Benjamin Franklin arrived in Philadelphia and were being installed at No. 51 High Street. and the firm name. Franklin and Meredith was hung above the door. Meredith was a printer in Keimers shop and a friend of Franklins. He had been given to overindulgence in drink and Franklin. by advice and example. had redeemed him to a very creditable degree. In gratitude Merediths father furnished a sum of money. though not wholly adequate. for the purchase of equipment. in return for a partnershipand probably further moral supportfor his son. This partnership. however. was dissolved. in 1730. and Franklin became sole owner of the business. In his autobiography Franklin says that at the time of the beginning of this new firm it was freely predicted that Franklin and Meredith must fail as there were already too many printers in the city. Yet there were only two. one of them Andrew Bradford. the other Samuel Keimer. and neither had the grasp and knowledge of his business possessed by the youthful Franklin. Franklin did not just hang out his sign. announce that he was in business and wait for customers. When he and Meredith opened for business. the public printer of Pennsylvania was Andrew Bradford. a dilatory man whose competition had been negligible and only from the highly incompetent Samuel Keimer. Evidently. the bounty of the public purse was just as alluring in Franklins day as in our times and political security was then. as now. a dangerous illusion. Franklin therefore aimed his first competition at Bradfords most lucrative plum. the public printing of the Assembly of Pennsylvania which promptly fell right into his lap. To use his own words \"Bradford had printed an address of the House by the Governor. in a coarse. blundering manner.\" We reprinted it elegantly and correctly and sent one to every Member. They were sensible of the difference. it strengthened the hands of our friends in the House. and they voted us their printers for the year ensuing. This. I venture to say. was the beginning of modern lobbying technique in America. From that year. 1730. until his retirement. Franklin remained the official public printer of Pennsylvania. In 1736 he clinched the contract by getting himself appointed clerk to the assembly. thus insuring. without interference. the direct transmission of printing orders from the assembly directly to the printer. This clerkship was Franklins first political post and his first step in a long career in public service. Undoubtedly the public printing business was the foundation and side walls of Franklins Way to Wealth. At about the same time that he took the job of clerk to the assembly he also broke Bradfords monopoly in the newspaper field. Keimer. In competition with Bradfords paper. the American Weekly Mercury. had issued on December 24. 1728. his first edition of a weekly called by the impressive title. \"The Universal Instructor in All Arts and Sciences and Pennsylvania Gazette.\" Within 6 months Keimer was through. He never had over 100 subscribers so he offered the paper to Franklin for what Franklin called a \"trifle.\" On October 2. 1729. Franklin began publishing the paper with a more reasonable title \"The Pennsylvania Gazette.\" That paper was published regularly until 1815. 25 years after his death. Franklin was a keen newspaperman. He knew that controversial issues created reader interest. and he has told of controversies he published which. as he says. \"Got the publisher and editor talked about by the principal people involved and in a few weeks brought them all in as subscribers.\" There is no complete list of books that Franklin and his various partners published from 1728 until 1766. when he sold his Interest in the firm to David Hall whom he had taken into a partnership 18 years earlier. The most reliable count of Franklins imprints. made about half a century ago. recorded at that time 759 titles. Next in importance to the public printing were religious works and sermons and books on theology. as a group. He was not a sectarian publisher and the religious works he wrote. or edited. and published amply covered the field of all sects sheltered under William Penns \"freedom to worship\" policy. Next to religious works and very important profitwise were his almanacs. Of the 759 knows items Franklin published. religious titles accounted for 148 and almanacs for 119 items. Very likely even more have now been accounted for. One itemPoor Richards Almanack. regularly published for 26 years. far outsold all of its competitors. but he did not carry all of his almanac eggs in one basket. In one year. 1751. he issued six different almanacs. one In the German language and one in the export field called The Barbados Almanac. I have mentioned briefly some of the important Items printed and published by Franklin but there were other and very profitable items such as forms. letterheads. announcements. and such materials as the job printer and stationer supplies. In those days it was the custom to print certain business forms. such as bills of lading starting with the words \"By the grace of God.\" Franklin felt that some users of these forms might prefer to have those words omitted so he advertised that he would supply bills of lading with or without the grace of God. Nor have I accounted for the great numbers of pamphlets which he wrote and printed on the philosophical society. the university. and the library companyall of which he helped to found: on his stove. on electricity. medicine. and on politics. At 42 years of age Franklin had made amply secure his future. financially. and then retired from active participation in the business so that he might have more time for the increasing burdens of public service and his many other interests. It may be fairly said that Poor Richards words of worldly wisdom. his pamphlets. his pen. and printing press did more to mould the new American character than any other influence in his time. A delegate to the First Congress assembled in America at Albany. N. Y.. in 1754. he presented his plan for the union of the colonies. which unquestionably awakened in the minds of the colonists a new national consciousness. Many regard this as Franklins most significant contribution in behalf of the independence of our country. George Washington. to whom we refer affectionately as the Father of Our Country. was in that same year. 1754. a lad of about 20 years. mainly occupied with the task of surveying his familys estates in Virginia. Franklin died at the age of 84 years and 3 months. soon after Washington. at the age of 57. was Inaugurated first President of the United States. I would like to now conclude this discussion of Benjamin Franklin. printer. by recalling. what we must believe he valued among the finest rewards of a life of devoted service to his country and to mankind. It was a letter that he received on his deathbed. but while he was still in possession of his faculties and ability to clearly comprehend. which I now read: \"If to be venerated for benevolenceif to be admired for talentif to be beloved for philanthropiescan gratify the human mind. you must have the present consolation to know that you have not lived in vain. and I flatter myself that it will not be ranked among the least grateful occurrences of your life to be assured that. so long as I retain my memory. you will be recollected with respect. veneration. and affection by your sincere friend. George Washington.\" A446 Build Up Allies or Enemies?","Mr. President. the 37th anniversary of Lithuanias independence. which tragically proved to be shortlived. occurred this week. During her period of independence. from 1918 to 1940. Lithuania was an honored member of the family of free nations. faithfully fulfilling all her obligations in the international community. The contrast between those happy days and the present is deplorable. It has been described by the Lithuanian American Council in these words: Today. a rigid Soviet censorship hides from the world the continuing deportations under the guise of \"volunteer\" work elsewhere. the collectivization of a once most prosperous nation. the slave labor camps. the systematic efforts of the Soviet occupational regime to organically merge Lithuania into the Soviet system. the extermination of the hostile antiSoviet element by killings of the resistant groups. by russiflcation and colonization by Russian elements. But the spirit of freedom remains alive in Lithuania. As this proud and virile nation survived other oppressions. so shall it survive this one. On the occasion of this 37th anniversary of Lithuanian independence. America sends a message of sympathy to the Lithuanian people in their hours of trial. and of hope that one day they may again enjoy the happiness they once had as a free and independent nation.","Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. for many years I have been a firm advocate of farm prices based upon costs of production but I have been willing to support a minimum of 90 percent of parity until an equitable program could be enacted. It has been interesting. if not convincing. to listen to those who advocate what they are pleased to call a flexible plan. The fallacy and speciousness of their arguments is attested by the fact. that they do not advocate the same thing for those who sell goods and services to. farmers. For instance. how flexible are electric. telephone. and freight rates. fixed by. laws which guarantee costs of operation and a reasonable return on investment. All of these are services which farmers must buy. How flexible is the price of farm equipment and many other necessities farmers must have? The administration proposal would sell the farmer down the river by arbitrarily slashing his prices and income while leaving undisturbed his costs for machinery. freight rates. power. telephone rates and a host of other costs. Incidentally. it is to be hoped that those who voted for a fairprice law for businessmen will accord the same consideration to farmers. In the minds of some there still seems to exist the belief that farm production can be turned off and on like water from a faucet. Remember the drouth stricken areas of Texas last year? Some of these same areas now lie deep under ftoodwaterscrops again destroyed. Reports from Iowa indicate $10 million losses in corn and small grains during the last 3 weeks by floods and inundations. The farmer is the worlds greatest involuntary gambler. It has duly been said that he plants in faith. cultivates in hope. and sometimes reaps a harvest of charity. Let me give you another example. A few days ago I received a letter from a farmer in the district which I represent. It reads: Sold our hens yesterday for 12 cents per pound. They weighed 6 pounds each. As dayold DeKalb chicks they cost 60 cents per each. so you see we got only 12 cents per hen more than they cost the day after they were. hatched. without any death loss. I imagine you would pay pretty close to 72 cents for a couple of drumsticks and gizzards here in Washington or New York. and this same farmer has been getting 25 to 28 cents a dozen for eggs In the last few weeks. To my Republican colleagues. especially. I would like now to address a few words. There are those in the administration who say this 90 percent issue is political. Nothing could be more wrong. This issue transcends partisan political considerations. as the recent vote in the House Agriculture Committee shows. as the final vote on this measure will show. and as the votes on farm programs in both the House and Senate have demonstrated for at least a quarter of a century. I repeat that my opposition to the administrations flexible pricesupport plan is based on the firm conviction that any further reduction in farm income. without a corresponding drop in costs of operation. will produce serious economic trouble in the great foodproducing areas. which will inevitably spread throughout the Nation. I find no pleasure in opposing the administration on this or any other issue. but if there is the continued insistence that the pending farm legislation is politically inspired. and I do not agree. then let it be remembered that a Republican Congress in the late 1920s twice passed the McNaryHaugen bill. that it was twice vetoed by a Republican President. that the Nations worst depression followed. and for 20 years thereafter Democrat Presidents inhabited the White House.","Mr. Speaker. I have asked for the time of this House in order to invite and direct the attention of the House and of its appropriate committees to a matter of gravity and immediate urgency. I am sure that my record in the matter of such requests well establishes that I do not impose upon the time of the House for any light or trivial reasons. In this instance I wish to call to the attention of the House a case which. I am fully convinced. involves a gross and flagrant mishandling of a labor dispute by the National Labor Relations Board. In order. at the outset. to establish clearly the proper interest and concern of the House in this matter. let me state five reasons for bringing it before the House in this manner. First. Involved Is a matter -of elemental justice to constituents of mine in the Third Congressional District of Michiganthese constituents including representatives of both management and labor and of the community at large. It is. moreover. a matter of such elemental justice as to constitute in effect an urgent and rightful petition for redress of grievances. Second. The matter involves an immediate and serious threat to uninterrupted operation of an industrial plant engaged in the production of highly critical war and defense materials. Third. The matter to which I refer involves actions of a board created by the Congress and presumed to be functioning under and in accordance with laws enacted by the Congress. Fourth. The situation I shall describe Involves a bold and arrogant challenge of the rights of constituents and of basic principles of law and justic.. by a powerful international union and. in my judgment. also involves reasonable suspicions of collusion between this international union and the National Labor Relations Board in support of this challenge. Fifth. Finally. the matter to which I direct the attention of the House has. I believe. a direct and important bearing upon proposed corrective legislation being. or to be. considered by the House and its appropriate committees. Proceeding now to a statement of the background facts involved. permit me first of all to identify the principals in this matter. Immediately involved are some 500 employees and the management of the Albion Malleable Iron Co. of Albion. Mich.. the International Molders and Foundry Workers Union of North America. A. F. of L.. and its local 413. which has been the duly established bargaining agent of the employees since 1937 until the January 16. 1953. representation election now in dispute. and finally the International Union. United Automobile. Aircraft. and Agricultural Implement Workers of America. UAWCIO. and its local 474. Also involved are Harry Casselman. regional director of the seventh region. NLRB. Detroit. Joseph Kulkis. field examiner for the seventh regional office. NLRB. Detroit. and members of the National Labor Relations Board and counsels staff in Washington. D. C. The Albion Malleable Iron Co. was founded in 1888 to produce malleableiron castings. The company was reorganized and a mechanization program instituted in 1938. Both during and since World War II capacity of the plant was very substantially increased. Its present capacity is approximately 50.000 tons of castings a year. Present production of the plant includes rearaxle parts. wheel hubs of various sizes. frame and chassis parts. and other castings for automobiles. trucks. and defense vehicles. The plant has also been producing various items for inclusion in artillery shells for Army Ordnance and only last week was awarded additional extremely critical Army Ordnance contracts. Due to the high degree of mechanization and modern production methods the firm has been acclaimed by Foundry magazine. leading trade journal. as the model of efficient malleablecastings production. As we shall see. the position of leadership in the industry attained by this firm has a direct and important bearing upon the matter here under discussion. The facts regarding the companys labor representation history may be stated very briefly. From 1888 to 1937 the company operated without any formal employee representation. As already noted. the A. F. of L. union acquired bargaining rights for the employees in 1937. through an election on the issue of A. F. of L. recognition or no union. During the spring and summer of 1950 the UAWCIO carried on organizing activities. culminating in an election in August 1950. This election resulted in the A. F. of L. retaining bargaining rights. On or about November 17 of last year. the company received notice that the UAWCIO claimed it represented a majority of the employees and requested bargaining rights. An election was held on January 16. 1953. under direction of the seventh regional office of NLRB. The developments with which I am here concerned. and to which I call the attention of this House. have arisen in connection with this January 16 election. These developments may. at this point. be summed up under two headings: First. The UAWCIO union. having claimed to have received a 1vote majority of the votes cast and having claimed entitlement to bargaining rights for the companys employees. the A. F. of L. union filed objections claiming that the election was indecisive. invalid. and should be set aside on grounds of improper activities in connection with the election and on grounds that a legal \"majority was not received by the UAWCIO union. Second. Subsequently the A. F. of L. union filed with NLRB charges of unfair labor practices by UAWCIO incident to and arising out of the January 16 election. Somewhat later. and acting independently as a result of investigations it conducted. the company also filed with NLRB charges of unfair labor practices by the UAWCIO incident to and arising out of the January 16 election. Without going into extensive details. let me now summarize for the record the chronology of events subsequent to and arising from the two actions which I have cited. that is. objections to the election and unfair labor practice charges. All dates refer to the present year: January 16: Election held. CIO claimed 1vote majority. January 23: Timely objection to election filed by A. F. of L. union against UAWCIO. February 3: A. F. of L. filed amended objections. March 12: Report made by NLRB regional director on A. F. of L. objections to election. said report overruling objections. March 19: A. F. of L. union filed unfair labor practice charges against UAWCIO. March 21: A. F. of L. union filed timely exceptions to report of regional director and matter sent to NLRB in Washington for consideration. March 21: Albion Malleable Iron Co. received copy of A. F. of L. unfair labor practice charges against UAWCIO. and thereupon began its own independent investigation of such of those charges as appeared to jeopardize the companys very existence if found to be true. March 31: Albion Malleable Iron Co. filed unfair labor practice charges against UAWCIO with NLRB and furnished regional board with 90page document which included pertinent excerpts from 12 hours of tape and wirerecorded testimony substantiating facts set forth in the companys charges against UAWCIO. April 1: General counsel for UAWCIO filed request with NLRB for 15day extension to permit UAWCIO to file a brief in reply to A. F. of L. exceptions to the report of the regional NLRB director. So far as I have been able to determine. there was no such brief filed with the board in behalf of UAWCIO despite apparent approval of such extension. April 1417 inclusive: The field examIner for the NLRB regional office conducted investigation of the companys unfair labor charges at the Albion plant. I do not have immediately available the dates of similar investigations of the A. F. of L. union unfair labor charges. April 20: The NLRB overruled the obJections of the A. F. of L. union to the election and certified the UAWCIO as the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees of the Albion Malleable Iron Co.. . April 21: A handbill was circulated by the UAWCIO in Albion in the proximity of the Albion Malleable Iron Co. plant bearing the statement: \"Flash: The UAWCIO was certified at Albion Malleable today by the NLRB.\" Also the Jackson (Mich.) CitizenPatriot. an afternoon newspaper. carried a newspaper story quoting Harold Marsh. Jackson UAW international representative. as stating that NLRB \"has certified the UAWCIO as bargaining agent for employees of the Albion Malleable Iron Co.\" The article further stated: HeMarshsaid he had received notice of the certification from the UAW office at Washington. D.C. Attention of my office was called to the circulation of the aforementioned handbill. Inquiry by my office resulted in confirmation by telephone by Ogden W. Fields. associate executive secretary of NLRB. of the Boards action. Subsequently. and at my request. a copy of the Boards decision and certification of representation was delivered to my office by Mr. Fields. April 22: Company and A. F. of L. officials received written notification in Albion by regular mail of the NLRB action. I also received a telegram from the president and secretary of A. F. of L. local 413 protesting the fact neither the A. F. of L. nor the company received notification simultaneously with the UAWCIO. and also requesting that certification of the UAWCIO be withheld for this reason and until the unfair labor practice charges in the case have been processed. The telegram stated that a copy had also been sent to the chairman of NLRB. Now. Mr. Speaker. I call the attention of the House to certain highlights in this case. More particularly. I propose to make several specific allegations which. in my judgment. clearly indicate a gross and flagrant mishandling of this entire matter by the National Labor Relations Board. First. I direct your attention to the fact that NLRB has rendered its decision and issued its certification in this disputed election case even while unfair. labor practice charges are pending and. that in so doing the Board has flagrantly violated its own established and accepted rules of procedure which the courts and the board itself have ofttimes affirmed and reaffirmed. In that connection let me further point out that the unfair labor practice charges here involved. charges filed independently by the A. F. of L. union and the company. were charges relating directly to and arising out of the disputed election. By willfully and flagrantly ignoring these unfair labor charges. still pending. the NLRB has not only violated its own established rules and practices but has committed an act totally repugnant to and violative of every reasonable principle of justice. equity. and right. The Board thereby has been flagrantly indifferent to the rights and interests of all parties to this dispute. No report had been filed prior to the April 20 action of NLRB by the regional field examiner with respect to these separate and independent unfair labor practice charges. Yet. notwithstanding the fact that these charges. and the investigation of the charges. relateas I have saidto the disputed election. NLRB by its hasty and improper action has foreclosed upon any consideration of the charges or evidence cited in corroboration of those charges. so far as the Boards decision on the election issue is concerned. I demand to know. and I believe this House has a right and duty to know. the reasons. real or alleged. for this unprecedented. improper. unlawful. and unjust haste. What motives. what pressures. what interests dictated this irregular action? I demand an answer to these questions not only in behalf of my injured constituents but in behalf of all future litigants. whether representing labor. management or the public. whose interests will be jeopardized if this unholy precedent is permitted to stand unchallenged and uncorrected. It is not my intention to burden this House with extensive citations establishing the fact that it is the obligation and the accepted procedure of NLRB to hold election certification in abeyance pending decision on electionrelated unfair labor practice charges. Let me quote just two or three pertinent citations on this allimportant point. In the case of Electrical Workers against Herzog. decided by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. January 18. 1951. the couxt stated: As a consequence of a petition filed in accordance with section 9 (c) the NLRB on July 7. 1949. conducted the election in the plant of the StewartWarner Corp. In Chicago. Ill. 0 0 * SubsequentlyAnd I call the attention of the House to that word \"subsequently\"Subsequently. unfair labor charges were filed with the Board both by rival unions and by employees in the bargaining unit. Because these charges are pending. the Board refuses to certify the plaintiff union in accordance with the procedure under Section 9 (c). The court sustained the position of the Board in refusing certification while the unfair labor charges were pending and made the following statement: This interpretation has the effect of continuing in full force under the new actThat is. the LaborManagement Relations Act. commonly known as the TaftHartley Acthas the effect of continuing In full force under the new act what was regarded as proper procedure under the National Labor Relations Act. Note that in this case NLRB was sustained by the court in itscontention that certification should not issue until a determination had been made in connection with the charge of unfair labor practices. filed subsequent to the election. Again. in the case of Textile Workers Alliance against Herzog. decided by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. February 4. 1950. the court cited the action of an NLRB regional director in refusing \"to process the representation petition filed by plaintiff. pending disposition of an unfair labor practice charge.\" The court. speaking of the NLRBs affirmation of the regional directors action. said: The Board * *denied the requested leave and affirmed the action of the regional director. in accord with the Boards longestablished policy not to proceed with representation matters while there is an unwaived unfair labor practice charge pending. In still another case. that of NLRB against Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co.. before the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. decided January 16. 1950. the court considered a fact situation similar to the Albion Malleable Iron Co. case. The court held in this case that when a charge of unfair labor practices was filed subsequent to the report of the regional director on objections to the election. it was proper for the National Labor Relations Board to refuse to act on the question of representation until the unfair labor practice charges had been determined. I believe this House has a right to an answer to two questions with respect to the flagrant and arbitrary action of the Board on April 20. 1953. in the Albion Malleable Iron Co. case. In rendering a decision and certification in a disputed election while unfair labor charges were pending. was NLRB deviating in this single instance from established policy or was NLRB initiating a new policy? In either case the further question properly arises as to why. So far as I can see. there is nothing either in the previous decisions of this Board or the courts. or in this particular case. which in any way warrants either a deviation from established policy in this case or the adoption of completely new policy for allsubsequent cases. Second. Now I come. Mr.. Speaker. to the character. and scope of the charges of unfair labor practice filed before NLRB. Let me say to this House that in one particular the charge leveled against the UAWCIOoriginally by the A. F. of L. and subsequently in greater detail of allegation and evidence by the company as a result of its own independent investigationinvolves an incredibly shocking and appalling situation. I refer to the charge that it was. and Is. the plan and intention of the UAWCIO. announced by. UAWCIO officials and representatives both in public meetings. at meetings in union headquarters. and at many private gatherings in taverns and other places in the city of Albion to divert work and production away from the Albion Malleable Iron Co. and to distribute this work and production among other foundries in the malleable casting industry. Think of that. Here is charged. and the charge is accompanied by corroborative evidence supplied to the NLRB field examiner by both the A. F. of L. union and the company. hereis charged a preelection purpose and intentin event of UAWCIO victory in that electionto impose a postelection. unionengineered and unionenforced \"share the wealth\" program upon the company and upon the very employees the UAWCIO was propcsing to represent and serve as sole bargaining agent. Bear in mind that. of course. this UAWCIO union already has contracts in those other competing plants in the malleable casting industry. I submit that such a proposition involves an unprecedented violation of both the spirit and letter of the TaftHartley Act. It constitutes an advance and anticipatory refusal to bargain in good faith for the best interests of the very employees the union was seeking to represent. This alleged and documented proposal. plot. promise. threatyou may choose your own designationamounts to an announced intention on the part of the union. its leaders and representatives. to become dictator and dispenser of jobs and production. of wages and profits. within an entire industry. without so much as a \"by your leave\" of either workers. management or stockholders. Upon what meat do such Caesars as these feed? These. I hasten to remind the House. are among the charges. pending and totally ignored by the National Labor Relations Board. when on April 20. in violation of all established precedent and procedure. it proceeded to certify this union and this leadership to sole and exclusive bargaining rights for the employees of the Albion Malleable Iron Co. Under those circumstances how conceivably can the Board justify its cavalier proceedings? The thought occurs. and must remain in the absence of overriding evidence to the contrary. that here was a plan so ambitious and bold. conceivedby.men so brazen and daring. thatplaying for such high stakes -of naked -powerthey brought to bear uponthe Board pressure which the Board lacked the courage. fortitude. and even elemental commonsense to resist. This much we know. of record.. The Board in this instance. capitulated and deviated completely from its own established and accepted procedures. Why. Mr. Speaker? Third. Against the background of this major charge. the various other allegations of alleged unfair practices seem dwarfed. Yet for the record they should be cited. These charges include \"restraining and coercing the employees of the company in the exercise of the rights guaranteed under section 7of the LaborManagement Relations Actby statements. representations of threats of bodily harm and economic injury. by the buying of votes. by making extravagant and unreasonable promises of benefit or gain. by misrepresentations. by the excessive use of intoxicating liquors in their campaign for support. by fraudulent promises and fraudulent allurement.\" These. too. are all allegations documented to NLRB by the separate complainants. These are charges pending and ignored by the Board in its decision and certification. notwithstanding that they arise in connection with and incident to the election under dispute and certified by the Board. Fourth. I am forced to add. Mr. Speaker. that I am convinced the offense of the National Labor Relations Board. in this matter is compounded 4ty a direct and overt breach of good faith. I am informed that the DetYoit regional office of the Board. through its director and agents. assured the company. prior to the April 20 decision. that the usual procedure would be followed in this case. I am informed that these assurances included the specific statement that the matter of unfair labor practice charges in this case would be determined prior to a decision by NLRB in regard to certification of the election. Again. I ask. why were these assurancesfully justified by wellrecognized and established procedurethus ruthlessly. wantonly. and completely violated? And. in that same conjunction. why was disclosure of the Boards April 20 decision and action made to and through the Washington office of the UAWCIO. to parties not of record in the proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board. prior to official notification to the attorneys of record? Mr. Speaker. over the entrance to the marble edifice which faces this Capitol are inscribed the words which embody the basic obligation and ideals of Government in all of its functions and relationships-\"Equal justice under law.\" My interest in this case which I have detailedand my sole interestis the fulfillment of that obligation and the realization of that ideal. Basic to that fulfillment is the requirement that all parties whose rights are at issue shall have equal opportunity for full and just hearing of their cause. It is my firm conviction that this requirement has been .ignored andviolated in the case I have described -to this House. - . In this instance. it has been violated with respect to.citizens of a community in my district. with respect to persons identified with the ranks of labor. of management and of ownership. If tolerated. if permitted to pass unchallenged. the violation may next extend to citizens of your district. I am satisfied that the National Labor Relations Board in this case. for reasons known only to itself. has arbitrarily ignored pertinent and shocking allegations and evidence of record. It has arbitrarily imposed its fiat. It has violated good faith and legitimate assurances given to parties affected. And in doing all this. I am convinced that the Board has flouted its own established rules and procedures repeatedly reaffirmed alike by usage and by court decisions. I do not presume to judge whether these acts of the Board were the acts of subservience and venal collusion. acts of sheer willfulness or careless haste or of incompetence. I believe that even to the members of the National Labor Relations Board there should be extended the right and privilege which that Board has denied to vitally interested parties in this casethe right and privilege of full and just hearing of their cause. Accordingly. in the interest of all parties. I respectfully request that the Committee on Education and Labor of this House forthwith summon the Chairman of the NLRB. the General Counsel of NLRB. and such other person or persons as it deems necessary and proper. for questioning and explanation as to the actions of the Board in the case I have described. Such action by the committee is. I believe. abundantly justified alike in the interest of securing the full facts in this case and in the interest of determining the bearing of these facts upon proposed labor legislation now before the committee. Further. I strongly urge that failure of NLRB officials to give adequate and completely satisfactory explanation for their actions in this case will constitute abundant grounds for resignation of the involved officials forthwith. Finally. I ask that the committee act expeditiously upon this matter. Not only the interests and rights of workers. management. and owners are urgently involved. but the hope of restoring confidence. stability. and transquillity to a small but typically American community is at stake. What is done. or left undone. in this matter will affect for good or ill the way in which many of my constituents and of your fellow citizens will read. in the future. those noble words: \"Equal justice under law.\"","Mr. Chairman. the purpose of this amendment is to increase this appropriation by $200.000. If that is done it will complete the floodcontrol project at New Albany. Ind. I was very pleased to hear Mr. Davis state during general debate that it was the policy of the committee that when a project had been started they considered it good business to allocate sufficient money to finish that project. It will take $331.000 to complete this project. The committee has allocated only $131.000. That means that $200.000 more is necessary to complete it. With this $131.000 and what has already been appropriated. the sum of $5.800.000 will have been appropriated for this project. and. as I said before. it will take only $200.000 to complete it. Let me hasten to state that this project has nothing to do with the generation of electric power. and there is nothing in it for the housing of defense workers or other people. the only thing that is involved is a floodcontrol wall around the city of New Albany. a city with a population of 35.000 situated across the Ohio River from Louisville. This project was started 3 or 4 years ago. Large delegations have come down here from Indiana interested in this project. I hope the gentleman from Michigan will not accuse me of being parochial. but we have only two projects in Indiana. We somehow feel that this is our new land. We feel rather bad. to have this one project taken away from us. especially when it is so close to being completed. I know the Government Is not going to spend the sum of $5.800.000 and then not complete the project. That would be expensive. The project has been started and it is scheduled to be finished this fall. Taking the men off the work. taking the machinery away and bringing it back. and letting new contracts. will cost more money. Possibly the cost of materials and labor will go up by that time. So it would be good economy. I think. when the men are on the job and they have gone as far as they have. to complete this project. This extra $200.000 will buy pumps. I know that. if a flood should come. the Government will bring in portable pumps and pump the sewage and flood water out of there if the necessity arose. However. that would mean you would spend more money on this proposition. still without building permanent protection. The budget request for this project was $631.000. The committee has allowed the sum of $131.000. Even with my amendment to add $200.000. I am asking that $300.000 less than the budget estimate be appropriated. I understand one of the reasons that the committee cut this down was because $500.000 already appropriated has not been expended. but that money will be expended within the next 2 or 3 months. as I understand. That amount of money. together with what I am asking to be appropriated. Is necessary to carry out this project. It would not save any money to deny this sum because I know the project is going to be completed in future years. It is sound economy to go ahead and finish this project now. and it is in accordance with the plan of the engineers. I hope that the committee will agree to this amendment. I am certain that an amendment of this kind will save money and that it is good business. There has been some talk about letting the Senate complete the work. but I do not know why the House cannot write Its own bill. Mr. Chairman. I hope my amendment will be agreed to.","Mr. President. the question of whether or not there should be a percentagewise increase across the board. or whether it should be a lumpsum increase applying to all employees in the Post Office Department and in the classified service. is one to which the committee gave considerable study and thought. I believe for the purposes of the RECORD it behooves me at this time to point out exactly what we are getting into with amendments which are offered from the floor. When S. 355. the postal payincrease bill was under consideration last Friday the Senator from Kansas suggested a minimum of $400. On the floor we worked out a compromise to the effect that the formula of 8.8 percent would apply to all postal workers. provided. however. that in no case would an employees salary be increased by less than $400. In the postal payincrease bill certain other adjustments were made with reference to grades 1 and 2. under which those grades were to be eliminated. and by which the employees in those two grades were to receive a $200 increase. More than that. we tried to adjust the salaries of employees who came into the postal service subsequent to June 30. As the postal payincrease bill now stands there is a serious question in the minds of myself and many members of the committee as to whether or not the bill as it was passed does not in fact grant an increase of a minimum of $600 with reference to postal.employees. In other .words. to make the RECORD a little clearer. the bill originally provided for an increase of 8.8 percent. A serious question exists whether the $400 minimum is to be applied after the adjustment of $200 takes place. or whether the figure of $400 is to be used after the increase has been computed on the basis of 8.8 percent. in which case no employee of the Post Office Department in any category would receive an increase of less than $400. To connect the same argument to the pending bill. and apply it to an employee who today is working in the Post Office Department in grade 1. and is receiving in the neighborhood of $2.670. if we grant him a $600 increase. it would mean that anyone now employed under the classified system who is receiving $2.650 in GS3 would be getting under the bill we are now considering. S. 622. an increase of only $250. In other words. to point up the harm that can come from floor amendments. I am saying now that under the postal bill which we passed last Friday. anyone presently employed in the Post Office Department in grade 1 would get an increase of $600. whereas a comparable employee in the classified service. who receives $2.650. in GS2. would get under the bill which has been approved by the committee an increase of only $250. In that way. we would create in our Government a situation under which two men in the same family of Federal workers. receiving the same amount of money today. would. under the action of the Senate as the two bills now stand. S. 355. which was passed Friday. and the bill now being considered. the following difference in salary. The employee in the postal department would get an increase of $600. under the interpretation being given to the postal pay increase by some Members of the Senate. and at least $400. according to the interpretation which I believe was intended. but not made clear. On the other hand. the employee in the classified service. employed in GS3. would receive an increase ol only $250. I say to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota . while there is abundant argument for consistency. namely. that we ought to undertake in this bill to provide the same minimum of $400. as fixed in the postal pay billand it is hard to deviate from the argument of consistencythe fact still remains that this is what we are doing: To employees who work. let us say. in CPC 2. receiving in the neighborhood of $1.603. $1.700. or $1.800. we would give an increase of $400. which in fact would be an increase of 25 percent. I believe we would completely violate the provisions of the Wage Stabilization Act. Mr. President. I say very frankly that while I can adhere to the argument of consistency. I can also see the absurdity of proceeding in that way.","The language of the gentlemans amendment states \"as far as practical.\" It would not. of course. be found practical for the administration to change an existing labormanagement contract.","The answer is \"No.\" The Government has no power to fix wages or terms of employment during the period when it has the plant in its possession. nor will any award recommended by the Board be binding after the properties have been returned to the owners. The effort is made to provide a coolingoff period during which the processes of conciliation can work.","I will say this. that I have all the confidence in the world in the gentlemans statement. but I would like to have him give me or anyone else a list of two or three small packers that would not be able to pay this inspection fee. As I said. I am personally acquainted with many of the small packers in Chicago whom I have known for many years. among whom are the Oscar Mayer Co.. Pfaelzer Bros.. Inc.. and others. none of whom have appealed to me to support legislation to relieve them of the small cost of inspection. But I do know that representatives of the Meat Institute. representing the big packers. have been around to urge the saddling of the $11.000.000 cost of inspection upon the Government. As I stated before. both the large and small packers have made more money during 1946 and 1947 and are continuing to make greater profits today than ever before. Their reports show that their profits run into the millions of dollars. reaching the stupendous amount of $87.000.000 in 1947. and their profits for the first 3 months of 1948 show the same percentage of profits. as compared with profits of $56.000.000 in 1946. Yet despite the tremendous increase in earnings. the- big packers have refused to grant a small increase in the wages of their employees. Mr. Speaker. there is no evidence to indicate that the officials of the Meat Inspection Division of the Dapartment of Agriculture or anyone in behalf of the interests of the Government were given an opportunity to appear before the committee to testify in opposition to the bill or to show that for the past 9 months meat inspection. paid for by the packers. has been inadequate or suffered in any way whatsoever. In fact. with greater production during that period. meat Inspection has never been more efficiently performed. Mr. Speaker. I feel that the bill is not entitled to favorable consideration for the reasons I have given. I realize it will be impossible for me to sway you gentlemen. especially those of you on the left. who are advocating economy but come in with bills continuously increasing expenditures and causing more waste of our taxpayers money. So. in view of the conditions. I am opposed to the rule. although I realize it will pass. I am afraid that even though the bill Is unfair to the Government it will also pass. because you have the votes and. of course. what do you care about the people? Load everything on the Government.","Let me ask the Senator if this is the only amendment in the labor bill which in any way gives some autonomy to a local union. or are there othei provisions which seek to do that very thing?","What I know is this: I know that when an economic situation has become grave and the employees feel that the employer is refusing to even sit down and justly consider their demands. passions get awfully hot. When workers are forced to the extreme of a strike. which none of them wants to dono worker likes to strike. it is no pleasant pastime. it is a tough deal for everybody concernedbut when workers are forced to strike by an employer. they are going to see to it that no one else gets their jobs. His job is the closest thing to a property right that most workers have in this world. He believes he has a right in that job. and the Wagner Act establishes the fact that the striker is still considered as an employee. One court decision after another has definitely maintained that such is the basic law of the land. The Supreme Court has settled the issue by declaring that a striking worker is still an employee and is always to be considered as an employee of the struck firm. I will be glad at a later date to debate this entire issue on the floor of this House with the gentleman from Michigan. but I am not yielding any further today.","For the reason that the total acreage has long been established. When we have enumerated those which are under cultivation it is a simple matter to determine the number that are not under cultivation. In response to the question the gentleman has raised. let me say again. and permit me to emphasize it. that the question of the contribution of labor to the war is not involved. No man is accepted for this work who is not cleared by the War Manpower Commission. That was brought out in the testimony and that is the practice that has invariably been followed. As amatter of fact. most of the enumerators who have been accepted up to this time have been women who are not engaged in industrial occupations or have been farmers who are in winter quarters the first 2 months of the year. In January and February there are practically no farm duties except the farm chores. The enumerators follow their own time schedules. They are not paid by the day and are not paid mileage. It is.piecework. They have so many farms to visit and 2 months in which to visit them. They attend to the chores at home and devote such part of the day as they wish to enumeration. The work of the census will not take a single man away from war work. It will not subtract from the farm a single unit of manpower which could be used or is needed in the operation of the farm. So we may discard once for all the question which has been emphasized so strongly in the debate in opposition to the rule. In response to the suggestion that the department lready has the information to be compiled by the census and there is no need for a census. permit me to cite letters which I have here from the Secretary of Agriculture and the War Food Administrator. They came unsolicited. The Secretary of Agriculture writes: In agriculture as in any business activity It is necessary to have a periodic inventory to show where we are and it is especially important in time of war. Production in agriculture as you know In recent years has broken all previous records of production despite difficulties in getting labor.. machinery. and fertilizer. A census of agriculture at this time would give information about production In 1944 and will provide a benchmark for many other programs that will be necessary in reconversion. And may I have the attention of those who have insisted that we have other means of securing this information. The Secretary of Agriculture says further: The Department of Agriculture currently collects a large body of statistics about agriculture but these cannot replace the statistics supplied by a census. In fact the census figures provide the basis for backing up the Departments estimates. Here is his letter in full:","Mr. President. let me say first that I cordially agree with the able and distinguished Senator from Texas in his dedication to an unpartisan approach to this tremendously vital achievement which is so desperately essential to civilization. I take it this does not suggest that candid public discussion of the subject should be foreclosed. On the contrary. I take it. that. as President Wilson once said. we should seek open covenants openly arrived at. and that it is to the best welfare of the Nation that the problems of foreign policy should be laid frankly before the American people and discussed frankly out of the heart of our high leadership. so long as the objective is the welfare of our common undertaking. Mr. President. I agree with what the Senator from Maine has said about the work of the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I know of no experience in my 16 years in the Senate when there have been more generous. broadminded. and tolerant efforts to find a unity of purpose at all times. regardless of partisan politics. I join in thanking him for his observations regarding whatever contributions we have been able to make from this side of the aisle in the same spirit. I rise particularly. however. Mr. President. because of an implication in the suggestions made by the Senator from Florida . who seems to feel that we have already reached the point where we can leap ahead to the creation of a timetable which will foreshorten this entire enterprise any produce a quick net result. I think he suggested that if anyone has any difference of opinion regarding what is going on. he ought to express it now. and not later. Mr. President. I believe there is no fundamental difference of opinion regarding the objective. I think perhaps there is some difference of opinion among us as to the precise method which shall be pursued in arriving at that goal. In view of the suggestion made by the Senator from Florida I wish to take this occasion very briefly to lay down three or four fundamental points which will be my own continuous impulse In my continuing effort in connection with this great and vital adventure. The first thing I wish to say is that. in my view. if this foreshortened world cannot organize a permanent peace. then the murderous ingenuity of modem military science will make an end to our civilization in the next world war. and only those who are blind to these blasting realities. only those who can be complacent in the presence of global suicide. will fail to make every practical effort to organize the peace of this earth against any such calamity. To that objective I dedicate every prayer of my heart and every effort of my remaining years. Next. Mr. President. I wish to say that. from my point of view. it is too obvious for argument that this objective requires sound international organization to encourage the concord of good will. to stimulate moral and spiritual. as well as physical defenses. to establish organized justice under effective international. law as a substitute for force. to create the mechanisms which shall exhaust the rules of reason before there shall be appeals to might. and ultimately. if all these fail. to mobilize the military cooperation which shall defend the conscience of the world. Third. I wish to say that at the threshold of this aspiration it is equally obvious that the worlds criminals of today must be so permanently demilitarized that they can never become the criminals of tomorrow. To that end the immediate and continuous availability of Allied force is indispensable. This is elementary prudence. It is clearly the primary military responsibility of the four major powers. It is a temporary military alliance for a specific and limited purpose. as distinguished from a permanent alliance. Even George Washington. the great. original foe of entangled Americanism. recognized such temporary alliances as wholly legitimate. There must be no such complacency. in softer years to come. in respect to this repressive phase of the problem as was largely responsible for Hitlers sinister violation of Versailles. with the expedient and inexplicable and negligent consent of his subsequent victims. Now. Mr. President. we come to the question as to the part which military force shall play in the ultimate authority of this international organization which is to be charged with responsibility for the peace of the world. Let there be no doubt about my view that force. as a last resort. shall never be out of sight or out of mind or out of mutual reach. Military force will always have to be the answer to those who understand no other argument. But there can be deeply conscientious differences of honest opinion in respect to the inherent relative importance of military force in this equation. I am one of those who do not believe that our greatest hope for peace lies in trying to put peace in a steel strait jacket I believe that our greatest hope lies in adequate mechanisms to develop reason and justice in international affairs. which shall be predominately accepted by enlightened peoplesbacked always. I repeat. by constant vigilance against mobilizations of aggressive power. In other words. I doubt whether any hard and fast international contracts looking toward the automatic use of cooperative force in unforeseeable emergencies ahead will be worth any more. when the time comes. than the national consciences of the contracting parties when the hour of acid test arrives. In whatever degree this is correct. our final reliance. even in the mobilization of military forcewhich. of course. must be available finallywill depend upon the justice of the cause and the peace conscience of the world. It is for this reason. Mr. President. that I believe that a just peace. in the first instance. is the indispensable beginning of this great adventure. because in my view a good league cannot cure a bad peace. either now or hereafter. It is for this reason that I like those words in the Republican national platform. if I may refer to it not in a partisan sense but in a historical sensewords which have been amazingly misunderstoodwhich pledge the use of peace forces to stop the aggressors of tomorrow. Peace forces means to me whatever forcemoral. diplomatic. economic. or militaryis necessary to keep the peace whenever the emergency arises. Lia my humble view. the first three of these forces are likely to be more useful than the last. although the last must never be ignored and must never be unavailable. Let me add a final word to this swift summary. I want my country to play her full. legitimate. and effective role in this evolution out of recurrent world savagery. I believe she can play her greatest role by remaining always and forever the free. sovereign. and independent United States of America. I believe that her voice will always be the most disinterested and judicial voice in the concerts of the world. and such a voice should never be muted. I believe that we can collaborate wholeheartedly in building up the \"peace forces\" which shall minimize. and probably prevent. another World War tragedy. and I have no thought that we have parted with any essential sovereignty when. for example. we ourselves recognize justiciable issues in a greatly broadened and strengthened international law which we ourselves have helped to write. and which we approve. I have the profound conviction that if this international machinery is adequately created to implement a just peace. and again I emphasize the adjective. and if the major powers strive faithfully to organize and support these \"peace forces\" of the earth. any pirate of tomorrow who defies this process will be so clearly criminal in character and so clearly due for physical restraint that there will be no default. on the part of ourselves or of any others. in the united. voluntary military action which will produce invincible repression. Mr. President. that. in a general quick summary. indicates my feeling about this tremendously important subject. I think it ought to be plain that the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee. to which considerable reference has been made. in its conferences at the State Department has dealt solely with the question of international organization for peace. It has had no approach to the considerations involved in the writing of the terms of the peace itself. That has been outside our jurisdiction thus far. If there has been any sort of difference of opinion among Senators. the great difference has been over the inability of some of us to separate our conception of the international machinery which we are attempting to create from the type and character of the peace itselfthe type of a postwar status quo which our organization in the first instance must underwrite and undertake to sustain. My own very deep conviction. I repeat. Is that we cannot separate the possibility of final and conclusive success for our organization from the justice and the equity of the peace agreement which in the first instance it must undertake to administer. But in the present temper qf the American people and in the present approach which is being made to this subject throughout the country. if we will just credit good faith to those who want to publicly discuss the subject. I know of no reason why we should not proceed to a jaet result which will be a benediction on the world. I do not think there is any disadvantage in full public discussion. so long as it is wellfounded and proceeds in good faith. On the contrary. I think that in the last year or two our chief difficulty has been a lack of adequate public information about some phases of the problema lack of information which inevitably invites gossip and rumor and speculationa lack of information particularly regarding postwar understandings at Casablanca. Quebec. Cairo. and Teheran. Under the existing circumstances. particularly in the light of what is a very recent accord between high spokesmen for political parties in the United States respecting a mutual desire to achieve this goal. in my view the conference at Dumbarton Oaks meets under the hap.piest possible promise of good effect.","Has the gentleman made any particular inquiry with reference to the number of persons who have been taken off the farms in Indiana to fill these surplus jobs. in the light of the statement just made by the Secretary of Agriculture that in the 12 months ended last September. 1.500.000 persons had left the farms to go into other occupations. and in the further light of the proposal now being considered for the drafting of women and children to be placed on the farms as replacements for those who have left the farms to fill these unnecessary positions?","Mr. Speaker. I am going to be so bold as to say that unless this bill is passed the dairy farmers of upState New York will be in a situation not unlike the people of Egypt were at the end of the 7 years famine in that ancient time. The only difference is that before the 7 years of famine in Egypt there were 7 years of plenty. and Joseph. by his foresight. had planned ahead so that he stored up in the granaries supplies for both the cattle and the people. Today. Mr. Chairman. we are affected by a condition which has been brought about by a combination of circumstances which started back in 1935. of flood. famine. drought. and nearly every other plague that could be suffered by agriculture. For this reason I am taking the floor at this time to appeal to the House to come to the rescue of thousands upon thousands of dairymen who operate their own farms either wholly by themselves or with parttime labor and who are advocating or asking for the opportunity to have their hay transported from distant points and that they be given the cost of transportation of this hay from places outside the area in which they live.","In my judgment we are trying constantly to do that very thing. I am glad to know that every now- and then we have the assistance and joinder of some of cur Democratic brethren in that effort. Another item. on page 8. is $250.000 for farmlabor statistics. That auarter of a million dollars. I believe. should be stricken from the bill. The explanation in the report is not all convincing to me as to the present need of It. Those are just a few of the items that we should put under the microscope before voting on the bill tomorrow. In conclusion. I am very hopeful that from now on all of the debates on the floor of the House may be conducted in the same temperate spirit as has characterized this debate. We are dealing with large matters and our decisions may go far toward shaping the destinies of our country. It behooves us to keep our feet on the ground and our good spirits constantly.","The gentleman is absolutely right. and I am very glad to have his statement as he is one of few Members here who has always been mindful and appreciative of the cooperation of the East. The American Federation of Labor adopted the following resolution in support of the McCormack amendment: Whereas the refining of raw cane sugar in continental United States gives employment to thousands of workers affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. and Whereas the jobs and pay rolls of the sugarrefinery workers have been reduced since 1925 by the flood of refined sugar which has been imported into this country from Cuba. Hawaii. Puerto Rico. the Philippines. and other tropical islands. and Whereas a further loss in jobs and pay rolls will occur after 1940 unless these workers receive an adequate protection in the Sugar Act to be written In that year: Therefore be it .Resolved. That this convention. the fiftyninth of the American Federation of Labor. go on record as recommending that an adequate protection (through tariffs. quotas. or otherwise) be provided for the sugarrefinery workers in any sugar legislation which may be developed by Congress in 1940. and under no circumstances should there be any further expansion in the importation of refined sugar made in the tropical islands for our market. and be it further Resolved. That the American Federation of Labor does endorse and advocate protective legislation for these workers. Your committee recommends approval of the purpose of this resolution and would refer it to the executive council for study and action. The report of the committee was unanimously adopted.","House bill 1360. chapter 227. acts 1937. Authorize a Governmentuse system for penal institutions. preventing competition resulting from convict labor. That was in relation to the products of the State penitentiary. Senator CONNALLY. Speak out louder.","Mr. Chairman. I am interested in this proposition of appropriating money for the continuation and extension of the T. V. A.. because. as I have said before. I cannot forget that It was not the intention of the founding fathers in granting the power to impose taxes directly upon the people to confer an unlimited power of appropriation. They tried to insure. and intended to provide. that the Federal Government could only expend money as provided by article I. section 9. wherein it is stated: No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law. and a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures shall be published from time to time. I am fully cognizant of the fact that notwithstanding this limitation Congress has made large lump appropriations and justified them by and under the assertion that Congress deemed them to be for the general welfare. and by virtue of that clause of article I. section 8. which originally read: SEc. 8. The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes. duties. imposts. and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense of the Nation. To this section was added these words: \"and for the general welfare of the United States.\" which words have been construed to mean that whatever Congress. or a majority group. deems to be \"for the general welfare of the United States\" is a legitimate subject for the expenditure of money raised by virtue of the preceding power granted to Congress. Many of us will remember the powerful arguments and the elucidating and instructive statements made on this floor by one. than whom there has been no greater legal authority as a Member of Congress. the late Congressman James M. Beck. who said in my presence and in that of some of you. that there could be no grosser misinterpretation. and that old \"General Welfare\" was a usurper constantly destroying the purposes of the Federal Government and converting a government of theoretically limited powers into one of almost unlimited powers. I do not agree with those who contend that Congress has a right to so construe this article as to assume that it is an unlimited grant of power which warrants Congress in granting stupendous amounts. not only for the special and exclusive benefit of sections and States but for that of special classes. To my mind this has too often. as in the case in hand. meant a subversion of the Constitution. Subversion? Yes. it is my opinion that the act creating the T. V. A. is unconstitutional. I do not now believe. and I never have believed that the Federal Government has any authority under the Constitution to engage in such a project as this. obviously primarily designed for the production of electric power. The claim of the T. V. A. that its power production is merely an incident to improving navigation is so big a joke as to be almost a fraud. and it ought not to be permitted to be perpetrated. Those of us who listened to the testimony at the time we were drafting the McSwain bill amending the T. V. A. know that neither navigation nor flood control. nor national defense were the primary purposes of T. V. A. but were only incidental to the main idea and the plan of the originators. and for power production. Now under the cloak of authority in this T. V. A. Act. the T. V. A. as I see it has arbitrarily and with usurpation invaded the constitutional rights of the States. if the States have any rights left. or play any essential part in our scheme of Government. If the figures which are submitted mean anything. and they do say that figures will lie just as long as liars will figure. there is but one conclusion to be drawn from them. and that is that T. V. A. is engaged in unfair competition with and has deprived private companies of their business and their property without compensation or due process of law. and that the methods It has employed have not only been illegal. but unconstitutional. It is repetitious. but. I nevertheless reiterate that I was .long ago satisfied in my own mind that the electricity to be .generated. and that being generated under the program of the T. V. A. would not be and is not incidentally produced .by any bona fide navigation program. On the other hand it is deliberately and purposely produced for and by an entirely independent power program in which there is actually and incidentally included and intruded some navigation facilities. Out of the window with all this talk about national defense and the general welfare. as a smoke screen. I do not and cannot now be made to believe either that a highpower dam project costing $500.000.000. and producing half a billion kilowatthours of primary power and a billion and a half kilowatthours of secondary power is a necessary adjunct to or incidental to navigation or floodcontrol development of a river. Why. gentlemen. think it over. it stands to reason. as has been said. that power development is never the incidental result of flood control. but in fact is antagonistic to it. and necessarily so. Bona fide flood control requires that reservoirs be kept empty. not filled to capacity! Kept empty so that they will be ready to receive any flood that comes along. That is flood control. I will not take time to enumerate many other reasons. which satisfy me. as I have said. that Congress when it enacted the T. V. A. Act. went beyond its constitutional power and wished onto the taxpayers of this country. without authority under the law. the burden of the terrific expenses incident to the completion of this gigantic and tremendous T. V. A. program. which will eventually cost the taxpayers at the lowest estimate from a half a billion to a billion dollars. It is not solely a question of appropriation of money which is confronting you. as you consider this independent offices appropriation bill in connection with the T. V. A. There is a great deal more involved than appears on the surface. All these matters and things need. and must and eventually will have. a very thorough and a very complete investigation. I tell you Members of the House on both sides of the aisle that the eventual determination of all the legal questions involved. and they are very many. will have a very important bearing upon the question as to whether we are going to change our form of government. and as to whether or not a new social system is going to be established and evolved. and as to how extensive the changes are which will be made in the present system. While the underlying principles involved in this T. V. A. legislation may not affect your State or your constituents today. no man knows what the morrow may bring forth. I am of that group which has come to Congress since the original enactment of the Tennessee Valley Authority legislation. However. as a member of the Committee on Military Affairs I listened to hearings had before that committee on the McSwain bill. And in connection with discussions and arguments on the floor when that bill was before us for consideration. I said. in effect. I was satisfied that the three men who were at the head of the T. V. A. were usurping unwarranted and undelegated authority and were failing to comply with the purposes and intent of the Congress and the strict and unambiguous letter of the law. I said. moreover. they were impervious to any suggestion they were wrong. inclined to be intolerant of anything and everything with which they did not agree. I also said that their zeal and enthusiasm had led them to ignore the fact that as a Federal agency created by an act of Congress it was their obligation to carry out the intent of Congress as specifically provided in the act and that they would be held responsible for their failure so to do. I said that as a Board they labored under the obsession that they were above and beyond the law and responsible to nobody. That was said 2 /2 years ago. in substance. and I reiterate the statements with all the emphasis in my power. The time has come for an accounting and for holding these gentlemen responsible for their acts or their failure to act as provided by the act of Congress which created the T. V. A. It really is regrettable. from the standpoint of the welfare of the people. that the Board does not. will not. and has not rendered a full account of its stewardship. taken Congress into its confidence with respect to its plans. cease to arrogate to itself a nondelegated power and authority. and give Congress the opportunity which it reserved to itselfthe right to have and to approve or disapprove the plans to be submitted by this Board. in order that Congress. by so doing could keep its hands on the control against wasteful extravagance or unnecessary expenditure of the peoples money. And. further. in order that Congress may exercise the power which it reserved unto itself. and the right to regulate. guide. and to control the extent. sequence. and nature of the development to be advanced by the T. V. A. by and through the expenditure of public funds. Then again. I am interested. and particularly so. because in the last analysis the big T. V. A. problem involves those \"little regional T. V. A.s.\" which some people. pursuant to the program of the President and his advisers. would set up in the different areas of the country. among others one being that containing the New England group of States. I go along 100 percent with the Governor of my State and its people. who are everlastingly and forever opposed to delivery. ownership. or direct control of all natural resourceswater. minerals. and land and industries of the countryinto the hands of a centralized authority. I agree with him and them that \"the State exists for the people. not the people for the State.\" We of New England. and Vermont particularly. have thought. and still think. that. the States have retained and should retain some rights. You will find upon examination that Governor Aiken. of Vermont. Governor Barrows. of Maine. Governor Murphy. of New Hampshire. Governor Hurley. of Massachusetts. and Governor Cross. of Connecticut. to name only those in the New England area. are on record In opposition to the centralization program of the socalled regional planning proposals as drawn. I have spent several hours reading and digesting 168 pages of testimony before the Independent Offices Subcommittee. including the statements of the three directors and eight executives of the Tennessee Valley Authority. First. I should like to say a word of commendation of the subcommittee for its painstaking zeal in exploring the justifications presented by T. V. A. in its demand for a $40.000.000 appropriation. Before proceeding with my general remarks I should like to set forth certain marginal notes of comment adduced from the record of the hearing itself: Page 933: Speaking of the effect of T. V. A. as a floodcontrol project. Carl A. Bock. assistant chief engineer. stated that in the disastrous flood of January 1937 T. V. A. had reduced the peak of that flood at Cairo by about 6 inches. Chairman WOODRUM then asked: What difference would that have made In the damage. the inundation? Mr. Bock replied: That might have made the difference between Cairo being dry or being completely flooded. This is a gross misstatement of fact. I have here a photograph appearingcaption thereof \"Exhibit A\"-In the New York Times of February 4. 1937. showing the Cairo water front at the moment the crest of the flood was passing that point. This picture conclusively demonstrates the truth of the caption below stating that there was still 3 feet 6 inchesnot 6 inchesto spare at that time. Mr. Bock may not have realized that Cairo was saved by the cutting of the Birds Point spillway. which reduced the crest some 3 feet. This spillway was previously built by the Army engineers at a cost of $5.000.000 as against T. V. A.s $500.000.00J. Page 947: There are some tables presented as to estimated land purchases of Tennessee Valley projects. completed or under construction. and also on land areas flooded on Tennessee Valley projects. completed or under construction. which shed a new and startling light on some of the aspects of this program that have received too little consideration in the past. The five main river dams and reservoirs are Gilbertsville. Pickwick Landing. Wheeler. Guntersville. and Chickamauga. and the tributary stream projects are Norris and Hiwassee. The total area of land to be putchased for reservoirs and clearance on these 7 of 11 dams amounts to 912.950 acres. Bear in mind that this is a floodcontrol project. In the table below we find that the total \"area flooded in the area occupied or to be occupied by reservoirs by average 5year flood before the dam was started is 382.600 acres.\" Alongside of this we find an estimate of the area flooded under maximum conditions amounts to 541.800 acres. In short. to control the floods. we take out of useful production nearly a million acres to protect ourselves from occasional temporary floods of four and five hundred thousand acres. The average price of this land was $49.11 per acre. or $44.834.572. No figures are included as to the tax yield of this property. The 68.000 acres for the Chickamauga Reservoir averaged $101.52 per acre. which in these times means it must have been highly fertile and productive farm lands. I wonder if this Congress dreamed when the act was enacted in 1933 the gigantic scale upon which this program would be carried out. the extent to which the Government would be launched upon a program of drowning out fertile acres. while in the West another branch of the Government Is reclaiming desert land at the cost of as high as $600 per acre. Pages 971977: In this connection I should like to call your attention to a series of tables on pages 971 to 977. inclusive. Discussing the principal features of Wilson Dam. Norris Dam. Wheeler Dam. Pickwick Landing Dam. Hiwassee Dam. Guntersville Dam. Chickamauga Dam. and Gilbertsville Dam. for the first time we see revealed many vital factors that should be borne in mind in the consideration of further appropriation for this project. How many in this House realize that on these 8 dams aloneand there will be 11 or 12 in allT. V. A. has created inland lakes with a shore line of 5.701 miles? This is greater than the American shore line of the Great Lakes. it is comparable with the shore line of the United States on the Atlantic. the Gulf of Mexico. and the Pacific coast. How many of you realize that the schedule of land purchases. including the normal reservoir area of Wilson Dam. is 1.457.9 square miles? Remember that. according to the Army Engineers survey of the Tennessee RiverHouse Document 328. Seventyfirst Congress. second session. page 730the sort of flood that comes but once in 500 years would cover but 666.154 acres of land. or 1.040.8 square miles. Surely the Seventythird Congress did not dream that enactment of this law would mean the destruction of the hearths of 10.442 families. the uprooting of whole villages. the relocation of 8.776 graves. Under the heading of \"Towns Affected\" these tables show that 13 towns. with a total population of 37.900. will be affected. . Whether these towns will be wholly or partly drowned out. or in what way they will be affected. the tables do not indicate. . They do show. however. that 601.5 taxpayerbuilt highways and 8 major public bridges will be \"relocated\" by the greatest manmade flood in history.- They show that 61 miles of railroad and 16 major railroad bridges will also be \"relocated.\" Bear in mind these figures do not show the record for the proposed Coulter Shoals. Watts Bar. or Fontana Dams. which would add materially to all totals. . Under leave to extend my remarks. I shall incorporate an analysis which I have made of some of the important data which I have totaled from these tablesexhibit B. Page 980: We find here a discussion between members of the committee and T. V. A. experts about the very advantageous power contracts which the T. V. A. has concluded with certain industrial firms which it has induced to settle in T. V. A. territory. These include the Monsanto Chemical Co.. the Electro Metallurgical Corporation. the Aluminum Co. of America. and the Victor Chemical Co.. all of which enjoy a rate of approximately 2 mills per kilowatthouronehalf the cost of production. It was brought out that T. V. A. stipulates in its contracts with municipalities the resale rates by which the advantages of the low rates are passed on to the consumer. but that in these large industrial contracts no provision is made for the passing on in reduced prices of the benefits of T. V. A.s low rates. I think the Members of both sides of this House will agree to the remarks of Mr. DIRKSEN at this point: There are two questions I think are important here: If the Federal Government is going to spend some $505.000.000 for the development of this power and these people go in and get the benefit of that cheaper power. at least some of those benefits ought to be passed on to the consumers. And if it is not being passed on to the consumers. then we are just throwing millions of dollars Into the development of these projects that is not going to do the taxpayers of this country any good. and they are going to have to pay for the plants through taxation. And the second question is very important. in my judgment. and that is whether through the development of cheaper power the Tennessee Valley Authority is inviting industry from other areas so that at some time. when this development is completed. by reason of the necessity of meeting this competition they will have to move into that area and the result will be the closing down of plants in other sections and throwing more men out of employment. necessitating an adjustment in employment as well as location of industries. So far as my city of Peoria. Ill.. is concerned. we would have some objection to that. Page 1005: I wish to call your attention at the bottom of page 1005 to the reluctant admission by Dr. Martin G. Glaeser. acting chief power planning engineerfor the first time. to my knowledge. by any T. V. A. officialthat. to quote Mr. Fitzpatrick. itMight be Just as reasonable to produce it (electricity) by coal and oil or gas as by water power. Page 1007: That the T. V. A. has been in the business of selling electricity and making of rates for nearly 5 years now without ever having determined that part of its capital costs should be allocated to power. This in spite of the fact that for nearly 5 years it has asserted that its rates were to establish a \"yardstick\" by which the reasonableness of rates by private utilities is to be measured. Moreover. almost 21/2 years ago in the amendments to the T. V. A. Act. approved August 31. 1935. T. V. A. was specifically directed to undertake such a study and report it to Congress by January 1. 1937. It was given a year and 4 months to get up the study. and now. 2 years and 4 months later. in defiance of the law and the will of Congress. that allocation is not forthcoming. The same amendments require that allocations must be submitted in each annual report thereafter. and the annual report that was submitted December 31. 1937. did not contain such allocation. If the stockholders of a private corporation were so cavalierly treated and their wishes so ignored there would at least be a wholesale investigationsuch as Mr. MAVERICK and Mr. MAY propose for T. V. A.followed by a thorough housecleaning. As has been suggested on this floor. in the lobbies. and in the press. for a long time the Tennessee Valley Authority has been handicapped by a split within its directorate. The differences between Chairman A. E. Morgan. on one side. and David Lilienthal and Harcourt Morgan on the other are deepseated. The failure of these officials to agree upon management and control of the T. V. A. experiment is obviously a factor contributing to the confusion of the administrations power policy. President Roosevelt must have been concerned over this split for some time. for the T. V. A. is one of the favorite undertakings of the New Deal. But he has not succeeded in ending the row. In the recent hearing to determine the value of Senator BERRYS marble leases. concerning land flooded by the Norris Dam. the fight within the T. V. A. reached an explosive point. When the majority directors accuse the chairman of making false and malicious inferences. all hope of bringing about a harmonious working relationship between them seems to have passed. The President may find it necessary to intervene to bring some modicum of accord into the management of this vast experimental project. But the matter ought not to end there. Originally this was not a row between antagonistic personalities. Rather it was a clash between conflicting policies. Chairman Morgan favors cooperative dealing with the private power industry. while the other two directors seem more inclined to use T. V. A. facilities to force private companies into line with Government policies. The very fact that such widely different policies are possible under the terms of the T. V. A. Act suggests the vital interest of Congress in the matter. Policies of such vital importance ought to be determined by legislation and not by one Director who chances to hold the balance of power between T. V. A.s two Morgans. Certainly. then. this farreaching controversy indicates a very serious deficiency in the law itself. That management of the Authority is also in need of attention is pointedly indicated by Dr. Morgans virtual request for a congressional inquiry. In these circumstances an investigation into the T. V. A. ought to be one of the first items in the program of this 1938 session. By such a move Congress could give the T. V. A. a sense of direction that now seems to be lacking. It could turn to more constructive uses the energy that now goes into bickering and internal dissention. And. finally. such a move would give constructive impetus to efforts now being made to bring about an understanding between the Government and the privatepower industry. The fruits of such an inquiry should be rich. They might do more than court decisions to confine or eliminate the threat of T. V. A. to private business. which has paralyzed necessary refinancing in that territory and hampered it in other regions. The power to compete with industry and on a favored basis in one region involves the power to do the same thing in others. Congress should investigate before it invests another nickel of the peoples money. The responsibility for cleaning the house of the T. V. A. rests with its landlord. Congress. and not with the neighbors. In fact. every Member of Congress should approve such a congressional investigation as is contemplated. We are informed now that this allocation will be completed sometime this spring. Would it be fair to suggest that the T. V. A. deliberately chose to violate this law. rather than risk the introduction of its allocation of cost into the testimony now being taken in a trial at Chattanooga. which will test the constitutionality of the act and their administration of the act? I suggest this motive. inasmuch as this socalled navigation and floodcontrol program is at least 45 percent an outandout power program. according to the Comptroller Generals annual report for 1937. Acting Comptroller General Elliott therein states that. of the costs of the annual audit. 45 percent is charged to the generation and transmission of power. Pages 10081009: We discover on pages 1008 and 1009 the method by which T. V. A. intends to find a market for its power. A list of projects under the supervision of the chief project engineer at Chattanooga as of December 1. 1937. shows pending P. W. A. allotments to municipalities for the construction of systems competing with the privately owned utilities. In the State of Alabama. P. W. A. is ready to lend eight cities a total of $1.296.000 and. as a further inducement. make an outright gift of $974.999. Two cities in Mississippi will get loans amounting to $149.000 and gifts of $121.909. In Tennessee. 11 cities and towns will borrow $4.975.000 and receive as gifts $6.440.777. Middlesboro. Ky.. also will receive a gift of $89.000. The grand total of P. W. A. loans in the four States is $6.420.000. and the gifts are $7.626.085. But the total estimated cost of these 22 distribution systems -will amount to $23.897.802 because. while all cities accepted grants. some of them were able to borrow money at cheaper rates than the Governments 4 percent. At this point I should like to insert into the RECORD a startling ccmparison of ultimate power capacity of the Tennessee Valley Authority as against installed capacity of privately owned utilities within transmission range of T. V. A. power (exhibit C). The ultimate rated capacity of the Tennessee Valley Authority will be 1.878.000 kilowatts. whereas the combined steam and hydroelectric installed capacity of the privately owned utilities in the T. V. A. region amounts to 1.859.258 kilowatts. In other words. the T. V. A. is increasing installed capacity in its area by 100 percent. and to find a market for this power another arm of the Government is bribing cities by 45percent gifts to build their own municipal plants to the destruction of private industry. No eloquence of mine could be more persuasive than these cold figures as to one of the root evils of this administrations policies which have brought about the present collapse. Page 1019: On page 1019 we find an interesting item in the fact that this $320.000.000 Corporation pays taxes. And how much do you suppose it pays? Exactly $136.000. If T. V. A. paid 10 times as much. it would not compensate for the land alone that it has taken off the tax roll. Any private corporation owning $320.000.000 worth of real property would be forced to pay many millions in taxes. whether or not it earned a dime. In my opinion. and in the opinion of many Members of this House on both sides of the aisle. one of the most harmful and hypocritical phases of the T. V. A. program is its assumption of the role of a taxpayer. The fact is that it pays 5 percent of its gross revenue in lieu of taxes. There is not a private utility company in","Mr. President. I think this is too important a measure to be considered under the rule governing the proceedings of the Senate at this time. It calls for $70.000.000 for flood control. The Congress passed a bill at the last session authorizing some four or five hundred million dollars for floodcontrol purposes. It seems to me that the project provided for in this bill should come within the provisions of the act which has been passed rather than be acted upon as a separate measure.","Mr. Speaker. ladies and gentlemen of the House. I have this day introduced the following House joint resolution: Resolved. etc.. That there be hereby appropriated from any unallocated and unappropriated balances remaining from the appropriation made available by reason of Public Resolution No. 11 of the Seventyfourth Congress the sum of $1.000.000 to be used to relieve suffering and remove menaces to public health and rehabilitate stricken families and business concerns in the State of Ohio resulting from the recent floods in the Ohio River Valley. Said moneys to be distributed immediately and under the direction of the Administrator of the Works Progress Administration. The Ohio River is for about 175 miles the southern boundary of the district which I have the honor to represent. It is a majestic river. It is considered the most beautiful river in America and is better equipped to carry river traffic than probably any river in the world. The people in the Ohio Valley near this great river are perennially troubled with .disastrous floods. No one not having had experience with these floods can appreciate the damage and inconvenience they cause. I am glad to report that the Army engineers have given great consideration to the question of flood prevention. Already the Miami conservancy district in Ohio has been constructed and has proven its worth many times over. The Muskingum Valley conservancy project is now in the process of construction. A few more similar improvements on the headwaters of the Ohio and on its larger tributaries will go a long way toward the prevention of these floods. The flood of a few days ago was very destructive. especially in the northern reaches of the Ohio River. While the flood as it swept through the towns and cities of my district did not carry any imminent danger to life. still it did carry tremendous financial loss to all classes of people and a tremendous threat to the health and happiness of the people. In the eastern part of Ohio the water moved with greater rapidity and reached a higher level than the 1913 flood and caused much more damage. I had a letter sent me by Mr. Edgar R. Cochrun. of Steubenville. Ohio. who made a survey of the conditions in Jefferson. Belmont. and Columbiana Counties. with which letter he enclosed copy of an official report made by him to Dr. Carl Watson. who is Works Progress administrator for the State of Ohio. That report reads as follows: Official report on Ohio River flood conditions from Wellsville. Columbiana County. to Powhatan. Belmont County. filed with Dr. Carl Wtson. Ohio W. P. A. chief. by Edgar R. Cochrun. Steubenville. representing the American Legion in Jefferson. Belmont. and Columbiana Counties. The cities and towns covered by this report are Wellsville. Port Homer. Stratton. Empire. Toronto. Costonia. Steubenville. Mingo Junction. Brilliant. Warrenton. Martins Ferry. Bridgeport. Bellaire. and Powhatan. In addition. there are in the total a large number of stricken homes along this route that are not in any incorporated city or town. The total number of homes that were rendered uninhabitable by the flood is conservatively estimated at 3.000. A great many of these are mill families of foreign extraction. and the average per family runs high. The number of homeless people from Wellsville to Powhatan is not less than 15.000. and it may be substantially higher. Saturday and Sunday we covered the entire area and inspected many of the homes. Some had been wholly submerged for 6 to 18 hours. Others were inundated over the second story. The residential areas were clogged with sludge. silt. and debris. and the dwellinghcuse floors were similarly affected. The personalproperty loss in clothing. furniture. and foodstuffs cannot be calculated. Local agencies. with help from outside communities. have met the immediate emergency needs of food. medicine. and shelter. The refugees are crowded into school buildings. churches. and public and private halls. The health hazard is very great. as sanitation facilities are wholly inadequate. These unfortunate people are chiefly workers without surplus resources and with small credit privileges. The task of rehabilitating their houses. refurnishing their homes. and caring for them until they can safely reoccupy their homes is completely beyond the financial capacity of their local communities. A quarter of a million dollars made immediately available to the municipal authorities of this area would probably suffice to control the threat of pestilence. render habitable these homes. and equip them with modest quotas of necessary furniture. The job is essentially one of local rehabilitation. and our considered judgment is that it could best be handled by the regularly constituted local authorities. If the task is not done promptly. much worse conditions will certainly eventuate. The crisis calls for prompt action. If authority is lacking. the Congress is in session and should Immediately enact emergency legislation not only for the area covered by this report but for all of the districts which have suffered in the recent floods. This disastrous flood in its irresistible course inundated a large amount of territory in my district. beginning at Hockingport and ending at Haverhill. It maintained its reputation for causing damage. destruction. inconvenience. and ill health. In the cities and towns thousands of people were forced to abandon their ground floors and move upstairs. Hundreds of businesses. large and small. were forced to move out and build against the floods approach. Now that the waters have receded in hundreds of stores and thousands of homes there is the unsightly mud and filth and debris which brings such discouragement as would challenge the fortitude of the most stalwart. These people have been heroic in the -past. and they will clean up again if they can. Financial and business depression has already staggered many of them. and the damages caused by this flood will be an additional burden that many of them cannot bear. Government assistance that will help restore the homeless to their homes and to rehabilitate those whose hopes are crushed and whose personal belongings are practically destroyed would be real charity and would be money well spent. Many of the villages and municipalities in the wake of this flood are so financially depressed as to be unable to provide the necessary means to clean the streets and alleys and thereby remove the danger of an epidemic. It is my hope that the feet of those in whose hands rests public charity will run readily to the relief of these destitute. who are destitute without any fault of their own but by reason of a great. natural. superhuman calamity. Now is the time that relief is needed. Two weeks .from now may be too late. Out of this great calamity I hope there will arise such a public sentiment as will encourage the formation and completion of relief programs that will ultimately put an end to these destructive annual calamities.","Mr. Speaker and Members of the House. a most deplorable condition is existing in the neighboring city of Alexandria. which is only a few miles from the Nations Capitol.

That has been the construction placed upon this language during the years it has been in effect. it has been construed to have reference to mental or physical disabilities that incapacitated a veteran for the performance of manual labor so as to render him unable to earn a support. and those men who were on the roll on March 19. 1933. will on the 1st of next month following the passage of this measure receive pensions according to their degree of disability. If some veteran who has never been on the roll should apply. manifestly he would have to comply with the requirements just as those who have heretofore applied have complied with them. He would have to undergo an examination. and if it was determined that he was disabled to the extent of 50 percent from performing manual labor with which to earn a support. he would be put on the rolls at whatever degree of disability he was found to have suffered. That is the interpretation and construction of the language of the Veterans Administration of this proposal. not what it would be. but how a similar provision has actually been construed in the past.","Does not the gentleman think that some of the salaries paid relief workers are excessive?","Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD three addresses delivered July 9 by farm leaders of national standing. The first is by Edward A. ONeal. president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. the second by Charles E. Hearst. vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. the third by Earl C. Smith. president of the Illinois Agricultural Association. I hope every Senator will read these three addresses. In the main I agree with the statements made by these three farm leaders. This session of Congress has been a busy one. it has faced a most serious situation. it has struggled earnestly to enact emergency relief legislation. But. Mr. President. this Congress has not done its duty. It has refused to deal with fundamentals. It has ignored what seems to me to be a plain fact. that unless and until agriculture is placed in position where the farmer as a whole can receive the cost of production for his products there can be no real relief. there can be no return of employment. Wages are paid. in the last analysis. by basic commodities. The basic commodityprice level is too low. It is too low not so much because of surpluses as because our monetary system has broken down. Mr. President. when these farm leaders plead for the passage of the Goldsborough bill to stabilize the purchasing power of the dollar. they are pleading not only for agriculture but for labor. for industry. for business generally. They are pleading for an honest dollar for the benefit of 90 per cent of the people of this country. The Federal reserve system should be managed in the interest of the 90 per cent who are producers. not in the interest of the small percentage of the population who are primarily dealers in money. The plea of these leaders for the enactment of the Norbeck bill. as an emergency measure to force higher prices for wheat. cotton. and hogs. should be heeded by this Congress. I ask that these addresses be printed for the information of the country and the guidance of Congress.","I thank my colleagues for withdrawing their objections. As a practical matter. the operation of f this measure. if enacted into law. will prove very beneficial to the manufacturers and dealers in tobacco products. as well as to tobacco producers. yet no hardship will be wrought upon the Treasury. The bill simply amends and broadens existing law providing for the redemption of tax stamps affixed to articles to denote the payment of internalrevenue taxes. Under leave. I am including as a part of these remarks the reports of the House Ways and Means Committee on this bill. The measure was fully considered by that committee. and a favorable report was made thereon. Also. it was fully considered by the Treasury Department officials. especially those of the tobacco tax division. Not only did these officials approve the purpose of the bill but they also aided and cooperated in drafting it. They knew that its purpose was just and equitable. and they knew. in addition. how its provisions should be formulated so as to accord justice to the tobacco trade. and at the same time give full protection to the Treasury Department. At the instance of tobacco manufacturers and dealers. I introduced this bill on the 12th of last March. The Secretary of the Treasury on April 22. 1930. made to the Ways and Means Committee. under reference. a favorable report thereon. That report is included with the original report of the Ways and Means Committee filed on June 20. 1930. favoring the passage of the bill. A few days ago I again conferred with Treasury officials concerning the provisions of the bill to ascertain if. upon further consideration. they had any changes or modifications to suggest. I was again assured that the measure. with inclusion of the simple amendment suggested by the Secretary of the Treasury. and reported by the committee. represented the views of the Treasury Department on the subject. and that they favored the enactment of the bill in this form. Under the regulations which the Treasury Department will promulgate. if the measure is enacted. it is understood that taxpaid tobacco products in the hands of jobbers and dealers. when damaged or rendered unsalable. may become the subject of these refunds. as well as similar products in the actual hands of manufacturers and importers. However. it is expected that the jobbers and dealers will make. with the manufacturers and importers. satisfactory arrangements whereby the Treasury Department may deal with these refunds through the manufacturers and importers. All this is a matter of departmental detail. and the officials of the Treasury Department will desire to frame and to carry into effect regulations which will be reasonable and workable. Tobacco products. after being taxpaid. may be injured through fire or water. through shipment and transportation. and also through other causes. In addition. as pointed out by Secretary Mellon. certain brands on the market may become deteriorated. and the manufacturers may desire to replace the same with fresh and marketable articles. Such replacement would mean the sale of more tobacco by the producer to the manufacturer and the utilization of more labor in manufacturing the new goods. and in placing them in the hands of the dealer. New tax stamps will be required and there will be no appreciable loss of internal revenue taxes. In brief. Mr. Speaker and Members of the House. permit me to say that the justice of this measure seems to be so obvious that a statement of its purpose should suffice. The reports of the Ways and Means Committee on the bill are as follows: [House of Representatives. Report No. 1995. Seventyfirst Congress. second session I","Mr. Speaker. the alarming rate of increase in the importation of lumber and of coal from Russia should arrest the attention of everyone who has at heart the Interest of American industries. It portends. in the judgment of those who are familiar with the situation and the plans of the Soviet Government. a farflung and rapid invasion of the entire industrial field of this country. In voicing my protest in this matter. I venture to speak not only as a representative of the manufacturers of Pennsylvania. but also as the representative of the miners and mechanics of Pennsylvania. In todays newspapers we read of the proud boast of the Soviet Government that a Red army is being trained to protect and advance the interests of the socalled proletariat against the capitalist nations of the world. We have been reading of the determined effort of the Russian Government to crush out the last vestige of religion in that country. And now there comes to our ears with gathering force the reports of an ambitious 5year program. the materialization of which would flood American markets with the convictmade goods of a government gone mad with desire for power and without scruple as to the method of its attainment. I. for one. believe that it becomes the duty of the representatives of American industry and of industrial workers to see to it that the plans of the soviet schemers are foiled. If the reports are true. that the coal and the lumber which are now being imported into this country are produced by convict labor. the United States authorities haye the power to handle the matter. In its issue of February 23. the Philadelphia Public Ledger carried a statement from the pen of Henry D. Baker. formerly American commercial attachd to Russia. that those commodities imported in growing volmne in this country were the products of convict labor. Mr. Baker also elaborated in detail on the plan of the Soviet Government to use prison and forced labor to promote production required for its program of raising cash abroad. I learn that the Customs Service Bureau has been advised of recent articles published in London newspapers in relation to the hardships of prisoners at work in large Russian timber camps. An agent of the United States Treasury in London has also advised his home office of reports. which he could not confirm. to the effect that convict labor was also being used in the coal mines of Russia. Inasmuch as I have already pointed out that the United States customs laws exclude from importation to this country all products produced by prison or forced labor. I think a situation presents itself which calls for immediate action. It is my understanding that the question has been referred to the legal branch of the customhouse service and I. for one. insist that the importers of any Russian goods be compelled to produce satisfactory evidence that the goods in question have not been produced by prison labor and. in the event evidence to that effect is not furnished. clearance to the same at all American ports of entry be denied. Although only about 250.000 tons of Russian coal were imported into Anmerica in 1929. indications are that this amount will be doubled in 1930. and it is said that the development of the Russian program would result in the importation of three or four million tons within a relatively short period. The plan of the soviet is to send to this country its increasing surplus of coal. This coal enters the United States free of customs duties and for the reason that the industry is a government monopoly it does not have to be operated at a profit. The big idea of the Soviet Government is to secure cash and any such item as depletion. which must be taken into account by American producers. is quite unnecessary in the Russian scheme of things. The Russian miner receives but a ruble a day. and that means a present purchasing power of about 17 cents a day in American money. The Russian miner has no alternative. If he does not work for. that wage. he does not receive one of those cards. without which he is unable to purchase any of the necessaries of life at the government stores. He also does not have the right to unionize against the government or to strike. There is no work in Russia other than work tinder the monopoly of the government. which controls fill work. In other words. as I have said. he must work at the rate of 17 cents a day or starve. We all know of the more or less unhappy plight of our coal industry due to the wellknown fact that there are \"too many mines and too many miners.\" and it does not require any far cry to picture the evils that would follow in the wake of more serious competition with a product that Is produced at the Russian wage. I can think of no more effective way for the Soviet Government to develop a communistic attitude on the part of American miners than to create a situation whereby American coal would compete with coal.produced by labor that was receiving 17 cents a day. Regardless of the disastrous effect it wouldhave on Anmerican industry. the issue I would raise concerns the very serious effect it would have on the morale of our sturdy miners who have already suffered in no small measure from an economic situation over which the industry itself had no control. I demand that this situation shall not be aggravated by the competition to which I have referred. and I would caution everyone not to minimize this situation on the ground that the present importation was relatively insignificant. It is a beginning and I have always held to the theory that the proper time to operate was before the disease reached serious proportions. No far reach of the imaginati6n is required to visualize the magnitude of Russian importations within the next decade if the present policy of the soviet is pursued with its present degree of relentlessness. It is all very well to prate about the danger of openly antagonizing the Soviet Government but I. for one. have no qualms on that score. If there is a law in the statute books. as there is. that no products of convict or forced labor shall be imported into this country. I demand that that law be enforced. There are no \"ifs\" and \"ands\" concerning this entire matter. It is an openandshut proposition. and action at once is imperative. It should be a simple matter to determine whether or not forced or convict labor is producing coal and lumber which are now being shipped to America from a government which has already declared war on religion and which boasts of the mobilization of a red army of millions to destroy the socalled capitalist governments of the world in the name of the common people of whom. as a matter of fact. that very government is a mortal enemy. Free men shall not compete with the slaves of a godless government.","Mr. President. this plan of valuation suggested by the Supreme Court is so impractical that it seems to me that Congress must take cognizance of the situation and pass legislation that will give us a stable rate basis. Unless we do this. with the price of material and the price of labor and the price of building operations continually changing. there will be a rate basis that is as unsteady as is the changing cost of living and the changing cost of the building and rebuilding of the great publicutility systems of the country. and if this uncertainty Is to continue. there can be but one refuge for the people of this country. and that would be the public ownership of the public utilities. and particularly of the railroads of this country. I am not today advocating public ownership. but it Would have certain advantages that it is impossible to realize under the hodgepodge valuation system with which we are now confronted. We would know the costs upon which rates were to be based. The valuation would be fixed. We would have a certain fixed return upon the bonds with which the railroads were paid for. We could have an amortization that would retire the bonds. and the railroads would become a public utility for service rather than for manipulation and expensive litigation. because equally as bad as. if not worse. than the unstable basis of our rate structure. as a result of this decision. is the invitation to litigation which that decision holds. I was rather impressed with the summary of the Philadelphia Record as to what this decision means. It sums it up as follows: For the commission. the decision means that It will continue the prodigious labor of bringing valuations down to date under the new instructions. For the railroad. it offers no prospect of a big Jacking up of rates. but a gratifying assurance that they will not have to reduce their charges. For the public. it signifies no drastic rise in the cost of living. but the quenching of hopes for lower transportation costs. And for a large number of. corporation lawyers it promises years of profitable employment. So I say this decision leaves us in a worse position than we were in before. because the commissions work has been upset. the commission has been told that the valuation basis is not satisfactory. that a higher valuation must be given. and yet no real basis of valuation has been set out. Now. what can Congress do about it? What should Congress do about it? There are two or three things that Congress might do. If this higher valuation of from eleven to twenty billions of dollars is to be added to the railroads. if the meaning of the decision be that reproduction costs are to be the basis. then Congress might amend the act of 1920 by providing that the return shall be lowered from 6 per cent to 4 or 41/ per cent. Whether or not the court would declare that rate so low as to be confiscatory we have no means of knowing. but Congress at least would show its intention and purpose in that connection. A second thing is that Congress might specifically provide what percentage or what amount of consideration shall be given to reproduction cost in fixing the valuation of the railroads. Whether the court would overturn that. I do not know. Nobody knows. I think. however. that if a reasonable proportion of the valuation were based upon the reproduction cost. the court might permit it to stand. Then there is a third thing that the Congress might do. especially if we are to pass the consolidation legislation which is now pending before the Congress. We might require. as a condition for consolidation. a fixed and stable and fair valuation of the railroad properties that are to enter into the consolidation. And. of course. the last resort would be Government ownership of the railroads. as I suggested a while ago.","I want to finish this contribution to the information of the Members of the House. McKinley said there. with 20.000 people in the arena in which he spoke. \"I do not believe in a cheap coat because a cheap coat inevitably will make for a cheap man.\" That may not have been the most intellectual argument that could be made on the tariff. but for some inscrutable reason it had the effect of carrying that big crowd off its feet and it went wild with enthusiasm for McKinley and for the utterance he had delivered with respect to what makes for a great. selfrespecting people. In that utterance the masses found comfort. They saw in it good wages which make for decent. upstanding American men and women. It makes for that purchasing power. without which the wheels of prosperity are slowed up. if not stopped altogether. You can not beat them down into poverty. you can not clothe them in shabby attire. put them on halfsoled and broken shoes. and expect them to live up to the highest traditions of a great Republic like this. [Applause.","Mr. President. the bill referred to in the resolutions was intended as an amendment to the House bill to amend the World War veterans act. 1924. but that bill was disposed of by the Senate before Consideration could be given to my amendment. I therefore reintroduced my proposed amendment as a separate bill. S. 5046. on January 4. and it has been referred to the Committee on Finance. As is stated in the preamble to the resolutions of the American Legion Auxiliary. the compensation paid under the World War veterans act to or for children amounts to only $10 per month for one child and $6 per month for each additional child. when there is more than one in a family. and these small payments terminate when the children reach the age of 18 years. It is evidently assumed that a child should be selfsupporting when he or she becomes 18 years old. No one will deny that the average boy Is physically able to do manual labor at this age. and girls of 18 also can be put to work of some kind. but is it right to arrest their education at this immature age and deprive them of the training they will sorely need to make a living for themselves and to assist in providing for their 1.927","Let me make one appeal to the Committee on Immigration. I beg of you on bended knees to give some consideration to the various bills now before the comnittee to admit at least the mothers and fathers of citizens as nonquotas. and to give some consideration to those bills now before the committee that will In some way facilitate the entry of minor children and wives of aliens who have been here at least three years and who have decared their intention to become citizens of America. The President of the United States recommended that in his message to Congress. and I appeal to the majority who want to support the President to at least humanize the act of 1924 to that extent. Mr. Speaker. as I have already said. I realize that under suspension of the rules there is very little time in which to discuss such an important bill. This bill deals with human rights. Every provision in it affects human beings. Let it be known that under the suspension of the rules no Member is permitted or has the opportunity to offer any amendments or to bring about any change in the bill. In other words. this bill is being considered under limited debate and must be either taken as a whole or rejected. I venture the statement that a bill coming from the Committee on Agriculture and dealing with livestock would not be considered in this fashion. I therefore protest against this method of forcing through a bill so fundamentally important as dealing with human lives and human liberty without full and complete discussion and without an opportunity to offer for the consideration of this House certain 10867 changes and amendments which some of us. owing to our experience and knowledge of this human question. desire to do. Now. there is no question as to the right and desirability of deporting vicious criminals. The present. law permits that. There is no difference of opinion as to the necessity of deporting vendors of narcotics. The sale of narcotics is a crime today. Deportation of an alien convicted of this crime is provided in the present law. I would go along and was Inclined to go along to provide for the deportation of aliens convicted as in this bill provided for a term of 18 months if. and I say \"if.\" the crimes were specifically enumerated. Unless these crimes are enumerated I see great danger of oppression and the opportunity of the commission of grave Injustice. It would not be a difficult matter to enumerate the crimes. The simple index of a penal law would do that. But. gentlemen. I received some very startling information in the last few days and I have learned of the hope expressed from certain sources for the passage of this bill in order to intimidate workers and curtail every attempt of workers to improve and better their condition. Under the bill as it now stands an alien who might have peacefully resided in this country for nine years and been a lawabiding citizen. if he happened to be arrested for picketing while his industry was out on strike. would be deported. I do not want to deport such an alien. In this day of suppression of speech and with the wave of intolerance that is now sweeping certain portions of our country a man might find himself behind the bars for a period of one year and deported for the mere expression of an opinion. Oh. do not tell me now that you do not desire to countenance the overthrow of our Government. I do not. That has nothing to do with It. The law as It now stands fully takes care of that. But. gentlemen. what do you say when I tell you that a resident of New York was sentenced to over a years Imprisonment for reading the Constituti.on of the United States on the steps of the city hall of a New Jersey city? Were he an alien. under this bill lie would be deported. No man ought to be imprisoned or deported for reading the Constitution of the United States and the Declaration of Independence at any time anywhere. That typifies. however. the attitude in some communities and it typifies the state of mind and the intolerance which predominates often at times of industrial disputes and conflict between employers and employees. Do you not see the temptation and the possibilities for grave abuses and miscarriage of Justice when a labor dispute is going on and workers simply exercising their constitutional rights of bettering their conditions and in the heat of the dispute a minor misdemeanor might be committed and the offender sent to jail for a year and then deported. That Is why I believe that deportation following conviction and a sentence of one year should be only for crimes specifically enumerated. Include the bootlegger. there is no serious objection to that. No man is compelled to bootleg hootch to buy bread for his children. But many men are compelled to go on strike in order to protect the bread of his children and the very life of his children. Do not classify this man with the dope peddler and include him in a blanket provision for deportation. As to the provision for the deportation of aliens who have become public charges. I believe that the bill should be amended to clarify those cases. and not to place the burden of proof on certain cases where the alien has become a public charge and is incapacitated for life by reasons wholly due to his work and occupation In this country. Will anyone kindly tell me how an alien who may become insane or become totally Incapacitated by the \"bends\" owing to his work in an underriver tunnel. working in chambers of highly compressed air. will be able to prove his case under the provisions of this law? IIe may be here without relatives. If he is Insane he surely can not prove his case. and on the certificate of the doctor that the insanity or physical disability is due \"to causes existing prior to Immigration\" lie would be deported. Surely that is not the intention of the committee. but that is what this bill will do. If this bill were discussed under the rules of the House a simple amendment that where lite public charge of the alien is the result of insanity or physical disability front Industrial causes. for industrial occupation. the burden of proof shall be on the Government to establish that the disability was due to causes existing prior to entry Into this country. Such an amendment would in no way change the policy of deporting public charge aliens. but would simply provide a fair. honest American way of giving such an unfortunate person a square deal. Now. gentlemen. In closing let me say that we have been in session for seven months. The Committee on Immigration has worked no doubt. but to date no bill has been reported which would in the slightest way humanize the present cruel act of 1924. Nothing has been done to heed the prayers of thousands of splendid men and women who literally on their bended knees have begged Congress to permit them to get their mothers and fathers or wives and children to join them in this land of ours. An appeal was made by the President of the United States in his message to Congress of December 3. 1925. Let me read what the President said: If It (the act of 1924) deprives them of the comfort and society of those bound to them by close family ties. such modifications should be adopted as will afford relief. always in accordance with the principle that our Government owes its first duty to our own people and that no alien Inhabitant of another country has any legal rights whatever under our Constitution and laws. It is only through treaty or through residence here that such rights accrue. But we should not. however. be forgetful of the obligations of a common humanity. There is not a restrictionist. no matter how extreme he may. be. who can truthfully deny that the present law deprives many people of the comfort and society of those bound to them by. close family ties. No one will denyand I have heard the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Immigration say In a speech in my citythat great hardship and suffering was being caused by the separation of families. and especially of aged mothers and fathers. Yet no relief has been given. Was the President sincere in his recommendation? Do you of the majority party desire to follow the President? Do you of the majority party want to support the President? If you do. a bill granting relief to old fathers and mothers. to wives and young children waiting on the shores of foreign lands to come and permanently stay with their dear ones in their pew adopted country should be reported and passed before this session of Congress terminates. I introduced a bill. H. R. 482. which would bring relief without In the slightest disturbing the policy of immigration established by the act of 1924. My bill would give nonquota status to wives and children of aliens who have resided here three years and have obtained their first papers. My bill would give nonquota status to aged fathers and mothers of citizens. Gentlemen. that is asking little enough. That surely Is in keeping with the Presidents recommendation that \"we should not be forgetful of the obligations of a common humanity.\" The provisions of my bill would make thousands of families happier and make them more useful and better citizens. But. I repeat. no action by Congress. Why. there are several bills introduced to humanize the act of 1924 and to grant relief. I repeat. not one has been reported. Distinguished spokesmen for the President and his administration have introduced bills similar.to mine. I repeat. no action by Congress. I have. not the slightest pride of authorship. I would support any bill that would reunite families. I would work. vote. and fight for any measure which would eliminate sorrow. abolish distress. and wipe away the tears of the splendid men and women who are asking their Congress to permit them to send for a mother. a father. a wife. or a child. In my district it was stated in a bitterly contested congressional fight that the administration was pledged to this very measure. it was solemnly pledged that the President and his administration would -pass a bill which would reunite families. I ask the majority. Are you going to keep the pledge? I have kept faith with the people in my district. I can look every man and woman in the eye. because I have not broken a solitary pledge made to them before. during. and aftbr the political campaign. It is time to act. Human souls are in .distress and suffering moral misery. Why. my friends. right here in this act before you. if we could amend. I would offer a suggestion to give the Secretary of Labor a quota number for every alien criminal who is deported. Permit the Secretary of Labor to use this quota number to admit some old mother who is being kept away from her chil-. dren by reason of the quota law. Is there anything unreasonable in an ambndment of that kind? Of course not. Gentle-. men. many of you simply do not understand and do not knowi how many families are suffering. You have no contact with them in many of your districts. You believe that we are seeking to lower the bars permanently and entirely by asking these humane amendments to the existing law. Some charge us with being hyphenates and seeking only to cater to certain racial groups. That is not so. Come into our districts. Get acquainted with these fine men and women. who work hard and deprive themselves of all amusement and the luxuries of life in order to reunite and have all of their family in the land they dearly love. Come into my district and get acquainted with those splendid Jewish. Italian. Polish. and Irish families and you will find but two purposes to which the head of the family is devoting his life. one to care for his motherI and father. have them come here and live with him. and the","Mr. Speaker. listening to the discussion on Here we have -before us a measure which might be called a this bill and noting the opposing interpretations of the Consti- doubleheader.

I am quite sure that committee is about finishing up Its labors. and I do -not believe there will be much more time required by it.

Beginning on line 11. page 10. the committee has seen fit to segregate the amounts that can be expended for any purpose. Take the item for salaries and wages. $600.000. Suppose there should be a demand for $610.000. would the Army be allowed to use any of the amounts that are appropriated for other purposes under. this Item for that amount. or would they have to come in with a deficiency?","Mr. Speaker. in the time allotted to me I will endeavor to discuss the provisions of H. J. Res. 325 as they appear to me. When I say that it seems to me this Is a matter of political pretense and not of political construction. I do not speak in any partisan spirit. There was no partisanship in the tarrying on of the war. there should be no partisanship in so important a thing as the negotiation of peace. Therefore I present my views of this resolution entirely without regard to partisanship. but based upon the legality and power of each of the three distinct elements in our governmental life. I start with the assumption that the country wants to have the absolute knowtedge that there is to continue to be an executive. a judicial. and a legislative body. all acting within their proper limits. Already we hear criticisms that the courts are going outside of the construction of laws. that they are making laws. we have heard. too. of the alleged encroachments of the executive: we are now facing a proposition of the encroachment of the legislative. and I think that the basis of our American prosperity in a governmental way Is to make sure for all time the absolute separation of the executive. the judicial. and tie legislative. Therefore. in calling attention to what I do regarding this resolution. I beg your indulgence if I quote literally from the resolution. because I do not believe much in fighting windmills nor speaking in glittering generalities. I want to present to you the solid facts in this case. as I see them. The gentleman from Pennsylvalia . a very excellent student of international law. said that this was a mere declaration. The gentleman from South Dakota . an honored soldier of the Great War. said in his statement at the beginning. \"We may as well sweep aside at first the question of the constitu. tionality of this measure.\" Now. these are two very important premises. To them Iadd a third. The gentleman from Kansas ]. the chair- man of the Committee on Rules. said. in answer to an inquiry as to why AustriaHungary was not included. \" Wily. we may only include that which the President has sent in his treaty as it was when sent to the Senate. We may only act upon what was sent to the Senate.\" These are statements of responsible men. and I beg you for a moment to take consideration of them with me. In the first place. I challenge the statement of the gentleman from South Dakota that we are to sweep aside all questions of constitutionality. Because if we sweep aside all questions of constitutionality. then we sweep aside the basic law of government in the United States of America. I agree with the gentleman from Pennsylvania that this is a declaration. and I need go no further with him than he states for himself that it is merely a declaration. Being a declaration. what does it amount to? How can it affect anybody? What good does it do? It can only be of effect when it attains the dignity of a treaty. and a treaty can only be of effect when it attains the dignity of a completed contract made in the way prescribed by our Constitution. These are the legal propositions that I want to make as strongly as I can before this body representing American citizens in this most important matter. Now. the question has arisen. as the gentleman from Pennsylvania stated it. that it is a declaration of the end of the war. Well. it is all right if it stops therea declaration of the end of the war. The President has said that the war is at an end. We know that. and everybody knows that. But there is a. difference between the ending of a war and a treaty of peace. and the latest thing which this House has had and upon which it has acted has been the consideration of the bill H. R. 6810. in the report upon which the following appears as the statement of the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary. the gentleman from Minnesota . Ie states \"That war exists with both Germany and AustriaHungary needs no argument. The armistice only suspends actual hostilities. and until treaties of peace have been ratified there is no peace.\" That was stated in his report to accompany the bill H. R. 6810. and It was acted upon affirmatively by a great portion of the Members of this body. even over the veto of the President. It was sustained by the Supreme Court of the United States. so that we have this as the present law of the land. that until the Congress of the United States takes affirmative action in the matter of legislation which it has a right to pass by a repeal of that legislation. there Is no repeal of such legislation. and until there be a treaty of peace and presidential proclamation there is no. recognition and acknowledgment of the agreement of warring nations of the terms and conditions of that governmental contract which ends war and provides for peace. These are the propositions I bring to you. I say the resolution provides terms for a treaty and goes further than the statement of the gentleman from Pennsylvania that It is a mere declaration. because In section 3 it states this: The German Government shall duly notify the President of the United States that it has declared a termination of the war with the United States and that it waives and renounces on behalf of itself and its nationals any claim. demand. right. or benefit against the United States or its nationals that it or they would not have had the right to assert had the United States ratified the treaty of Versailles. It does not refer to the end of the war and peace with the AustroHungarian Government. which is no part of this resolution. although it should be. if the resolution were open to amendment. because every man can see that It is necessary to make a number of amendments to clarify this resolution for even proper consideration in its acknowledged scope. But that is now foreclosed and I will not speak of it further. There is in what I have quoted an absolute statement that we advance beyond that which the gentleman from Pennsylvania calls a declaration of the end of the war and invade the province of treaty making. There is absolutely no question about it. It has been established beyond a peradventure of a doubt by the very scholarly address of the gentleman from Mississippi and by the splendid speech. too. of the gentleman from Texas that when it comes to the making of a treaty of peace there Is constitutional warrant for only one way. and that way lies through the President of the United States. with the approval and consent of the Senate of the United States. We may act upon that which we have done. We may repeal that which we did in declaring war. Let us do it. I stand with you. Let us sensibly enact the intent of section 2. and I will stand with you. because I say that the people of America today have the right to be relieved from oppressive war legislation. I stand with you and ask you to present on the majority sideand I will go as far as any one of youtile repeal of all laws that without warrant or necessity","Right In connection with what I am saying now. I have a table that is a fair criterion of what those wage figures show. that I propose to put right Into the text now. in connection with what I am saying. Now. let us see about those \"excessive wages\" demanded by labor during the stress. when war was on. when everybody was expected to be patriotic. and almost everybody was patriotic except a lot of profiteers. What did the unions demand in the way of wages? I have *.one through these tables and taken the highest wages that I could find for any city in any North Atlantic State. and the lowest that I could find. and I have put them into this table in order to show the trend of things. These are tile wages that union labor demanded in this country. Union labor can always command better wages than individual labor can get. and so this may be taken as the high tide of the appeal of labor for enough to live on. Let us see if it is excessive. let us see if it is $6. $8. or $10 a day for ordinary labor. for the man with the pick and the shovel. Let us see whether labor is less patriotic than the employers. According to the unionlabor scale of the 15th of May for bricklayers the highest vages they demanded in the North Atlantic States were $5.95 a day for eight hours labor. and the lowest were $5.15. Building laborers. evacuating scaffold men. and so forththe highest wages they demanded. according to the union scale. were $3.82. and the lowest $2.40. in the North Atlantic States. At that tine their wages vould not purchase more than 50 per cent of the necessaries of life those samne wages would have purchased before the war. For carpenters the highest wages demanded by union labor on the 15th of May. 1918. was $5.20. and $4.36 the lowest. Engineers. portable anrd hoisting. $0.66 the highest wages. $4.58 the lowest. Hod carriers $4.40 amid $2.56. Split that in two and you have what the moncy would purchase according to the scale of the prices of the necessaries of life at any time before the war. ihat is. $1.28 a day at the fair prices of the necessaries of life before the war and $2.20 a day. Yet. a man will stand on this floor and talk about ordinary labor demanding $6. $8. and $10 a day. Painters. $5 and $3.66. Plasterers. $5.86 and $4.58. Plasterers laborersthose are the fellows who carry the mortar for the plasterers. I suppose-$4.12 and $2.56. Plumbers and gas fitters. $5.50 and $4.12. Sheetmetal workers. $5.50 and $2.75. Structural iron workers. $6.78 and $4.58. Structural iron workers (finishers helpers). $4.40 and $3.30. Blacksmiths. $6.52 and $4.16. Boiler makers. $6.30 and $4.77. Machinists. $8.10 and $2.50. Machinists were the very highest paid mechanical labor in the country last May. when the purchasing price of tile dollar was less than 50 cents. 3Aoulders (iron). $5.80 and $3.66. Pattern makers. $7 and $2.75. Granite cutters. $5.72 aind $3.66. Stonecutters. $5.50 and $4.12. Mr. President. that is what organized labor demanded. We have some labor bureaus organized under the Federal Government. During that same period of time last summer they were seeking enployment for men out of work and they got eInployment. and they put down in this bulletin the wages they were able to obtain for tie men for wioni they secured employnlent. So I have here another table. Mr. President. the employment table. the actual results of the bureau organized to secure employment for unemployed people In the United States. I am going to ask leave to print that table as a part of my remarks in the CONGRESSIONAL ECORD. I have selected. in so far as the table shows it. the very same employments that I selected for the first table. so that there can be a comparison Instituted between what union labor demanded and what the United States Bureau of Labor or its subordinate organizatioins were able to secure for the labor that it placed in employment over the country. I will not take tie time to read It. It corresponds very generally with i lie s.me figures that are here. and I will ask to incorporate it withoit reading in my remarks.","That is substantially true. but the Government has borne all increases of wages out of its Treasury. but this can not happen under private control.","You put it on on crude oil and your AntiSaloon League will not last two days.

We know the penalty .that that nation has paid by becoming anation more addicted to straight alcohol than any other nation on the face of the earth. Sweden is now striving to struggle back again and once more get control of this great business. .. Now. I want to say this to the men on the floor of this House: I have some patience with the man. who talks prohibition and practices it. I have less with the man who talks it but lives as wet as the sea. The men who.talk prohibition and send liquor to their friends are beneath the contempt of decent men. We men are introducing a program that bids for a universal violation of the law.

You would buy that by the bottle to put in your home. and you would say to yourselves. we are fighting \"demon rum.\" Listen: If the principle of prohibition is right. we should enact it into law. and we should enforce that law if it takes a standing army to do it. If the principle of prohibition is wrong. we should oppose it on the ground of principleand not as a matter of dollars and cents. not as a matter of saving any mans commodity.

I desire to be heard on the amendment. As I understand the purpose of this amendment. it is simply to correlate and coordinate the work of this proposed bureau with the work of the Bureau of Public Health. I see no objection .to that amendment and am heartily in favor of it. While I am on my feet I want to say with reference to this bill that it seems to me it is in entire harmony with the tendency. and the proper tendency. of the age in which we live to legislate along lines of humanitarianism and justice for man as man. As I have been sitting here. I have been thinking of some of the laws that have been passed in recent years that go directly to the benefit of the men who toll. Here are some of these laws. not all of them of course: The various safetyappliance laws. laws for the regulation of the hours of labor. the legislation to secure better sanitary conditions. the establishment of the Bureau of Mines. the establishment of the Childrens Bureau. the establishment of the Department of Labor. and many other laws that have for their purpose direct benefit to the men who labor. It seems to me. Mr. Chairman. that this is an entirely appropriate kind of legislation. I am in hearty sympathy with it. and have supported all of it that has come before this House while I have been a Member. and I shall support this bill and all similar measures in the interest of the workingmen of this country. Some question has been raised here as to the desirability of the second section of this bill. Personally I do not deem that section of as much importance as the first section of the bill. yet I see no valid objection to it and shall support it. My attention has been called to what has been accomplished In other countries by such a museum as is contemplated in this section. In the report which was alluded to by the gentleman from New Jersey . our late colleague. Mr. Bremuer. made reference to similar museums in Europe. As will be seen by referring to the report of the committee. reference is made to the fact that similar museums have been established in Amsterdam. Barcelona. Berlin. Brussels. Budapest. Copenhagen. Dresden. Frankfort on the Main. Gratz. Helsingfors. Munich. Odessa. Paris. St. Petersburg. Stockholm. Wurzburg. and Zurich. that in these museums various safety appliances have been collected together. and that from time to time instructive lectures are given there upon this line of work. In his very able brief on. this subject. our late colleague. IIon. Robert G. Bremner. says:","Referring to this amendment. in connection with the suggestion made by the Senator from Mississippi to the Senator from Utah that this debate has developed the fact that it is the labor unions. and not the tariff. that fix wages in the mining regions of the country-","The Senator from Utah has stated excellently an additional reason. As I said. the Committee on Appropriations would be vested with jurisdiction on .a great variety of matters. A law like this. which should be carefully framed by the Committee on the Judiciary. or other similar committee. might be enacted as an amendment to an appropriation bill. and that. too. entirely without adequate examination. From the standpoint of legislation our laws would lack that accuracy which comes from consideration by the respective committees of Congress. Probably the illustration here is about as bad as any that could be imagined. Mr. President. I wish to speak very briefly in regard to this Commerce Court. There has been a great deal of discussion in this country. and I think I may say in some other countries. regarding the desirability of special courts. such as patent courts. courts of admiralty and of commerce. The general result. I think. has been the development of subdivisions as part of a more elaborate judicial system. I recognize fully the objections advanced by some arising from the tendency of specialists notto take that broad view of questions which may be a desirable element of all judicial decisions. Another objection commonly allegedthough I do not believe it is entitled to much forceis that the judges will entertain a certain partiality for those having litigation before them. as a result of which such organizations as the railways or important patentees or great vessel owners will have advantages before the courts possessing jurisdiction over their respective matters. But it seems to me that the arguments in favor of this court are almost unanswerable. The experience of every lawyer will testify that the judges of our different circuits and also of our different State courts manifest an unusual degree of hesitancy in deciding upon these great questions of transportation. They involve a separate branch of the law. which has assumed the utmost importance and which acquires additional difficulty because of constantly changing commercial conditions. Instances have been frequent where judges of the United States circuit courts have postponed for weeks. months. and even for years the decision of important railway cases. The first argument for the Commerce Court is the promptness with which decisions can be reached. The court has shown certainly a most remarkable record in this regard. The judges are more ready to decide these questions. It is apparent that a special tribunal organized for this purpose can arrive at much prompter decisions. Again. Mr. President. there is an undoubted advantage in having.here at Washington a special court which deprives the railway company of its power to go before any judge who may entertain a friendly bias and bring up its case in any circuit it may select within the territory touched by its lines. The most important cases decided by this court. Nos. 50 and 51. relating to the long and short haul. were filed in the month of November. 1911. They were decided promptly. and went to the Supreme Court in February. where they have since rbsted. Now. what would have been done had It not been for the existence of this tribunal? A suit would have been filed in California or New Mexico or anywhere along the railroad line between Chicago and the Pacific coast. The litigants could have selected their own judges. In. filing petitions they could have resorted to that court whose docket was the most congested. and if they felt the case was likely to be decided adversely. they could have selected the tribunal where conditions promised the greatest delay. It has been said here with- a great deal of earnestness that you do not need any such court as this. and it has been alleged that the functions of the Interstate Commerce Commission are judicial. Mr. President. it is contrary to the fundamental idea of our Government to vest in any one official body functions which are at the same time executive. legislative. and judicial. The Interstate Commerce Commission is primarily. as I interpret it. an administrative body with quasi legislative duties. but not with judicial functions. To give all three powers or functions to one body would be contrary to every idea of good government. The conclusive answer to the claim that the Commerce Court takes away judicial powers from the commission is found in the House bill. It does not eliminate judicial review. True. it does take it away from this court. but it gives it to tAe district court of the United States with the consequent delay. first. of a resort to the circuit court of appeals and then to the Supreme Court. Even then you have the same judicial review. but by a number of Judges with varied opinions colored by the legislation of different States. instead of by one body that can promptly decide cases and send them to the Supreme Court. Now. it is maintained that this tribunal has usurped the functions of the Interstate Commerce Commission.","Mr. Chairman. in reply to what the gentleman said about it being hard to say what is raw material and what is finished product. I will say that raw material has been Intellgently defined to be \"the lowest and crudest form in which a commodity enters into commerce.\" That means when wool is baled and ready for market. cotton. when first placed upon the market in the form of lint. hides. in the crudest form in which they are offered for sale. corn. in the condition it was when taken from the stalk. and so forth. I insist that raw material Is not a proper subject for tariff taxation for revenue purposes. because every cent levied upon the raw material is compounded several times before it reaches the consumer. thereby assuming gigantic proportions by the time the finished product is ready for use. Mr. Chairman. the excuse given by the authors of the pending bill for putting a tax on raw wool is. that because of the depleted condition of the Public Treasury the taxing of wool became a revenue necessity. The resolution upon the subject adopted by the Democratic caucus sets forth the reasons for its action in putting a tariff of 20 per cent on wool better than I can do. so I will let it speak for itself. It reads as follows: Resolved. That the bill revising Schedule K. as presented to this caucus by the majority members of the Ways and Means Committee is not to be construed as an abandonment of any Democratic policy. but in view of the Democratic platform demand for a gradual reduction of the tariff and of the depleted and depleting condition of the Public Treasury. a result of Republican extravagance. a tariff of 20 per cent ad valorem on raw wool is now proposed as a revenue necessity. I think the two main facts set forth in that resolution can be clearly controverted. First. it is insisted that the adoption of the resolution was not to be construed as \"an abandonment of any Democratic policy.\" Mr. Chairman. if Democratic platform declarations and or-. ganized actions of Democratic lawmakers in all of the Congresses that have convened in the United States for nearly threequarters of a century against a tax on raw material can be construed to be Democratic policies. then the declaration of the action of the present Ways and Means Committee in putting a tax on raw wool Is a contradiction of that part of the caucus resolution which declares that it is not to be construed as \"an abandonment of any Democratic policy.\" I do not see how the committee could have done anything that would have been a more complete abandonment of the Democratic policy on the tariff question or a more complete turning of the face of our party In the direction of the doctrine of Republican protectionism than they did when they put a tariff on raw wool. Second. there can be no necessity for levying a tax upon the necessaries of life until after every opportunity to raise revenue by taxing luxuries has been exhausted. Woolen clothes are absolutely necessary for the laboring people of this country. while silks. diamonds. and rubber used in the manufacture of automobiles for joy riders and the crazy rich to exploit themselves in. as they did in Indianapolis a few weeks ago in a series of wild races that left death and destruction in their wake. are luxuries. and ought In all fairness be taxed for revenue purposes before a single cent of tax is laid upon wool. Statisticians tell us that if the tax was taken off of wool it would reduce our revenues about $15.000.000. Now. in order to meet that deficit. let us see how easy it would be to make it up by putting a tariff of 20 per cent on the luxuries that I have just mentioned. Last year $67.000.000 worth of raw silk was admitted into this country free of duty. A 20 per cent duty upon that would have brought us $13.400.000 of revenue. nearly enough within itself to have wiped out the deficit caused by taking 20 per cent off of raw wool. Over $100.000.000 worth of raw rubber. used to manufacture automobiles. and so forth. was admitted free of duty last year. A 20 per cent duty on that would have raised more than $20.000.000. and quite a number of millions could have been added to our revenue by a 20 per cent tariff on the diamonds that were admitted free. Thus it can be seen that it was not absolutely necessary to place a tariff of 20 per cent on wool in order to meet revenue deficiencies caused by the extravagance of the Republican Party. None of the articles I have mentioned are necessary for either the comfort or happiness of the toiling people of this country. and hence are proper subjects of taxation according to the declarations of Democratic platforms. On the other hand. woolens are worn by the humblest of our citizens. I am informed that miners. who delve deep into the earth from one years end to the other in order to eke out a meager existence. are compelled to wear woolen clothes to protect themselves from the Inflammable dangers that always attend them while at their work. It is hard for me. as a Democrat. to understand why the gigantic Rubber Trust. headed by exSenator Aldrich. of Rhode Island. should be allowed to receive its raw material free of duty. to be used in manufacturing pleasure machines. while woolen manufacturers are required to pay a tariff of 20 per cent Upon the raw materials that they manufacture into woolens to be worn by miners. sewing women. and hod carriers. And now. Mr. Chairman. I offer my last Democratic authority for placing raw materials upon the free list. It is taken from a speech made by William J. Bryan. in 1892. while a Member of Congress. a speech which. in my judgment. has not been surpassed before or since as an argument in favor of reforming the tariff by placing raw materials on the free list. I will read it: It also takes away entirely those specific or compensatory duties which were added to the ad valorem rates to enable the manufacturers to transfer to the back of the consumer the burden which a tariff on raw material places on the manufacturer. The reason why I believe in putting raw material on the free list is because any tax imposed on raw material must at last be taken from the consumer of the manufactured article. You can compose no tax for the benefit of the producer of the raw material which does not find its way through the various forms of manufactured products and at last press with accumulated weight upon the person who uses the finished product. Another reason why raw material should be upon the free list is because that is the only method by which one business can be favored without injury to another. We are not. in that case. imposing a tax for the benefit of the manufacturer. but we are simply saying to the manufacturer. \" We will not Impose any burden upon you.\" When we give to the manufacturer free raw material and free machinery. we give to him. I think. all the encouragement which people acting under a free government like ours can legitimately give to a free people. Mr. Chairman. if that is not Democracy. I beg some one. in Gods name. to tell me what it is. But we are told that Mr. Bryan has no right to suggest anything to this Congress about legislation. that. when he does. he is meddling. I hold no brief to speak for the gentleman and am not fortunate enough to have an intimate acquaintance with him. I have met him in a formal way on a few occasions. but I have heard and read much of him. and in that way have come to know him to be one of the ablest. cleanest. and most upright characters that it has ever been my good fortune to meet. As an officeholder his career was short. only having served .two terms in this House. but In that time his superior ability and splendid statesmanship enabled him to make a name and fame for himself that no one occupying a similar position for the same length of time has been able to make for himself since the foundation of our Government. His clean life has been an incentive and encouragement to every ambitious American youth to live a better life. and his wise and able utterances and noble actions have given him a worldwide fame that no other private citizen has ever enjoyed. The corrupt interests of this country have been doing everything in their power to crush and drive him from public life ever since the purity and integrity of the man was known to be genuine and true. They have had \"twobyfour\" critics nagging at his heels ever since he sprang into renown. but his lofty life. noble purposes. and splendid statesmanship have kept him so high above them that they have been unable to place a single stain upon his good name. They have assaulted him upon every side with coarse. brutal vituperation and villification that would have caused any other man to have hurled their infamous criticisms back at them in kindred language. but in defending himself against their unjust criticisms he has not uttered a single word that could not have been used in the most sacred pulpit in all our land. Without wealth to attract the silly social to his feet or patronage to allure hungry place hunters to his shrine. he has created for himself a popularity that has fairly rung around the civilized world and has made for himself a name far greater than that of any other private citizen of his or any other time. Several years ago I had the pleasure of attending a reception given to Mr. Bryan at Louisville. Ky.. upon his return from abroad. and in reaching the hotel the committee In charge of him had to proceed through several miles of streets that were packed from the brick walls on either side to a point in the center of the street where the conveyances could hardly move without pressing the toes of persons near by. It was a scene wonderful to behold. and to see a private citizen attracting such attention and receiving such applause as was being heaped upon him upon that occasion was a revelation to me. and I so stated the fact to a correspondent of the St. Louis Republic. who was riding in the conveyance with me. and he replied that it was wonderful. but he said that it was much more wonderful to see him attracting the same kind of attention and applause In foreign Countries. He said that he was detailed by the Republic to travel with Mr. Bryan in Europe for five months as its special correspondent. and that it made no difference whether they were in London. Paris. Berlin. or any of the other great metropolitan cities of the Old World he was received by immense crowds and with much applause. While on that trip he was received and entertained by royalty on more occasions than one. made many speeches. and received much applause. and he came out of it all the same plain. everyday Democrat that he was when he bade his native shore goodby. and he insulted no one while he was doing it. What other private citizen. according to the history of the world. has been able to do as much? The pity of It is. Mr. Chairman. that a fellow citizen. who has done so much for the plain people. who has done so much to better the manners and elevate the morals and statesmanship of his country. a man who is the peer of anyone who has lived with him or before him. should have carping critics eternally nagging at his heels. critics that will compare with him in manners as the fox fire that shines by night compares with the bright noonday sun in brilliancy of light. will compare with him in intellect and statesmanship as the pace of the snail compares with that of the fleetest charger that ever gave mount to Arabian knight. and in morals will compare with him as the water that percolates through the barnyard drain compares in purity with the saltpurified waters of the mighty deep. We all know that he is not an angel. but we know that he has been one of the greatest apostles that ever went forth to proclaim justice and right between man and man. Mr. Chairman. I ask in all sincerity who has done more in this age of the worlds progress for the betterment of the conditions of our splendid country than Mr. Bryan? Mr. Roosevelts popularity is but a reflection from the popularity of Bryan. for all of his progressive ideas were first possessed and proclaimed by Bryan. The legislation that has been enacted at this session of Congress. of which so many Members have boasted and which has received the unstinted applause of the American people. was first advocated by Bryan. For 16 years he has gone forth preaching the doctrine of righteousness and justice and proclaiming against special privileges of every kind until the minds of the people have been so crystallized upon the subjects that he has been advocating that they have sent us here as their representatives to put Into law the declarations of that great and good man. And yet. with all that he has done. when he opens his mouth to suggest a welldefined Democratic principle concerning a great economic question pending before Congress. he is denounced by some of the Members of this House as being an officious meddler. Has it come to that. Mr. Chairman. that a great Democrat is denied the privilege of expressing his opinion upon a great Democratic question pending before Congress? Have we reached a point where a man who has done so much for his country as W. J. Bryan has done dare not express his opinion. to be accepted for what it is worth by Congressmen. without being condemned for doing so? Mr. Bryan has just as much right to h is opinion about the legislation to be enacted by Congress as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee or any other Member of the Iouse. and to deny him that privilege would be a denial of free speech in a country that has unfalteringly contended for that sacred privilege from its foundation. When Members of Congress become so selfopinionated or so large in their own estimation as to become offended when any of our fellow citizens suggest the propriety of the enactment or nonenactment of certain legislation by Congress. It is time for them to be retired to the private walks of life. The humblest citizens of our country have a perfect right to freely suggest what their servants shall or shall not do when it comes to legislating for them. I saw it stated in several papers immediately after Mr. Bryan made his recent declaration in favor of placing raw wool on the free list that some of the Members of the House who had favored free raw wool before he made his statement were against the proposition after reading what he said about it. I hope the newspaper reports of the matter were not true. for I can not understand how a man large enough to represent 190.000 people in Congress could be so small as to turn against a cardinal Democratic tenet that was in existence before Mr. Bryan was born simply because that gentleman saw fit to express himself In favor of it--a party principle that was being advocated by Members of the House before he declared his views upon the pending bill. It may be statesmanship for a Member of Congress to change his position upon a great party question because some one takes sides with him about it. but. to my mind. it is the smallest statesmanship that could be defined by man. and I have but little respect for those who possess It. It has been stated that Mr. Bryan was seeking to destroy the harmony of his party In Congress. but I do not believe it. There are certain kinds of harmony. however. that ought to be destroyed. whether in Congress or out of it. Political harmony should not exist anywhere at the enormous cost of the sacrifice of great political policies. and I for one am ready to do everything in my power to cast the harmony of my party to the four winds of the earth if in order to retain it I would have to turn my back upon the principles of the Democratic Party on the tariff and my face toward the protection policies of the Republican Party. Mr. Chairman. in order to show the great sacrifice that would be demanded in order to preserve certain kinds of harmony. I will say that there has not been a day or an hour since the fall of the angels that there could not have been absolute harmonly between hell and heaven if the saints of heaven had been willing to yield to the sinful influences of the demons of hell. and there has not been a day or an hour since the fall of Adam when the virgin and the streetwalker could not have been in happy harmony if thevirgin had surrendered her sweet virtues to the impure thoughts and infamous suggestions of the streetwalker. there has not been a day or an hour since the sacred pulpit of the religion of our God was established upon the earth that its occupants and the dive keeper could not have gone hand in hand down the pathway of peaceful harmony if gentlemen of the cloth had been willing to partake of the vices and adopt the habits of the dive keeper. I love harmony. Mr. Chairman. whether in church. business. politics. or society. but when it comes to paying such prices as those indicated in the enumeration just made in order that it might exist. I say. to the winds with \"harmony.\" I regret very much that anything has been said by Democrats to cause anyone to believe that Mr. Bryans counsel was no longer coveted by the party. I. sir. as one of its humblest members. unhesitatingly state that whenever it becomes too good or too bad to need or desire the counsel of men of Mr. Bryans stripe that it will be too good or too bad for me. as the case may be. It has been said that Mr. Bryan is a dictator. but that I strenuously deny. For one to be a dictator he must occupy some position of authority. To accuse Bryan of dictatorship because he has declared for free raw wool may have the unfortunate tendency to confirm the conjecture that he who makes such an acquisition may have fallen under the influence of the protection interests of the country. I hope the charge was only a careless expression caused by a momentary eruption of mind. but charges of a political dictatorship against Mr. Bryan are suspicious. and their proper analysis will force the conclusion that that kind of warfare upon him originated with the plutocratic elements of the country. No man can be a political dictator who does not hold a public office. a party chairmanship. or who does not belong to any inside clique. or has no special business interest or affiliations. or who can not pull a single secret wire in politics. or who has no political or other power except the confidence which an overwhelming majority of the American people repose in his true fidelity. Bryans political power consists solely in the wellearned confidence that lie enjoys beyond that accorded any other citizen of the United States. He no longer even enjoys the doubtful power of a possible candidate for the Presidency. for he has distinctly declared that he will not again be a candidate for that office. It is inevitable that the power of such a man as Bryan shall always be dreaded by corrupt politicians. but they make a great mistake when they attempt to injure this gallant patriot by unwisely declaring him to be a dictator or a boss. It has been stated that it was not through the efforts of Mr. Bryan that the Democrats are in control of the House. and that those who won the victory accepted the challenge he made when he declared himself for free raw wool. Mr. Chairman. he who says that Mr. Bryan had nothing to do with the election of the Sixtysecond Congress either exposes his own ignorance upon the subject or deliberately misrepresents facts in regard to it. I remember to have read a speech delivered by Mr. Bryan in Indianapolis last fall in the interest of Senator KERN and Mr. KORLY. in answer to a speech delivered in that city one week before by Theodore Roosevelt In behalf of the candidacy of Senator Beveridge for reelection. No abler or more effective plea was ever made to an audience for Democratic supremacy or for Democratic candidates than Mr. Bryan made upon that occasion. and I am advised that he made speeches of like import in all parts of Indiana. as well as in other States. and to my mind those speeches had more to do with the election of the Sixtysecond Congress than those made by any score of speakers who took part in the campaign. I call upon the Representatives from Indiana to repudiate what I say if they can truthfully say that Mr. Bryan had nothing to do with the election of 12 Democrats to 1 Republican to this House from that State. I remember among other things said by him in the speech made in Indianapolis. that was accorded wide circulation throughout the country. that the Sixtysecond Congress would be asked to reduce the expenditures of this Government. thereby lightening the burdens of the people. and he said that they would need Mr. KERN in the Senate and Mr. KORBLY in the House to help carry out that reform. that the Sixtysecond Congress. would be called upon to adopt a resolution amending the Constitution so as to provide for the election *of Uiited States Senators by the people. thereby taking it out of the hands of corruptionists. such as those that compelled the election of a certain Senator from Illinois. and he said they would need Mr. KERN in the Senate to vote for that resolution and Mr. KORBLY in the House to vote for it. He said that the Sixtysecond Congress would be called upon to pass a bill providing for the publication of all expenditures and contributions before election that were used or made for the election of Presidents and Vice Presidents. so that the people would know before they cast their ballot what interests made contributions and proposed to control the elections in this country. and he said that they would need Mr. KERN in the Senate and Mr. KOaBLY in the House to vote for that proposition. Mr. Chairman. I might go on and name other great measures that this wonderful Democrat stood there and appealed to the voters in behalf of and urged them to cast their ballots for the Democratic nominees in order that they might be carried out. but time will not permit me to do so. I will. therefore. bring the matter to a close by asking if any of you think that Mr. Bryan had nothing to do with the election of the Sixtysecond Congress? I do not believe there is a man upon this floor that will subscribe to such a belief. Oh. Mr. Chairman. what has Bryan done that he should receive strictures from anyone? It is true that he has been an unsuccessful nominee for President three different times. but in all of those contests he came out of them as clean as when he went into them. No man can point his finger at a single speck or spot that he made upon his political record in either of those contests. When this country declared war against Spain because of Its inhumanities to those of Its subjects at our door he promptly offered his services and his life. if necessary. to maintain his countrys honor. It is true that Mr. Bryan has not in every instance represented the policies of our party as I understood them. but he is so much my superior in Intelligence and statecraft that I do not know whether I am entitled to take issue with him upon them or not. He at one time favored Government ownership of railroads. I was opposed to the proposition. but who can tell whether he was right and I wrong. Nobody will be able to tell who was right until we see whether the gigantic railroad combinations of this country are going to respect the laws enacted by Congress regulating them or whether the courts are going to Fee that they are enforced. But why complain of Mr. Bryan for differing with his party on that question when we do notcomplain of Democrats In this House who. only a few months ago. advocated upon this floor the creation of a Tariff Board. to be appointed by a partisan President. to gather such facts and figures concerning the tariff as might be desired by the party of the President that appointed the board? If Mr. Bryans position upon the railroad proposition was undemocratic. certainly the position taken by Democratic Congressmen in advocating the creation of a Tariff Board was undemocratic. It is true that he opposed the election of the Democratic nominee for governor in his State during the last campaign. but why should we compain of that when we accept in the best of fellowship certain Democratic Members of this House who bolted the Democratic nominee for President in 1896. In the one instance only one office in a State was involved. in the other the chief officers of the Nation and the vast horde of inferior officers to be appointed by the President were Involved. Let us be generous and just with Mr. Bryan as well as with those Members of the House who turned their backs upon their party nominee when every economic interest of the Nation and the life of the party. almost. depended upon the result of that election. Mr. Bryan has been the greatest expounder of the principles of humanity this country has had within my lifetime. and no one can truthfully say. I care not how low and degraded he may be. that that illustrious political knight. that splendid advocate of manhood. that true apostle of righteousness and justice between man and man. has ever lowered the standard of any cause for which he has fought. whether making his fight for them in this country or anywhere else in the wide. wide world.","Mr. Chairman. this amendment of mine is unquestionably subject to the point of order. but I present it for the purpose of again calling to the attention of this committee the manifest Injustice that obtains in the substitute carrier service. Under -existing law a substitute carrier is paid at the rate of 30 cents an hour when employed. He may take the place of a carrier who earns $1.200 a year. and if that carrier be absent without pay. I believe that the substitute should get the pro rata pay while serving for the absent carrier. provided the department Is not also paying the absentee. Now. the carrier service In the big cities. in first and second class offices. is recruited from these substitutes. They are compelled to serve. under existing conditions. on an average of four years before they go into the regular service. Rarely is it the case that one of them receives $40 a month. yet for four years they struggle on in the hope of being called into the regular carrier service. They are compelled to buy uniforms. They are at the beck and call of the department from 6.45 In the morning until 5 at night. and. as I say. they frequently work four years as substitutes before they reach the regular service. When they do get into the regular service it is in the lowest grade. and in which they must serve for a year or more at a salary of but $12 a week. Now. If my amendment obtained. it would not burden the department. It would not draw upon the funds of the department to any greater extent than under the prevailing system to allow these men the pay of regular carriers who are absent without pay. Yesterday the gentleman from Kansas . explaining why the $500 labor class was stricken out of the bill. stated to the committee that it was because of the impossibility to get men to work at a fixed salary of $500 a year. yet here are men who have passed a civilservice examination requiring considerable mental skill. who are eventually to become carriers In the service. working In the department for four years at the miserable rate of $40 a month. Everybody knows that the carrier service is a splendid branch of the service in which to be employed and that these men are ambitious to reach it. They toil on at a pay that will not cover their expenses. no matter how economically they may live. Many of them are married men and must apply themselves absolutely to the work of substitutes. When they do reach the regular service many of them are in debt. for no man can support a family on $10 per week these times. and it Is many years before they get out of debt. Now. it means this that unless some change is made In this system. unless some provision is made to properly pay substitutes. we are going to get a cheaper class of men in the service. because no man with a family. no man who lives decently. cau afford to struggle with such discouraging conditions for four years. We ought to provide these men at least a living wage. and we ought to do so Immediately. I offer this amendment solely for the purpose of again calling the attention of the committee to the fact that a desirable change ought to be made. some remedy afforded to the 5.000 men in this branch of the service. that will insure the maintenance of the splendid standard of efficiency and integrity which now characterizes the carrier service of the country.","The Senator from Indiana stood here a few days ago and read speech after speech of the President of the United States in which he had promised the American people in the main a reduction upon these tariff schedules. Why are not the Senators who are controlling this legislation as desirous and solicitous for maintaining the integrity of a Presidents promise which had been written into a thousand newspapers. which had been written into his public address in this Chamber on the 4th day of March. and about which there can be no quibble. instead of insisting here about promises of which the Senate. so far as I know. has no knowledge direct from the President? There is in the Presidents message. however. a discussion as to the danger of allowing oriental immigration into this country. and pursuing that same line I. for one. am opposed to allowing the product of ofiental labor to come into this country as against that of the American workingman.","I submit a concurrent resolution and ask that it may be printed and lie on the table. At a subsequent time I propose submitting some remarks in regard to it. The concurrent resolution was read. as follows: Rcsolvcd by the Senate (the Hose of Reprcsentatives concurring). That the Secretary of War be. and he is hereby. directed to cause such survey and examination to be made of the existing canal and locks at the falls of the Willamette River at Oregon City. Oreg.. as may be necessary to ascertain what sum of money at present prices of labor and material should be appropriated by Congress. In addition to the appropriation already made by the State of Oregon therefor. to enable the Government to acquire said canal and locks and properly repair the same.","Now. these four paragraphs on page 14 relate chiefly to laborers of the same class as the-","Of course. Mr. President. I recognize my inability to discuss this question with so able and learned a Senator as the Senator from Massachusetts. and I realize that it wotlld perhaps be much better for mi if there had been a childlabor law when I was a boy. but.. if there had been. I fear I sometinies should have gone hungry to my books. I want to ask time Senator what heowould have done with the young man in charge of my factory today. who told me. when lie came to me for work years ago. that he had three sisters and a brother. and lie was their only means of support. He was less than .12 years of age. Would the Senator have sent them all to the )oorhouse. or what would he have done? I am just as much in favor of education as is the Senator from Massachusetts. and I am sqrry that I have not a better one. but I do not want to put anything in the way of the boy who is by necessity compelled to earn a living for himself or for his parents or for his brothers and sisters. or to bar him from that privilege. I would rather see him grow up a good mechanic. a hardworking. honest man. than a loafer.","The silver pay roll has been the pay roll on the Isthmus always for the ordinary laborers. At the time we went down there silver was the money basis.","Mr. Adams paid for clerical services out of the laborers fund. but the Comptroller said itcould not be legally paid out of that fund. There was not enough in the other fmid. so he paid it out of hisown pocket. There is no doubt about its having been paid for services. The bill was reported to the Senate without amendment. ordered to be engrossed for a third reading. read the third time. and passed.","Mr. Chairman. this. I think.is rather a remarkable provision. It is to \"foster. promote. and develop\" the insurance business of the United States. a business which. as the chairman of the committee stated to the House a short time ago. is already an enormous business. Yet we are to- foster. promote. and develop it through the agencies of this new department of commerce and labor. Why is not this called the department of commerce and insurance? Why do you not tack onto the name the word \"insurance\" as well as the word \"labor?\" Certainly the insurance interests will be satisfied with the substance. and you propose to satisfy. if you can. labor interests with a jingle of words. What reason there is upon the earth for a department in this Government to foster. promote. and develop insurance. until the discovery was made by the gentlemen who project this bill. was a mystery to the world. This clause is an addition to what was in the Senate bill. Those who refer to section 3 of the.Senate bill. proposed to be stricken out to make way for this amendment. will find that it contains nothing in relation to fostering. promoting. and devel6ping insurance. The gentleman from Illinois suggests that these harmless words \"foster. promote. and develop\" will have no weight and can do nothing unless there be other legislation. Does the gentleman. in the simplicity of his soul. suppose that it is intended that there shall be no other legislation? Can he not with the eye of fancy see a bureau presided over by a chief and an assistant chief and a chief clerk. assistant clerks. and a horde of useful employees. to \"foster. promote. and develop\" the insurance business of the United States. and incidentallyI might say principally and primarilyto foster. promote. and develop thu interests of themselves and of those who put them into these fat but useless offices? There are a great many things in this bill the absence of which would be an improvement. but striking and unique in these samples of strange legislation is this feature: To foster. promote. and develop the insurance industry in the United States. If this were not serious legislation. it would lack but little of being a roaring farcecreating a department of the Government. having an officer in the Cabinet of the President to foster. promote. and develop the insurance business of the United States. and not to leave him alone and unassisted. not to burden him with overWork. but to supply him with an abundance of subordinates so that he and they. colaboring. putting their massive intellects and their great industry into operation. may effectually and satisfactorily to those interested that way. foster. promote. and develop the huge. the enormous insurance business of the United States. This provision did not straggle in by accident. It did not get in through some fortuitous circumstances. I think it is due to the House that those who know how it got into this bill. that those who know who got it into the bill. that those who know who are to profit primarily and directly from the putting of it into the bill ought. in a generous burst of confidence. to impart a little of the information to the House. It would not occur to the ordinary man in the ordinary way. the ordinary promoter of commerce. the ordinary friend of labor in wordsit would hardly as a mere matter of accident. as a matter of fortuitous inspiration. occur to any of these to light upon this scheme to provide for fostering. promoting. and developing the insurance business of the United States. I think we can see following this the organization of some huge Federal insurance companies. I think we may witness the power of organized wealth banded together in the various insurance companies taking possession so far as they please of the machinery of the Government. using it to throw out of gear and to destroy the machinery of the States. perfected to a considerable degree for the control of the insurance interests and business.

So that this employment of temporary employees is. at best. an increase over any number heretofore employed or appropriated for. It is clearly within the scope of the statute of 1894. which limits it to employees whose employment is permanent and continuous. Qnd we find all through the bill provisions for temporary labor and contingent expenses. I have no fault to find with the Fish Commission. It is doing good work. and the Commissioner is a very courteous gentleman. but the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations has said it is the most extravagant service we have. I think it is time.
