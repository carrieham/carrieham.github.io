another issue to talk about today. to a certain extent. i have great sympathy for my republican colleagues. they have been stuck with a standardbearer for their party. who is a bigot. a bully. a liar. a misogynist. with no discernible qualifications for the high office that he seeks. but they are not helping themselves by trying to shift the subject of debate here on the floor of the house. tomorrow. we are going to be taking a stand against a couple of what they think are unpopular ideas. it is too bad that the proposals we will be debating on were never considered by our ways and means committee. one. a sense of congress that a carbon tax would be bad for the economy. and the other. opposition to the presidents proposal for a $10 a barrel fee on oil. the carbon tax ironically is something that most of the economists who have studied itwhether they are conservative. liberal. republican or democratagree would be a good policy for this country. a carbon tax is the most efficient way to deal with the serious problems of carbon pollution that is already harming the economy. look at the disruption of the fishing industry and the widespread flooding we have seen that has been unprecedented. we are about to go into another egregious forest fire season with huge costs economically. as well as to forest health. we have wildly unpredictable weatherunprecedented heat. in portland. oregon. last weekend. it was 100 degrees for both days. a carbon tax would harness market forces to be able to change that direction more effectively than other initiatives. a carbon tax actually can be designed to cushion impacts on low- to moderateincome people. in fact. it actually could be designed to help low- to moderateincome people. a blanket dismissal of what economists think is our best economic environmental protection is shortsighted. it is too bad that we didnt debate it in committee. the other resolution. the opposition to the presidents barrel tax. misses the point entirely. it suggests that that is somehow going to be detrimental. wait a minute. the barrel fee would be used to rebuild and renew america. we have been in a desperate situation. we havent raised the gas tax since 1993. it has made it almost impossible to move forward with a robust transportation bill to deal with the problem. america is falling apart while we are falling behind. that is why seven red republican states last year raised the gas tax. we couldnt even talk about it here in congress. using a barrel fee of $10 per barrel will enable us to make significant investments in rebuilding and renewing america. the standard &amp; poor 500 research report of a couple of years ago pointed out that investment in infrastructure has a significant impact on the economy. $1.2 billion creates almost 30.000 jobs. creates $2 billion worth of economic activity. reduces the federal deficit $200 million. and we get the benefit of improved infrastructure. that is why every major interest group supported raising revenues for transportation. when i introduced the gas tax increase. it was supported by the american chamber of commerce. the aflcio. by truckers. aaa. engineers. and contractors. virtually everybody who builds. uses. maintains. or owns american infrastructure said. raise this fee. help us rebuild and renew america. i think the only thing wrong with the presidents proposal is that it is several years too late. we should have been debating this from the outset. particularly when petroleum prices have fallen precipitously. and when americas infrastructure continues to deteriorate. it is sad that we didnt have a robust debate in committee. we will have a little bit of discussion tomorrow. but it is too little and too late.","mr. speaker. even more offensive. in a display of colossal incompetence. last week. the republican leadership was forced to pull their entire interior appropriations bill to protect their conference from having to defend the display of the confederate battle flag on federal lands. imagery long recognized as a symbol of hatred and intolerance. as a result. funding for critically important agencies such as the environmental protection agency. whose programs protect wildlife. the environment. and public health. continues to hang in the balance. this rule first provides for consideration of h.r. 2898. the western water and american food security act of 2015. which republicans claim will alleviate the drought crisis currently unfolding in california and other western states. but this bill is just another example of the countless partisan attempts made by the majority to roll back important environmental protections while also preempting state laws. let me put a footnote right there. \"preempting state laws.\" these are the people that argue state rights and now would preempt them in western portions of our great country. particularly california. reducing water management flexibility. mr. speaker. this bill undercuts the endangered species act by changing the welldefined standard used to determine when an action negatively affects an endangered species and introduces an untested. undefined standard. as evidenced by this piece of legislation. the republicans solution to the drought crisis is to provide handouts to big agricultural interests at the expense of the environment and everyone else. i want to make it very clear that i represent agricultural interests as do my colleagues who are republicans. we represent all of the specialty crops and sugarcane grown. and we understand these dynamics very well. not only will this bill scale back desperately needed environmental protections. it will affect thousands of fishing jobs in california and oregon that local residents depend on. given the changing standard of the endangered species act. this bill will dramatically weaken protections for salmon and other fish and wildlife in californias baydelta estuary. this bill claims to help california. but even california doesnt want it. californias own secretary of natural resources has said that this billand let me quote himwill \"reignite water wars. move water policy back into the courts. and try to pit one part of the state against another.\" this bill will elevate the water rights for certain agricultural contractors over the existing water rights that benefit refuges and wildlife areas. in short. this bill circumvents californias groundbreaking equitable water conservation programs and puts the desires of big agriculture over everyone else. this combined rule also provides for the consideration of h.r. 3038. termed the highway and transportation funding act of 2015. part ii. because it is yet another shortterm. temporary patch to ensure that the highway trust fund does not become insolvent. it is a patch. it is the ninth time we are patching. if you had a tire and were riding down a highway and if every time you looked up you had to have another patch. pretty soon you would recognize that you would need new tires. what we need in this country is a 6year highway bill. back in may. congress passed and the president signed a bill we can now appropriately call the highway and transportation funding act of 2015. part i. at that time. we were assured by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle that a multiyear bill that would provide the longterm funding certainty and stability needed to keep transportation and construction projects operating was on the horizon. that was in may. we were promised. mr. speaker. that if we voted to provide funding through july 31. the comprehensive. multiyear highway bill america so desperately needs would become a reality in time to avoid any insolvency. unfortunately. today we find ourselves in the same situation as we did in may. i just heard my good friend from washington make the argument that. in the next 6 months. we will be able to work together to do the things necessary for a 6year highway bill. i am paraphrasing what he said. as we had in may. today we have a rapidly approaching. selfimposed deadline and are frantically seeking an interim fix. like its predecessor. this highway bill does nothing to address the longterm solvency of the highway trust fund. there is one thing i have learned here about kicking the can down the road: if kicking the can down the road were an olympic sport. here in the united states congress. we would win gold. we would win bronze. we would win silver. and we would win aluminum for kicking the can down the road. instead. we are again being asked to vote for legislation that would keep the highway trust fund solvent through note the date of december 18. just before christmas. so that we can play the game: \"if you dont vote for this next patchif we dont do 6 yearsthen we will keep you here until christmas without the necessary assurances that a longterm bill will become a reality.\" this is no way to govern. our insistence on kicking the can down the road does nothing to protect american jobs or to invest in critical infrastructure that every man and woman in this house of representatives recognizes is desperately needed in this nation of falling bridges and pockmarked roads. finally. investing in our nations infrastructure and. indeed. in our nations future will require us to make tough choices. instead of considering raising the federal gas taxi said the ugly words. \"federal gas tax\"-which is the primary source of funding for the highway trust fundand it has not been increased since 1993. peoplethis bill seeks to cut taxes on liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas at a cost of $90 million over the next decade. any comprehensive highway bill must consider. in part. addressing the federal gas tax. why dont we just face up to that. go to our constituents and explain it to them so they will understand that this is a desperate need for this entire nation. our failure to come together to pass a multiyear transportation bill year after year has resulted in 65 percent of our nations roads being rated \"deficient.\" all you have to do is drive around washington to recognize that. it has left 25 percent of our nations bridges in disrepair. and it has left 45 percent of americans without access to transit. this failure has farreaching and devastating implications and must be addressed with thoughtful and meaningful bipartisan legislation that will provide the certainty and consistency required to fuel jobs and keep the highways and other transportation infrastructure safe. mr. speaker. i reserve the balance of my time.","mr. speaker. i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker. the global food security act. h.r. 5656. is a bipartisan bill with 21 cosponsors. including betty mccollum. our lead democrat. who has worked very hard on this issue. i would also like to thank house foreign affairs committee chairman ed royce. ranking member eliot engel. ranking member bass. i would like to thank jeff fortenberry. who has played a key role. as well as erik paulsen and. again. other members who have joined across the aisle to work on this legislation and to work on the language. i also want to thank the staff that worked tirelessly on this. in particular. jenn holcomb. kelly stone from congresswoman mccollums office. joan condon. katy crosby. and janice kaguyutan from the full committee. and from my own staff. pierro tozzi. thank you so much for your work in helping to make this bill a reality and bringing it to the floor. mr. speaker. this is important legislation which will help provide a longterm solution to global hunger by authorizing and strengthening the existing national food security program coordinated by usaid. commonly known as feed the future. this program strengthens nutrition. especially for children during the critical first 1.000day windowfrom conception to the childs second birthday. it also teaches smallscale farmersin particular. womenthe requisite techniques and best practices to increase agricultural yield. thereby helping nations achieve food security. which is something that is. first and foremost. humane but also in the national security interests of the united states. as usaid administrator dr. rajiv shah has pointed outwho. i want to point out. parenthetically. has done a tremendous job as the administrator of usaidthis program encourages selfsufficiency and operates in targeted countries where the host governments have committed to investing in local agricultural development and to undertaking reforms that allow the private sector to flourish. its hallmarks are the building of local capacity and sustainability. as well as resiliency in linking local entrepreneurs to the global economy. while boosting transparency and accountability. the end result of this can be seen in lives saved and in lives enriched. in the past year. the feed the future program has helped 7 million farmers across the globe to increase harvests. resulting in improved nutrition for some 12.5 million children. to give one example. in ethiopia. stunting rates were driven down by some 9 percent in just 3 years. resulting in. roughly. 160.000 fewer children suffering from malnutrition. yet. today. even though progress has been made. malnutrition is the underlying cause of death for at least 3.1 million children per year around the world and is responsible for 45 percent of all deaths among children under 5. more than 800.000 babiesone in four newbornsdie each year because they are born too soon or they are too small as a result of poor maternal nutrition. mr. speaker. one of the first laws that i wrote over 30 years ago was the child survival funda $50 million program that included vaccinating kids to protect against preventable diseases like polio. pertussis. and diphtheria. as well as oral rehydration for kids at risk of death from repeated bouts of diarrheal disease. what we discovered then was that. for mere pennies on the dollar. we could intervene before problems arose. not only saving lives but also saving money in the long term. this global food security act has the potential to be equally transformative in the lives of so many. malnutrition. in addition to death. leads to the stunted growth of children. stunted children become adults who suffer from diabetes. hypertension. and cardiovascular diseaseconditions that not only result in poor health but that also impede earning capacity and result in lower incomes. of particular concern. women affected by stunting give birth to children who are also likely to be afflicted by this preventable condition. perpetuating the cycle of malnutrition and of poverty. adequate nutrition for pregnant women. lactating moms. and all women and adolescent girls of childbearing age needs to be prioritized in food policies for the sake of children. women. and. by extension. nations. by ensuring comprehensive prenatal. maternal. and robust support. including nutritionagain. through that first 1.000 days of lifegovernment health workers. civil society. and others will not only prevent many deaths. but children will be stronger. healthier. happier. their immune systems will be boosted. and as they matriculate to adulthood. they will be more prosperous. if women of childbearing age are wellnourished. they are healthier and are able to provide nourishment for their children. i remember being in so many refugee camps. at a darfur refugee camp. on one of many trips to africa. i remember the women there were so concerned that they would be able to breastfeed their children. but they were so malnourished that that was next to impossible. after several weeks. they were able to do so. i should also add. when these childrenhealthy childrenget this kind of help. it also ensures greater not only physical but cognitive development. healthy children thrive and are empowered to become healthy adults. again. they can make. because of that. meaningful contributions to their families and society. finally. i note that the program authorized by h.r. 5656 is not only pennywise. but it is also poundwise. it is economical in the long run. and it should lead to a reduction in the amount of money we spend on emergency food aid. a comprehensive food security strategy outlined in the bill. as well as in the policy. also helps us to do more with less by leveraging our aid with that of other countries. the private sec-","mr. president. i rise to discuss the increasing american jobs through greater exports to africa act of 2013. i am introducing this bill along with my partners from the last congress. senator chris coons from the state of delaware is in the chamber. the chair of the african affairs subcommittee of the senate foreign relations committee. senators john boozman. ben cardin. and mary landrieu have joined us in this bipartisan effort. we expect representatives chris smith and karen bass will soon introduce companion legislation in the house. this is a very straightforward. commonsense piece of legislation. it is about creating jobs. american jobs. every $1 billion in exports from america supports over 5.000 jobs. this bill seeks to expand u.s. exports specifically to africa by 200 percent in real dollar value over the next 10 years. the african market is ripe for greater american commercial engagement. in the past 10 years. people do not believe this. but they should take a look at the facts. in the past 10 years. six of the worlds fastest growing economies were located in subsaharan africa. in the next decade. 7 of the top 10 will be in subsaharan africa. the mental image which most americans have of africa is completely out of date. africa is growing. not only in population but in economic activity. the middle class of africa is growing as well. their appetite for goods and service puts an opportunity before us to export from america and to create good jobs in our country with exports to africa. in the last decade. the number of africans with access to the internet has doubled. from 1998 to today. the number of mobile phones on the continent has grown from 4 million to 500 million. seventyeight percent of africas rural population now has access to clean water. over the last 10 years. real income per person in africa has increased by more than 30 percent. positive health outcomes are increasing. enrollment in school is growing. these are signs of a growing middle class and what the world bank has called the brink of an economic takeoff in africa. as my colleague and friend senator coons has noted. in a report he recently released on the topic. economic growth in africa has risen dramatically in recent years. but the continents vast economic potential has not yet been fully realized by the u.s. government or the american people. that report from senator coons could not have been more timely and accurate as far as i am concerned. i can tell you. american companies are eager to get into the african market. they should be. but they often face a private finance system that is stuck. thinking about africa through the prism of the past: wars. famine. strongmen dictators. i have met with these company leaders. large and small companies alike. they tell me the same thing: the u.s. does not have a coordinated strategy for africa. others do. china and others are gaining a foothold in africa at the expense of our workers. yesterday. the ambassador from algeria came to see me. it is a country that has a fascinating background. colonized like most of the countries in africa. it went through a storied period of independence in the 1960s and has french roots. the ambassador said: we pride ourselves. we believe we speak better french than the people living in france. that is their past. i asked them about their future. i said: what is the presence of china in algeria today? he said: it is a growing presence. when it comes to the infrastructure of algeria. it is china that is playing a major role. it is china that is loaning the money to algeria to build the roads and the bridges and the airports. but there is a catch. you want to borrow the money from china? there will be chinese architects. chinese engineers. chinese contractors. and half the workforce will be chinese. pretty soon they will have become part of algeria. the next time there is a decision. whether it is for a telecommunications system. whatever it might be. you can bet the chinese. with a history of working with the algerian government. will be first in line. they know what is happening there. africa is developing its economy and they are part of it. they see africa from two or three different perspectives. first. obviously. it is an opportunity to sell things. it is a market. second. it can provide basic resources and energy needed by the chinese. third. as the middle class grows in each of these countries. the appetite for more and more economic activity will grow. there was a time when america knew that too. there was a time when we visited the four corners of the world looking for those same opportunities. we are sitting back now and watching. as we watch. china is moving. as i have said many times. the u.s. system of export. promotion. and finance is so poorly coordinated that it is a shame we are losing so many opportunities. we have dozens of government agencies that are supposed to be working on this problem. i called many of them in my office. it was the first time some of them had met one another. they are supposed to be working together. this bill we are introducing will fix it. it would require a coordinated government strategy to help increase u.s. exports to africa. responsibility for overseeing the implementation of this strategy would be vested in a single position. one coordinator. no more agencies tripping over one another. no more competing priorities. every day we delay. china and. i might add. india and others will fill the void if america does not step forward. since 2009. china has been africas largest trading partner. it has flooded the continent with billions of dollars building highprofile construction projects. often the assistance comes in the form of concessional loans. loans that. frankly. suggest you can borrow $100 million. you only have to pay back $70 million. that practice distorts markets. puts our companies in america at a disadvantage. between 2008 and 2010. china provided more to the developing world than the world bank. to the tune of $110 billion. currently. chinas exports to africa outnumber americas three to one. the chinese get it. should america not get it? through this engagement. the chinese are becoming major players all over africa. i defy you to find a country in africa where the chinese are not already a part of the economy and part of the economic conversation. recently. senegals president macky sall told president obama exactly that in a meeting at the white house. arguing the west should pay as much attention to africa as china does. i have heard the same thing firsthand. not just from the algerian ambassador but from the former president of ethiopia. across the continent. it is the same question: where is the united states? this bill answers the question. no longer would africans wonder why american companies were not doing business there. the bill bolsters u.s. government ability to support these companies. maintains a solid presence of u.s. commercial foreign service officers. it is going to help small and medium businesses in the united states compete in africa. it will increase the focus of the exportimport bank. giving it greater incentive to aggressively counter those concessional loans. it will help the exportimport bank and the overseas private investment corporation more quickly process applications so we can be competitive. last congress we almost passed this bill. one would almost think that it is a nobrainer. but. unfortunately. we did not. one senator objected. he had the courage to come to the floor and voice his objections. i appreciate that very much. but at the same time. on the other side of the aisle. senators johnson. coburn. and corker were working with me to pass the bill. so we have not given up on making this a successful bipartisan effort. i think the united states cannot stand by the sidelines just to say we believe in a market economy. get the government out of the picture is to overlook the obvious. the chinese government is in the picture. and they are running circles around american companies because of it. in thinking about the issue. we must also not ignore the interests of the africans themselvessomething sometimes our competitors do not focus on. chinese engagement comes with a price. china gobbles up natural resources that are needed many times for that growing domestic economy. the infrastructure projects. as i mentioned. often come with chinese professionals: architects and engineers and workers. when local labor is used. african workers often suffer poor labor standards. if the chinese are in charge. environmental standards are ignored. they should be a priority all over the world. we also have to factor in the cost of having to replace products and goods much sooner because. sadly. the chinese workmanship as well as the quality of their goods does not match what the united states can bring. i also wish to mention a growing problem that stems from chinas presence in africa. that is. the resurgence of elephant poaching and ivory trafficking. several recent new york times articles have highlighted tens of thousands of elephants have been slaughtered. one may say: i thought we solved this a few years ago with a worldwide ivory ban. it turns out ivory is so popular in the chinese culture in part of its burgeoning population. one item is sought as an ultimate status symbol in china: ivory. reports are that as much as 70 percent of the ivory harvested from slaughtered elephants is smuggled to china. in fact. there is growing evidence that ivory poaching actually increases in elephantrich areas where the chinese construction workers are building roads. even more troubling. the chinese demand for ivory funds some of the most despicable actors in africa. much of the proceeds from the illegal ivory trade ended up in the hands of joseph kony and his murderous group the lords resistance army. i recently went to uganda and met two of the victims of joseph kony. he is a madman. he has used his beatific visions to generate an army of slaves. literally soldier slaves. i met one of them. a young man who was dragged out of his african village in uganda. everybody was lined up at the village as kony and his soldiers stood around with their automatic weapons. they said to this young man: you are going to join our army here or we are going to kill you. before you join the army. though. there is one thing we have to ask you: who would you spare among the members of your family here? we are going to kill the rest of them. which one would you spare? the young man said. after some hesitation: my father. they walked over and killed his father first. that is the kind of ruthless madman we are dealing with in joseph kony. believe me. president obama has recently put a target on his back. we are going after this man. we have driven him out of uganda. we believe he is in the central african republic. i saw firsthand while visiting there what we are doing to make sure his reign of terror comes to an end very quickly. it turns out konys reign of terror has been fed and financed by the chinese demand for ivory. he is poaching ivory from the elephants. slaughtering them in the area and using this ivory to keep his men in arms and for their reign of terror to continue. the increasing american jobs through greater exports to africa act has something for everyone to support. it is good for the american economy. helps u.s. businesses create jobs. it is good for u.s. foreign policy. keeps america in a position of global leadership. it is good for the people of africa by making superior american products and services the standard in their future. i urge my colleagues to sign on to support this important effort. while we wait and do nothing. the chinese are acting every single day and america is falling further and further behind. mr. president. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the record.","secondly. mr. speaker. i am a member of the nato parliamentary assembly. its an organization designed around legislators from all of our nato countries. its been in existence over 50 years. since the legislative bodies in most chambers are the funding for the military. its important that the legislative body talks about natos role in the past. in the present. and in the future. during my time as a member of the nato parliamentary assembly. i became great friends with a member of the british parliament who recently passed away. and i would like to pay tribute to him. mr. speaker. i would like to pay tribute to my british friend and colleague. frank cook. who passed away on january 12. frank was a longtime colleague of mine in the nato parliamentary assembly. as you know. the assembly brings together members of congress with their counterparts from canada and europe to talk about issues that concern us all. as a leading member of the defense security committee. frank cook made vital contributions in debates in the assembly from the mid1980s to 2010 on issues as wide ranging as afghanistan. arms control with russia. natos operation in kosova. and its relations with ukraine and other partners. he also served as vice president of the assembly. frank embodied the spirit of the transatlantic alliance. he was never shy to express his opinions with a clear mind and a sharp wit. even when frank and i disagreed on policy. we remained friends and allies because we shared the values that underpin nato: freedom. democracy. fundamental human rights. and the rule of law. we both believed that the nato alliance was critical to our collective security and defense. and that we as legislators in our own countries needed to do everything we could to make sure it was capable of meeting the threats we face in the 21st century. i can recall many unforgettable experiences ive shared with frank. i observed him lead a forceful debate on controversial issues and get all sides mad. like a debate he led on nagornokarabakh in quebec in 2006. he and i took incoming artillery fire from the taliban in kandahar airfield in 2007. during the summer of 2010. we visited greenland together. we visited a military encampment called point north. which is north of the arctic circle. the dogs there pull sleds and provide early warning for polar bears. they appear quite scary. but frank was the first to amble up and pet them. frank was a throwback to a time when characters could be listedand by being listed. in parliamentary speak. that means being put on the party list for electionso frank was a throwback to a time when characters could be listed and serve constituencies. but perhaps my most memorable experience was when frank would regularly treat us with the best performance of \"my way\" since old blue eyes himselfnot a small feat for a brit. i learned a great deal from him. and he will be deeply missed by many of his friends at the nato parliamentary assembly and here in congress. now to the business at hand. mr. speaker. again. thank you for letting me come down once again to talk about a very pressing and important issue in this country. one that im going to continue to use the bully pulpit for to help educate my colleagues. the public as a whole. even you. mr. speaker. on the need to address the issue of highlevel nuclear waste in this country. its an issue that has been around since the development of the nuclear weapon system that we used to win world war ii. some of that waste is still there from that time. and it still sits in the same location of 4050 years ago. it has hit the international stage with the experience that japan has had in fukushima daiichi and the tsunami. not just the generating facilities themselves but what happened to the nuclear waste onsite. and an international nuclear disaster that still is making it difficult for our allies in japan and really causes us to make sure that we look at our systems and understand what is our national policy on highlevel nuclear waste and why we are not moving forward. what ive done in my times coming to the floor is go around the country and highlight where nuclear waste sites are and compare it to where we. by federal law. have stated our nuclear waste should be stored. this is all under the 1982 energy policy act. and a site was located under that law in 1987. so lets go through the area for a brief review. this is what happens when we no longer have pages on the house floor to help us. the first site i visited personally was in washington state and the site is called hanford. which was a good place to start in this tour of where nuclear waste is because the vast majority of nuclear waste stored here is department of defense and department of energy waste that was used to develop our nuclear weapons systems during world war ii. there are 57 million gallons of nuclear waste onsite. mostly in large tanks of 750.000 to a million gallons each. the waste is stored 10 feet underground. the waste is 250 feet above the water table. and the waste is 1 mile from the columbia river. and something that is not listed there. some of that waste is leaking from the tanks. so lets compare it to the site that we have decided by law to establish. which is yucca mountain. yucca mountain has currently no nuclear waste onsite. the waste would be stored 1.000 feet underground. the waste is 1.000 feet above the water table. and the waste would be 100 miles from the colorado river. nuclear waste next to the columbia river or nuclear waste stored underneath a mountain in a desert? that is site number one. next. not to pick on other states to the exclusion of mine. the next location i talked about was the zion power plant. decommissioned. highlevel nuclear waste still onsite. lets compare it to yucca mountain. sixtyfive casks containing 1.135 metric tons of nuclear waste. the waste is stored above the ground. 5 feet above the water table and 1.300 feet from lake michigan. and. of course. this is lake michigan right there. part of the time what ive been doing is highlighting a location and then looking at the states surrounding. the state of wisconsin has two nuclear power plants. both on lake michigan similarly located. of course. the stats for yucca mountain are the same. let me add here that we have already spent $15 billion to study this site of yucca mountain. 20 years in the making. and we still wait. im not sure if this is still in the proper order that i have come down to the floor. but the next nuclear power plant that i wanted to highlight was san onofre nuclear generating station. now. this one is in california. and its right next to the pacific ocean on the opposite side from where japan is. you can see the waves. and you can see how close it is to the pacific ocean. at this power plant. there are 2.300 waste rods onsite. the waste is stored above the ground and in pools. and its adjacent to the pacific ocean. as i said. and 45 miles from san diego. yucca is 90 miles to 100 miles from las vegas. and its also located on government property the size of the state of rhode island. its controlled by a couple of entities. the department of energy being one. the bureau of land management being another. and the third one. it is a nuclear test site where we tested nuclear weapons years ago. i didnt mention zion nuclear power plant. zion is located about 45 miles from chicago. illinois. there is another nuclear power plant. and that is located in massachusetts. as you can see. its next to cape cod. the pilgrim generating facility. there are 2.918 spent fuel assemblies onsite. waste is stored above the ground in pools. and why is that important? part of the problem in fukushima daiichi was that there was waste stored in pools. because of the disaster. were not really sure what happened. either the foundation was cracked and the coolant water left the pond. or the power went off. the water couldnt circulate. the heat by the rods evaporated the water. then the heat on heat caused the rods to. in essence. start to melt. which is a very dangerous situation. so much of our nuclear waste throughout this country is stored in pools around the country. why is that important? because its our national policy. based upon a law passed in 1982. followed up by the location site in 87. that we are to have one geological repository. not nuclear waste stored all over this country. but we would have one centralized location. now. its important to add that in the next couple of days. the blue ribbon commission is going to come out with a report. and we think its going to say that its in the national interest to have one geological repository for highlevel nuclear waste. and we await. with interest. that report. now we go to idaho national labs. a federal national laboratory in idaho. comparing it to where nuclear waste would be stored if we would continue to comply with federal law. we have in idaho there 5.090 canisters of waste. a good point to note on this waste. a lot of this waste. again. is from the research done on nuclear power and nuclear weapons systems. and in that process. you create waste. in hanford. as theyre trying to decide what to do with the waste. the containment systems to transport the waste have all been designed with the plan to store in yucca mountain. so when you look at the 53 million gallons in hanford. and were going to move that waste out of washington state and into yucca. time. effort. energy. and money has gone in to preparing the technology to move this waste and store it in yucca mountain. similar to idaho national labs. currently. though. we have 5.090 canisters onsite. waste is stored above the ground. waste is 500 feet above the water table. and the waste is 50 miles from yellowstone national park. then we go to the great southeast in the state of georgia. and we look at the savannah generating station where you have 6.300 canisters of nuclear waste onsite. water is stored right below the ground zero to 160 feet above the water table. and as you can see from the photo. its right next to the savannah river. part of the debate that the environmental left and antinuclear folks told us about is water in the desert and how its going to affect nuclear waste. and part of the educational process that ive learned going through the different sites is you really cant find a nuclear power siteand. of course. all nuclear waste generated is still onsitethats not close to a body of water. so thats this whole issue about would you rather have it next to a body of water or would you rather have it in a desert. i think that debating point is pretty clear. so thats savannah generating station versus yucca mountain. right before the end of last year. i came down on the floor and the location that i was to talk about nextof course. i got off topic a little bit and didnt really clarify and identifyis turkey point. turkey point is in the state of florida. and. of course. again. were comparing it to yucca mountain. at turkey point. you have 1.074 metricton vehicles of spent fuel onsite. the waste is stored above the ground in pools. waste is on the biscayne bay at sea level. and the waste is 10 miles from the everglades versus yucca mountain. again. defined by the nuclear waste policy act of 1982. yucca was established by federal law. by this chamber and the other chamber and the president of the united states in 1987. yucca mountain is in a desert. the storage site would be underneath a mountain in that desert far away from any population that would be immediately affected. another location that i was to address last week. which i also got off topic. is the sequoyah nuclear generating station. sequoyah is in tennessee. but its right on the south carolina border. at sequoyah. there are 1.094 metricton vehicles of spent fuel onsite. the waste is stored above ground in pools in dry casks. waste is 25 feet from the groundwater. and waste is 14 miles from chattanooga on chickamauga lake. what ive done once we get to new states that i havent really identified is then ive gone and looked at the senators past statements and/or their voting record on this because we had a vote on the floor this year on whether we should move forward with the dollars to finish the final scientific study by the nuclear regulatory commission. and that vote was 297 \"yes.\" now. theres only 435 members in this chamber. a huge bipartisan vote that really sent a signal of where the will of this chamber is. so why cant we move forward? the issue is the majority leader of the senate happens to be from the state of nevada. and to really get the senate to move. you have to hold the senators from these states accountable. or at least for them to state a position as to where they stand on where the nuclear waste currently is. and really what is the proposal and what should we do with it. so having done that before. i then look at the senators from the state of tennessee and the state of north carolina. senator alexander is a \"yes.\" senator corker is a \"no.\" senator burr is a \"yes.\" a \"yes\" is lets move our nuclear waste to yucca mountain in a desert underneath a mountain. senator hagan is silent. what do i mean by \"silent\"? we couldnt find any public statements. of course. the senate has not cast a vote. so we hope maybe the senator will sometime make her position known. but as for now we will list her as being silent. again. why is that important? because we really need to find out where the senators are. under the senate rules. to break a filibuster you have to have 60 votes. so im hoping that through this process we will finally tally them up. which is what ill do at the end of my time. and kind of show you where we are so far. now. i still have a couple of places around the country to address. remember that these are just onemany states like mine. ive pointed out zion. but we actually have six sites and 11 reactors. illinois has a huge nuclear power plant. fifty percent of our electricity comes from nuclear power. so even though im mentioning a few. you can multiply that by three. as far as how many nuclear power plants are out there. and equivalently. if there is a nuclear power plant in your state. then your state is the storage site for nuclear waste right now. the state that i came to the floor on to highlight today and the region is the state of arkansas and the state of missouri. now. missouri. as i knowim from illinois. im from southern illinois. i know the state of missouri well. the state of missouri has a nuclear power plant called callaway. so the same thing im mentioning here on this power plant in arkansas you can make for the callaway plant. so lets look at the one weve chosen. which is a power plant called nuclear one. again. nuclear one has 1.260 mtbs of spent fuel on site versus none at yucca mountain. nuclear one has waste stored above the ground in pools and dry casts. obviously. theres no nuclear waste at yucca mountain. but if there were. where would it be stored? it would be stored 1.000 feet underneath the ground. nuclear one has waste adjacent to a water supply. of course. you can see the photo right here. as ive highlighted. in almost every nuclear power plant or waste site theres water nearby. well. of course yucca mountain is in a desert. so the waste would be stored 1.000 feet above the water table. nuclear one has waste on lake dardanelle. a reservoir on the arkansas river. now. whats a reservoir? i think. by definition. a reservoir is a body of water that youve created to hold water for public use. whether thats for recreation or for drinking and stuff. so there you have. youve got nuclear one right on this reservoir. now. what about the senators from the state of arkansas? i mean. are they happy with this nuclear waste on site? so lets look at their positions. we actually have a few other states represented. too. first. from the state of arkansas. we have senator boozman. one of our former colleagues. has a stated position and cast votes in support of yucca mountain. senator pryor. as far as we can tell. is silent. from iowa. senator grassley is a \"yes.\" senator harkin is not only silent. hes a \"no.\" so not sure why that would be. maybe because iowa doesnt have nuclear power plants in the state of iowa. but theres definitely some around there. it must be his position that nuclear waste stored around this country is okay. then you go to the state of kansas. another colleague. former colleague. senator moran. has voted \"yes\" on yucca mountain as a good place to put highlevel nuclear waste in a single repository. senator roberts. also a \"yes\" vote. from the state of missouri. another former colleague of ours. senator blunt is a \"yes\" on moving highlevel nuclear waste from the state of missouri to a desert underneath a mountain. senator mccaskill is silent on this. which. again. since im next door to the state of missouri. i know that the callaway nuclear power plant is in the state of missouri. and senator mccaskill is silent on that issue. so whats our scorecard? where are we at with going around the country? because remember. mr. speaker. because of the senate rules. we have to get to 60 to really push something through. so weve identified what we believe is actually 36 \"yes\" votes so far. weve identified actually 10. this should be updated. we have 10 that we really dont know their position. in other words. they have no public statement or they have not cast a vote. and then we have eight definite \"noes.\" which means they have made public statements in opposition to moving nuclear waste underneath a mountain in a desert or theyve cast a vote somewhere in some type or signed a letter. were happy to be corrected on any of this analysis of where senators are. but i think its time that we start to get some accountability in this process. why have we not moved forward on yucca mountain? and the answer is pretty clear that when this administration was running for the presidency. he. wanting to get support from the senior senator from the state of nevada. promised not to move forward. thats fine. it was a political decision. hes holding to his commitment to do that at the cost of what? nuclear waste being held across this country. in states around this country. in places that. after fukushima daiichi. you might argue might not be the best place to have this nuclear waste. so the president and the majority leader of the senate has placed this in the political realm. elections have consequences. were approaching an election cycle. there will be senators on the ballot in november. what is their position on what their state. and what should be the national position on what we do with highlevel nuclear waste. so we do know weve got a lot who are on record saying nuclear waste ought to go in a single repository in a desert underneath a mountain. we do believe that the blue ribbon commission this week will say this country needs a single repository. we do have 10 senators that we do not know their positions. and. to their credit. we have eight that we do know their position in opposition. but it looks. from being a casual observer. and if the trend continues. that were getting close to a majority of u.s. senators that say that we should have a single repository. and that single repository should be whats been identified under the nuclear waste policy act and the following legislation in 1987 that said yucca mountain is the site. why is this important? fukushima daiichi is example number one. the health and wellness of our citizens. the location of all of this nuclear waste. we have to continue to highlight these concerns because the nuclear waste isnt going away. in fact. we have got some nuclear power plants being constructed right now. maybe in 10 or 15 years. they will start generating. when they do. they will start creating nuclear waste. and that nuclear waste is going to have to go somewhere. the question that we have highlighted throughout this year well finish in a couple of months. should that be in all these states and all these locations. or should it be at a single repository? mr. speaker. i look forward to coming down numerous times in the future to continue to identify each state. each senator. and then allow the public access to the information so that they can make a decision if this is an important criteria in this next election cycle. i hope that the answer would be yes so that we would follow up on a national policy to deal with highlevel nuclear waste. we have only spent $15.5 billion in over 20 years to identify yucca mountain as a site. if we were to try to find a new site. we throw away the $15 billion. the 20 years of research. and we will have to have another 20year time for research and development and another $15 billion to get to the same location we are today. mr. speaker. i yield back the balance of my time.","weve already reduced mercury emissions by 90 to 95 percent. to get another 90 to 95 percent is so cost prohibitive that you would probably just shut down some of those plants. in my opinion. thats not necessary. so what the train act. in conclusion. is doing. mr. chairman. is just saying lets do a timeout. before we go forward with any new regulations. lets make sure that there really is a true benefit that outweighs the cost. in my district alone last week. a closure was announced of one plant and one coal mine that are going to cost directly at least 500 jobs. thats not hypothetical. thats not modeled. thats real. and if all these plethora of epa regulations go forward. youre going to see thousands of jobs eliminated. billions of dollars in cost. and very problematic improvements in health. please vote for the train act when it comes up for final passage.","mr. speaker. on january 12. 2010. haiti experienced one of the worst earthquakes in their history. i believe that our trade policy can play a key role in rehabilitating the haitian economy. as such. i rise in support of my friend congressman charles rangels timely legislation. the haiti economic lift program. help. act of 2010. which will extend trade preference programs. expand market access for haitian goods. and ensure fundamental worker labor rights for haitian workers. expanding trade with haiti is an important step in creating economic stability and sustainability. the help act will enhance and strengthen our trading relationship. where 78.2 percent of haitian exports are directed to the united states. by extending trade preference programs such as the caribbean basin trade partnership act and the haitian hemispheric opportunity through partnership encouragement act through september 30. 2020. both laws are credited with increasing haitian apparel exports to the united states from $420 million to over $512 million and creating impressive economic growth from 2007 to 2009. it is imperative we help foster burgeoning industries within haiti that will ultimately attract investment and provide jobs during and after their reconstruction efforts. the help act expands the list of products that can be shipped dutyfree. it has been noted that new jobs in haiti creates multiplier effects which supports families and others who are in need. mr. speaker. as a long supporter of worker rights. i am pleased that todays legislation will continue the international labor organizations labor monitoring program to ensure that fundamental core labor rights of their workers are followed by factories benefiting from the help act. the united states and its citizens. which have had a long tradition of helping allies in their time of need. have given unprecedented amounts of foreign aid and donations to the people of haiti in the weeks after the earthquake. todays legislation extends the reach of this aid by increasing trade between the countries. which will ultimately provide jobs and a better future for haitians. i urge my colleagues to support the bill.","i thank the gentleman. for yielding. mr. speaker. i rise in support of this resolution. today. the house is considering a resolution that many consider to be routine business with little effect outside of this chamber. however. i believe this resolution will provide congress with the resources we need to do the peoples work.. as we get to work. our main concerns need to be creating jobs and turning the economy around. an important component of this will be meeting the needs of small businesses so they can stay afloat. grow. and contribute to economic recovery. in good times. as well as bad. small businesses are the backbone of our economy. they create 60 to 80 percent of all new jobs. during economic downturns. like the one we are in now. they are even more important. small firms generate the innovative ideas and new services that spur job growth. for example. following the recession of the mid1990s. small firms created 3.8 million new . jobs. during economic downswings. many americans venture out and start .their own small businesses. for instance. in the 1990s. 25 percent of laidoff managers over the age of 40 went on to start their own firms. this kind of determination is -the hallmark of the american entrepreneurial spirit. it has led us out of previous recessions. and it will lead us out of this one as well. however. for that to happen. we need to make the needs of our small businesses a priority. the resolution that we are voting on today will provide congress the resources to undertake important work on behalf of small businesses. one of our first steps needs to be unfreezing the credit narket so small firms can access the capital they need to expand. grow. and create jobs. we must also ensure small businesses receive investments that allow them to remain technological pioneers. startup entrepreneurs often produce the new ideas that spark job growth and can even launch a whole new industry. small firms will also play a key role in rebuilding our nations infrastructure. the economic recovery act that was enacted earlier this year will mean an explosion of new public work projects. small businesses are well positioned to do this work. but only if we ensure that they can compete for their fair share of these new contracts. finally. a host of kitchen table issues very directly affect small business owners. as our nation takes up matters like tax policy. health care. and energy. the needs of entrepreneurs must be part of the discussion. mr. speaker. since this economic downturn started. our committee has heard from a flood of small businesses calling for assistance to help them weather the current storm. this resolution will mean that we will have the ability to help as many entrepreneurs as possible. i am confident that. given the right tools. these same entrepreneurs will once again lead our nations recovery. creating opportunity in theface of adversity. for that reason. i urge a \"yes\" vote.","madam president. i thank my colleague for raising some of those issues. our area was hardest hit in one area i visited not long ago. and just now we are seeing houses come back. it has been sad. i think that it has taken this long to move. going on 3 years. and you wonder why we couldnt make that happen earlier. a lot of money has been spent on interim housing and other things. that had it been spent in a way that goes directly to housing. to building new housing in safe areas and raised up so we wouldnt have a risk in the future. we would have been a lot better off. i know it is hard because i have been there and i have seen how hard it is to move the process in a faster way. i hope in the future we will learn to do it better. i thank my colleague for raising it. budget madam president. all of us realize our country faces a fiscal crisis. unless we take action. we are going to see dramatic damage to our economy in the years to come. with the retirement of the baby boomers. our current spending levels on social security. medicare. and medicaid in particular are simply unsustainable. absent reform. the social security trust fund is expected to be exhausted by 2041. the medicare part a trust fund will be exhausted in 2019only 11 years from nowand the cost of these federal programs will actually exceed the current budget. the resulting deficits will be so large that many predict the government will not be able to borrow its way out of the problem. so we do need to take some steps now. some may think these grim predictions. these projections are not accurate. maybe things are not as bad as some are projecting. but i do not think anybody can doubt we are moving to a period of time when our ability to fund the entitlement programs. plus our general expenditures. will be beyond our capacityreally beyond our capacity. it becomes more difficult each year we delay in getting there. next week we will be marking up. in the budget committee. this years budget. i have served on the budget committee for a number of years. last year. we had a budget. and it was a bit discouraging. we have had discouraging budgets for some years. frankly. i want to make some remarks to clarify what i think is a problem. some would say it is partisan. but i think we might as well talk about it because. prior to the last election. our democratic colleagues vigorously attacked the republicans for not fixing our fiscal situation. they said: you are in the majority. there was. in truth. much merit to those criticisms. i do not think the republican majority did a very good job. and people were not happy about it. it was a factor in the last election. in fact. in the last election. 2006. when my democratic colleagues were promising to do betterand they achieved a majority in both houses of congressthe polling data showed the democratic members of congress were believed to be better able than republicans to confront this deficit problem we were facing. so it was a factor. i think. in the last election. i note that over the last several years substantial progress was made about the deficit. we do not need to be too negative here. the deficit fell from $413 billion in 2004 to $162 billion last year. that is more than halfwell more than halfthat we reduced it. i. frankly. was very hopeful that if we could continue to contain the growth in spending we would see that deficit continue to fall. but two things have happened that. frankly. make this a difficult year. first. the congress voted for a $170 billion stimulus package to send everybody checks and other things-$170 billion. last year. our deficit was just $162 billion. this year we added on top of all of our spending another $170 billion. since we were already in deficit. where did we get the money to pay the $170 billion? nobody disputes it: every single dollar of the $170 billion proposed is paid for by more debt. it is borrowed. it is going to be a debt we will carry and our grandchildren will carry. frankly. and we will pay interest on it. so this years budget is going to look bad. and it is going to be difficult because we have another $170 billion. and that is more than the deficit of all of last year. secondly. we still have very considerable expenses related to the war on terrorism. that hurts. but that was included in last years deficit. the next thingthat is troubling for us allis the economic slowdown. we tax the american people pretty heavilyfrankly. more than i like to see them taxed. we tax upper income people with even higher marginal tax rates than we tax lower income people. when the economy is doing welland somebody should do a better study about this. i think. than has been done to datewhen the economy is doing well. upper income people tend to do very well. so their businessmaybe they own 10 or 12 of this or that outlets in some city. the economy is booming. the ceo. the owner. makes $300.000 a year. and he pays that 35percent marginal income tax rate to the federal government. now. if the economy slows down. instead of making $300.000. he makes $100.000. it looks like a lot of money. but it certainly will not benefit the u.s. treasury nearly as much because the marginal rate on $100.000 will be lower than 35 percent. and he will only be paying on $100.000. so i say. we have created a tax system that has tied itself to a growing economy. and we are not in a growing economy this year. it looks like the economy is going to slow down. and it is troubling. so we cannot project the same level of revenue to the u.s. government that we had the last several years. which had been surging. it was 13 percent. 11 percent. 10 percent the last 3 years in growth. so we are facing a difficult issue. my democratic colleagues. during this past election. promised to cut spending and do better than those who had been in power. my very fine colleague senator conradwho i think. if he had more support among his majority colleagues. would be able to do more than he is doingsaid these things last year. this is the chairman of the budget committee: so for those of us who are concerned about spending. sign me up. on \"60 minutes\": we need to be tough on spending. i think most of it is going to have to be on the spending side of the equation. given the magnitude of the baby boom generation. i think we should sharply inhibit the growth of spending. well. those were some promises that were made last year. they have also promised and made a big todo about the tax gap. now. the debate over the tax gap was simply this: well. we dont want to promote in our first budgetlast year. that was the first democratic budgeta tax increase. so what we will do is we will use the same current tax rates. and what we will do is collect more and get those people who are cheating. we had reports from the irs that said that was not going to work. we had experienced senators. such as senator grassley. former chairman of the finance committee. who said: that is not going to work. senator gregg. former chairman of the budget committee. and now ranking republican on that committee. said: it is not going to work. oh. but they used that argument. when the budget was passed. this extra income they projected would be received into the treasury as a result of enhanced enforcement by the irs. that that was going to help them. allow them to spend more money and not increase the debt. ok. that was the debate we had last year when we passed a budget: a commitment they would raise more money by collecting from those who are not paying as much as they are supposed to pay. it did not happen. i will talk about that in a minute. but i want to say this: a budget is a defining document for a political party. it is organized 5149 with a democratic majority here. we passed a budget act a number of years agobecause we could not pass budgets because of filibustersto eliminate the filibusters during budget debates. you can pass a budget with a majority vote. so the majority party. as the republicans could do in the past. was able to pass a budget without support from the other party. anybody who is in a majority in the senate ought to be able to pass a budget. it also is a document that says something about the priorities and the direction that the majority wants to see the country go: how they are going to get there. it is a very important. defining document. senator gregg. last year. was very eloquent. he is such an experienced and wise senator. who watches this carefully. he has studied these issues carefully. he predicted their budget was not going to add up last year when we passed that budget. but they insisted that it would work. as it was passed. and history now can tell us what happened. looking back. it is cleareven in a period of good economic growth last yearthe promises that were made were not kept. they told us they would cut the existing spending or reduce the rate of increase in spending. yet last year the majority attempted to add $23 billion to president bushs discretionary spending request. which already reflected a $60 billion increase. so president bushs budget had a $60 billion increase in discretionary spending. this excludes social security. medicare. and the militaryor the war supplementals. it excludes those entitlement programs. he proposed $60 billion in increases. our colleagues passed a budget in the senate that was a $23 billion increase above that. contrary to cutting spending. i would suggest my colleagues did not fulfill their promises. but actually proposed a budget that increased spending 50 percent more almost40 percentplus more than president bush proposed. over a 5year period. that budget would have hiked nondefense discretionary spending by $205 billion. but we did have somewhat of a battle last year. and as the great omnibus bill came through at the end of the yearthat monstrositypresident bush threatened a veto. and he forced a cut in spending. republicans in the congress backed him up on that veto threat. and that was achieved at the end. it appeared that we had a spending program that was more akin to president bushs $60 billion increase than to an $83 billion increase as proposed by my democratic colleagues. but it wasnt all that good. frankly. because. as has been the case for decades. there are other options to get around the budgetgimmicks and devices. by abusing the emergency spending designation last year. the majority party was able to spend an additional $24 billion anyway. by calling it an emergency. if we have a budget and we agree to commit to that budget and legislation is proposed that goes above that budget. it is subject to a point of order. and you have to have 60 votes at least before you can spend it. but if you can get enough votes. if you can get 60 votes. you can just declare something an emergency. and you can put the money in the emergency spending with 60 votes. and it doesnt count against the budget because you have declared it an emergency. so that is on top of the deficit budget we have. also. there were great promises that any new spending programs would be offset. this is the paygo rule. how do you offset a new spending program? you can cut spending somewhere else or you can increase taxes. that is the only way to do it under paygo. but our colleagues have oftenthis paygo rule that had been so much ballyhooed here by our colleaguesthey either ignored it or gimmicked the paygo rules last year. such gimmickry resulted in $143 billion in deficit spending. for example. lets look at the schip reauthorization. i hope my colleagues will just think about this. i take no pleasure in this. i have seen republicans do this too. but this is really a blatant example. the bill we passed last year increased funding for schip. the insurance for children. increased spending over 5 years by $35 billion. but in fiscal year 2013. that spending level was decreased by 85 percent. now. i ask my colleagues: why? why would we dramatically increase funding for the schip program and then in an outyear2013slash it by 85 percent? the reason is they score the cost of it over 5 years. so for 4 years we would have a dramatic increase. and in the fifth year they make a dramatic 85percent reduction. the question is. why was that done? so it would fit within the score. the 5year score. but what is really going to happen? does anybody in this senate think that in 2013 we are going to cut the childrens insurance program by 85 percent? of course not. this is a gimmick. it was a gimmick to make it fit within the budget. to appear not to be in violation of the paygo rule when. in fact. we know we couldnt possibly reduce that program by 85 percent. not only does the paygo rule fail to control spending. it will put us on an almost guaranteed path to large tax increases. under the democratic budget that passed last year. any existing tax cut. any existing lower tax rate that expires sometime in the future would be allowed to expirefor our colleagues. to continue those current levels of taxes. to continue them at a lower rate is considered a tax cut. so to extend the dividend cuts. extend the capital gains cuts. extend the lower rates for lower income workers. it amounts to. under their definition. a tax cut. it takes 60 votes under this paygo rule to pass a tax cut. president clinton said he opposes these tax cuts that president bush passed. and i think that represents the majority view of my colleagues. so we are looking at a period of time that we could. see additional increases in taxes. and to keep them at the current rate. they will score it as a tax cut. we will either pay for it under this definition by reducing spending or increasing taxes somewhere else. we are not going to reduce spending because we have already seen the majority party has proposed a budget that spends more than president bush proposed. and he proposed an increase in spending. it is sort of a perverse little deal. under this paygo rule. my colleagues assume that spending will go up each year. so that doesnt have to be offset. it goes up at a certain rate. but they say if you extend the current tax rates. that is a tax cut. it provides an incentive and an advancement of spending and a detriment to tax reductions. now. with regard to the tax gap. it would be pretty humorous. frankly. if it werent so serious. their proposals on this tax gap. this idea that they are going to raise more taxes by having the irs increase collections. was one of the wildest political chimeras this senate has seen in quite a number of years. as i have indicated. senior senators such as senator grassley and senator gregg pointed out how it was not going to work. and they cited the irs and other things that showed it. but we passed it anyway. we scored the budget on the assumption the money would come in. it was going to raise $300 billion over 5 years. just in enhanced collections. so we assumed we were going to enhance tax collections by $300 billion over the next 5 years last year when we passed this democratic budget. but we see now. from the best estimates we have for the effort of closing the tax gap. it is not going to raise $300 billion. it will raise $200 million over 5 years. $40 million a yearhardly enough to impact the overall deficit situation we are in at all. the house has recently passed legislation that actually is going to widen the tax gap. unfortunately. our colleagues promised to enact middleclass tax relief. but that has not been done. there has been no action to extend the marriage penalty relief we have today. the $1.000perchild tax credit we have. the 10percent tax break creditthe 10percent tax bracket for lowincome workers. or any kind of estate tax reform. so we have had that talk. but we havent passed it. and we are heading to the point where we are going to have a paygo problem to even extend these current rates. and they are going to score that as a tax cut and demand to know where we are going to get the money from. the capital gains reduction that virtually every economist agrees results in increased revenues to the government from capital gains taxes will expire in 2010. the 10percent tax bracketthe low 10percent tax bracket that didnt previously exist but was created as a result of president bushs tax cuts would expire. and it would go back to 15 percent for lower income individuals. setting a dividend rate at 15 percent will end. it will go back to the marginal rate for many people of over 30 percent. does anybody think that is going to help the stock market to increasedoublethe rate for dividend taxes you have to pay? so the best scores we have are that we are heading toward a $900 billion tax increase that will impact directlyand everybody indirectly116 million taxpayers. what about entitlements? the majority party talked about doing something about entitlements. i think senator conrad truly believes we should do something about it. he has worked hard at it. but he has never gotten the support on his side of the aisle to ever make a dent in it. we have to think about entitlement spending. at this point in time. entitlement spendingsocial security. medicare. medicaidexceeds half of our budget. half of what we spend. that number is growing. some have it up to 100 percent of the current budget level in a number of decades unless something were to change. at least president bush consistently has offered programs to improve and contain the growth in these programs. he talked about social security reform. and the door was slammed shut. my colleagues wouldnt even discuss it. he has talked about medicare and medicaid. nobody would talk about that last year. it was absolutely not a part of last years budget. so i think this is irresponsible. if we are heading on a glidepath that takes us to trillions and trillions of dollars in debt. driven overwhelmingly by the 6. 7. 8 percent increases annually in medicare and medicaid. why cant we begin to reduce that growth rate and bring it more close to the inflation rate of 2. 3 percent. maybe 4 percent. 5 percent increases each year? finally. i thought one of the most effective critiques of the republican majority leadership in 2006 and the years before was we werent passing our appropriations bills on time. they had too much pork in them. stuff was put in them in the dead of night. and we didnt have a chance to read it and do anything about it. that was the valid criticism of the republican majority. what happened this past year after our colleagues won the majority. claiming they were going to do better? did they do better? well. we have 12 appropriations bills each year. we should enact each one of them individually. they should be brought up on the floor onebyone. there should be an opportunity to offer amendments. and they should be voted up or down. right? no. that is not the way it goes. this past year. we had the largest omnibus bill in 20 years. the majority sent us. near christmas. a 1.600page omnibus package that combined into one bill 11 of the 12 appropriations bills. and then it hit this floor. there was no time to read it. we didnt know what kind of pork or policy had been added to it. we were challenged to vote for it or not. it was $555 billion. that is worse than we have had in terms of an omnibus package in 20 years. frankly. the majority leader. senator reid. has indicated that he may not even bring up the appropriations bills or we may have another great omnibus bill this year. but after the election. well. the election is in november. the fiscal year starts october 1. it is our responsibility to have the appropriations bills passed before the beginning of the fiscal year. october 1. it is as if he is throwing in the towel before we even get there. frankly. as an aside. i truly believe we would do much better if we went to a 2year budget and 2year appropriations. as over half of the states have. that would help us in this process because this happens every year. and it is getting worse. it seems. every year. we will soon have the new budget resolution. it will hit the committee next week. i am a member of the committee. it was a failed and unhealthy budget last year that was moved forward by our democratic colleagues. i am afraid this one will not be much better. i noticed that the democratic presidential candidates are offering a lot of new proposals. senator obama. who now leads. has offered 158 of them that would cost at least $312 billion in new annual spending. or $1.4 trillion over 5 years. as we tend to score those things. that doesnt include all of his proposals that are out there. madam president. i will conclude by telling the american people and my colleagues that next week we will begin a defining process. next week. the majority party will offer a budget. because of the budget rules. with 51 votes. they will be able to pass this budget. so because the democratic majority has 51 votes. they can pass the budget they want. but we need to examine it because it will tell us and america what their priorities are. what their commitment is. how willing they are to sacrifice and make sure we have fiscal responsibility in this country. based on last years budget. i am afraid it is not going to be any better. based on the fact that senator reid says he doesnt expect we will finish the appropriations process until after the november elections. i dont sense any commitment to do better than the republicans did when they had the majority. certainly. this year. their performance was worse. this past year. it was worse. and it doesnt look as if it will be better in the future. i thank the chair for this opportunity to share my concerns. i hope we can be frank about these matters because the majority party knows it has a very serious responsibility when it submits a budget. we knew it when we had the majority. i sat on the budget committee. senator conrad and his colleagues know they have that responsibility. they also know they have the votes to pass this. therefore. there can be no excuses. there is nowhere to hide. are you going to do anything about entitlements? are you going to guarantee tax cuts? are you going to submit a budget that projects lower spending or one that is filled with gimmicks to hide even more spending increases? it is a big deal. we will be talking about this for some weeks. i hope our colleagues will focus on this.","mr. president. since it

perfect. but it provides appropriate funding for many important purposes. and i will vote for it. subcommittee chairman hobson. ranking member visclosky. and their colleagues on the appropriations committee deserve our thanks for their work on this legislation. their task was made harder by the restrictions imposed by the budget resolution cham.pioned by the republican leadership. and the bill does not include some things that i think should have been funded. but i think they have done a good job with the allocation of funds available to them. and the bill does include some items of particular importance to coloradans. in particular. i am very pleased that it will provide nearly $580 million to continueand. i hope. completethe cleanup of rocky flats. formed by the location of a facility for making key parts of nuclear weapons. the rocky flats site is located just 15 miles from downtown denver and at one time was the location of large quantities of nuclear materials and other hazardous substances. because of its proximity to our states major metropolitan area. timely and effective cleanup and closure of the site has been a matter of top priority for all coloradans. with the funding provided by this bill and barring unforeseen developments. the department of energy and its contractor. kaiserhill. should be able to complete the cleanup in the coming monthsand while the department will have ongoing responsibilities at rocky flats. completing the cleanup will enable it to focus even more intently on the cleanup work to be done at other sites. so. i strongly support this part of the bill. however. while we are taking care of the site. it is essential that we also take care of those who worked there. some of them were made sick because of exposure to beryllium. radiation. or other hazards. it was because of them. and those like them who worked at other sites. that i worked with our colleagues from kentucky and ohio. mr. whitfield and mr. strickland. as well as others in both the house and senate. and with secretary of energy bill richardson and his colleagues in the clinton administration. to pass the energy employees occupational illness compensation program act (eeoicpa). i am proud to have beenable to help get this program enacted and i will continue working to improve it for those who have worked at rocky flats and other sites. and. we need to also remember the other workers at rocky flats as well. as they near the completion of their jobs at the site. they are understandably concerned about what will come next. many have moved on to other jobs. and others will do so. but many are facing uncertainties about their futures. for all of them. it is essential that doe acts promptly to resolve remaining questions about the futures they can expect when their work at rocky flats is finished. for that reason. i recently wrote to ask secretary bodman to give immediate attention to two important matters-(1) determining the future administration of pension and health insurance plans for rocky flats workers (and for those at other closure sites as well). and (2) assuring thecontinued availability of medical benefits for rocky flats workers who will not be eligible for full retirement at the time of the sites closure. i pointed out that does office of legacy management (lm) has stated that it is developing a plan for the transition of pension and insurance plans. as well as for record keeping and other matters for which lm is responsible. however. i also noted that no such plan yet exists. which means there is increasing concern among the rocky flats workers about their future. there now remain only a few months for these matters to be resolved prior to closure. time is of the essence. so. i was very glad to note that the committee report accompanying this bill directs doe to report by september 30. 2005. on the departments plan for a national stewardship contract for administration of the pension and benefit payments to former environmental management closure site contractor employees. i applaud the commttee for including this directive. and urge the administration to complete and submit this report as soon as possible. the bill also includes other matters of particular importance for colorado. it provides funding for several bureau of reclamation projects in our state. including the coloradobig thompson project and the fryingpanarkansas project as well as the ongoing construction of the animasla plata project. it also includes needed funds for operation and maintenance of a number of reservoirs operated by the armys corps of engineers as well as for other corps activities in colorado. and i am very glad to note that the bill will provide funds for completing construction of the new science and technology facility at the national renewable energy laboratory. i am disappointed. however. that the bill shortchanges some of the important clean energy programs at nrel. as cochair of the renewable energy and energy efficiency caucus in the house. i have worked for years to increaseor at a minimum. hold steadyfunding for does renewable energy and energy efficiency research and development programs. given the finite supply and high prices of fossil fuels and increasing global demand. investing in clean energy is more important than","mr. president. last year right about this time i stood in the senate chamber questioning why an administration that talks so much about the importanpe of homeland security and first responders would submit a budget that so drastically shortchanges their needs. i find myself 1 year later still asking the same questions but hearing no good answers. specifically as it pertains to community policing and other law enforcement programs. this budget shortchanges smaller communities and grossly under funds programs that have put more police officers on the street. reduced crime in rural areas. curbed drug abuse and put atrisk youth back on the right track. instead of strengthening these programsprograms that we know workwe are pulling the rug right out from under our communities feet. under the budget proposal. the cops program would see a reduction from $756 million to $44 milliona staggering 94 percent cut. let me be clear: taking away cops funding will mean less police officers on our streets. it will mean less resource officers in our schools preventing violence and drug abuse. it will also mean longer response times and higher crime rates. this is tradeoff we should never even consider. yet alone go through with. since 1994. my state received $88.4 million in cops grants. which has funded 1.289 additional police officers and sheriff deputies. 112 school resource officers and more than $11 million in crimefighting technologies. arkansas is not alone. i ask if there is a senator among us that would contest that their state has benefited from the cops program. we cant be serious about law enforcement by paring this successful program to $44 million. texas alone received nearly $30 million from the cops program last year. how are we going to fund the entire countrys cops needs using the budget of what just one state received last year? when i was the attorney general of my state. i worked closely with law enforcement to make arkansas a safer place to live and raise a family. one thing i know for sure. these police officers operate under tight budgets with smaller staffs than most of their urban counterparts. nevertheless. they put their lives on the line every day and we need to make sure they have adequate resources to do their jobs properly. i recently talked with several arkansas police chiefs about the proposed cuts to the cops program. they told me how important this program was in their continuing battle to stop the production of methamphetamine throughout arkansas. chief james allen of the bentonville police department said the cops program has been the biggest single factor in helping his region fight the environmental and social problems created by methamphetamine use. last year alone. arkansas police shut down 1.208 meth labs. but more are popping up each day. methamphetamine spreads so easily because it is cheap and easy to produce. it is also extremely addictive and it is tearing rural communities apart. law enforcement officials have told me that if congress feduces cops funding by 94 percent. we would effectively decimate their ability to battle this deadly drug. these law enforcement officers are making a huge difference in our communities and on top of that. they play the integral part in our homeland defense as first responders. cops grants have played a critical role in providing additional manpower. technology and trainingall of which are necessary to enhance community security and contribute to the overall goal of national domestic preparedness. the chief of police in pine bluff. ar daniel moses characterized his homeland security overtime grant as a godsend. september 11 madeus acutely aware of the need of genuine partnerships that involve all segments of our communities and all levels of governmentwe all have a role in keeping our community safe. our local law enforcement must be able to respond to whatever may confront them in the future. but how can they properly respond. when they are given a budget that cuts deep into their existence? i would also like to note that in my state. a number of police officers on the front lines of crime prevention are also fighting on the front lines in iraq and afghanistan. they are pulling double duty for our country in the reserves and national guard. but at the same time. their absence has spread our police forces even thinner. we need td build on what we know works. these law enforcement programs work. but dont take my word for it. take the word of attorney general john ashcroft who said not two years ago: since law enforcement agencies began partnering with citizens through community policing weve seen significant drops in crime rates. mr. president. our communities. the people we represent have truly benefited from these programs and taking away its funding would be a major step backwards in our efforts to fight crime.","i thank the senior senator from new mexico for what really has become a very thoughtful and methodical approach toward resolving a national energy debate. and bringing us legislation that not all parties agree on but clearly is that abundant market basket full of ideas and concepts and realities. we believe. that bring this country once again toward energy selfsufficiency. and our ability to stand on our feet and be proud that we are what we are as a country. our great strength has always been in our abundance of relatively inexpensive energy. it has driven our economy. it powers us up as a great country. without doubt. it is what lights up the computer screens of our country and has made us the leading hightech manufacturer in the world. i was in san jose. ca. this weekend speaking to a group. there were about 50 ceos from hightech companies from the valley. the heart of the silicon valley. we call it silicon valley west because right here at the beltway in northern virginia is what i call silicon valley east. the heart and home of the internet systems and internet companies. while i was talking about technology. they wanted to know about energy. in that valley they demand a high quality of electrical generation. constant power loads to feed their manufacturing facilities. they are very frustrated because of the problems california has had. which has been in part a policy issue and in part a transmission problem. all of those problems are embodied in our legislation. that is why it is important we resolve and get to our presidents desk a bill so we can help the energy segment of our economy get on its feet and get moving again for the sake of all. i have said several times. and i think most agree. this legislation. s. 14. has more new jobs to be created in the next 4 to 5 years than the stimulus package. while the stimulus package was critically important. and i voted for it and it already appears to be turning on the economy across this country. the longterm infrastructure investment for the energy industries of our country that will fuel our homes and light up our computer screens in the future is embodied in this bill. that is why it becomes so important for everyone. let me step back to hydrogen for a moment. 1 have no difficulty with the senator from north dakota proposing legislation that said agencies ought to submit annual plans and reports that look at transition and talk about and build a system or a mechanism for transition to a hydrogen economy as these technologies develop. as these new production capabilities come on line. that would be a right and appropriate thing to do in light of where the technology of this industry is. i have visited with hydrogen fuel cell engineers. scientists who study this area. they are telling me it would be very hard to measure. they are suggesting we need to prove the worth of this technology to the american consumer-\"worth\" meaning a sense of safety. a lot of folks are wondering. is a hydrogen car going to be safe? they fail to recognize that a gaspowered car that they assume is safe sometimes is not as safe as we think it is. there have been fires and explosions. is a hydrogen car safe? we believe they can be manufactured to be every bit as safe as a gaspowered car. if not safer. but bow do you prove it? one of the ways is to get hydrogen used in the economy before.it is transitioned to transportation. how does that happen? the development of hydrogen fuel cells. that actually fuel homes. manufacturing plants. other facilities that are perhaps less adjacent to or isolated from transmission capability. to have a hydrogen fuel cell that can actually produce enough power for a factory is not unreasonable to assume. or a single home in a rural setting. once that consumerism begins to develop in this country and there is a general understanding that hydrogen is a part of our energy economy. the reality of transition to a transportation base is probably even greater. maybe they go equally together. but i know the scientists and the engineers are thinking one or the other or both. one before the other. part of it all comes together at some point. i believe it can. i. along with senator domenici and others who study energy sources for our country as members of the energy and natural resources committee. have spent a long time looking at this as a concept to be explored. as the senator from new mexico mentioned. we are committing a lot of public resources to this. we ought to. it is clean. what happens to the exhaust system of a hydrogenpowered fuel cell? no emission. except a drop of water. so there is no emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. interestingly enough. when you use natural gas to create hydrogen. the process creates an emissions problem. when you use electrolysis of water to create hydrogen. you do not. so there is another reason to examine and build on the technology of electrolysis. we think the natural blend. the hand in glove. if you will. the synergy that can be created by new passive nuclear reactors that are safe. cool in operation. automatic shutdowns. but can do the -constant load. that can create the economies of optimum operation and therefore at great cost saving to the consumer. is a technology that ought to be developed and is embodied within 5. 14. i will now. therefore. have to oppose the dorgan amendment for all of those reasons. it is not time to require the acquisition in the market. it is time to push the technology. it is time to ask for the reports. it is time for this senate to be able to understand progress and growth and development in this area and the likelihood of a time down the road when more and more of our economy will actually be using hydrogen as an energy base. it is with that i come to the floor to debate this amendment. i hope as we get to it tomorrow and a vote in the senate. as the chairman has spoken to. that senators will consider the reality that this is not the time for targets. this is not the time for hard goals. this is a time for pushing the. technology. building on it. encouraging the private sector to marry up with the public sector. to advance the technology. and it may well be time for the department of energy to be required to report and analyze on an annual basis for our sake. for those who make public policy. the reality of these technologies. i yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.","madam president. i thank the chair of the committee. i thank my colleague and very good friend. senator harkin. for his work on this bill. i thank senator lugar for his work. especially in the area dealing with nutrition. and for his thoughtful comments. i will start out with just a practical minnesota point of view and then review broader questions. this coming year. minnesota farmers will see $1.16 billion in assistance from this legislationan increase of approximately $395 million over the 1996 farm bill. over the next 6 years. my state will see about $5.7 billion from this farm bill. or about a $2 billion increase above the 1996 farm bill for the state of minnesota. now. if i had my wayand i dont think my colleague would disagree with mei would love to have higher loan rates and rely less on direct payments so that farmers would have more leverage to get a better price through the marketplace. however. the 1996 farm bill or the \"freedom to fail\" bill was one of the worst things that ever happened to rural america. i went home the day it was passed. and i said to my wife sheila: this is the worst thing that has happened in the senate. this year. without a new farm bill. the freedom to farm bill would give us a 20percent drop in farm income. all that has kept farmers going is all the amta payments and the government subsidy. if members are worried about payment limitation. which i am and which my colleague said we will come back to again. this fight is not over. a lot of these direct payments to the largest producers have been the epitome of subsidy in inverse relationship to need. however i dont make apologies as a senator from minnesota for supporting this bill. i would have liked to have had the ban on packer ownership. i tried to pass that amendment in committee. we lost. then i joined senators johnson. grassley. and harkin to offer a ban on packer ownership on the senate floor. we won. then it was knocked out in conference. unfortunately the house conferees refused to support it. however. we will come back to it again. in the senate. we passed a bipartisan payment limitation amendment. the senate bill established a reasonable limitation on payments to the very largest farming operation. that would have affected fewer than 100 farms in my state of minnesota. my colleague from indiana has spoken to that. it was the right thing to do. and i continue to strongly support those payment limitations. i regret what came out of conference. but again we were blocked by the house conferees. but as senator harkin said. are we going to let a conference committee stop a whole farm bill and continue with \"freedom to fail\"? there is too much economic pain in the countryside. i didnt like what happened with the environmental quality incentives program. i passed an amendment in the senate that limited payments to $30.000. the amendment. which senators harkin and lugar supported. also said: do not let the smithfields of this world own six. seven. eight confined animal feeding operations and get a big subsidy for every one of them. i would preferred that eqip. an important environmental program. be targeted to our family farmers. there are certainly some missed opportunities. but. on the positive side. my colleague from iowa already talked about the dairy front. this is hugely important for my state of minnesota. this is the first really good. positive thing i have seen happen in dairy for over a decade. in addition. while i will continue to fight for higher loan rates. in the house bill. the secretary of agriculture had the discretion to lower loan rates. this administration. the president in his budget proposal. went on record in support of lower loan rates. so at least the loan rates go up for the first time in a couple of decades and the effective safety net or target price is much higher. i am hoping and praying our producers can cashflow so they will have a future. i think this legislation will give them that opportunity. again. for this coming year. to talk about $394 million of addition assistance to minnesota agriculture. i make no apologies for that as a senator from minnesota. over the next 6 years. an average of $330 million more of it is targeted to minnesota family farmers so they can continue to farm. you better believe i support that. an increase of net farm income averaging $4.5 billion a year for the nationyou better believe i support that. it is a darned sight better than \"freedom to fail.\" when i hear some of my colleagues say actually supporting family farmers is in competition with the social security trust fund or making sure we support medicare. i just have to smile and say: wait a minute. where were you when you voted for these robinhoodinreverse tax cuts which bleed the economy of trillions of dollars? where were you? dont be pitting family farmers in minnesota against medicare or against social security. we are not going to let you get away with that. not in this debate and not ever. on the plus side. above and beyond arguments made already. i would like to thank the chairman. senator harkin. and i am proud to be part of this effort as well. i would also like to thank the other senate confereessenators daschle. conrad. and leahy. senator harkins success on this bill is irrefutable. senator harkin from iowa. with the conservation security program. he led the way. the conservation security program will provide assistance to producers who adopt conservation practices on working lands. i love. the conservation reserve program. which we were able to increase with this bill. i love the wetlands reserve program. which we were also able to increase. i love working with ducks unlimited. pheasants forever. and other great conservation groups. now. with the conservation security program we will be focusing on land in production with economic incentives for farmers to utilize wise conservation practices. this is winwinwin. i have loved seeing senator harkin. the environmental community. and the agricultural community working together. this is really a sea change for the better. it is a huge change for the better and the senator from iowa deserves all the credit in the world for this. above and beyond that we have country of origin labeling. that was an amendment i did in committee. i am proud to pass that amendment. i thank the conferees for keeping it in. i know these big conglomerates dont like it because it gives our independent producers a leg up. because these big conglomerates are shipping out and shipping in and not relying on our independent producers here in this country. in addition consumers have a right to know what they are eating and where it is .from. it is hugely important. franklyi can say it now because the conference report is overi am amazed it is in the conference report. but i thank the chairman for his help. then for the first time ever we have an energy title. people are excited in greater minnesota. in rural america. about this energy section. because rural america has part of the answer. we talked about ethanol and biodiesel. but there is another part of thisits wind. solar. and biomass. in minnesota it is a nobrainer. we are a cold weather state at the other end of the pipeline. we import barrels of oil. we export $11 billion a year. but we are rich in.wind and biomass to electricity. we are rich in saved energy. we are rich in clean technology. small business. this is a marriage ready to be made in heaven. this bill moves us down that patha clean energy path. it is respectful of the environment. keeps capital in the community. it is small business intensive. jobs intensive. keeps capital in our statesthis is great. the economic development piece is hugely important. i heard my colleague. the senator from iowa. talking about telecommunications. that we dont want to be left out. i am so pleased my rural telework initiative has been included. again. it is my work and i am bragging about it. but setting up a telework institute is a major victory for rural communities. information technology companies. have said: listen. we know the work ethic of people in rural america. we want to make .sure. if the federal government is willing to provide the grants and willing to get this goingthen we have a real opportunity for people to- be able. out of their homes. out of a satellite office. to work for companies halfway across the world much less halfway across our own country. people do not have to leave our rural communities. our young people do not have to leave. i meet so many young people in greater minnes6ta. in our rural communities. basically they are following the advice to get ahead. get a good education. which means get out of here. that is the death knell for our communities. one thing they are asking about is whether or not they could stay in the community. are they going to be able to? if they farm. are they going to get a decent price. job opportunities. a small business going? will there be good education and health care and environment? and on the job opportunitiesi love thisthe rural telework initiative means people in our rural communities can work for companies halfway across the world. lets make sure this happens. we dont.want rural america left behind with this information technology economy. we can be a part of it. i think there is huge bipartisan support for this. of course i am bragging. but i want my state of minnesota to be the leader. i think we can. my final point: we are going to be back on this fight on packer ownership. we are going to be back on this fight on payment limitations. i talked to the chairman and he said we are going to do additional investigative work. we are going to do additional public hearings. in addition. one of the things i cant wait to do. and albeit it is easier said than done. i want to write an antitrust bill looking at the food industry. in summary. this conference report perfect. but i do not want to keep going on with this \"freedom to fail\" bill. i want to see a change. this bill represents that change. i agree with some of the critiquing from some of my colleagues. but all in all. this is a step forward for agriculture in minnesota. it is a big step forward for the farm structure in minnesota. it is a big step forward for the environment. it is a big step forward for a better energy policy. it is a big step forward for. economic development. it is a big step forward for people who live in greater minnesota and live in our rural communities. i am willing to come out here and debate and fight for this bill and support this bill. an finally would like to ask for a commitment from senator harkin that we are not done with this battle on the reform battle on payment limitations. and on the ban on packer ownership. lets go after someof these conglomerates. its the right thing to do. i yield the floor.","mr. speaker. my 2 minutes has been reduced to 30 seconds. so i will turn in my remarks. two wrongs simply do not make a right. i share dallas/ fort worth airport with the gentleman from texas . and i have three other airports. i know how many people were laid off. but that will be fourfold or more if we do not support the airlines tonight. it is for that reason that i rise in support of this bill. and i have been working to make sure that we come up with the other bill to support those persons who have already lost their jobs. mr. speaker. although i have some misgivings regarding what has not been included in the bill. i rise in support of h.r. 2926 and urge its passage by the house. in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon. air carriers have reported sustaining nearly $1 billion in losses as a direct result of the federal governments order that flights be grounded. while service has been restored. passengers are still reluctant to fly. as a result. the airlines will certainly suffer further losses from reduced demand. on monday. the financial markets responded predictably to this environmentthe airlines lost about 40% of their market capitalization on that day alone. and morgan stanley wrote to the treasury secretary that the airline industry would not have access to private capital markets unless the federal government intervened. h.r. 2926 is the intervention that the airlines need to stabilize their financial situation and to help them weather this crisis. unless we act to pass h.r. 2926. some carriers face the very real possibility of bankruptcy. we cannot let that happen. the airline industry is an indispensable sector of the american economy. touching upon 10% of our gross domestic product. without aviation. other important sectors such as aircraft manufacturing. hospitality. tourism. and countless others cannot function efficiently. we already see a glimpse here in the washington. dc metropolitan area how bankruptcies in the airline industry will affect businesses and communities. washington national airport has still not been given clearance to resume operations. as a result. the airport and other businesses dependent on passenger flows have laid off thousands of workers. and small businesses like restaurants and newsstands who cater to passengers are idle and losing money. unemployment lines in this area are overflowing. we must act to pass h.r. 2926 to prevent this situation from being replicated in cities across the country. despite the tax rebates. which my democratic colleagues devised and which i supported. the nation is already teetering on the brink of a recession. if we do not act to stabilize our airlines. we risk plunging the country into a fullscale depression and massive unemployment. indeed. i am most concerned about the individuals who work in the airline industry and their families. they include the 140.000 employees of american airlines. whose headquarters and major hub operations are located at dfw international airport in my district. i am also concerned about the 40.000 people who work at the airport and whose jobs depend on americans survival. two days ago. american announced that they would have to lay off 20.000 of its workers. and i know what kind of hardship they must be going through right now. i have heard some of my colleagues object to this bill because it does not contain language to provide relief to displaced workers. i too want to ensure that workers have enough money to pay their rent and mortgages. to buy food and clothes for their kids. and to keep their health benefits while they are unemployed. i understand that majority leader daschle has promised to call up legislation -regarding displaced airline employees in the senate next week. and i intend to make sure that this legislation also passes the house. i also intend to work with my colleagues on legislation to restore the publics confidence in airport and aircraft security because airlines longterm survival depends on their having paying passengers. in the meantime. we must deal with the impending crisis. the employees of american and dfw airport have flooded my phone lines in my district office with a loud and clear messagecongress number i priority in this area is to pass legislation to help american airlines ride out this storm. they. in their collective wisdom. know whats at stake. we have some time and leeway to help displaced workers. but unless we act now to help the airlines avert bankruptcy. they might not have jobs to return to.","mr. president. im very pleased to announce that. after months of very hard work. we have bipartisan legislation which will clean up and redevelop the abandoned industrial sites known as brownfieldss. 2700. the brownfields revitalization and environmental restoration act of i first introduced brownfields legislation in the senate in 1993. in the hopes of both protecting public health. and addressing the problems of blighted areas. since that time. it has become clear that there are even more reasons to address brownfields than we originally thought. in fact. there are few environmental issues which cut across so many problems and offer so many solutions. mr. president. brownfields threaten the health of our citizensand the economic health of communities across the country. by leading to abandoned inner cities. increased crime. loss of jobs and declining tax revenues. brownfields also lead to urban sprawl. loss of farmland. increased traffic and air pollution and loss of historic districts it older urban centers. but once theyre cleaned up and made useful again. they also represent tremendous potential innew jobs and a cleaner environment. now. .finally. we have a bipartisan plan to achieve those goals. the legislation were introducing today provides federal money to investigate and clean up brownfields sites. state and local governments would use this money to determine which sites pose environmental problems. to decide which redevelopment options hold the greatest promise. and most important. to get these sites cleaned up. second. the legislation promises important private investments in the cleanup effortby providing liability protection for people interested in buying and cleaning up these sites and for people who bought a brownfields site without knowing it was contaminated. it also removes potential liability for parties who own property which becomes contaminated through no fault of their own. from hazardous substances from an adjacent site. these liability limitations and clarifications will help innocent parties and provide incentives to get these properties cleaned up and back into use. third. this bill does several new and positive things for communities and for the environment. for the first time. it creates a public record of brownfield sites handled under state programs. because the public has a right to know whats happening at the sites near their homes. and it is the first brownfields bill to provide funding not just to assist in redevelopment projects. but also to provide assistance to state and local governments to create and preserve open space. parklands and other recreational areas in former brownfields sites. finally. the bill gives states incentives and funding to develop state programs to clean up their brownfield sites quickly and safely. it has provisions to encourage cooperation and coordination between the federal and state governments. both of whom play an active role in cleaning up these sites and protecting the citizens. the bill strikes a delicate balance. it provides deference to state cleanup programs but still ensures that the federal superfund program will be able to come in and address problems when a site poses a serious problem. the brownfields cleanup and redevelopment strategy in this legislation is comprehensive. its fiscally responsible. and it will improve the quality of life for people throughout the country. it promises thousands of new jobs and millions in new tax revenue. it promises increased momentum for smart growth. which means cleaner air and less congested roads. it promises a new focus on revitalizing downtown areas. which will reduce urban sprawl. lower rates and protect parkland and open space. i come from the most densely populated state in this country. and i understand the importance of protecting open space. mr. president. the nations mayors estimate that brownfields cost between $200 million and $500 million a year in lost tax revenues. returning these sites to productive use could create some 236.000 new jobs. just look at the progress weve made even over the last few years. grants from the epa to aid in cleaning up brownfields sites have helped generate more than 5.800 jobs and about $1.8 billion in revenues. in new jersey alone. weve rescued more than 1.000 brownfields sites. replacing polluted lagoons with office centers and covering abandoned rail yards with condominium complexes. these successes benefit everyoneboth environmentally and economically. which is why this legislation has strong support from both democrats and republicans. mr. president. in the 1960s. this country turned its attention away from downtown areas and started focusing on the suburbs. we see now what that got us: clogged highways. overcrowded airports. and increased pollution. its time to turn that trend around. and thats exactly what this legislation will do. i also want to thank my three colleagues for their determination and hard work in hammering out this compromise. senator smith. our new chairman. has really reached out to all members of the committee to try to craft good environmental legislation. senator baucus. the democratic leader on our committee. has been a stalwart advocate for a good superfund program and a compromise brownfields bill. we have fought many battles together over the years. finally. senator chafee has shown great courage and energy. bringing us together to do what was once unthinkable. a superfund related bill that has bipartisan support. i look forward to working with all of them to ensure that this bill is signed into law. thank you. following is a summary of the bill.","mr. chairman. i do not know if we have unemployed lumberjacks in this country or not. i do not know whether or not there is unemployment in the part of the country of my colleague. i think there might be some unemployed lumberjacks in this country that would prefer creating the jobs here in the united states of america. of course. then we have to have some environmental controls so that some of these big companies could not rape the environment.","mr. speaker. the chairman of the committee on ways and means got it exactly right. this is a very fragile time. and while i am inclined to support this bill. that fragility makes this measure at this time a foolhardy exercise that could greatly damage our economic strength in the world. make no mistake about it: american prosperity depends on the success of our trading arrangements. today the worlds balance of power is defined less in military terms than it is as a matter of economic strength. trade negotiations are as important to our economic future as the soviet arms talks were to our national security in an earlier era. but subjecting fasttrack legislation to certain defeat today is not only bad politics. it is bad and dangerous policy. it sends a reckless message to securities markets everywhere. our inability to work out an orderly agreement for trade negotiating authority can do real damage in real time to already fragile markets. including our own. and to economies around the world. moreover. it damages the worthwhile goals of people on both sides of the measure before us. it works toward no constructive resolution of legitimate concerns over labor and environmental standards that are within our grasp. negotiating authority is important because our prosperity is tied to market opening global trade. and i believe we must move forward. but playing reckless politics with this issue is a dangerous exercise. and those who brought it to the floor will bear the burden for its defeat and whatever consequences it has throughout the world.","mr. chairman. today we are considering a plan which balances the federal budget by the year 2002. we should be proud that democrats and republicans have been able to work together to create this plan. but it is important that we review the facts and understand how we got ourselves in a position to balance the budget in 5 years. while protecting medicare. medicaid. investing in education. the environment and health care for children. when president clinton arrived in washington in 1993. he inherited a $290 billion budget. deficitthe largest deficit in our nations history. job growth was stagnant. and unemployment was over 7 percent. and washington was unable to find a solution to the exploding deficits and sluggish economy. but in 1993. president clinton proposed a budget plan which included $500 billion in savings over 5 years. the plan was criticized by many of our republican colleagues. who argued that deficits would explode. jobs. would be killed. and our economy would crash if we adopted the presidents budget plan. in fact. not a single republican--in the house or the senatevbted for the 1993 budget plan. but today. 4 years later. the plan has worked. and has put us in a position to balance the budget in 5 years. today our deficit is just $67 billionthe lowest amount since 1979. the budget deficit today makes up just 0.9 of 1 percent of the gross domestic product [gdp]-the lowest level since 1974. since 1993. 12 million new jobs have been created and our unemployment rateat 4.9 percent.s at its lowest level since 1974. democrats know what it takes to balance the budget. we made the tough choices in 1993. and made the tough votes. today we have the opportunity to vote on a resolution which will bring our deficit to zero in just 5 more years. we have assembled a budget plan that is smartwe havent lost our values and goals in the budget cutting process. the budget resolution includes $16 billion to insure 5 million children who have no health care coverage giving working families the opportunity to make their families healthy and more secure. we are investing in education by funding the $1.500 tax credit for the first 2 years of college and the $10.000 tax deduction for all postsecondary education and training. and by increasing the pell grants from $2.700 to $3.000. making 350.000 more students eligible for pell grants. we are tightening our belts. but we are committed to protecting medicare and medicaid. we are investing in education for our kids. we are building a system to give uninsured children health coverage. and we balance the budget by the year 2002. mr. chairman. i support this budget plan because it preserves the programs and efforts that are important to working and middleincome americans: medicare. medicaid. education. environmental protections. and child health. it does all these things and still balances the budget in 5 years. mr. chairman. this plan is smart and it is fair. and i urge my colleagues to vote \"yes\" on the resolution this evening.","mr. president. i would like to explain why i voted against this * proddct liability conference report. all of us in this room have heard horrific stories about people who got hurt when they did stupid or silly things with a product and then recovered tremendous amounts of money from innocent businesses. those few stories have. gotten a lot of mileage. they have gotten us to a conference report that takes power from consumers and gives it to corporations. mr. president. i am a mother who wants to be responsible for passing laws that improve the chances for my children to live healthy. safe lives. i am glad that victims have used the current statebased product liability laws to force manufacturers to make safe toys. nonflammable pajamas. and cars and trucks that dont explode. the current legal system forced companies to be responsible or face the possibility of significant financial loss. i also want to be responsible for passing laws that provide the hard working men and women of this country an opportunity to be fully compensated for injuries that are a direct result of products they use in the workplace. this conference report makes it much harder for our workers to recover damages from those responsible for their injuries. it is designed to give advantage to corporations and disadvantage to our workers through its limits on joint liability for noneconomic damages. on punitive damages. and on seller liability. as well as its broadly drawn defenses to liability. such as the statute of repose. in addition. i want to support legislation that allows our citizens to trust that the medical devices they are rez ceiving are safe. so many women needlessly suffered when the maker of silicone gel breast implants refused to heed initial warning signs that their product was flawed. today. there is no dispute that there is a strong correlation between silicone breast implants and serious health disorders. including joint and muscle pain. tremors. and autoimmune diseases. and. unfortunately. not all of the victims of these implants are known. for those who have not yet filed. this bill will block them from seeking redress from this grossly negligent company. that is wrong. finally. i want to be responsible for legislation that improves our citizens quality of life. this bill could severely limit lawsuits involving products that damage the environment. such as pesticides and toxic chemicals. in particular. the provision addressing joint and several liability could make it nearly impossible for victims to receive full and fair compensation for harm caused by a mixture of toxic substances where a victim is unable to prove the percentage of damage caused by each chemical. especially now. when we see efforts to scale back governments role in environmental protection. the civil justice system is an even more important mechanism for deterring environmental degradation. i know that responsible businesses feel threatened by the current system. i believe we should seek to reform and improve our system. but this approach is too sweeping. we need to take smaller steps and make more incremental reforms. mr. president. i have voted against this conference report for all of the above reasons. i cannot support a products liability law that shifts power from the states to the federal government and takes power away from our children. the elderly and working people and gives it to the companies that produce harmful products.","mr. chairman. i thank the gentleman for yielding. mr. chairman. i rise very strongly to support the advanced technology program. because i know locally that it is not about big business. it is about small technological firms that help give jobs to americans. over 177 r&amp;d projects have been created since the programs inception involving the efforts of some 400 organizations. from government laboratories to academic institutions. and i really want to emphasis academic institutions. it allows the research that would not be supported by the private sector to be supported and to provide the kind of technology. that a local firm in my community has been able to develop a biocatalytic desulfurization technology which aids petroleum companies in conforming to environmental regulations. what better use of our tax dollars than to improve the quality of life. to create jobs. and. of course. to help an industry that is so much in need of enhanced technology to improve its productivity. this small company is an excellent example of why we need the atp program. to aid small r&amp;d organizations with federal moneys in order to develop promising technologies that private sector corporations and venture capital groups would be hesitant to fund. we cannot leave the development of these important new technologies to tax credits or regulatory reform and ignore the need for federal programs like atp. let us continue. mr. chairman. to fund progirams like this. let us support atp. i rise in support of this amendment.","mr. speaker. i rise today to proudly announced the introduction of the risk assessment improvement act of 1994. environmental regulations are not doing the job. threats to health and safety are not being addressed. while precious resources are frittered away on unproductive activity. at the same time we put unnecessary roadblocks in the path of business. causing loss of jobs. this legislation strengthens and coordinates the scientific methods used to calculate threats to human health and provides a basis for protecting the environment while preserving american jobs. it establishes a director of risk assessment at the epa to oversee a new risk program and bring together the variety of existing risk assessment initiatives spread throughout the agency. this will ensure that stateoftheart scientific methods are the basis for the risk assessment guidelines developed by the epa. second. the bill established a pilot program using comparative risk analysis to rank the severity of various environmental hazards. also. the presidents science adviser will coordinate mechanisms in risk assessment to ensure that government agencies address similar risks using compatible methods. this bill already has broad bipartisan support and i urge all members to cosponsor this important initiative.","mr. speaker. on december 9. 1993. the new york county lawyers association will honor robert coulson.president of the american arbitration association since 1972. with the william nelson cromwell award for useful and outstanding service to the profession and the community. i join in offering my congratulations to him and my appreciation for the energy and intellect he has brought to our profession. indeed. his work has affected all our lives and most directly the causes of alternative dispute resolution and legal reform. robert coulson joined the american arbitration association in 1963. the aaa was founded in 1926 by leaders in the business -and legal communities and has become the standardsetting institution for alternative dispute resolution with more than 7.000 members. and more than 52.000 panelists who work on cases involving billions of dollars each year. mr. coulson explained aaas growth on the occasion of its 65th birthday several years ago as a reflection of the fact that arbitration and mediation are favored by business executives and their lawyers as less costly. less timeconsuming and more rational ways of settling disputes. particularly when the court system is flooded with cases. robert coulsorfs passion for reform has affected every activity in which he is involved. he has been active in the association of the bar of the city of new york and the american bar association. serving as chairman of the commercial arbitration committee of the corporation section of the aba and cochairman of the collective bargaining and arbitration committee of the labor section. he serves on the board of the fund for modem courts and is an honorary fellow of the arbitrators institute of canada. he has written and lectured extensively on managementlabor relations and dispute resolution. mr. coulson is the author of \"how to stay out of court.\" \"family mediation will work for you.\" \"the termination handbook.\" \"business arbitration.\" \"labor arbitration.\" \"arbitration in the schools.\" \"alcohol. drugs and arbitration.\" \"empowered at 40.\" \"how to stay out of court.\" published in 1968. sold more than 100.000 copies. attracted mainstream media attention. and brought alternative dispute resolution to the attention of the country. the arbitration journal. published by the aaa. continues as a preemminent publication in its field. robert coulson is a graduate of yale university and harvard law school. he has received honorary doctorates from bryant college and hofstra university. he is married to cynthia cunningham coulson. has five children. and lives with his family in connecticut","mr. president. i rise today in support of the nih reauthorization bill. specifically as it addresses an underrpresented group here in the u.s. congress: women. two hundred years of a maledominated legislature has left its mark on women in many areas. particularly in that of medical research. traditionally. men have decided. and still do decide. what types of medical research get funded. and at what levels. men are in the majority in the congress. men are in the majority in medical research. this means the needs of women are overlooked. i am here to speak for those women currently suffering from femalespecific diseases. and for those who may have died from those diseases. if men suffered from illnesses such as interstitial cystitis. multiple sclerosis. lupus. and osteoporosis at the same rate women do. i would wager that much more research would be done on these illnesses. perhaps there would even be cures. i see this inequity as nothing less than medical sexism. last year. as a member of the senate appropriations committee. i worked to secure $50 million for breast cancer screening programs. more than $200 million for research on breast. cervical. and ovarian cancer at the national institutes of health. and $3 million for research on interstitial cystitisa painful. debilitating disease affecting 500.000 americans. of whom 90 percent are women. these appropriations. .and they have been increased under this years appropriations. were a significant step toward placing womens health on par with mens. today. we r.e fortunate to have the opportunity to go a step further. this bill provides permanent authority for an office of research on womens health within the office of the nih director. this office will ensure that nih complies with the congressional mandate of inclusion of women in clinical research and will coordinate among the institutes the various research projects involving women. for too long. women have been excluded from research projects due to arbitrary considerations. researchers believed that because women have a more complicated hormonal system. results of studies on women would be difficult to interpret and more costly to gather. therefore. women have been considered a special case. and men have been considered the norm. how can we consider a majority of the population as a special case? how can we refuse to test more than half our population because we say they are not the norm? this makes no sense. it is blatant medical sexism. the bill requires clinical research equity in every institute to ensure that women and minorities are included as subjects in each project. millions of women have read the study suggesting an aspirin a day may prevent heart disease. do they know the sample group was entirely male? in fact. we do not know whether an aspirin a day is harmful or beneficial to women with heart disease. it is patently unfair to assume that men and women do not differ in their response to aspirin or to ignore any difference as not technically significant. heart disease claims the greatest number of womens lives in this country. yet all major studies of causes and prevention has involved exclusively men. once again. women are left in the dark because of medical sexism. unfortunately. physicians have a poor understanding of the effects of aging on the development of disease in older women. onethird of women in america are postmenopausal and doctors are without the tools to treat the accompanying aging problems. this bill requires research on the aging process in women. especially on the effects of menopause and loss of ovarian hormones. further. $40 million is authorized for research of osteoporosis. a disease affecting onethird to onehalf of postmenopausal women. and resulting in 50.000 deaths annually. in addition to research on osteoporosis. the effort shall include a study of pagets disease and related bone disorders. information is the greatest necessity in womens health today. this bill establishes a clearinghouse and data bank to provide information on research and prevention activities in womens health. a registry is established to provide the sample pool and data for continuing research projects. despite our advances in technology. the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer each year has increased from 1 in 14 women. to 1 in 8. as reported yesterday. in my home state of nevada alone. it is estimated that 200 women this year will die from breast cancer. this is unacceptable. this bill authorizes $325 million for breast cancer research. prevention. education. and establishment of research centers. $75 million is further provided for research in gynecological cancers. we must continue to provide the assistance needed to investigate and combat these pervasive. deadly diseases. as i have said before. women have been underrepresented in positions that affect this nations health policy. health problems unique to women have received inadequate attention. i intend to change that trend. i urge your support for this important legislation. for the health of our wives. daughters. mothers. and all american women. i would like to address another section of this bill which provides for loan repayment for those professionals researching within the nih. after being in washington for almost 9 years. i made my first visit to the national institutes of health. these institutes are the worlds foremost biomedical research facilities. i had developed over the years a respect and appreciation for the work done by the institutes. but my personal tour closely showed how impressive and even exciting are these institutes. while visiting the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke [ninds]. the director. dr. murray goldstein. acquainted me with the evolution of a great discovery. researchers came to him for permission to follow a course of study involving the use of corticosteroids to prevent paralysis resulting from trauma to the spine. as in the case of a car accident. initially. results showed no reduction in paralysis when corticosteroids were administered. the steroids were administered again in larger doses. still no improvement. but. because the experiment had worked in cats. researchers at ninds were not ready to give up hope. they administered the substance in mass quantities and found that if given to a trauma victim within an hour of injury. degeneration of the spine could be halted. even more exciting. this treatment costs less than $100. less than $100 to save someone from paralysis. i could continue for hours about the seemingly miraculous medical discoveries made at nih. while all the institutes work on vastly different projects. i did encounter a recurring theme in every one i visited. because nih does not pay salaries comparable to those offered by private sector biomedical research facilities. the various institutes frequently have difficulty recruiting scientists. when one considers the amount of debt amassed by both medical doctors and ph.d.s during their training. it comes as no surprise that recently graduated scientists cannot accept lower paying jobs offered by this biomedical research center. currently. nih employs a very successful approach to attracting scientists to the facility to research in an area where shortages of researchers exist.-specifically the area of aids investigation and research.","mr. chairman. i rise to give strong support to this excellent legislation. it is needed in my district and going to be welcomed by many. many citizens. mr. chairman. i rise today to voice my strong support for h.r. 3566. the intermodal surface transportation act of 1991. not only does this legislation address the surface transportation dilemma confronting our nation. it also strives to provide for specific road projects in the many rural and urban areas throughout the united states. many of you are aware of the enormous amount of suffering the manufacturing areas incurred during the economic recession of the 1980s. even as we debate this bill today. the number of unemployed in this country continues to rise with no help in sight. for example. the 20th congressional district of pennsylvania. which i proudly represent. endured considerable job loss. but still remains poised for economic recovery if it can only receive the proper incentive. the intermodal surface transportation act can provide that incentive and give many pennsylvanians. and americans. a brighter future to look forward to. strategic transportation investments linking workers with job opportunities in western pennsylvania are critical to the recovery effort in the region. if not the entire nation. many of the demonstration projects contained in this bill focus on creating new roadways. expanding existing busways. and completing light rail rehabilitation projects in western pennsylvania. one project that is vital to both the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the state of west virginia is the monongahela valley expressway. this roadway is a 70mile. fourlane. limited access highway extending from u.s. 68. near morgantown. wv. to the pennlincoln highway near pittsburgh. once this project is completed. the mon valley expressway will be the first direct link between pittsburgh and morgantown. furthermore. the planned expressway will support muchneeded economic revitalization efforts in the mon valley communities between pittsburgh and morgantown. older industrial sites. rich industrial heritage. and abundant natural resources offer great promise for new activity in the region. with the completion of the mon valley expressway. the region can capitalize upon this potential by encouraging further development of naturalresources such as coal and petroleum. which are extremely vital to the areas economy. in addition. it is anticipated that the expressway will result in greater tourism to the region and will encourage new industry to relocate there. tourism. natural resource development. new industry in the monongahela valley combined with federal. local. and state financing for roadways and transportation will assist monesson. belle vernon. point marion. mckeesport. brownsville. duquesne. and countless other communities between morgantown and pittsburgh. given this valleys unique environmental structure. the mon valley expressway will serve as a catalyst to encourage economic growth in an area that has barely survived the reaganbush era in the white house. aside from the mon valley expressway. there are a number of other projects that will enhance the growth of the many western pennsylvania communities that have suffered economic downturns over the past number of years. the economic stimulus provided by the construction of the new greater pittsburgh international airport. scheduled to open in 1992. offers significant opportunities but the existing transportation network in and around the airport limits them. unless a significant investment is made to expand the transportation modes in the area. many potential workers will not be able to access the rising opportunities in the greater pittsburgh metropolitan area and western pennsylvania. many of my fellow colleagues may not know that allegheny county is the proud home of the worlds first truly exclusive busway--the south buswaywhich opened in 1977 between downtown pittsburgh and the countys south hills communities. in 1983. the martin luther king. jr. east busway opened between downtown pittsburgh and suburban wilkinsburg. the east busway serves over 30.000 riders each day. and has generated significant private investment and economic development. the proposed extension of the martin luther king. jr. east busway into my district. along with the proposed construction of the airport busway. will provide an important. much needed transportation link to my constituents and provide quick and extremely efficient service each day to many current and potential public transportation users. allocating appropriations on projects such as this is not a waste of money. it is a surefire method to help america grow and prosper. many members will voice their opposition to the demonstration projects and label them as \"porkbarrel spending projects\" or some other colorful phrase. but i. for one. will not oppose this legislation. this bill is indeed a true investment in america. we are making a promise to ourselves. our children. and our grandchildren that we will strive to improve the transportation infrastructure in this country and create more efficient. smoother highways. more efficient. timely busway systems. and devpiop alternative modes of transportation that can be utilized years from now. we. the members of the house of representatives. must take the lead on this issue and make sure private and public transportation will be better further on down the road. in closing. i urge all of my colleagues to support the intermodal surface transportation act so they can stand up and tell their constituents that they made an investment in the future infrastructure of america.","mr. president. i know the hour is late. i certainly express my thanks to all of our colleagues and to a great number of staff people. sometimes we fail to appreciate. particularly on my own staff. jim whittinghill. deputy staff director. who also spent i do not know how many hundreds of hours on this particular legislation. and barbara bankoff. who we consult with in the leaders office. had been an invaluable help in many. many areas. plus outstanding staff people from the department of energy. cea. epa. white house. justice and interior. the list of names are as follows: doe: linda stuntz. doug carter. ted williams. carmen difiglio. len coburn. mike delello. and dean burridge. cea\" dick smallensee and howard gruenspecht. epa: bill reilly. bill rosenberg. jim strock. rob. brenner. kate pay. jeanette wiltse. tom kiernan. john beale. nancy kete. jill g.ant. keith mason. alan eckert. 1f.ch oaas. charlie carter. howard hoffman. michael winer. kevin mclean. mike alushin. dick wilson. stan meiburg. bill harnett. and brian mclean. white house: roger porter. bob grady. boyden gray. rob fairweather. john schmitz. david rifkin. david sloane. and teresa gorman. justice: mark haag. jennifer haverkamp. and ann shields. interior: david oneal. barry williamson. and alby modiano. in each and every case they were directly involved and deeply involved on a daily and hourly basis and i do not know how many total hours were consumed in the majority leaders office april j. 1990 because i was not there all the time. but some of them were. and it must have been hundreds of hours plus weekends. plus half the night. so i think in each case it is another demonstration of the dedication that our public. not just public officials. but that our civil servants have in the job they do. and many times it goes unnoticed and many times they are criticized. being part of the bureaucracy. i can say in this instance i do not know of any of those that i know personally that did not give every minute of their time and every ounce of their effort. so we made history today. we passed the clean air bill. we have laid down a marker for future generations. it is a bill that dwarfs previous attempts. and i was on that committee at the time senator muskie was leading the efforts on the environment and i agree with the commenting earlier made by the majority leader that senator muskie certainly should be recognized a sort of the pioneer and sort of led the way in cleaning up the environment. and i was honored to be on that committee and had some opportunity to work with senator muskie at that time. i would simply say that we have not done enough. it is not tough enough. and let us keep in mind we are not finished yet. this is one step. we have a house bill that is in the process. we have a conference where we will have differences between the house and senate. between the congress and the administration. and between different groups who have a right to speak up during the conference. it is called interest groups. not particularly special interest groups. but they may be environmental. it may be the private sector. and all of these voices must be heard and it must be reconciled before a bill finally comes back to us for final action. so i would say that those who wanted rhetoric. well. they had their rhetoric. but those who wanted results. we had the results tonight. broad bipartisan support. precisely what we set out to do when it started. there really were no partisan differences. once we agreed that certain amendments would in effect be deal breakers. then it became i think the responsibility of many of us to make certain that that did not happen. so i would say. as i have said before. that certainly the distinguished majority leader deserves special credit and special congratulations because. notwithstanding the fact we were able to work together. first. he understood the bill and. second. he had the re\" sponsibility as the majority leader to get it done. i did not have that responsibility. i wanted to help. but if it did not happen. i could say. \"well. i cannot help it. i do not have enough votes.\" so i certainly commend the majority leader and the president of the united states and my colleagues. senator baucus. senator chafee. senator durenberger. and others. mr. president. the senate has just made history. with the passage of the clean air bill. we have lain down a marker that future generations will look back upon and say. thank you. this is the day we turned the corner. this is the day we started to win the fight for cleaner air and a healthier america. for more than a decade. concerned americans have been demanding action. today we have delivered. from ground zero. we have crafted landmark legislation that dwarfs any previous attempt to clean up the air we breathe: its massive in scope. complex. comprehensive. and costly. but the bottom line says. it was worth it. some special interests say we havent done enough. the bill isnt tough enough. compared to what? compared to current law. this act looks like the declaration of independence. the senator wanted a bill. the majority leader wanted a bill. the president of the united states wanted a bill. and so did the american people. together.we got the job done. for those who wanted rhetoric over results. i say you can breathe easierthanks to the leadership of george bush and george mitchell. mr. president. not since 197713 years agohas the congress passed a reauthorization of the clean air act. due to our failure to act. more than 50 percent of the population of the united states now lives in areas which are out of compliance with the national ambient air quality standards set by the federal government. during these 13 years. the clean air act has almost become the second civil war. pitting state against state. alcohol fuels against hydrocarbon fuels. hard coal against soft coal. and unions and business owners against professional environmentalists. into this fray came a true environmental herogeorge bush. the president was willing to put his enormous popularity at risk to achieve dramatically significant advancements in the cleanliness of the air we all breath. without question. we would not be at this point today without the leadership of our president. without the environmental commitment he made to the american people during the presidential campaign. and without his forceful action to ensure those promises were met by the congress of the united states. in joining my colleague. the distinguished majority leader. in sponsoring the substitute before us today. i intended to address critics of the legislationwhether against it for being too weak. or too strongwith the fact that we have achieved a good. tough. yet responsible stewardship of the quality of our nations air. this has been a difficult bill for the senate to consider. there were no magic wands for us to wave. we had to sit down. roll up our sleeves. and sift through stack after stack of studies. recommendations. and. at times. pure speculation. but after days and weeks and months of dedicated and determined work. we ended up with a good. solid package. i dont think we have rushed a bill through. as a matter of fact. the senate consumed 21 days on this bill. no issue that i am aware of escaped intense scrutiny. some critics charge that we should have adopted two amendmentsone which would have imposed what are called federal implementation plans and a second which would have imposed unprecedented new costs and other requirements on fuel and automobiles. as i said in earlier statements. although federal implementation plans may sound like a reasonable. gettough. policy. they will not work. we simply dont have the federal personnel to test the tailpipe of every car. to visit every factory. dry cleaner. baker and gasoline pump. this would have resulted in a total breakdown in any area with a federal implementation plan and would have resulted in worsenot betterair quality. the second amendment. although very well intentioned. just went too far. there are areas in the country which may need to require ultraclean vehicles and ultraclean fuels. los angeles. for example. has such severe air pollution problems that some fuels we havent even considered will be necessary to bring that area into attainment. but we dont need this approach everywhere. that is the reason i joined with the junior senator from south dakota and a number of other colleagues in proposing an amendment to require reformulated gasolinereformulated gasoline with fewer toxics and more oxygento be used in all vehicles in the most polluted cities. in the first year alone. this one amendment will require the use of 18 billion gallons of cleaner fuel than was originally proposed in the substitute. this is a major. achievable. and yet responsible. amendment. we have debated jobs on the floor. let me state very clearly once againthis bill will cost thousands of jobs and affect thousands of others. the majority of these jobs wont be from identifiable plant closings. rather. it will come from a decision to invest in pollution control rather than keeping 100 percent current employees. it will come from complying with the act as opposed to giving raises. health benefits. parental leave. or the long list of other initiatives some of my colleagues continue to demand. but. the bill has strong. defensible benefits. health costs will reduced. air will be tangibly cleaner. and we will be able to hand to our children a country for less polluted than it was on the day that they were born. this has not been an easy struggle. regional. as opposed to partisan. differences has to be put aside for the benefit of the union. long days and nights had to be invested. and every senator had to delve into the minutiae. many of my republican colleagues spent what to some senators would seem to be careers on this bill. including those on the committee on environment and public workssenators chafee. simpson. symms. durenberger. warner. jeffords. and humphrey. other gave untold hours in addition to their other duties. finally. i would like to congratulate two senators on the other side of the aisle. first. the distinguished chairman of the appropriations committee. and president pro tempore. robert c. byim of west virginia. the residents of that state got even more than they could have imagined when they sent him to washington. and he has represented them with dignity and tenacity. the majority leader. george mitcheli.. deserves great credit for the success of this bill. he has been subjected to unfair criticism and chronic complaining. yet he has proceeded fairly and patiently. keeping his sight on our goal of a cleaner healthier america. i congratulate him on this success. and look forward to our service together across this sometimes wide. sometimes very narrow center aisle of the senate.","mr. speaker. tomorrow i intend to introduce a resolution which will put the house of representatives on record in support of actions to eliminate preventable deaths and disabling illness. especially among the worlds children. the resolution embodies proposals that i have been working on for a number of months. numerous individuals in the private voluntary sector. international organizations and government agencies have contributed to this effort and their assistance is greatly appredated. this member will be introducing the resolution in conjunction with the commemoration of world health day on april 7. on thursday. april s. the select committee on hunger will hold a hearing to consider efforts to improve the health of the worlds people. that occasion will be used to speak more directly on the provisions and purposes of the resolution. in advance of that hearing to facilitate reaction to ti proposal. i roqest permission to have the text of the resolution reprinted in the ]. rrs. whereas the \"child survival and development revolution\". launched by the united f remarks april 4. 1989 nations childrens fund (unicef) in 1982. to reduce by onehalf by the end of this century the then daily toll of 45.000 deaths of young children as a consequence of preventable disease and malnutrition. has achieved impressive results. despite the extreme economic and developmental difficulties afflicting most developing countries in the 1980s. whereas the adoption by the congress of a joint resolution in 1983 (public law 98198) was the first act by a national legislature to formally endorse the child survival and development revolution. whereas the low cost. highimpact health and nutrition interventions which form the core of child survival programs. most notably oral rehydration therapy and immunization. are already by 1989 saving the lives of over 2.500.000 children per year who have died if the death rates of 1982 still prevailed. whereas unicef. the world health organization (who). developing country governments. the world bank. and other multilateral and bilateral development assistance agencies (including the agency for international development in the united states) have identified additional lowcost opportunities for dramatically improving the survival. health. and development of the worlds children. which could. with increased international coordination. political commitment. and institutional innovations increase the number of children saved to over 5.000.000 within 2 years and to over 10.000.000 annually on a permanent and sustainable basis by the year 2000. whereas fewer than 5 percent of children in the developing world were immunized against the 6 major childhood diseases when the united nations goal of \"universal child immunization of 1990\" was initiated in 1977. now more than 50 percent of children worldwide are immunized and the universal child immunization target of at least 80 percent immunization by 1990 is within reach for a majority of developing countries. whereas it is recognized that the child survival and development revolution requires integrated action to provide (1) nutrition. (2) primary health care. (3) environmental sanitation. water. and basic shelter. and (4) basic education. especially for women and girls. and that many governments. including the united states government. have endorsed the attainment of these goals by the year 2000 as part of the who program of \"health for all\". whereas child survival and development programs are being advanced collaboratively by a \"grand alliance for children\" comprised of a vast array of critically important nongovernmental organizations. including voluntary associations. private businesses. .e media. religious groups. and other entities. in addition to governments. intergovernmental agencies. and international organizations. whereas the emerging global concern for children. reflecting a new international political commitment to future generations. has been evidenced at the highest levels of international discourse. a reflected in the joint statement issued june 2. 1988. following the summit meeting in moscow between the united states and the soviet union. in which president reagan and general secretary gorbachev reaffirmed their support \"for the who/unicef goal of reducing the scale of preventable childhood death\" and urged other countries and the international community to \"intensify efforts to achieve the goal\". whereas the general surge in concern for childrens welfare has formed the moral. legal. and political basis for the internatlon. april 4. 1989 congr al convention on the rights of the child. which would define the rights of children with regard to survival. protection. and development. and which is expected to be approved by the united nations general assembly in 1989: whereas secretary of state james baker has indicated that \"the united states should take a leadership role\" in the initiative to \"develop a plan to get to the core of the poverty problem\" in order to achieve a healthy world by the year 2000. whereas the united states has consistently led the world in the provision of financial. operation. research. and advocacy support for child survival initiatives. and whereas the executive director of unicef. with the current endorsement of over a score of national leaders from developed and developing countries. east and west. has proposed a \"world summit on children\" to promote international plans for achieving the goals of child survival. health. and development of all children: now. therefore. be it resolved. that(1) it is the sense of the house of representatives that the child survival and development programs implemented collaboratively by national governments. unicef. who. the agency for international development. and many other governmental and nongovernmental organizations are to be commended and have the full support and encouragement of the house of representatives. (2) the house of representatives reaffirms its commitment to the goal of permanent improvement in the survival rates. health. and development of people in all countries by the year 2000. especially children. and urges the president to adopt this as a major priority of the executive branch and to lead the world community in proposing concrete actions to achieve this goal. (3) the president is urged. on behalf of the people and government of the united states. to propose to the secretary general of the united nations that he establish an independent advisory commission to provide strategic planning. leadership and advice to the world community on collaborative actions and programs in primary health care. nutrition. basic education. and environment by all members of the grand alliance for children in order to eliminate easily preventable death and disabling illness in all countries by the year 2000. and (4) the house of representatives endorses the call for a world summit on children at the earliest opportunity as an opportunity for governmental leaders. including the president of the united states. to commit their countries to concrete plans of national action and international cooperation to reduce the scale of preventable childhood deaths nationally and globally and. in particular. to attain the goals of universal childhood immunization by 1990 and health for all by the year 2000.","mr. speaker. when i first came to congress 3 years ago. defense issues were neither my specialty nor my chief area of interest. i knew simply that the united states and its democratic allies exist in a dangerous world and that it was my duty as a national legislator to support whatever funds and policies are necessary to defend us from foreign aggression. this. i imagined. would be a fairly straightforward task. unfortunately. i was immediately shocked and appalled to discover the extent to which certain defense decisions have little to do with a cool and dispassionate appraisal of the present threat and future contingencies. but are instead heavily influenced by politicsthe politics of the pork barrel. in americas more innocent days. \"pork barrel spending\" referred to the roads. dams and power stations that senators and congressmen maneuvered to have built in their home districts. with the coming of the cold war and the rise of the permanent defense establishment. that has changed. another main source of pork barrel spending now. im sad to say. lies in budget function 050: the national defense. there is no question that we need large armed forces to meet the soviet threat. and i yield to no one in my support for a strong defense. but as a conservative and a taxpayer. i cant help but conclude that the political use of military spending is a troublesome problem. much of this. of course. is an inescapable part of democratic governance. federal officials. whether relected or appointed. can no more ignore the political implications of their defense decisions than they can cease to be human beings. politics is the nature of the beast. i am aware of at least one area. however. in which we can and must introduce some needed reform: we must eliminate obsolete military bases which serve no purpose except to advance the parochial interests of individual members of congress. we must eliminate pork barrel bases. when it comes to making economies in our base structure. we run into two maddening political problems. the first one we are all familiar with. if a member of congress has a base in his district. he doesnt want it to be moved or closed down. military bases provide jobs to many civilians and the paychecks of their personnel help support local economies. this means that if a base becomes redundant or obsolete. a member will fight to keep it open as if his political life depends on it. if that were the only problem. however. we wouldnt have a problem. parochial interests are something we deal with all the time. and they can easily be overridden by a simple majority vote. when a member offers a floor amendment to the defense bill to bring a new defense contract into his district. for instance. we debate it on its objective merits. if he can justify his case in the larger national interest. he gets the contract. if not. he can write home and explain that at least he tried. what makes base closings so difficult. however. is that whenever the defense department recommends bases to be closed or consolidated. there is almost invariably a suspicion that the particular bases were selected for political reasons. members charge that the bases were chosen in order to punish congressmen who do not support the president on crucial issues. sadly. this charge has frequently been quite legitimate. when the executive branch was lobbying for the b1 bomber. for instance. some officials pointedly implied that air force bases might be shut down in the districts of members who continue to oppose it. then. when jimmy carter canceled the bomber in 1977. his aides did exactly the same thing. they were dispatched to the hill to tell members that they could lose their military bases if they refused to support the decision to cancel the b1. hardball politics of this kind has been practiced by republican and democratic administrations alike. this possibilitythat base closings can be used as a political weaponmeans that congress as a whole has an institutional interest in ensuring that the executive branch cannot shut down major basesand that is precisely what congress has done. in 1977. congress passed a law which has made it virtually impossible for the defense department to close down any major base. known as the oneillcohen amendment. it requires dod to carry out complex and timeconsuming environmental impact statements before a base can be shut down. that may sound benign on the surface. but italong with the original environmental statute itselfhas prevented any major base closing since it was passed. what typically happens is this: dod announces it wants to close a base and proceeds to complete the environmental study. the opponents of the base closure then challenge the study in court. and dod is forced to do it again. if the second study is found wanting. a third can be ordered. in this way. the closure can be delayed indefinitely. wherever oneillcohen applies. a single member or even a citizens group can stop a base closing simply by tying the matter up in court. now ask yourself: why should closing a base require an environmental study? opening a base. certainly. but if you close a basetake down the powerplant. move the weapons. transfer the troops. shut down the airfieldthat can only be a boon to the natural environment. so why does this requirement exist? it was enacted in a deliberate effort to stop base closings and remove the possibility that they will become instruments of political retaliation against members the administration does not like. and so we have a challenge: we must waive the statutes that prevent the defense department from closing bases. but we must first ensure that no bases will be closed for arbitrary or political reasons. to do this. i propose that we establish a nonpartisan commission to select bases which can be closed without hurting the national defense. and provide that the statutes will be waived for those bases only. april 13.1.988 now theres a certain logical symmetry to this arrangement. because the statutes were enacted to prevent politically motivated base closures. and because the nonpartisan commission i propose will already have allayed that concern. the statutes will no longer be necessary for the bases the commission recommends. they will remain in force. however. for every other property in the pentagons inventory. this is the only way out of the base closing deadlock that i can see. if we were to simply waive the protective statutes that make it difficult for dod to close bases. the pentagon would be able to close any base it wanted for virtually any reason. that would leave congress highly vulnerable to administration intimidation. on the other hand. if we were to leave the protective laws in place and only establish a commission to study the issue. the defense department would be powerless to close any base that the commission recommends. establishing a commission. the recommendations of which trigger selective waivers of the protective statutes. insures both that the process will be nonpartisan and that dod will be able to actually realize savings in the base structure. i first introduced this idea in march 1987. today. h.r. 1583 has nearly 120 cosponsors from both parties. the new york times. business week. and dozens of smaller publications have editorialized in its favor. last year. i offered it in the form of an amendment to the defense authorization. and it failed by a slim margin of seven votes. a key reason for its failure was that the defense department opposed it. but dod now supports the concept. and i have every reason to believe that similar language will pass this year. mr. speaker. if we can solve the base closing deadlock. we can potentially save as much as $2 billion annually. not only would this reduce the deficit. but it would make our defense establishment more efficient. i believe that now is the time to take some of the politics out of defense and work together to eliminate waste in government. mr. speaker. i want to talk for a moment about my proposal. and as i say. 120 members of congress have cosponsored my baseclosing proposal. due to the broad. sweeping editorial support that we have received from across the nation and the broad support from our own membership. the defense committees subcommittee on military construction under the leadership of mr. dzulums has held hearings on my bill. naturally. as would be the case and as is often the case. no bill is in its perfect form at the time it is introduced. i am very pleased to tell you that the committee along with the senate committee and the department of defense have taken this basic concept of the baseclosing commission. nonpartisan in nature. coupled with the selective waiver for chosen bases. and have expanded and improved on the bill. i would hope that it will be introduced by the committee as an amendment to their defense authorization bill. i would like to point out to those 120 members of you that have from this body cosponsored that bill. please study the product when it comes through the committee process. it has not broken with the essential spirit of the nonpartisan baseclosing commission that we have all signed up on. it has been improved. it has dealt with some very difficult details. there has been good work from all parties concerned and obviously an issue of concern for the members of this body has been who selects the commission and what are the procedures by whch the commission will operate. i think if you study the product when it comes to the floor with the defense authorization bill. as i have been growing more and more confident it will. that you will find that it is only improved over the product that you have cosponsored. and even more deserves your support for the fine detailed work that has gone into it.","mr. speaker. i want to thank my good friend and colleague. mr. bruce. for giving me this opportunity to speak out in favor of the superconducting super collider. as my colleagues are aware. california has been chosen as one of five potential sites for this project. my discussion today will not be focused upon the merits of california as a potential site. but instead will help to bring to light many of the fascinating and productive uses of the ssg. the california journal recently did an exhaustive investigative report on the ssc program and declared that the ssc could be. \"the ultimate payoff: undreamed of knowledge of the behavior of the tiniest subatomic particles and laboratory replicas of the basic forces that created the universea new window on nature in its smallest and largest forms.\" this window to the world can only be realized through the strong support of this administration and both houses of congress. the evolution of the ssc project dates back to the early 1980s and various studies conducted by the american physical societys division of particles and fields. this workshop. and all subsequent workshops in the spring of 1983. concluded that there are no scientific obstacles to the construction of a collider system. after the awarding of a nobel prize in physics for work in this area. the ssc project became a viable concept for the united states to pursue. in 1984 funds were allocated by the department of energywith congressional approvalto accelerate research and development of the project. after approximately 2 years. in which to assess demographic. environmental. and economic impacts of this project the reagan administration has chosen to include this project on their list of viable scientific projects to support. the department of energy recently released a report indicating a need for approximately $4.3 billion to complete the project. while $4.3 billion may seem like a large sum of money for a project which has only futuristic implications. the funding requirements for this project will be spread over a 10year period. thereby minimizing the effect upon current budgetary constraints. when looking at the technological and scientific advantages of this system. one cannot overstate the obvious impacts. both international and domestic markets could benefit from the construction of this project. in addition. the scientific expertise and technology that will spill over into the surrounding communities from the ssc facility will be tremendous. this system could be a major hightechnology boost to any state that secures it. the economic advantages? no scientific center in the world will be able to match the economic contributions that the ssc will make to the community in which it is located. short term economic impact studies indicate that over 3.000 jobs will be created through the implementation of the program. this would result in a boost to all aspects of consumer spending. some have complained of unwarranted burdens to education. transportation. and the communitys ecological systems. however. the opponents to the system fail to realize that all of these areas have been thoroughly investigated with a netgain in productivity and environmental stability overall. any state. whether it be california or illinois is not about to put any of its citizens at risk over this project. safety is no. 1 consideration. i think many of my colleagues will agree with me when i say this is not just a program for today. but a project for the future. we. as a country may be facing economic difficulties. but the superconducting super collider is the first step toward economic and scientific prosperity. as the philosopher bertrand russell once worte. \"we know very little. and yet it is astonishing that we know so much. and still more astonishing that so little knowledge can give us so much power.\" that power is in our quest to further our technological studies. the ssc is the gateway to a more prosperous and productive tomorrow. i urge strong support from all my colleagues.","have labored and labored at length to bring this legislation for us. the bill before us today is. as best we can. a compromise. a compromise between the various communities. the environmentalists. the pesticide producers. and the agricultural community. none of them are completely happy. all of them understand this is perhaps the best that we can get. i want to address my remarks at the absolute need of this congress to continue and complete this effort in this session of the congress. by virtue of that. i am very concerned that if we do not make a couple of changes in the legislation between here and the end. we do run the risk of a presidential veto. the statement of administration policy which has been circulated on this bill very clearly indicates that the administration opposes enactment unless various amendments are made. the most important being to eliminate the acceleration of unnecessarily costly changes to the reregistration program or increase the fee authorization to cover those costs. let me spend a bit of time on this issue which i have brought up to my colleagues on the subcommittee and the full committee as we have been through that process. presently. the estimated reregistration cost in the legislation is some $206 million. the current budget projections over a 9year period are $110 million.- suggesting that we need an additional revenue of $96 million. under the legislation before us. there is a fee recovery program that in terms of food use will bring in approximately $21.9 million in nonregistration standards and approximately $11.4 million for those active ingredients which have already achieved a registration standard. in the nonfood area. we will bring in approximately $7.9 million in the nonregistration standards. and approximately $1.12 million in the registration standards. this brings in $42 million leaving us still with a revenue gap of approximately $56 million. the question that each and every one of us has to ask is: are we willing. at a time of deficit reduction. to increase overall expenditures or gpr revenues to this kind of a program? i would suggest that it is going to be very difficult for most of us to vote to increase revenue expenditures in this area or outlay areas in this area. at the expense of our manyfavored social. educational. training. retraining. health care programs and of that sort. as a result. mr. chairman. i will be introducing an amendment tomorrow during the full consideration in the amendment process which will allow us to look at two alternatives. one alternative will recover about $6 million. that being to cover and make sure those who have already achieved their reregistration standard pay the same costs as all of those yet awaiting that same opportunity for reregistration. the second alternative that i will present before this congress will be a simple doubling of the revenue. this is what would be necessary to fully fund this legislation. we have gone too far. we have been through too much controversy to lose this bill to a veto because it is not properly funded. i want to make this issue very clear to my colleagues. you are going to have to choose between properly funding this legislation or cutting some other program later on. pay attention during the amendment process. mr. chairman. it gives me great pleasure to come before you today and speak in support of h.r. 2482. the federal fungicide. insecticide. and rodenticide act amendments of 1986. the subcommittee chairman. mr. bedell. and the ranking minority member. mr. roberts. should be commended for their outstanding work in bringing a well developed. comprehensive piece of legislation to the floor of the house. since i came to congress 6 years ago. the house has- had the opportunity to make signficant and needed changes in the federal insecticide. fungicide. and rlodenticide act. but for various reasons the needed changes never came about. today. the house has another opportunity to pass a piece of legislation that will benefit everyone involved from those who produce the pesticides to you and me who are exposed to them. .what is it that makes this bill different from those previously brought to the floor of the house? for the first time the national agricultural chemical association. the environmental groups. consumer groups and labor groups came before the house agriculture committee with a single bill. the bill. which was a result of the groups finally working together. was the starting point for the department operations. research and foreign agriculture subcommittee. i am proud to say that the agriculture committee did outstanding work to keep the package together but at the same time offered and passed amendments that make the bill stronger in many respects.","mr. president. i am today introducing a joint resolution to designate the first week of october 1985 as \"national buy american week.\" senators sassr. laxalt. and stennis join me in cosponsoring this joint resolution. our country today faces an unprecedented foreign challenge. that challenge doesnt come from foreign planes or troops or missiles. no. mr. president. we are under assault today by billions of dollars worth of imported products that have in recent years literally flooded the american market. and tragically. that allout assault has disrupted industries. taken away millions of jobs. and caused pain and suffering for people in every part of the country. as recently as 15 years ago. madeinamerica products dominated u.s. and world markets. in 1970. only 11 percent of the goods purchased by americans bore foreign lables. today. the percentage of imports purchased here has tripled. in 1970. we had a trade surplus of $2.6 billion. today. we are quickly approaching an unheard of trade deficit of $150 billion. the flood of foreign importsand our inability to sell sufficient goods overseasthreatens the very structure of our economy. this year alone. the mammoth trade deficit will reduce our gross national product by 2 percentage points and will result in the loss of as many as 3.75 million jobs. make no mistake. mr. president. this disastrous trade imbalance is not the result of a decline in the quality of american goods or a lack of faith in the skills of american workers. rather. it is tied directly to massive budget deficits. high interest rates. an overvalued dollar and the continued unfair trade practices of foreign governments. i do not believe. mr. president. that we can turn this situation around by the simple expedient of proclaiming a \"buy american week.\" i wish we could. but one thing that this proclamation can accomplish is to remind the consumers of this country that every american has an interest in helping to create the prosperity that comes from a healthy and productive economy. and perhaps. mr. president. this reminder will help americans realize that the time has come to think of \"we\" instead of \"me.\" i ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed ir the record.","mr. speaker. the national association of manufacturers (nam) in a recent newsletter article (february 22. 1984) described h.r. 4124. the \"comprehensive trade law reform act of 1983.\" as \"the most complete and authoritative statement of the views of a large industrycongressional faction that is seriously discontent with the existing trade laws and that is working to get them changed this year.\" the articles premise is that h.r. 4124 is currently framing the debate on trade. this is certainly the case. as well it should be. h.r. 4124 was born out of the experiences of numerous industries with the workings of our trade remedy laws. what these industries have found is often frustrating: a complex set of laws made up of roadblocks. rather than pathways. to their efforts to gain relief under our trade laws. what these industries have found are laws arbitrarily administered. thereby creating uncertainty as to their outcome. trade remedy procedures which are so expensive and coinplex as to put them out of the reach of small firms and industries. an ineffective \"escape clause\" procedure which. to date. has yielded import relief in less than 25 percent of the cases brought under its provisions. and which employs a standard of injury higher than that required under our code of international trade. the gatt. and a toothless section 301. which is supposed to help counter the unfair trading practices of foreign governments. but has not because it has been ineffectively utilized. while the united states continues to play the \"good guy\" in international trade. other countries continue to increase their share of our market with record imports as evidenced by the $9.5 billion merchandise trade deficit registered in january alone. if the monthly deficits stay at this level. the yearend trade deficit will certainly top the administrations current forecast of $110 billion for 1984. and shocking as it may seem. despite the u.s.-e.c. arrangement. carbon steel imports doubled in january 1984 over the same month last year. despite the multifiber arrangement. textile and apparel imports rose 25 percent in 1983 and 30 percent in january 1984 over the levels of a year earlier. while some of this can certainly be attributed to an overvalued dollar. that is not the whole story. these are real imports. and they are destroying real american jobsevery $1 billion increase in the trade deficit translates into a lose of 25.000 jobsand a great many of these imports are unfairly traded. our laws have not been terribly effective in reaching such unfair trade practices. where surges of such imports have been injurious to u.s. workers and industries. the record of import relief has been dismal. u.s. firms and workers have a right to expect effective remedies under our trade lawsit is simply the only way to maintain public support for an open system of trade. inadequate trade laws and inadequate trade law administration will virtually guarantee a collapse of such public support for our current trade system. when it is understood that we are the only ones playing by the rules and there is little in the way of relief from unfairly traded or injurious imports. how can we expect support for an open trade system. particularly when imports are coming in at record levels? that is why h.r. 4124 is such an important peice of legislation. it truly does frame debate on trade because it is the only comprehensive approach to trade remedy law reform out there. and because it is supported by a wide diversity of industriessteel. footwear. textiles. apparel. metalworking. color television. and mushroom growers. to name a few. (the industries supporting h.r. 4124 account for an estimated $250-$300 billion in annual sales. are located in every state. and employ over 41/ million workers.) its provisions would assist not only these industries in addressing relief measures under our trade laws. but also the socalled hitech industries. which are being unfairly \"targeted\" by foreign governments. as an original cosponsor of this legislationthere are now 46 in the housei urge my colleagues to support this measure. and thus give rise to the opportunity to take a comprehensive look at our trade remedy laws and provide the thorough overhaul which they sorely need. i ask permission to have the nam article included in the record. following my remarks: (from trade &amp; industry. feb. 22. 19841","mr. president. it can be saidof few senators that their passing left a void that could not be filled. but it isno exaggeration to make that statement abbut my friend scoop jackson. he was just not another senator. hie was primus inter pares. first among equals in tme senate. how do you measure the loss of one man? consider what would not have happened without scoop jackson ill the senate. how much longer would the witchhunting days of joe mccarthy have gone on without scoop jacksons role in the armymccarthy hearings? how many more years would it have taken to achieve passage of the national environmental policy act of 1969? would we have an environmental protection agency today? measured in human terms. there are hundreds of thousands of former soviet jews now residing around the world thanks to the efforts of senator jackson and his 1974 jacksonvanlk amendment to the trade bill. the indian education act. the alaskan native claims act. the north cascades and redwood park bills. all were products of his commitment to public service. these achievements aside. we can only speculate about what future events would have been changed because of the prestige and wisdom scoop brought to the senate. perhaps that is our greatest lossnot having him here when we face the next international crisis. the next domestic problem areathat is when we will really miss him. the nation has too few individuals of scoop jacksons integrity and leadership that we can afford their loss. too few. and new replacements are not born every year or every decade. that rare combination of good sense. legislative brilliance. and personal commitment is not found in normal circumstances. in the 26 years i have served in the senate i know of no senator whom i respected more than scoop jackson. no one could disagree more vigorously or effectively than scoop without being disagreeable. i know that from longstanding personal experience. for 15 years i waged battle with scoop over the supersonic transport plane which he championed and i strongly opposed. yet not once did i ever find that his commitment to the sst ever influenced our personal working relationship. while we may have disagreed on issues such as the funding for certain military weapons. scoop was always fair. friendly. and straightforward. and when he was on your side you knew you had an ally as strong and influential as could be found. we all wanted scoop on our side in a fight. it is impossible to say. how history will *treat any man or woman. but i suspect that there is more than a little room in the history books for henry jackson. a generation of democrats call themselves jackson democrats patterned after his staunch commitment to our national defense and his equally strong vision of human rights. environmental protecction. energy. labor. and consumer affairs. he had a distinct view of the world based onl the belief that democracy must be defended vigilantly at homne and abroad. that is why he was the champion of civil rights causes..of the labor moveinent. of the consumer and the environment. that is why he fought so tirelessly for preserving thle rights of individuals against more powerful economic interests. and perhaps that is why hie felt so strongly about preserving the power and influence of thle united states abroadto guarantee that thle average citizen here in thle united states would continue to have the basic freedoms so often found wanting in other countries. his was a constant commitment to thle basic values of our society. thle tenants of democracy. thle protection of haw. rights of the individual. and the oldfashioned american sense of fair play. all americans and those of us in tile senate could pay no higher tribute to scoop jackson than to adhere to his . concept of how democracy works.","mr. speaker. we tave all watched with outrage and sadness as our secretary of the interior continues his crusade against our environmental and natural resources. the most recent milestone in this campaign is the secretarys proposal to revise our wilderness preservation laws. this proposal is a remarkable reversal of decades of national policy. i am confident that congress will see through this sham. and understand the threat to our resources that it contains. to assist in these deliberations. i would like to share with my colleagues an editorial from the santa clara news of february 24. 1982. this editorial points out the fundamental problems with the proposal. the editorial follow: watr no fmrnd of wilderness whats this? james watt coming out against. development in wilderness areas? you mean james 0. watt. president reagans secretary of the interior. scourge of environmentalists. champion of oil companies. patron saint of strip mines? yep. same guyand on nationwide tv. too. when the environmentalists heard watt on nbcs \"meet the press\" show sunday. you could have knocked them over with a limp alfalfa sprout. here was the archcritic of conservationism. the bete noire of the backpackers. saying that he will ask congress to forbid all drilling and mining in 80 million acres of wilderness at least until the end of this century. \"we think these lands are special lands and should be preserved in the natural state.\" watt piously intoned. after the shock came elation. \"we congratulate the administration.\" gushed william a. turnage. executive director of the wilderness society. \"this is a victory for the american people and for wilderness preservation.\" but as the euphoria faded it became clear that jim watt. friend of the wilderness is not quite as affable a fellow as he might wish to appear. and his proposal is not by a long chalk the total victory that conservationists at first made it out to be. true. watt wants to amend the 1984 wilderness act to protect the nations designated wilderness areas from development at least until the year 2000. except in the event of a national emergency declared by the president and congress. but theres a catch. the catch is that congress would adopt deadlines for deciding the final status of some 30 million additional acres currently under study for possible wilderness designation. this would mean that about 7 million acres of proposed national forest wilderness areas could be opened up at the end of two years. and another 24 million acres now protected and under study. including a lot of california desert land. could be opened by the end of 1988. by tuesday -morning. conservationists were damning the watt wilderness plan as fervently as they had praised it on sunday. \"unquestionably a bad deal.\" said john mccomb. washington director of the sierra e 1490 club. \"a cynical sham.\" said bern shanks of the california resources agency. and turnage of the wilderness society. reversing his field with a deftness that would do credit to an nfl punt return specialist. branded.watts plan \"an act of infamy.\" mccomb points out that under present law all the designated wilderness areas would be locked away from developmentpresumably forever. not just until 2000as of jan. 1. 1984. at most. watts proposal would protect these lands a year or so sooner. on the other hand. the deadline fea. ture would \"put a loaded gun to the head of congress\" and the conservationists. since lands under study would automatically be opened if congress missed the deadlines. mccomb observes. the developers would merely have to get congress to stall a littleand when it comes to stalling. congress wrote the book. the sierra club doesnt want any deadlines for deciding the fate of potenti.l wil* derness areas. we think the deadline idea has some merit. it doesnt seem fair for the conservationists to lock up areas forever by delaying congressional action. but we dont see any need for slapping on a twoyear or sixyear deadline right now. domestic and world petroleum inventories are at record levels. after declining for 10 straight years. domestic crude oil production finally started to rise last year. accord. ing to the american petroleum institute. oil companies broke records for the number of new wells sunk in the united states in 1980 and 1981. and probably will break another in 1982. some analysts say the oil drilling boom has stretched the supply of materials and labor so thin that the energy companies cant even develop their existing leases fast enough: the oil industry disputes that. in any case. there obviously isnt an urgent need to open up the wilderness to oil and gas development right away. and. as the sierra clubs mccomb observes. we can always drill if we have to. but the destruction of wilderness is irreversible. wed advise congress to go over secretary watts wilderness proposal with a sharp and wary eye. as for the conservationists. theyd be wise not to welcome watt into the fold just yet. the secretary may be singing the hymns. but that doesnt prove hes got religion.e","mr. speaker. today congressman william brodhead and i are releasing a report entitled \"a critique of the autombile industry in the united states: a report by the congressional auto task force.\" the report examines the auto industry over the last 10 years and in particular the events which led up to the near collapse of the industry in 1979 and 1980. the following is a summary of that report. summary during the last two years. the u.s. automobile industry has suffered one of its worst periods ever. this slump is obviously more than a cyclical downturn in automobile and truck sales which can be expected to occur periodically. twentyone hundred domestic car dealerships and 140 domestic supplier plants have gone out of business. sales of u.s.-made cars and light trucks are at a 20year low. unemployment within the indystry is near 200.000. although some of this unemployment will be temporary. tens of thousands of jobs have been lost permanently. imports. particularly from japan. have increased substantially and now account for over one out of every four cars sold in the u.s. the market penetration of imports has risen 10% in just two years (from 17.6% in 1978 to 27.3% in 1980). further. the japanese are in a position to not only.hold their current share of the market. but to increase it even further in the next few years. profits of the four major u.s. manufacturers (gm. ford. chrysler. and amc) have dropped sharply. the chrysler corporation has lost money in five of the last seven years and was able to avoid bankruptcy only through intervention by the federal governessional recordextensions of remarks ment. ford has failed to produce a profit from its u.s. sales since mid1979. amc has been able to survive only through substandal capital investment by renault. which is owned solely by the french government. even general motors. the largest auto manufacturer in the world. lost money in 1980. perhaps the most alarming fact of all is that in 1980. for the first time in history. the u.s. was not the leading producer of automobiles. last year japan produced 3 million more units than the u.s. to understand why the u.s. has lost its leadership in automobile production a careful review of the last decade is necessary. the 1970s saw a sudden and dramatic change in the entire worldwide automobile industry. in the early and mid1970s. u.s. cars were being equipped with engines with displacements as large as 500 cubic inches. in 1970. gasoline sold for about 30t per gallon in the u.s. then. in october 1973. the opec nations flexed their muscles for the first time. the price of gasoline shot up to over 50* per gallon almost immediately. gas shortages were common in many urban areas. some states had to resort to \"rationing\" gasoline by allowing motorists to purchase gasoline only on even or odd days of the monthdepending on the last digit of the license plate on the car. by 1974. energy had become the most important issue facing the nation. president ford urged congress to develop a national energy policy. unfortunately. speculation that the energy shortage was entirely contrived by the \"big oil companies\" was increasingly accepted as fact. in 1975. congress passed its first major energy legislation: the energy policy and conservation act. that act is best remembered for two major provisions. first. it required that u.s. manufacturers increase the fuelefficiency of cars. this was accomplished by establishing \"fleet averages\" for fuel efficiency. by 1985. u.s. manufacturers were to achieve a fleet average of 27.5 m.p.g. the second major provision of the act mandated the regulation of the price of petroleum and petroleum products. it was feared that. without fedcral regulation. oil companies would increase prices to artificially high levels and reap huge profits. the result. however. was to keep the price of gasoline artificially low and thereby encourage consumption. as a result of the energy policy and conservation act of 1975. u.s. automobile manufacturers started a tenyear. multibillion dollar effort to improve the fuel efficiency of cars. yet the american consumer. reacting to low gasoline prices and ready supplies. continued to prefer the larger. less fuelefficient cars. the events of 19791980 can be explained as a confluence of many factors climaxing during this period. in april 1979. the second major disruption of energy supplies occurred when iran curtailed shipments of petroleum. to the u.s. because of american support for the shah. who had been overthrown in february. throughout 1980. the u.s. economy was in a recession. unemployment rose. and interest rates and inflation reached record highs. the consumer price index rose at a 20% rate in some months and interest rates set record heights. hitting a prime rate of 20% at one point. consumer confidence and purchasing power dwindled. it was not until the price of petroleum (and thus gasoline) was decontrolled in january 1981 that the u.s. government adopted a realistic policy toward the price of gasoline. because the u.s. price of gasoline was kept below the world price. american consumers had lacked the necessary incentives e 1079 to give up what had been a status symbolthe large fuelinefficient automobile. a second problem for the industry during the 1970s was federal regulation which forced automobile manufacturers to spend billions of dollars to improve the safety. pollution controls. and fuelefficiency of the automobile. the cost of meeting all of the federallymandated regulations reduced the profitability of the auto companies. particularly when sales began to fall. japanese auto manufacturers were able to take advantage of the changes in consumer demands because. in order to meet their own market conditions. they had already fully developed highquality fuelefficient cars. further. due to higher productivity. a more favorable corporate tax structure. and stronger government support through the central bank of japan. the japanese have been able to modernize their manufacturing facilities more quickly than u.s. companies. while the number of imported vehicles increased by 10% between early 1979 and 1981. almost all of that growth came from japanese manufacturers. japanese manufacturers for years have enjoyed a substantial advantage over amercan companies in labor cost. while wage comparisons are difficult due to currency fluctuations and to the higher fringe bene. fits in japanese auto manufacturing. the japanese pay only slightly more than half what american auto workers are paid. the japanese have developed government policies which insure continued growth. over the last decade. their growth in productivity has exceeded that of the united states. therefore the growth of the automobile industry in japan can be partly explained in terms of a more favorable economic environment. as auto imports have increased since 1970. so has the number of americans who depend on the import market for employment. today there are tens of thousands of americans who are employed in importing. selling. and servicing foreignmade cars and trucks. the future of the u.s. auto industry is marked by uncertainty. with the situation in the middle east remaining unstable. it is possible that events in that part of the world may lead to new shortages in gasoline and dramatic price increases. regardless of what happens in the middle east. the department of transportation estimates that the price of gasoline can be expected to increase (in current dollars) to over $3 a gallon by 1990. this will increase the demand in the united states for even more fuelefficient automobiles. the biggest change in the automobile industry in the 1980s may be in the production process. the internationalization of production facilities will mean that large corporations will massproduce component parts in several countries. these parts will then be shipped to other nations for final assembly. by creating this global system of production. corporations will be able to meet local content requirements and take full advantage of economies of scale. through a combination of international production facilities and a worldwide demand for fuelefficient cars. automobiles will become more homogeneous. with only slight differences between cars sold in europe. asia and the united states. any recommendations made to help the automobile industry. and to bring relief to its unemployed workers. should be directed toward meeting the goal of helping the u.s. auto industry to become competitive worldwide. u.s. manufacturers must be able to develop the design. the quality. the fuel efficiency. pricing structure to meet world standards. in order to accomplish this goal: federal environmental. safety and energy regulations must be examined and amended in order to balance the financial capabilities of the automobile industry with the capital requirements placed upon it in meeting those regulations. while still working toward the original goals of cleaner air and greater safety. in the absence of a negotiated agreement. the u.s. should impose limits on the number of automobile imports coming into the country from japan: the federal tax code must be amended to encourage increased capital investments and faster amortization of capital business expenses. federal antitrust laws should be amended to allow u.s. automobile corporations to share newlydeveloped emission control. safety. and fuelefficiency technology: and comprehensive programs to improve the economy must be enacted in order to imporve the confidence and purchasing power of the american consumer and reduce the cost of credit. these recommendations will require a coordinated and comprehensive policy developed by the congress and the reagan administration working with the auto industry and its unions.e","mr. speaker. the san bernardino area experienced three successive and devastating rainstorms on january 14. 28. and february 16. 1980. when the heavy. torrential rains occurred in january. tons of mud. rock. and debris were loosened. this material washed down from the adjacent mountains into residential areas on the northern periphery of san bernardino and highland. these sections incurred devastating damage. some homes were buried up to the eaves with mud. and more than 60 dwellings were damaged in the hampshire and mountain shadows areas. estimated flood damage costs totaled approximately $3.5 million and included damages to private property. public roads. federal facilities. as well as debris clearance. protection of property. repairs. and police and fire services. subsequently. on february 16. 1980. president carter declared san bernardino a federal disaster area. at this date. highway clearing operations are still in progress as the area recovers from the effect of these storms. on january 16. 1980. early during this period of natural disaster. the honorable w. r. holcomb. mayor of san bernardino. and other city officials contacted norton air force base seeking the assistance of the base in combating the effects of the ravaging mudslides in the hampshire area. the response of norton air force base was swift. positive. and decisive. under the direction of col. reginald shaleski. base commander. and his deputy. col. maralin coffinger. each squadron at norton air force base was rapidly organized through its respective first sergeant to provide volunteer relief service to the affected area of san bernardino. coordinating the military effort directly with mayor holcombs committee. the first sergeants group provided specific services when and where they were needed in a most time sensitive and highly effective manner. through the instrumentality of the first sergeants group. the volunteer response of air force personnel was both heartening and of inestimdble benefit to the civilian effort. tasks included the transportation of volunteers. air force equipment. and meals to the mudslide areas. in addition to providing meals for the air force volunteers. norton air force base also fed an additional 200 california conservation corps personnel. the first sergeants acted as crew leaders for their volunteers. coordinated the effort directly with city officials. and provided members to assist in the operation of the volunteer command post at wildwood park. under the command of col. david f. ferree. base civil engineer. members of the prime beef emergency force (prime beef) were deployed to the stricken areas. organized into three teams. these 100 air force civil engineer squadron members labored on 12hour shifts with heavy ecluipment and hand shovels to remove huge amounts of mud and to construct check dams to prevent further damage. the spirit. enthusiasm. and physical effort expended by the volunteer and prime beef teams. working side by side with their civilian counterparts to avert the effects of a natural disaster. provided a most edifying and concrete example of exceptional. effective. and highly cooperative community relations. the rapid response. enthusiastic support. civic concern. and crucial assistance rendered by norton air force base personnelofficers. ncos. and airmen aliketo the san bernardino community in time of extreme need is an exceptional accomplishment in which the civilian and military members of san bernardino may take immense and justifiable pride.*","mr. president. virginia is the nations seventh ranking coalproducing state. we have tried very hard to live within the confines of the new law and the regulations. about onethird of virginia is coal country. in recent years 14 million tons annually. have been produced in our state through strip mining techniques. approximately onethird of the coal produced in the state each year. frankly. our experience has proved that the present requirement in the surface mining act calling for mine operators to restore the mined land to original contours is extraordinarily costly and indeed infinitely unwise. but we are a state that is very proud of the progress we have made in protecting our environment under this act though at times it has been to our detriment. further. frequently the steps necessary to bring about original contours surface restoration have proved hazardous to the individuals performing this work. quite frankly. sometimes it is plainly impossible to restore vast mountain slopes to their original contours. many of our slopes average. from 20 to 30 degrees. human hands and technology simply cannot restore these slopes to their original contours. this has resulted in a drastic curtailment of strip mining. everincreasing unemployment. and a detrimental economic situation to many virginia communities. it is for that reason that i submit this amendment. which i feel is quite reasonable. it merely. in summary. asks that the 100 percent original contour restoration requirement be moved back to a reasonable 75 percent. in other words. the operators must at least restore the contours to 75 percent of their original slope. while my bill addresses virginias economic. environmental. and safety concerns in the surface mining restoration area. it would also have added benefit of possibly providing southwestern virginia with increased usable land. virginias communities have been able to utilize restored land for entirely new purposeshospitals. schools. housing. and other necessary improvements in everyday life. my bill would make available to them additional land for community use. mr. president. a u.s. district judge in western virginia. in examining the surface mining control and reclamation act of 1977 during litigation proceedings in february of this year. made findings of fact that the act imposes stringent performance standards upon coal mining operations on slopes greater than 20 degrees. the judge found that the act makes surface mining economically prohibitive on slopes of 20 degrees or greater. the judge found further that the act has its greatest impact on the land area located in the western district of virginia. since 95 percent of the coal reserves found in virginia and capable of being strip mined are located on slopes with an incline greater than 20 percent. it was held that the evidence presented clearly proved that the act establishes performance standards which are designed to restrict or prevent the recovery of coal from 95 percent of the coal reserves in the western district of virginia. this nonrecovery of coal means a loss of jobs in virginia and economic hardship wrought upon innocent families. at the present time 2.000 of virginias 20.000 coal mines are out of work in southwest virginia. my amendment which would relieve some of the acts stringent requirements would go a long way toward alleviating this existing economic disaster. i only wish that my colleagues could join me and see the beautiful hills of virginia and see how the people. through restoration. have made safe and productive use of land that has yielded forth the coal. in this hour of economic crisis. in this hour when we still are confronted with a national energy problem. i urge my colleagues to consider favorably this amendment. which will help many regions of america. i thank the chair.","mr. president. the question of approving or disapproving the proposed new panama canal treaties is a controversial subject that has evoked great emotion and opposition. in this connection. i am reminded of a cartoon that i recently saw in a magazine that showed two men leaning over their drinks at a bar. one of them said to the other: for thirty years i never thought about the panama canal. now. i cant live without it. i would like to make clear that in my view it would be to our advantage if the present canal zone arrangements could be maintained in a manner agreeable to the united states on the one hand and panama and latin america on the other. but that is clearly not the casewe have now negotiated new treaty arrangements. which are the result of the efforts of two democratic and two republican presidents and which have all along had the support of the joint chiefs of staff. we can either ratify the new treaties or reject thembut there is no way they can be made quietly to disappear. personally. i might have been inclined to have postponed getting started with these negotiations. but that is now water over the dam and. in any case. we had little real choice. my own mail has been running heavily against the treaties. but i am convinced that much of this opposition stems from a number of false impressions about the basis of our current presence in the canal zone. about what americas interests in the canal are. how those interests are protected in the proposed new treaties. and what our realistic choices are in considering these treaties. before discussing these issues. i would like to make it clear that americans ought to be proud of having built the panama canal and operated it so well for more than 60 years. the building of the canal was americas moon shot of early 20th century. i also want to make it clear that in my view the united states has a vital interest in the free. neutral. and efficient operation of the canal. this interest cannot be compromised. as i do not foresee the day when the canal will not be important to us. the question is. however. how can we test protect that vital interestby sticking to the status quo as embodied in the 1903 treaty that gave us the right to build and control the canal. or by approving new treaties? in considering this question. it is useful to look briefly at the history of our acquisition of the canal. in january 1903. we signed a treaty with colombia. of which panama was then a province. giving us the right to build. operate. and control a canal in panama for 100 years. with an option to renew the treaty for successive 100year periods. the u.s. senate voted to ratify the treaty. but the colombian senate rejected the treaty unanimously. in large part because of the perpetual nature of the renewable lease. three months later. a revolt occurred in panama led by an army of 500. u.s. naval vessels prevented colombian troops from landing to put down the revolt. and a new nation was born. two weeks after the revolt. the united states signed. an agreement with an unelected panamanian government granting the united states the exclusive right in perpetuity to build and operate a canal and granting the use of a 10mile wide strip of panamanian territory as if the united state3 were the sovereign. this treaty was signed by a french agent of -the new panamanian government who had p financial interest in selling the french canal companys properties in panama to the united states. no panamanian official ever saw the treaty before the french agent signed it. the fledgling panamanian government was. of course. in no position to repudiate the treaty. when secretary of state hay submitted the treaty to the senate for its advice and consent. he said: we shall have a treaty very satisfactory. vastly advantageous to the united states and. we must confess. not so advantageous to panama.  the panamanians have resented this treaty ever since it was signed. and. although changes have been made over the years to deal with panamania objections. they have never been happy with the treaty. this is an interesting and revealing bit of history. as it serves to put panamanian views in perspective. i see no point. however. in adopting a guilt complex over what our grandfathers did in another era. when it was accepted practice that large nations could run roughshod over small ones. nevertheless. we should not be under any illusion that the events of 1903 could stand the test of modern treatymaking or that panamanians could be convinced that they ought to like the 1903 treaty. in fact. it is in a way surprising that panama has not threatened to invoke the well established doctrine in international law of \"fundamental changes of circumstances\" and repudiate the 1903 treaty. i share the view of our governments highest civil and military authorities that americas national interest lies in the assured access to a safe and efficiently run canal. not in a continuation of a special position in the canal zone that is not necessary in todays world for our guaranteed use of the canal. i believe that our interest in the canal also includes a responsibility to the maritime nations of the world and to certain nations of our own hemisphere for whom the canal is a lifeline. but surely we should attempt to secure these interests by agreement and should seek to engage the friendship and cooperation of the panamanian government and people in keeping the canal open. since there has been a lot of confusion on just what the proposed new canal treaties would and would not do. i should now like to review their major provisions and then comment on the criticisms i have heard most often about them. first of all. there are two treaties. the first is known as the panama canal treaty and covers the revised terms for u.s. operation of the canal until december 31. 1999. when it would be turned over to panama. under this treaty. the united states retains control of canal operations and defense until the end of this century. although the united states will control the canal until the end of the century. the canal zone will cease to exist as soon as the treaty enters into force. the united states. however. will retain the right to use all land and water areas and installations necessary for the operation. maintenance. and defense of the canal until the end of the century. this means that the united states will retain its military bases to provide full security for the canal until then. but panama will be able to use the sizable and valuable areas of the zone that the united states is not now using. in returning jurisdiction over the canal zone to panama. the united states would not be giving away any territory that belongs to us. legally. the united states never obtained sovereignty over the canal zone in 1903. only rights in it. in this regard. the canal zone differs from the louisiana purchase and alaska in that we clearly obtained sovereignty over those areas. in addition. few people realize that in a 1936 treaty with panama. which modified the original 1903 treaty. we formally recognized that the zone is \"territory of the republic of panama under the jurisdiction of the united states.\" the treaty provides for increased payments to panama of from $50 to $60 million annually depending upon canal revenues. absolutely none of these payments would come from the u.s. taxpayers pockets. they would come strictly from canal revenues. and any shortfall in revenues would result in a corresponding decrease in payments to panama. although the projected payments to panama represent a significant increase from the $2.3 million now being paid. it should be borne in mind that in the 75 years since the 1903 treaty was signed. panama has received a total of only $70.5 million in payments from the united states for the use of some very valuable real estate. it is not surprising. therefore. that the panamanians believe that a raise is long overdue. moreover. the payments to panama are not out of line with the $35 million that we pay annually to spain and the $50 million proposed annual payment to turkey for base rights alone. in those cases. unlike the panama canal. the u.s. taxpayer foots the bill. yet we get less for our money than we do in panama where we get not only the use of bases but use of a valuable canal. th3 united states will also extend loans to panama totaling $295 million over the next 5 years to promote panamas economic development. these loans must be repaid at market rates of interest. because of \"buy american\" provisions. this loan package will bring substantial benefits to american business and labor. in addition. the united states will extend loans totaling $50 million over a 10year period to help panama develop a capability for canal defense. except for $5 million of the military credits. no appropriated funds are involved. this economic package is not a treaty obligation. therefore. approval of the treaties will not require approval of these loans and credits. they will be considered on their merits by the congress under the normal authorization and appropriation process. the treaty has extensive provisions to protect american employees of the canal. although u.s. criminal jurisdiction in the zone will be phased out over 3 years. u.s. citizen employees charged with crimes will have various guarantees. and in all likelihood will be able to serve any sentences in the united states. finally. the treaty gives the united states the exclusive right to build a sealevel canal in panama if both the united states and panama agree that such a canal is desirable. in exchange for this. the united states agreed not to negotiate with any other country for such a canal. since all of the desirable sealevel routes are in panama. this is not a significant concession. the second treaty that has been negotiated is known as the treaty concerning the permanent neutrality and operation of the panama canal. unlike the treaty which i have just described that runs until 1999. the neutrality treaty has no expiration date. it is this treaty that has caused so much controversy regarding americas right to use military force to keep the canal open and to receive priority treatment for our naval vessels. this treaty gives the united states and panama the responsibility. either acting jointly or separately. to take whatever measures are necessary to defend the canal and keep it open against any threat. the treaty also provides for expeditious passage by u.s. naval vessels through the canal. the treaty language on these points. by the way. was written and negotiated by the military members of the u.s. delegation. in view of the fact that one of the panamanian negotiators made statements in panama that seemed to contradict what u.s. spokesmen were telling the senate about what our rights are on these points under this treaty. i and several of my colleagues asked that this matter be clarified. accordingly. on october 14. president carter and general torrijos issued a statement of understanding making it clear that the united states \"shall have the right to act against any aggression or threat directed against the canal * * *\" and that u.s. navy vessels will receive \"expedited treatment. and in the case of need or emergency. to go to the head of the line * * *.\" in my view. this statement of understanding clears up the matter and fully protects our rights. i believe. however. that this statement must be incorporated into the treaty before it is ratified. i. for one. am strongly inclined not to vote for the treaty unless it is. i raised this matter with general torrijos personally. when i visited panama last month. general torrijos said he would have no objection if the senate amended the neutrality treaty to include the contents of the statement he and president carter issued on october 14. the senate leadership has introduced amendments. which i have cosponsored. to accomplish this purpose. and. if they are adopted. i shall support the treaties. one final comment on a feature of the neutrality treaty that is not widely known. the treaty obligates panama not to permit the stationing of any foreign military personnel anywhere in panama after 1999. panama is under no such obligation under the 1903 treaty and could invite the soviets or cubans to establish a base right next to the canal zone if it wanted to. i do not know of any other country that has made such a treaty commitment to another nation. the panama canal treaties are not a \"give away\" as some people claim. we are not giving up. our essential rights to use and defend the canal. what we are doing is protecting these rights in the best way possible under modern circumstances far different from those in 1903. we must recognize that. however. we in the united states may view the 1903 treaty. the rest of the world and especially the nations of latin america. do not regard it as an equitable and freely negotiated agreement. to insist on keeping the 1903 treaty would mean that over time we would be compelled to fall back on the use of force as the ultimate basis for our presence in panama. we should be prepared to do that if our vital interests can be defended in no other way. but that is not the case with the panama canal. because the treaties give us a clear and better alternative. those who advocate the rejection of these treaties should be prepared to pay the heavy political. economic. and military costs involved in maintaining our pesence in panama against the will of the panamanian people. looking at the military situation alone. our military commander in the canal zone recently stated that if the rejection of the new treaties leads to widespread civil disturbances and insurgency actions. he would need reinforcements upward of 40.000 troops. moreover. he said that if there were an externally supported guerrilla action involving 10.000 troops. he would need a force of 100.000 to combat it. by comparison. our current troop strength in the canal zone is about 9.300. before closing. i would like to address some of the specific criticisms that many rhode islanders have expressed in their letters to me or which came up in recent testimony before the senate armed services committee. much of the criticism of the treaties is based on insufficient or incorrect information. and i believe it would be useful to set the record straight. criticism no. 1. we are turning the canal over to a dictator who violates human rights. response. there is no doubt that general torrijos is a dictator and that serious human rights violations have occurred under his rule. i would have preferred to see the treaties negotiated with a. democratically elected government. but if we only concluded treaties with free countries -we would have precious few treaties. freedom of the press and other civil liberties have been curtailed in panama. but torture and other severe totalitarian actions common elsewhere in the world have not been the practice in panama. in this connection. i am pleased that in december general torrijos agreed to repeal decrees prohibiting public meetings. promised to permit all political exiles to return to panama after ratification of the treaties. and stated that he would ease or eliminate restrictions on the press. earlier. torrijos promised that free elections would be held in 1978. in judging the human rights performance of panama. it is important to realize that panamanians of all political persuasions. except the extreme left want new treaties. the only concern has been whether torrijos negotiated a good enough deal. on october 23. in a plebiscite monitored by the united nations and the organization of american states. the people of panama approved the treaties by a 2toi majority. thus. in a sense. we are entering into a contract with the people of panama and not torrijos. moreover. it seems unlikely that torrijos will still be in power when the canal is turned over to panama in criticism no. 2. panama is a marxistdominated country. response. nonsense. torrijos is certainly a dictator. but panama is not controlled by marxists. panama has no relations with either the soviet union or red china. and. although torrijos is supnosed to be a friend of castro. he has made it clear that castros way is not the way for panama. the fact that torrijos is succeeding in making panama an international banking center rivaling switzerland attests to the profree enterprise attitude of the government. in my view the surest way to help the weak communists in panama would be to give them an issue around which to rally support by rejecting the canal treaties. criticism no. 3. the panamanians cannot be trusted to run the canal efficiently and will raise tolls to outrageous levels. response. at the present time. over 70 percent of the canal employees are panamanians. although not enough panamanians are in the top management positions to insure the proper functioning of the canal at this time. the canal authorities will have 22 years to develop the necessary panamanian expertise. panama will have a strong incentive to maintain high standards of canal operations and to keep tolls at reasonable levels in order not to drive business away to other modes of transportation. criticism no. 4. panama cannot be trusted to keep its promises in the new treaties. response. i find it hard to believe that panama. having honored the 1903 treaty which it entered into under dubious circumstances and which its people despise. would violate treaties it freely entered into and which has the support of its people. we will have 22 years to test panamas trustworthiness and. if the new treaties are not faithfully observed. we would be under no obligation to relinquish the canal in 1999. if. after 1999. panama violates the neutrality treaty. we will have a legal right endorsed by all of latin america and most of the rest of the world to enforce the treatys provisions. criticism no. 5. the treaties are a bailout for u.s. banks who are owed $2.7 billion by panama. response. no u.s. banks have approached our negotiators to further their interests. most of the socalled panamanian debt actually represents deposits made by american banks in their panamanian subsidiaries for lending outside panama. they are not. therefore. really panamanian debts. the actual amount owed by panama to american banks is $355 million. and payments on these loans are current.","mr. chairman. as with the energy bill that was so skillfully propelled through this body earlier this year. h.r. 9346. the social security financing amendments of 1977. is primarily a tax measure. as with the energy program. these taxes are largely disguised and represent substitutes for genuine policy reform. the best that can be said about h.r. 9046 is that it is an improvement upon what was originally submitted by the administration. there is little dispute that the social security system is facing a severe financial crisis. and that many of the comfortable myths that have grown around the program are being shattered. the pro.gram does not pay for itself. it is not actuarially sound. and it is not insurance. workers are guaranteed nothing under the program and. as this bill demonstrates. may have their benefit levels changed at any time by a simple majority of congress. the system. in its current form. will survive only as long as the working majority in the country at any given time is willing to tax itself to pay program beneficiaries. this has posed no problem in the past simply because workers far outnumbered beneficiaries and bore a relatively reasonable tax burden. after years. however. of political exploitation of social security. a majority of workers find themselves paying more for social security than they do for federal income taxes (not even counting the employers contribution which is effectively part of the employees total wage). expected demographic patterns portend a worsening of this situation during the latter quarter of this century. sharply increased taxes. or reduced benefit levels will be necessary as the proportion of workers to beneficiaries declines from 3 to 1 currently to slightly more than 2 to 1 by the year 2000. the most sanguine observers of social security. such as former hew secretary wilbur cohen. concede that tax rates may have to be increased by 25 percent over this period. while less interested observers have suggested the need for a minimum 50percent increase in the payroll tax. this would all come on top of the nearly 400percent increase in the social security wage base from 1971 to despite such skyrocketing payroll tax increases. the social security program has run increasingly large annual deficits. with the trust fund having a current unfunded liability estimated to be in excess of $3.5 trillion. mr. chairman. h.r. 9346 would increase taxes by nearly $65 billion over the next 5 fiscal years. and result in an eventual tripling of social security taxes. hit hardest. by far. would be the middleincome american for whom the majority professes to have so much concern. an individual employee earning $15.000 in 1977 would be paying into social security $878. with his employer paying the system another $878. the selfemployed individual would be paying $1.185. assuming. conservatively. a 5percent annual inflation over the next 13 years. these same individuals would have to be earning $28.283 in 1990 to be able to maintain the same standard of living. under the new law. they will be paying $2.107 (plus matching employer contribution). and $2.956 respectively. as a percentage of total income. the social security tax will have risen 32.3 percent. an individual employee earning $20.000 in 1977 would be paying social security taxes of $965. as would his or her employer. the selfemployed individual would be paying $1.303. again. assuming a modest 5percent inflation rate. these individuals would have to be earning $37.130 in 1990 to simply keep pace with increases in the cost of living. under the new law. they will be paying $2.766 (plus matching employer contribution). and $3.880 respectively. as a percentage of total income. their social security taxes will have risen by approximately 60.4 percent. by granting standby authority to the social security system to borrow from general revenues. this bill has also made available to congress vast new sums of money that will enable it to continue meting out periodic benefit increases without having to make too clear who is paying for them. the fisher amendment. which i strongly opposed. would. in addition. tell the 100 million workers who are covered by social security that we are not satisfied with the amount of new taxes that the committee version of this bill imposes upon them. and that. in order to protect public employees and members of congress from the burdens of social security. we are going to raise their taxes still more. the fisher amendment. by removing these groups from the purview of the program. would increase everyone elses taxes by $22 billion. raising their wage base by $1.800 and their tax rates by 0.1 percent. somehow. the wondrous merits of compulsory participation in social security have escaped those most responsible for legislating and administering the program. public (and nonprofit) employees would not have lost any benefits whatsoever in being brought under social security. the experience of \"integrated\" retirement systems. both in the private sector and the public sector (military employees) has been a successful one. a fact attested to by numerous studies. a high percentage of state and local employees have already opted for inclusion under the social security program with no resultant loss of benefits. we hear much about this or that piece of legislation being \"labor legislation.\" and being a priority of the unions. organized labor may have been quiet on this bill. but i guarantee that their members (as well as all other workers) will ultimately suffer far more from this single piece of legislation than from the failure of congress to pass a dozen pieces of \"common situs.\" \"cargo preference.\" or \"labor law reform\" legislation. not only are they going to be socked with enormously increased taxes. but the system in which they are forced to place so much confidence has been made only marginally sounder. in addition. the cost to the employer of hiring individuals. particularly those with any degree of skills. has been raised substantially. making it likely that many employers will make do with fewer employees. billions more dollars have also been taken from the private capital markets. insuring continued shortages of investment funds. and continued levels of high unemployment. many of the shortcomings in h.r. 9346 can be remedied by passage of the conable substitute. this measure would provide for far more moderate increases in wage base and tax rate levels. make progress toward universal coverage. provide for a new \"working spouse\" benefit program for working wives. and restructure minimum benefits provisions. and the allocation of taxes among the oasdi and hospital insurance funds. there are several provisions in this bill which i believe are worthy of commendation. including the decoupling and wageindexing provisions. the gradual phaseout of outside earnings limitations upon social security recipients. and the elimination of sexbased differences in the social security law. it is despite these provisions that i find myself having to vote against this bill. h.r. 9346 is a bankrupt reform of an increasingly bankrupt program.","mr. president. this is an important bill. obviously. it contains the money for all of our public works programs or civil function programs. we sometimes say. of the u.s. army engineers. the bureau of reclamation. various regional power agencies. and on to the highly important erda. most of the activities for erda are for research and development authorized through an authorization bill from the joint committee on atomic energy and the committee on interior and insular affairs. mr. president. as a general overall outline. this bill is already somewhat above the presidents budget. it already approaches but does not exceed the ceilings of our allocations under the first concurrent resolution on the budget. i ask the membership to bear that in mind when we get to consideration of these matters. we have to bear it in mind. we have here in this bill $200 million of the most urgent importance to take care of the teton dam breakage and flooding of the area out there. to the great loss and detriment of the people who are directly affected. other items in the bill are the tennessee valley authority. the appalachian regional commission. nuclear regulatory commission. federal power commission. and various other agencies. at the front of the report appear the sums of money that are involved as they relate to the budget. to the house bill. and to the increases made by the senate committee. which were relatively small. but we did weigh and consider carefully these matters. as i say. mr. president. speaking for the committee on appropriations. the bill it is my pleasure to present to the senate. the public works for water and power development and energy research appropriations bill for fiscal year 1977. is a highly important and significant bill which provides funds for research and development for a number of promising alternative sources of energy under the energy research and development administration. title i of the bill. and provides funds for the well known and needed water resources program of the u.s. army corps of engineers. also known as civil works or civil functions. which has meant and continues to mean so much to our nation. which is title ii of the bill. title iii provides funds for the work of the bureau of reclamation and the various power agencies. which are under the department of the interior. and then there are appropriations to carry out the activities of the independent and related agencies such as the appalachian regional commission and its programs. the federal power commission. the nuclear regulatory commission. the tennessee valley authority. and the water resources council among others in title iv of the bill. the grand total of new budget obligational authority recommended by the committee in the bill is $9.694.785.000. this is an increase of $295.890.000 over the amended budget estimates of $9.398.895.000 that were considered by the committee. the increase recommended by the committee over the bill as passed by the house is $49.176.000. the house passed bill provides $9.645.609.000 which is an increase of $425.514.000 over the budget estimate of $9.220.095.000 that were considered by the house. the total fiscal year 1977 appropriation as compared to 1976 appropriations reflects an increase of $2.180.628.000. of which about $1.7 billion is the increase for the highly important energy research and development efforts. mr. president. let me point out at this time that the amounts that i have just given do not include the presidents budget request of june 11 to provide $200.000.000 in new budget authority for the payment of claims related to the teton dam failure. this amount was added to this bill on the house floor as requested. and will become available immediately upon enactment of the bill as it now stands. members are familiar with this disaster and the urgency for these funds to be made available as soon as possible. this amount of $200.000.000 will undoubtedly be charged against the fiscal year 1976 transition quarter appropriation and that is why we have not included them within the fiscal year 1977 amounts. additionally. because of the need to alleviate and to help with the tremendous damage and suffering in southeastern idaho. expeditious action is requested on this bill today in order that we may take it to conference with the house before the end of the week. pass the conference report through both houses and send it on to the president before the upcoming recess. now. mr. president. i do not intend to elaborate on the various items and projects included in the bill inasmuch as the committee action and the report accompanying the bill have been available to the membership since the committee met and reported this bill last thursday. june 17. i will highlight a number of areas very briefly.","mr. speaker. our nation is presently confronted with a staggering variety of serious problems. not the least of which are a skyrocketing rate of unemployment and a steadily deteriorating system of railroad transportation. these two problems. interrelated in ways. suggest to me that we in congress now should set forth our priorities in a clear and reasonable manner. one priority is to fine tune and focus squarely on our job programs. exactly what is their purposesimply to make work or is it to produce useful byproducts? another priority certainly is to get the railroads rolling. in the northeast we are looking at the probable abandonment of railroads. in the west we see deferred maintenance today that could lead to abandonment tomorrow. what we should be aiming at is not abandonment but rehabilitation. for a change. let us talk about making the railroads usable and manageable. the villages and towns and cities that rely on railroads cannot do this for themselves. lincoln suggested: the legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done. but cannot do at all or cannot do so well for themselves in their separate and individual capacities. what better time for congress to conduct \"the legitimate object of government?\" mr. speaker. i am today introducing legislation which would put to work rebuilding our nations railroad rightsofway. unemployed railroad workers and others who have suffered job losses during these times of high unemployment. to do this. my bill would make an investment in our nations railroad rightsofway. it also makes sure that the public interest in this investment is properly protected by necessary safeguards. my legislation does not represent a longrange solution to either problemunemployment or railroadsbut it does offer an important initial step toward resolving both difficulties. most important. this bill would mean action. and action is what the people rightfully expect of us. my bill is designed to employ over 50.000 maintenanceofway workers to rebuild railroad track and roadbedsa vital step if we are to improve rail service in this country. at the same time. this bill would help achieve our national goal of putting people to work on jobs that will stimulate our economy and expand work opportunities in private industry. the fact that the economic health of this country is dependent on rail service is most evident when you realize that railroads serve over 45.000 communities nationally. employ over 500.000 persons. pay $500 million in taxes a year. handle 60 percent of shipments by manufacturers. transport 70 percent of coal used domestically. and make annual purchases of more than $4 billion. however. the railroad industry simply does not have the manpower it needs to restore its rightofway to the degree necessary for railroads to once again become a viable transportation alternative. at the end of world war i the railroad industry employed approximately 400.000 people to maintain their rightsofway. today they employ little more than 90.000 people who are responsible for the maintenance of over 205.000 miles of track in the united states. yet. the railroad industry has been forced to compete at a disadvantage with other forms of transportation which have been heavily subsidized with government support. for example. the airline industry does not have to finance the high cost of running airportsthe government does that for them. the trucking industry has the benefit of the governmentconstructed modem interstate highway system which is nothing less than a high speed rightofway for intercity truck and passenger traffic financed with 90 percent federal money. the railroad industry has none of these benefits and must run their own train stations and rebuild and maintain their own roadbeds. therefore. i believe the time has come for this congress to correct the inequities in the distribution of government financial support for transportation in this country. we have ignored those transportation economists who have pointed out to us in the past that one reason rail service is on the decline is because rail transportation has received less than onehalf of 1 percent of all transportation funds expended by all levels of government in the united states. other experts have indicated that rail transportation \"can move most goods in volume between the same points with less than onethird the fuel. onethird the air pollution. onesixth the casualties and onetenth the land.\" how can we continue to ignore the importance that an efficient rail system can have on our economic. energy. and environmental programs in this country? this government must begin to put our national priorities in perspective. unemployment is soaring. almost 8 million americans are out of work and the financially crippled railroad industry was forced to lay off approximately 21.000 employees in january of this year. this was the largest monthly drop in rail employment in a nonstrike period in 15 years. upon clse examination. a definite parallel exists between the decline of our railroad industry and the decline in our economy. only through this recognition will we begin to appreciate the effect that efficient rail service has on our national unemployment rate which could go as high as 10 percent this year. the congress will shortly consider legislation that would authorize up to $5 billion a year for public service employment programs. i cannot believe that my distinguished colleagues would authorize such a large expenditure without giving some thought to the kind of jobs we create. what we need to give priority to are jobs that will further stimulate our economy and be a wise investment for the future. surely. rebuilding roadbeds to improve rail service makes much more sense than putting people to work raking leaves. cleaning streets. or maintaining public buildings. rebuilding our railroad rightsofway is a better use of hardearned taxpayer dollars. mr. speaker. the only means of transportation available to move heavy volume goods to market is rail transportation. without it. the auto industry would collapse in a week. coal could not be cheaply transported and agricultural goods would dramatically increase in cost. while the bill i introduce today will not solve all our problems. it will create the type of productive jobs that will stimulate our economy. improve rail service and. in turn. lead to the creation of more jobs in the private sector of our economy. we can no longer afford to idly sit back and wait for the economic recovery of our railroadsif we do so it may be too latewe need action and we need it now. i believe the proposal i introduce today could be the spark that begins a new era of efficient rail service in this country and an upturn in our economy. congressman fred rooney. chairman of the transportation subcommittee. has promised early hearings on this legislation and i am hopeful that we can count on speedy congressional action. mr. speaker. i have also received tremendously encouraging support from government officials. members of congress. railroad labor and railroad management. with their help and the help of my colleagues in the house. i am confident we can claim our first victory in our battle for a more stable economy. in particular. i have already received statements of support from the association of american railroads. the united transportation union. and the brotherhood of maintenance of way employees and i include these statements. together with the text of my legislation. at this point in the record:","mr. president. the amendment i am introducing today to s. 2744. the energy reorganization act of 1974. has a simple objective: to establish the energy research and development administrationerdaas a nonnuclear r. &amp; d. agency. it would leave the aec intact to carry out its developmental work on nuclear fission. it would not alter the sound decision of the government operations committee to separate the regulatory functions of the aec from its promotional aspects. but it would ensure that the nonnuclear research and development activities of the government are carried out by a nonnuclear agency. under s. 2744. all of the aec. including the division of military application. is transferred into erda. except for the number of people in the aecs directorate of regulations which is transferred to a newly created nuclear safety and licensing commission. while most of the aec. with its national laboratories and extensive contractor network go into erda. transfers from other agencies are minor by comparison. these include the department of interiors office of coal research. fossil fuel energy r. &amp; d. conducted by the bureau of mines. and solar and geothermal research of the national science foundation. the following table shows the personnel and budgets which will be transferred to erda from each agency: people money aec -------- 15.988 1 $3.779.000. 000 interior ---- 116 $372.000. 000 nsf -------- 13 $37. 000. 000 an additional 1.9co people and $140 million in fiscal year 1975 funds will be transferred to the newly created nuclear safety and licensing commission. in addition to the 7.000 aec employees. there are 88.000 employees at aecowned facilities. the aecs national laboratories. which are operated by private firms under contract with the aec. employ 33.000 individuals. all of these contract employees would come into erda. under s. 2744. to continue the work they have been doing for the aec. it is obvious that the aec will be the dominant agency in erda. indeed the nuclear proponents in the house would never have rushed the erda bill through that body in such haste if it did not put the aec in charge of energy development. i think it should be apparent to everyone by this time that putting the aec in charge of developing nonnuclear energy technologies is like putting the fox in charge of guarding the chickens. aecs record is one of outspoken advocacy for nuclear power against all other forms of energy. let me cite a few examples. first. on june 11. 1974. the aec unveiled its geothermal energy program. the resources it has devoted in the past to the program are pitifully small. and its announced 1985 objective woefully inadequate. the program was started only in 1974 with a funding of about 4.5 million. its aim is to do r. &amp; d. work on the construction and operation of small pilot plants with 10megawatt capacity. the program hopes to stimulate commercial production of 20.000 mw by 1985. contrast this with the report geothermal energy produced in september 1973 by about 50 scientists under a grant sponsored by the national science foundation. the report concluded that with adequate r. &amp; d. funds 132.000 megawatts could be produced by 1985. the equivalent of more than half of all the electricity now being generated in the united states. second. a report on the potential for solar energy. prepared by an outstanding panel of experts assembled by the cxx1308part 16 aec. was almost completely ignored in the aecs december 1973 report to the president on a national energy program. the experts concluded that: at an average energy conversion efficiency of 5 per cent. less than 4 per cent of the u.s. continental land mass could supply 100 per cent of the current energy needs. thus solar energy could contribute significantly to the national goal of permanent energy selfsufficiency while minimizing environmental degradation. in addition. this technology will be an exportable item for use by other energy deficient areas of the world. although the full impact of solar energy probably wont occur until the turn of the century. the economic viability of several of the applications. e.g.. heating and cooling of buildings. wind electric power. and bloconversion to fuels could be developed and demonstrated in the next 5 years. ultimately. practical solar energy systems could easily contribute 1530 per cent of the nations energy requirements. the panel recommended a 5year funding program beginning in 1975 with $409 millionminimum viableto $1 .056 millionaccelerated-\"having a high probability of early success.\" by contrast the report of the chairman of the aec to the president assigns the lowest priority to solar energysolar is ranked last out of 10 technologies consideredthe report recommended 5year r. &amp; d. budget is less than onefifth that of the accelerated. orderly program and less than half the minimum viable program advocated by the solar energy panel of experts. third. the december 1973 aec report to the president on a national energy r. &amp; d. program is overwhelmingly biased in favor of further development of nuclear energy and against the renewable energy sources. the report singles out nuclear fission for the largest share of the r. &amp; d. pie24 percent as against 9 percent for solar geothermal combined and hydroelectric and nuclear fusion combined. the bias is even more pronounced in the short- and midrange r. &amp; d. budget projections-$5.3 billion is recommended to achieve short and midterm objectives for nuclear fission as compared to $430 million for all renewable energy technologies. these huge sums recommended for nuclear fission r. &amp; d. are all the more astounding in light of the fact that nuclear power plants are now in production in large numbers and the r. &amp; d. phase at the program should have been passed long ago. this year the senate passed by unanimous vote s. 1283. a 10year. $20 billion program to make the country selfsufficient in energy by 1985. the house is working on a companion measure and it appears certain that a comprehensive energy r. &amp; d. program will be passed by the congress in the next few months. most importantly. this landmark legislation provides not a single cent for nuclear fission research and development. indeed the house sponsors of the bill are relabeling it as the \"nonnuclear energy research and development act.\" it is simply incomprehensible that the congress should pass this major legislation for the development of nonnuclear energy technologies and then turn over the management of the programs to the atomic energy commission. the aec has. over the years. developed a dogma regarding nuclear power that approaches a religious faith. and the more vocal critics have become in pointing out the inherent dangers of nuclear technology. the more entrenched and determined has the aec bureaucracy become. and this intense commitment to the promotion of nuclear energy is paying off for its adherents: 44 nuclear power plants are on line now. two hundred twentyfive are scheduled to be in operation in 10 years. 1.000 in 25 years. out of a $2.2 billion fiscal year 1975 energy budget. nuclear power received the lions share-$1.5 billion. now much of the aecs efforts is being directed to finding ways to bring nuclear plants into operation quicker. from 10 to 6 or 7 years. how can we possibly expect top aec personnel who have devoted all of their lives to the promotion of nuclear power to reverse gears and to start pushing nonnuclear energy sources? they have not done so in the past. they have given no indication that they believe renewable energy technologies can play a significant role in this century in meeting our energy needs. their commitment to nuclear power is complete. well. one of the answers being given is that s. 2744 as reported out by the government operations committee would assure that erda would not be dominated by pronuclear people. even though the aec would overwhelmingly dominate the new agency by its sheer manpower and personnel. what are these controls in the bill. and how effective can we expect them to be? first. section 2(b) states that: the congress intends that no energy technology be given an unwarranted priority. second. section (102) (c) prescribes that: the president shall appoint the adminisstrator from among individuals who. by reason of their training and experience are especially qualified to manage a full range of energy research and development programs. third. a separate assistant administrator is established for solar. geothermal and advanced energy systems. does anyone believe that these generalities will suffice to give nonnuclear technologies a fair shake in an agency dominated by nuclear proponents? what real protection do these sections of the bill provide? for example. who is to determine what constitutes an \"unwarranted priority\" for an energy technology? the technical competence for evaluating new possibilities will be in erda. and if that agency decides that solar or geothermal have only limited possibilities in the near and midterm. as they already have. who will gainsay them and provide for bigger r. &amp; d. budgets than the agency wants? if erda does not undertake needed research in nonnuclear areas because of its preoccupation with nuclear power. who will correct the balance. omb? the appropriations committees? the legislative committees? maybe. but lets not count on it. with regard to the second point above. that is. the administrator and deputy administrator \"specially qualified to manage a full range of energy research and development programs\" this has already been interpreted in committee as not excluding any of the present members of the atomic energy commission even though most of them are specially qualified to manage only one r. &amp; d. program. the nuclear one. how seriously this amendment is being taken by the administration can be seen from the fact that the white house has already floated the name of one candidate for the job of erda administrator. john simpson. president of a westinghouse division involved in the design and production of nuclear reactors and one of the most outspoken advocates of nuclear power. finally. the designation of an assistant administrator for solar. geothermal. and advanced energy systems. insures only that the funds allocated to his office will be spent on these technologies. it does nothing to insure that he receives a proper share of the total resources allocated to the agency. in an aec dominated erda run by personnel who have already indicated their low opinion of solar and geothermal energy. the chances for the assistant administrator to get a fair share of the funds available to the agency will be poor indeed. another effect of the amendment i have introduced is to keep the aecs military weapons program out of erda. under the committee bill. a military applications division is established in erda as a consequence of the transfer of most of the aec functions to the new energy agency. the development of nuclear weapons has no place in a civilian r. &amp; d. agency which has as its principal responsibility the development of energy technologies. all of the erda administrators time and that of his immediate staff will be required to set up and run this new program aimed at solving the nations energy needs. this is an allconsuming and an allimportant task. why burden these people with the job of managing a military weapons program? my amendment would not prevent the utilization of aec resources by erda for energy research. there is no doubt that the aec. in its contractoroperated national laboratories and in its tens of thousands of professional contract employees. possesses a capability of inestimable value. for example. aec contractors at los alamos laboratory. at the lawrence lab in berkeley. at the livermore lab at aerojet nuclear and elsewhere have an excellent potential for geothermal energy. r. &amp; d. erda would be encouraged to contract with these organizations to undertake research efforts appropriate to their capability. indeed. erda would be encouraged to seek out and utilize all available resources in the federal governmentincluding the national aeronautics and space administration which is omitted in s. 2744government. in private industry. and in the great universities. to placing r. &amp; d. contracts with those organizations best fitted to carry out the t sk of developing new energy technologies. to sum up the arguments for establishing erda as a nonnuclear energy r. &amp; d. agency: first. the aec will inevitably dominate erda by virtue of its overwhelming preponderance of manpower and budget. second. the aec has provided ample evidence of its intense bias in favor of nuclear power and against other forms of energy technology. third. putting the management of a major nonnuclear energy r. &amp; d. act in the hands of an aecdominated erda and expecting these nonnuclear technologies to be aggressively promoted indicates a faith in the nuclear bureaucracy that passeth understanding. fourth. the controls supposedly contained in the committee bill cannot be expected to prevent a pronuclear bias in the new agency. there is nothing in s. 2744 that provides real assurance that the erda management will promote nonnuclear energy technologies to their fullest potential.","mr. president. i send to the desk. for appropriate reference. a bill to establish a national program for research. development. and demonstration of fuels and energy technologies and for the coordination and financial supplementation of federal energy research and development. it has now been a year and a half since the senate authorized the committee on interior and insular affairs to undertake a comprehensive study of national fuels and energy policy. during the course of this study. the committee has conducted extensive hearings and studies into every aspect of fuels and energy policy and has published more than 40 documentshearing records. staff and consultant reports. committee prints. and other materials. the committee is now in the process of concluding the information gathering and public hearings stage of the study and investigation. and will soon begin to consider policy option papers dealing with specific recommendations for administrative action. for legislation. and for national energy policy in a number of different subject matter areas. although the committee has not completed its final report to the senate. i believe. as one member of the committee. that many clear conclusions already have emerged from the study. the most obvious- and. in my view. the most important conclusion to have emerged is that the nation critically needs and must now establish a comprehensive highpriority energy research and development program. a major factor contributing to our present energy crisis is that the necessary research and development efforts which could have provided us with the technological options and capabilities we now need so desperately were not undertaken in the past. fragmented management. inadequate funding. and illogical distribution of the little energy r. &amp; d. funding which is available have all contributed to the critical energy supply situation we face today. in the united states we are now facing for the first time very serious shortages of natural gas. fuel oil and other forms of energy. in the months ahead many regions of the nation will face critical shortages of gasoline. the shortages are not caused by a lack of domestic energy resources. there are adequate domestic supplies of energy to meet all of our requirements for the foreseeable future. we have huge coal reserves in appalachia and in the west. the oil shale deposits in the western united states are an untapped energy resource of great potential. geothermal powerthe heat contained in the earthcould be a major source of energy. there are large volumes of oil and gas yet to be discovered on the outer continental shelf and in the united states. the shortages we are experiencing and the shortages that all knowledgeable commentators project in the months ahead are the direct result of the nations failure to anticipate the problems and to develop policies to deal with them. this is especially true in the area of energy research and development. we have failed to move from the realm of theory into the time of commercial demonstration. today in the united states adequate supplies of fuels and other energy resources are available. the basic scientific theory and laboratory experimentation to convert the domestic fuels we have in abundance to usable forms of energy exist. but the technologies which would make these domestic energy sources commercially useful within acceptable environmental and economic limits have not been developed. why has not the research and development been done? for one thing. neither industry nor government fully appreciated the magnitude of the emerging energy crisis. and now that it is here and its magnitude has been appreciated. there is still a reluctance to undertake the allout research effort we need. in many areas we have had abundant warnings. we have been concerned about the national security aspects of oil imports at least since 1955 when a voluntary quota system was initiated. but there is little evidence that either government or industry has made efforts to improve the utility of our most abundant domestic fuels. specifically. research on oil shale has been sporadic and unenthusiastic. in coal gasification we have only the technologies developed abroad more than a generation ago. we have recognized the adverse physical and social consequence of underground coal mining since before the turn of the century. but underground mining continues to remain a dirty. dangerous. laborintensive process with little application of modern automated technologies. air pollution caused by electrical power plants and the adverse impacts of stripmining are selfevident. but far too little research has been done on methods to mitigate these impacts. even now. efforts are totally inadequate in relation to the enormity of the problem. this nation depends upon electrical power for 25 percent of the life support energy of modern communities. but the electric utility industry does not have the flexibility to effectively deal with all of the new constraints which now exist in the management of its systems. most generating equipment. for example. is incapable of switching from one fossil fuel to another. when one fuel runs short. the utility experiences a crisis even when alternative fuels are available. too little has been done to control the burgeoning energy demand. yet. if we fail to meet a peak demand for electricity. entire cities are blacked out. the traffic lights and the neon signs go out together: so do the tv sets and the elevators. the electric toothbrush and the kidney machine. now we realize the threat. but what research or engineering is underway to reduce or eliminate the public catastrophe which can result when peak demands or fuel shortages exceed the capacities of the systems? i cannot agree with a recommendation recently published by the national petroleum council that all we need is a favorable \"economic and regulatory climate\" to bring about the necessary and required energy research and development. even if a favorable \"economic and regulatory climate\" were achieved. i question claims that research and development efforts would improve. quite the contrary. favorable economic climates in the past have encouraged complacency and neglect of potentially favorable technological alternatives. whatever r. &amp; d. is being done. has been forced by adversity. the legislation i am introducing today is designed to initiate a program for energy r. &amp; d. which will establish the urgency of purpose which has characterized successful national research efforts in the past. such as the space program and the manhattan project. the program i am advocating has the following major parts: first. a clear and specific objectiveto provide the united states. by 1983. with the capability to be selfsufficient in environmentally acceptable sources. an aggressive research and development effort must have a goal. it is too easy to claim technological progress in relation to the past. progress in r. &amp; d.success or failuremust be measured against a schedule. and a schedule requires a defined objective. second. a management mechanism to provide an overview of federal energy r. &amp; d. programs and the financial capability to achieve an adequate total effort. the presidents budget for fiscal year 1974 proposes a total of less than $800 million-$771.8for all energy research and development. nearly 75 percent of this amount is for nuclear energy r. &amp; d.. primarily conducted by the aec. the rest. scattered throughout the federal agencies. is grossly inadequate to deal with the shortterm problems of environmental controls. to carry forward creative efforts on unconventional energy sources such as solar energy. and to improve the efficiency of conventional energy technologies such as petroleum and natural gas recovery techniques and electrical power generation and transmission. i propose that an interagency \"energy management project\" be established. it will have an independent chairman with a small technical and budget staff who will be assisted by representatives of the existing federal agencies which have energy r. &amp; d. responsibilties. the project will have an annual budget of $800 million to supplement the programs now underway. the project will be authorized to transfer funds to federal agencies to reinforce ongoing programs. more importantly. it will be authorized to determine what new efforts are needed and to enter into agreements with universities. national laboratories. nonprofit organizations. or industrial entities to obtain the kind of research and development capabilities which are required. the project is not a reorganization of existing federal energy functions. it will. however. enable the federal government to make an aggressive start now on a comprehensive research strategy. while the involved and timeconsuming job of government reorganization for energy is underway. the establishment of the project will not disrupt the progress of ongoing programs which are sorely needed. once a permanent lead agency for energy and energy r. &amp; d. has been created. the duties and budget of the project can be assigned to that agency. third. singlepurpose. corporate ventures to advance potential energy technologies to stage of commercial application. one of the most difficult problems in bringing new technologies into general application is to move from the laboratory or pilot plant phases to the first commercial prototype.- prototypes represent much larger investments of capital than experimental research. construction and management of prototypes present unfamiliar startup and production problems. and the potential returns on investment are always uncertain. a number of critically needed energy technologies are now stalemated at the point of prototype construction. shale oil production. coal gasification and liquefaction. advanced combined power cycles. and geothermal energy all are close to commercial viability. each technology. however. needs to be pushed from the laboratory into commercial service. achieving this will require a singleminded management group and adequate funding to bridge the gap from research to prototype. singlepurpose. corporate ventures should. in my view. be established for each technology. with federal support and involvement limited to the development and demonstration period. this will insure that the management of the venture is concerned solely with success in one technology and in the immediate future. federal support in each corporation should be sufficient to overcome the element of uncertainy and make the investment attractive to industrial participants. the corporate structure will permit federal participation on the board of directors commensurate with the level of federal support. but it will provide the nonfederal participants with a real share in management. specifically. the five areas which i propose to be included are: coal gasification. shale oil. advanced power cycles. geothermal resources. and coal liquefaction. first. coal gasification is tremendously significant. because it would permit our extensive coal resource---over 87 percent of proved fossil fuel reservesto be used directly to replace scarce oil and gas. the process would offer the opportunity to remove contaminants from the fuel prior to combustion. thereby decreasing air pollution and contributing to more efficient energy production. second. shale oil is important. because of the extent of the domestic resourceat least 30 times greater than reserves of crude. third. advanced power cycles would utilize the process of coal gasification in conjunction with high temperature aircrafttype turbines followed by conventional steam cycles at lower temperatures. all combined into a single system. they would provide electricity at higher efficiencies thereby conserving resources. advanced power cycles also offer opportunities to reduce air and water pollution to levels lower than those of conventional powerplants. and to make our deposits of high sulfur coal usable. fourth. geothermal resources. if all forms of development are considered. are virtually an unlimited source of heat energy in many areas of the country. geothermal energy is a \"renewable\" resource and is a potentially clean source of electric power generation and of heat for industrial processes. fifth. coal liquefaction. the production of synthetic liquid petroleum products from coal. can provide a substitute for increasingly scarce petroleum products. taken together. the program i proposea specific r. &amp; d. objective. coordinated and adequately funded management of federal support. and aggressive efforts to bring each of the promising new technologies to fruitionwill increase federal funding of energy r. &amp; d. from the present level of less than $800 million to about $2 billion annually over a period of 10 years. that .8360 would represent an increase of 150 percent of the present level. in terms of the significance of the energy crisis in relation to the overall economic. financial. and social wellbeing of the nation. this is the minimum program which is justifiable. mr. president. the bill which i am introducing today is consistent with s. 357. a proposal cosponsored by myself. the senator from washington and several other senators. s. 357 would amend the federal power act to establish a federal power research and development program to increase the efficiency of electric energy production and utilization. reduce environmental impacts. and develop new sources of clean energy. i believe that an r. &amp; d. strategy of this nature is appropriate for the electric utility industry. in a spirit of cooperation among the various committees which are members of the senate resolution 45 study. i have discussed the relationship between s. 357 and the measure i am introducing today with the distinguished senator from washington and my esteemed colleague from west virginia and it is our intention to insure full compatibility between these two bills before they reach the senate floor. so that the senate can consider a single comprehensive energy research and development strategy designed to remedy the past years of neglect by the federal government. the measure i introduce today does not purport to be the final answer to the nations energy problems. it is. however. an appropriate starting point in bringing americas scientific and intellectual resources and technological capability to bear upon a problem which affects the lives and the future wellbeing of all americans. the bill itself will be improved and modified as a result of committee hearings and the suggestions and recommendations of other members of the senate and of the administration. mr. president. i ask that the following tables and the full text of the national energy research and development policy act of 1973 be printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks.","mr. chairman. i rise in support of the wright amendment. mr. chairman and members of the house. there is no doubt in my mind but that we in the congress are responsible for the controversy which exists here today with regard to whether or not there should be some limitation placed on section 801 of this proposed bill. in my personal opinion. we are more responsible than anyone else. because we have with too much haste in times gone by passed supposedly environmental protective legislation without giving due consideration to what the end result of some of this legislation might be. now we find that certain agencies in the federal government. or at least we lay claim to the fact that certain agencies in the federal governmentin this instance specifically the environmental protection agencyare not administeri ng the legislation which we passed according to congressional intent. this may or may not .be the case. certainly we can all agree that people are being displaced from their regular 28404 cc employment because of the administration of such legislation by the environmental protection agency. i am not one of those people who get as excited as some others do about protecting the environment. i admit we have to do something about it. we must do everything we can. but we have to do it with common sense. i do not share the attitude that some have. that everything is emotional and we can correct all these things today. i stand before this house laying claim to a belief that says we will never eliminate totally. as some would say. pollution in this country. we must however reduce it to a minimum. some of those people who speak emotionally over that subject have not found out yet that if one takes a bath one pollutes the water. and if one does not. one pollutes the air. sincerely. however. the vast majority of all americans want to do all that can possibly be done to protect the environment. i share that desire with them. however. i will tell you this: we are in the process going to displace some people and cause them to lose their jobs because of the legislation that we already have passed or in the future do pass. now. listen to me. because there is a parallel to be drawn here. i have never in my own mind been able to justify. for example. compensation by payments to farmers for letting land lie idle except because of the fact that here. for example. was a farmer who owned land and who owned equipment and who had been farming that land which he owned with the equipment which he owned and who was suddenly told by the federal government. \"you can no longer farm your land. you have to do something else.\" that farmer is due compensation by the federal government. people are going to lose their jobs because of acts of the federal government. of the epa. i think just as farmers are due some compensation. so are these workers who are displaced because of federal legislative action and in turn then the action of an executive agency of the u.s. government. this being the case. i think they ought to be compensated. but the question comes up. how much are they going to be compensated? we have a national standard for compensating farmers through the system of payment for land which cannot by federal law be farmed and which lies idle. i see nothing wrong under these circumstances with a uniform standard. certainly we have to have some limit. it could be nothing but an oversight on the part of the committee that a limitation was not placed on this section and the compensation provided by this section in committee. so the committee comes along now and wants to limit and limit severely what an individual is eligible for in the way of compensation. i think in this instance the gentleman from texas makes a point and makes it well that.maybe they are entitled to just a little bit more than they would be as insured employees under workmens compensation because they are losing their jobs purely and solely","mr. chairman. the question will shortly be before the congress as to whether or not the government will continue to finance the private development of a supersonic transport. arguments have raged back and forth with increasing intensity. claim and counterclaim are made with a growing divergence between the various views. to me the choice is plain. i do not believe that the taxpayers of the united states should be forced to take a $1.4 billion risk that private enterprise is unable or unwilling to sustain. it is increasingly obvious that a powerful. inextricably intertwined lobby is seeking to siphon this vast sum from the public treasury for the benefit of an aerospace complex that is already in deep financial difficulty because of its own poor judgment and past errors. the airlines have no desire to have this craft. even if it were brought into being. upon them. staggering from debts and interest rates incurred by overbuying of large jets. they look with horror upon the costs of this new mastodon of the air. yet the aerospace companies affected have attempted to force this monstrosity down the throats of an already balky public. who would utilize such a monster? only the very wealthy. why do we need such an aircraft? so we can cross the oceans faster and have the extra 2 hours to spend in traffic jams? that is the only use that comes to my mind. arguments are put forward by the smoothly functioning. well financed lobby about the anglofrench concorde. news from the other side of the atlantic piles up to the effect that the british and french are stuck with a flying white elephant. a grossly expensive technical disaster that tears roofs off houses near airports. drives people half insane with its roars and shows no sign of ever approaching a financial breakeven point. mr. servanschreibers communications of recent weeks are more than a little thought provoking. yet to me the ultimate argument centers around the environment as well as about priorities. expert technical people have again and again raised pertinent questions about what longterm environmental effects this craft or a fleet of them will have upon the world we inhabit. by daring to have the courage to raise these questions. the environmental groups and their allies have been attacked. maligned and threatened. their patriotism. judgment. and even sanity has been called into question along with their tax exempt status. yet all they are doing is asking questions americans should have begun asking years ago. before pesticides ran wild. before subdivisions ran amuck. before all the forests were hewn down. before mercury began to be dumped in large quantities. before all sorts of chemical compounds began to be added to our food. ad infinitum. ad nauseum. american industry has. in the name of technology and progress for progress sake. perpetrated one atrocity after another upon the nation. reaping vast profit from public indifference. now that indifference is at an end. particularly when the very people who will be victimized by their latest little technical gimmick are being asked to subsidize it. i represent a district in new york citys borough of brooklyn. my constituents know what they require in terms of transportation requirements. mass urban transit that is safe. fast. cheap and dependable. fewer traffic jams. less lead in gasoline. better and safer cars. subsidies to help the beleaguered city and suburban dweller who cannot move with dispatch any longer in the confines of his own living area. it is presently impossible for any large number of americans to move safely. quickly and cheaply on urban mass transit with any consistency anywhere in the nation. and we are now being asked to subsidize this ridiculous flying boondoggle for the benefit of the sst lobby? not on anyones life. and what about the other national priorities crying out for attention and assistance? what of housing? what of antipollution? what of drug programs? what of the hungry among us? how about our schools and the millions of jobless citizens whose hopes drop lower daily? instead of these peoples needs. we are asked to approve subsidies for the ultimate in noise pollution. have any of the ssts proponents walked through downtown manhattan on an average day? let them have a treat in terms of noise. and then come back here and ask us for money for a chain of sonic booms stretching across the oceans and land areas. howls of anguish are heard on this score. they say they will never. never. never fly across the land routes. this is so much nonsense. all the lucrative routes for any such craft lie across land. if they do not fly such a plane across them. complete with sonic booms that would do nationally what already has been shown in oklahoma city. the plane would lay an even bigger financial egg than we are assured it will do anyway. the blather about how many jobs it would create or take with it is just that. hollow. empty mouthings by public relations men who are frightening apprehensive aerospace workers into lobbying on behalf of the vested interests. the russian sst is obviously going to become as great a cropper as the concorde. attempts to scare us into massive subsidies because of national pride are as empty as the other claims on behalf of the sst. my home state of new york already contributes more than $23 billion annually into the federal treasury. in return we receive less than $3 billion in federal programs. i for one am outraged at the thought of having to pay for such a venture. if private industry wants it. then let them pay for it as they have done in previous instances. finally. if this atrocity is foisted upon the public in spite of their expressed wishes. then it is my fervent hope that my home city will insure the passage of a measure now pending before the new york state legislature. it would prevent the use by any sst of any airport facilities in the new york area. without such privileges. there will be no sst. let the forces lobbying on behalf of this incredibly brazen project be aware that this is not isolated opposition they face. the harder they flght.the greater the forces they rouse in opposition to the entire range of attacks upon the environment. americans have passed the point of no return in regard to awareness of the finite nature of clean air. water. and other irreplaceable resources. future ssts and any other projects similar to it will have to run the same gauntlet. those struggling on behalf of the environment and a restructuring of priorities have tasted victory again and again in recent months. we shall not rest until we have turned this particular parade around. let those who are immediately affected take note. mr. chairman. under the circumstances. i shall cast my vote against any further subsidy for the sst.","mr. chairman. anyone can take a copy of the congressional directory and look up the 19th district for ohio. in it. he will find the following: michael joseph kirwan. democrat. of youngstown. ohio. elected to the 75th and each succeeding congress. and that is all. to an outsider. this scant commentary would appear puzzling. but to those who knew mike kirwan. it is testimony. in itself. to the fact that mike was as humble as a saint. indeed. he probably is talking to st. patrick right now. one indication of his humility is that he never forgot his beginnings. it would not be hard to believe that horatio alger modeled his story. \"only an irish boy.\" after mike kirwan. he had to quit school while still a child and as far as i know. he never received an academic degree. which he didnt need anyway. anybody can obtain an academic degree. which requires normal intelligence and effort. but mike went far beyond that in his dedicated service to the nation. and this is amply expressed by the number of honorary degrees conferred upon him. there are enough there to make any professor blush with envy. mike was always cheerful. pleasant. friendly and kind to everyone. he could be found working both early and late. but always working. he served the america he loved. as a true leader would. he had the unique gift of personality to be elected and reelected to congress so many times. he was a religious man with a profound awareness of his duties to both men and god. mike would not bow before the poll takers to find out what to do. instead. he would look at the needs of the people and pray to his god for guidance. he was rigorous in his attendance at church and one time when sheer physical distance was too great. he called upon one of the newest of inventions. a helicopter. to take him from the midst of a forest to one of the oldest of services. the mass. may god give us more public servants like this. i considered it one of the continuing highlights of my career that i was able to work with mike kirwan as a fellow subcommittee chairman on the public works program. many americans in future generations will not know whom to thank for the benefits they will receive from reclamation. flood control. waterways. and harbor improvement. i am here to tell you that mike kirwan worked long and hard to insure that we would bequeath to future generations a conserved america and not a squandered one. when mike submitted a bill. you could be sure that it was well thought out. i recall it was 2 years ago when congress paid a warm and spontaneous tribute to mike kirwan on his then approaching 81st birthday. we heard frank and sincere tributes paid to this humble man that filled up over 30 pages of the through the record for a good 50 years before you could even begin to find the likes of it. and you would have to go a good ways back before you could find another man like mike kirwan. among the many photos that mike used to have in his office. there were two that seemed to typify his life and lifes workone was a picture taken in 1900 of some young children looking ragged as they carried their lunch pails on the way to the mine in the days before the child labor laws. there was another picture taken in 1950 and this time. the young children had bright faces. were wearing decent clothes and were on their way to school. mike kirwan was. in large part. responsible for that transition. it was through his untiring efforts and fair play that the doors of opportunity were opened wider to greater numbers of americans. both poor and affluent. that greater numbers of people were allowed to share in the good things of this lifeeducation. material progress. and general wellbeing. mike kirwan sowed that others might reap. let us all take special note that mike kirwan grew wise with age. but did not grow old. hopefully. this is an example that all of us will follow. we. in congress. shall miss him and the country shall feel his loss. our prayers and sympathy go to his family.","mr. speaker. during the recent hearings held by the committee on public works. we were appalled to learn of the incredible shortage of personnel trained in the field of water quality control. this shortage of trained personnel is to be found at all levels. from operators of sewage treatment plants through postgraduate engineers and scientists. we were equally distressed to learn. mr. speaker. that the water pollution control act is not achieving the purpose which congress intended. in great part because of this lack of personnel. unless this sounds overly dramatic. i would point out that we can build all the sewage treatment plants that we are capable of constructing. yet without the operators to rake bar racks. to clean the grit chambers. to skim the settling tanks. to operate the digestors. to regulate operation in accordance with flow and season. to draw off sludge. to run the laboratory tests necessary to determine control. and the thousand and one other tasks that a treatment operator must supervise. these plants will be useless. testimony before our committee indicated that there are many now that have been closed down because of lack of personnel and many others that are operating it far below design efficiency because of lack of training of the personnel now on duty. it has become clear to us that determined action should be taken to provide the nation with personnel capable of carrying out the programs that congress has concluded are necessary if we are not to drown in our own filth. we must act to provide these personnel at all levels as quickly as possible. accordingly. mr. speaker. i have attempted to determine the causes of this problem. while they are complex. it is clear that in order to have trained personnel active in the field. aid must be made available to those who might be inclined to enter this field. there are certain statutes now in effect. which. to a very great extent. help the institutions that have been developed for the training of water quality control personnel. my investigation. for example. has revealed an area in which help is necessary immediately. those who would become sewage treatment plant operators and supervisory personnel find themselves unable to attend the institutions which have been developed. and which are now being developed. dedicated to the teaching of this art. the reason is that they cannot afford to take the time to go to school because they have no other sources of income. this bill would provide for stipends where necessary to be paid to these individuals when properly certified by approved institutions. and. in this manner. would encourage those who have an interest in the field to complete the studies necessary. further. it provides assistance for those individuals who wish to study technical aspects of water quality controlengineers. ecologists. bacteriologists. and technicians who now turn their eyes toward more profitable areas of endeavor by helping them obtain the training in this field. mr. speaker. this is but a very necessary first step in making available to the nation the corps of trained citizens without whom all the authorizations. appropriations. and acts of congress would be meaningless. for if we do not have the people- who can do the work. our words here have little significance. and our actions in this chamber playacting. therefore. mr. speaker. i urge all the members of this body to consider this measure among the most important to the wellbeing of every citizen of our country and to lend their support to this bill for. indeed. i am convinced that without it we will expire in our own excrement.","mr. speaker. under leave to extend my remarks. i

chairman. who can deny that the federal government has a responsibility to the victims of floods and other natural disasters? while we have spent billions on flood prevention and emergency relief. it is not enough. a national program of flood insurance at reasonable rates against losses to private and small business dwellings should be enacted. for that matter. additional hundreds of billions should be spent in our cities. social security should better reflect the increased cost of living and perhaps dental care should be available under medicare. billions should be spent for a strong antiballistic missile system. while our small farmers should receive increased prices for the fruits of their labor. the list is endless. we have other responsibilities also. we have the responsibility to set priorities. to realize that the level of taxation has yet to reach that which would bring us to the threshold of the millennium. we are in the midst of the great flscal debate of 1967. some of us say expenditure reduction must come first. others promise that reductions will be made after taxes are increased. those of our citizens who are looking on with interest might ask whether that fine truman expression has been changed to. \"if you cant stand the heat. shove the other guy into the kitchen.\" out of this debate. however. has come a call for action from the chairman of the committee on ways and means that few will challenge: what is required is a clearcut acknowledgrnent by all of us who participate in federal policymaking that our objective is establishing firm control over the amount and character of federal spending in the future. for this purpose. spending cuts this year are not the basic ingredient. welcome as they will be. what is essential. rather. is change in spending programs. we have to focus sharply on what the government is to do as well as on how much it is to spend. nothing in this bill. in the committee report. or the executive communications accompanying the legislation reveals how much the federal government will be called upon to spend in connection with the proposed national flood insurance act of 1967. in this regard. passage of s. 1985 would constitute a clear violation of the intent of public law 801 of the 84th congress which states that a statement of the 5year total cost as well as the manyears of additional federal civilian employment shall accompany each report. recommendation. or other november. 1. 1967 communication from the executive branch recommending proposed legislation entailing expenditure of appropriations in excess of $1 million. indeed. not only are we kept in the dark. with regard to the cost of s. 1985. but by going the \"backdoor spending\" route we have failed to provide present or future congressional control. section 106 provides that the secretary of housing and urban development \"is authorized to issue to the secretary of the treasury from time to time and have outstanding at any one time. in an amount not exceeding $500 millionor such greater amount as may be approved by the presidentnotes or other obligations.\" in short. the national flood insurance fund may tap the treasury for $500 million. or for billions more. we do not know. a short note from secretary weaver to secretary fowler substitutes for going to the appropriations committee in order to justify such additional amounts. at a time when we are criticizing the administration for maintaining three or four sets of budget books. the congress should not engage in several methods of authorizing and appropriating funds. while i disagree with the backdoor approach. i can well understand the uncertainties as to eventual related costs that dictated such a course. this is not the first attempt by congress to enact flood insurance legislation. in 1956 the congress enacted the federal flood insurance act of 1956public law 1016. 84th congress. to quote from the testimony of under secretary wood before our committee: the program proposed under the 1956 legislation reflected the belief of competent insurance experts. at that time. that actuarial rates for flood insurance could not be determined. when the federal flood indemnification administration. established by the 1956 legislation. submitted to the congress a request for program funds to operate the flood insurance program. it presented a rate structure which did not reflect the variations in risk in different locations in a flood plain. in other words. there was no presentation as to what the actuarial rate would have to be in any particular area in which inrurance would be made available. lacking an adequate case as to the actuarial premium required to cover losses. the house appropriations committee concluded that there was no adequate basis for the rate schedule proposed by the federal flood indemnification administration. no way of measuring the governments contingent liability. and that further study of the feasibility of flood insurance was required. no funds to operate the program were appropriated. and the program became dormant. referring to the bill before us as avoiding the weaknesses of the 1956 law. under secretary wood on page 10 of the committee hearings said: a major assumption of the proposed national flood insurance program is that actuarial premium rates can and will be established before insurance is offered. this procedure must be followed if the program is to overcome the reservations of the congress to the program abandoned a decade ago. the actuarial premium required to cover losses must be known before reasonable estimates can be made of the contingent subsidy liability of the government in connection with lessthanactuarial rate premiums charged to owners of existing homes in highrisk areas. in order to meet the objectives of actuarial soundness. it is necessary to compile and analyze flood frequency data in individual flood plain areas and establish rates by zones and types of structures. this has to be done on an areabyarea basis. since flood damage risks vary from one area to another. it should be emphasized that in referring to the bill before us. under secretary wood testified that \"a major assumption\" of the program is that actuarial rates \"can and will be established before insurance is offered.\" this amounts to a frank admission that such rates have not as yet been established. moreover. that portion of the flood insurance premiums to be subsidized by the federal government pursuant to section 215 of the bill cannot and will not be known until those who sell the insurance gain some experience as to the amount people voluntarily are willing to pay for such protection. or until such determination is made through a much more comprehensive market research study than has been conducted to date. furthermore. section 104 of the bill. entitled \"estimates of premium rates.\" authorizes the secretary of housing and urban development to commence a broad series of studies and investigations in conjunction with other agencies of government aimed at establishing flood insurance rates and \"the extent to which federally assisted or other floor protection measures initiated after the enactment of the bill affect the estimates of these rates.\" surely the authority contained in this section alone reveals how little is known as to the eventual cost of the program. it is this uncertainty regarding the extent of government liability under the program that makes me so apprehensive. the absence of estimates determined with a reasonable degree of certainty prompts me to suggest one of two alternatives: first. delay in the enactment of the program until better estimates have been provided. supported by appropriate data. of the immediate and projected cost of the program. or second. establishment within the legislation and the program of an effective maximum liability and exposure of the federal government. but because neither the congress nor the department of housing and urban development have sufficient data or experience with which to settle upon such a statutory ceiling of maximum exposure of government in the bill before us. the regular congressional control over the appropriations to the national flood insurance fund takes on added importance. if we approve the bill before us without change. other than appropriations for administrative costs. salaries. and repayments to the fund under section 107. there will be no effective congressional review. we are today voting to appropriate $500 million. or such greater sums as may be approved by the president. mr. chairman. it is a blank check to embark upon a program. the cost of which nobody knows. at the appropriate time. i shall offer an amendment that would at least cure this situation. it is not a joyous task to point out the weaknesses of legislation aimed at alleviating the suffering and heartbreak that occurs in the wake of floods. i hope a flood insurance program such as the one here proposed will be enacted into law. but i feel congress must be provided with reasonably comprehensive cost data before it is asked to embark on such an uncharted course. i do not urge opposition to this legislation but suggest the need for its improvement to the end that we reach the goal of national flood insurance protection at a pace consistent with prudent fiscal policy.","mr. president. latin america is on the threshold of a development breakthrough which it can crossor stumble overin the next 5 years.* the alliance for progress--midway in its 10year lifespanis within sight of success. yet it could be also within sight of failure. the future of latin america is balanced on a razors edge. that was the lesson brought home to me during my 2week tour through four key latin american nations which ended last sunday. as a member of the u.s. delegation to the interamerican economic and social council meeting in buenos aires. march 25 to april 1. and as a result of visits before and after the meeting. i was privileged to confer with the presidents of peru. chile. argentina. and brazil as well as national government figures. business and labor leaders. students. and educators in each of these countries. as a result of these conversations and of the discussions at the interamerican economic and social council meeting. i should like to report the following observations to the senate: first. whether or not latin america can successfully walk the razors edge across the development threshold depends in large part on whether or not civilian. democratically elected governments there can give enough satisfaction in time to the peoples demands for economic. social. and political justice to avoid communist takeovers or the substitution of the military for the civilian authority. i conclude that they can do so. but that this will require a shift of emphasis to greater measures of selfhelp and mutual cooperation in multinational projects among the latin american members of the alliance. as well as continued and perhaps even more effective support of the alliance by the united states. second. the castro communist movement has met with utter failure on the south american continent. this is not to say that there is not a communist threat or continuing castrosponsored efforts at subversion. because there are. but castro is no longer a hero and his personality no longer is capable of being a charismatic vehicle for communism. i feel that castros attempt to subvert the governments of latin america hasfailed primarily because of the growing strength of the democratic process and because of castros own abject failures at home. although castro still poses a threat of subversion. he has found that his greatest obstacle is true democracy under law. the strong and prompt reaction throughout the hemisphere against the insolent resolutions of castros recent trcontinental conference in havanna was striking evidence of his bungling arrogance and of the failure of his cuban model of a communist state to persuade others that it is the promised land they wish to emulate. third. while u.s. involvement in the dominican republic did not seem at this time to be a cause of great concern in the capitals i visited. it is a barrier to greater progress in strengthening the oas as a peacekeeping agency for the americas. however. i feel that there is now greater awareness among latin american leaders that only in strengthening the effectiveness and ability of the oas to act in crises will we be able to prevent a repetition of this kind of occurrence. fourth. there is genuine and widespread concern among many elements of the latin american community over u.s. involvement in vietnam. this concern. in my judgment. is based on two points: first. that vietnam involvement might reduce our support of and interest in the alliance for progress. and. second. that inflation. induced by vietnam expenditures. could limit our capability to support our part of the alliance agreements. i endeavored to give reassurances on that score. speaking. of course. only as one senator interpreting what i sensed to be u.s. opinion. i said that. in my judgment. most americans consider the hemisphere to be the home front and that vietnam has made us even more alert to the importance of the security and progress of latin america. on the subject of inflation. i pointed out that. in my judgment. there was a very strong opinion in the united states in favor of a modest tax increase if necessary to head off inflation. and that this demonstrated our determination on that subject. fifth. while the economic and social efforts of democratic regimes were encouraging. the fact that a number of latin american countries still lack constitutional. democratic governments is a cause of real concern. nine military coups have occurred in latin america since early 1962. although none in the last 2 yearsa fact for which i feel the alliance deserves some credit. it may be argued convincingly that not every one of these takeovers was necessarily undesirable. this grave question had been raised in brazil where there was a widespread feeling that a military takeover had been necessary to thwart an imminent threat of seizure of dictatorial power with the connivance and in the interests of international communism. on my trip. i could not see in any country of latin america a similar threat today of successful subversion by externally orientated forces. but. whatever the emergency and however transitional may be the entry of the military into the political affairs of some latin american countries. in their totality such coups are generally a manifestation of continued political instability. and political instability has become increasingly damaging to latin american economic and social development and to prospects for increased private investment. i stated in latin america. and i state now that as a permanent policy. i believe that collective consultation among the members of the organization of american states should determine whether to defer the establishment of diplomatic relations with. and deny military and economic aid to. any regime brought into power in a member state by the overthrow of a duly elected. constitutional. democratic government. certainly. such collective actionsay. by a twothirds or even a threefourths votecan bring about the earliest commitment for the restoration of constitutional government. for the holding of free elections and for the reapplication of human and civil rights and liberties. within a reasonable time. we shall have this opportunity to put some such system into effect at the third special interamerican conference which will meet in buenos aires in july. to consummate what happened in the interamerican economic and social council last week. and what happened in panama with respect to the revision of the oas charter. i regret to say that canada is not participating in those negotiations. because i think canada ought to be in the organization of american states as a major trading and political factor in the hemisphere. my sixth conclusion refers to the private enterprise system. of which i know something about. both as a lawyer and as one deeply interested in business. sixth. the private enterprise system dominates the economy of latin america. and it is. of course. very much in the interests of freedom that this should be the successful economic order there. it is the salient developing area in the world where private enterprise has an opportunity to make a success in the development of its society. i speak with feeling for that reason. because i think we can do so much there. more than anywhere else in the developing areas of the world. which includes africa. the middle east. and asia. i have seen. however. disquieting evidencealbeit with some notable exceptionsthat a considerable segment of private enterprise in latin america has not learned the lessons that u.s. private enterprise has learned in the last 35 years. the primary lesson is that business. to be successful and socially viable must be conducted \"in the public interest\" and should. as far as practical. be the subject of the broadest practical. mutual ownership through shareholding. in too many cases in latin america. i found a lack of understanding of the relationship between reasonable prices and living wages as the base for social stability and increased consumption. and a lack of appreciation of the effect on production and prices of increased competition and the rationalization of production which could come through a common market. i found. too. a lack of awareness that business had a responsibility in respect of housing. education. and health. i found certain builtin opposition to land reform without the offering of responsible alternatives. i found. too. some reluctance to adopt new and necessary techniques. as. for example. in the legislation for mixed businessgovernment accelerated development of chiles copper resources which has had a hard time being enacted. a fact which has cost chile at least a year in getting started on this great historic project. i feel that american business leadership can be of tremendous importance in helping to revise these attitudes of private business in latin america where they exist. and in helping latin american business to move toward the essential reforms so urgently required there. this leadership can be manifested through the great business associations which are represented in the americas and by the leadership and example of the many american firms which have branches. agencies. and affiliates throughout latin america. one of the most heartening developments in my judgment. on the latin american scene is the growth of the adela investment co.. which i had the honor to initiate. it is already becoming a potent force in the private sector toward the attainment of the goals of latin american economic integration. it is making a great contribution to strengthening private enterprise in latin america and its capability of serving the people. in operation little over 1 . year. adela has already approved $22 million in equity investments in 27 companies in 13 latin american countries. this investment is estimated to have generated $100 million in new investment for needed production and employment. i hope to assist adela in expanding its resources and in strengthening its role as an enlightened progressive force in the latin american business community. u.s. business could well be inspired by the job which is being done by the aflcio in the training of trade union leadership through the american institute for free labor developmentaifldprogram. some of the most inspiring moments i had on this trip were spent with training classes in buenos aires and sdo paulo where national trade union leaders were studying. similarly. i also had inspiring moments with the progressive business leaders who are represented among the private business communities in each of the countries which i visited. seventh. the alliance for progress. in the first half of its life. has been successful in defusing many explosive situations in many latin american nations. in this way. it must certainly be regarded as a success. these gains. however. do not represent yet the breakthrough necessary to satisfy the growing and just demands of the peoples of the americas. they do not yet represent the breakthrough now possible in terms of the resources. technology. and techniques available in the western world. it is understandable that during the first 5 years of the alliance. political problems and the problems of getting started should have placed greater emphasis on external aid by us. this phase is now properly at an end. i am confident that u.s. aid will continue on the same order of magnitude as heretofore. but selfhelp should be the keynote of the second 5 years. i gave my audiences my interpretation of the feeling of the people of the united states on this matter. i said that i personally was convinced that the american people will determine the extent of their support of the alliance by the success of selfhelp efforts in latin america. a group of students in slo paulo questioned me closely on this topic and i said that the united states has no desire to pay the bills for social welfare programs which should be supported through the governments. by the propertied and business people of latin america. of course. we cannot tellnor do we have any desire to tellany nation what form its government should take. so long as it is free. but we do have the right to expect that governments with which we propose to be associated or which we propose to help. should secure social and economic justice. free expression. and selfdetermination for their own people. in short. we have a right to say \"let us hope that youre going to do the maximum to help yourself as we have tried to help you.\" the multinational approach to selfhelp has been a subject of discussion and statements at interamerican conferences for many years without substantial results. i would therefore urge that before the end of this year a summit conference of latin american presidents be convened not only for the purpose of considering these problems. but to make basic decisions in several fields which i consider to be essential to meaningful progress in accelerated latin american development. indeed. i am glad to say. at the buenos aires meeting. argentina already offered just such a proposal. among the key subjects that should be discussed are the following: . first. the formation of an interamerican communications system utilizing communications satellites. such a system would represent a dramatic breakthrough not only in the field of telephone and telex communication between north and south america and among participating south american countries. but also in the field of television. there is already widespread interest in the establishment of such a system among leaders of the countries i have visited. particularly as a means to improve twoway contact between the peoples of the united states and latin america through the televising of educational sports. cultural and political events in our respective countries. and as a means to tap the enormous resources of colleges and universities for aiding economic and social development. the establishment of such a satellite communication system is technically within our grasp. by the fall of this year. nasa will put into orbit a communications satellite in support of the apollo program which will have the capability of television transmission between north and south america. by the end of next year the communications satellite corp. will have socalled global satellites which will have capability for simultaneous telephone. telex. and television transmission not only between north and south america but over europe and japan. the decision must now be made at the highest level to establish this interamerican communications system at the earliest opportunity with the close cooperation and support of the private sector in latin america and the united states. second. the development of hydroelectric power through multinational projects including reclamation. flood control. and irrigation. this multinational effort is particularly applicable to the interior of south americathe most underdeveloped areatouching brazil. peru. bolivia. paraguay. colombia. and venezuela. i found great interest on the part of president belaunde of peru. president frei of chile. and president astello branco of brazil. in such projects. a beginning has already been made in this area. let me cite some examples: paraguay. brazil. and argentina are involved in a small joint hydroelectric power venturethe acaray project. construction has already started on this project and which upon completion will generate 40.000 kilowatts of electricity. yet it will double the power available in paraguay and will provide much needed electrical power in a neighboring region of argentina. the project costs $25 million and is being financed from loans from the interamerican bank and european private sources. brazil and paraguay have under serious consideration a 10 million kilowatt hydroelectric project on the parana river. which forms a border between the two countries. if constructed. this would be the largest hydroelectric project of the world. costing in excess of $1 billion. another project with great potential benefit for peru and surrounding countries is the pampas de olmos project. this project has great importance to peru as a means to irrigate large tracts of agricultural land and to produce 120.000 kilowatts of electricity. the estimated cost of this project is $180 million. feasibility studies financed by the united nations special fund and the peruvian government are scheduled for completion by the end of this month. in addition to a communication system through satellites and multinational power projects. there are still a number of things which can be done. which a latin american presidents conference should consider. third. the development of transportation with multinational impact. the interamerican bank has recently approved a $25.5 million loan to construct a road between asuncion. paraguay. and the port of paranagua in brazil. and to improve the port itself. the interamerican bank has also under consideration a loan application for construction of a road through the andes to improve a major artery between valparaiso. chile. and buenos aires. these are but examples of projects that could be handled multinationallywhich should be handled multinationallyto give latin american economic integration real meaning. fourth. the expansion of an interamerican fund for feasibility studies of multinational projects. the president of the interamerican bank. the chairman of ciapthe interamerican committee for the alliance for progressand the secretarygeneral of the oas. have already made proposals along these lines. it is my understanding that this will be on the agenda of the forthcoming meeting of the board of governors of the interamerican bank between april 25 to 29 in mexico city. president johnson last august. and again in his foreign aid message last january. indicated u.s. support of such a fund. and assistant secretary lincoln gordon underscored u.s. support for this fund at the iaecosoc conference last week. it is my understanding that between $40 and $50 million will be needed initially. the money will be contributed by the bank. by the united states. and hopefully. by european sources. in view of the critical importance of this fund in furthering the progress of economic integration. i believe that the united states and other developed countries should provide whatever assistance is necessary to make this project for multinational planning for multinational projects in latin america effective. the fifth and final conclusion relates to the transformation of the 10country latin american free trade association into a latin american common market. the idea of such a market is a logical and necessary sequel to these multinational projects. which i have described. it is becoming more evident each day that the resolution of latin americas economic problems can best be effected within the framework of a genuine latin american common market. within which goods. persons. and capital can move more freely. with the emergence of a common external tariff. and a phased. acrosstheboard reduction of tariffs on intraregional trade. there would emerge in such an arrangement a mass market of 220 million people with a combined annual gross national product of between $70 and $80 billion. $18 billion in annual foreign trade. and $2.5 billion in gold and foreign exchange reserves. while a latin american common market was endorsed by the rio conference of foreign ministers last november. there is little indication that either the governments or the business community in latin america is prepared to make the necessary decisions that would bring about the creation of such a market in the foreseeable future. the decision. therefore. must be made at the highest political level. that is why i refer to it as an urgent matter for inclusion on the agenda of a summit meeting of the presidents of the countries of latin america. in this connection. a major question that i met with on this trip was why the united states does not give tariff preferences to latin american commodities like the eec does to the former african territories of its members. i pointed out that the united states is fighting for more liberal and not more restrictive world trade and that it was much better for latin america to free the markets of europe than to restrict the markets of the united states. i also pointed out that the creation of a latin american common market could form the basis for a hemispheric free trade area for at least raw materials from latin america which would fit into the framework of liberalized world trade and the rules of the general agreement on tariffs and trade. both the panama conference and the interamerican economic and social council session in buenos aires have now been concluded with disappointing results. it is essential that we do not slacken our efforts to find a new basis for reaching agreement with our neighbors to the south and that we do not lose sight of the fact that we need each other. what i have endeavored to do in this report is to stateon the basis of my personal observations--what needs to be done. mr. president. i repeat what i said at the very outset: latin america is the \"home front\" for the united states and offers enormous opportunities. it can be the first underdeveloped region of the world to break through to development. mexicos example demonstrates that such a breakthrough can be achieved. to do it will take heroic effort and hard decisions by the latin american nations themselves. especially by the business community of latin america in cooperation with the continued efforts. interest. good will. resources. and friendship of the united states and of the business community here. i have uttered these words in the hope that they will have been uttered in time to bring about these most desirable results. of course. i shall not stop here but shall. as i have been continuously. be working on projects with great specificity in an effort to forward the objectives of our nation in respect to the whole western hemisphere. mr. president. i ask unanimous consent that three of the speeches i made on this trip as well as several articles and an editorial relating to last weeks panama conference and the meetings of the interamerican economic and social council in buenos aires be printed in the record at this point.","mr. speaker. joe martin. who writes a column for chicago community newspapers entitled \"vets press.\" says things well. briefly. and to the point. as a commentator on matters of especial interest to war veterans and with deep patriotic undertones. he probably enjoys the largest reading audience in the chicago area. his editorial commemorating the inauguration of the great emancipator appears in the mount greenwood express. and other publications of the southwest messenger press chain and is here reproduced: vets press (by joe martin) one hundred years ago. an inauguration took place 6n the steps of the nations capitol. the city of washington shivered wet and cold that day in 1865. an equally tangible gloom was generated by the last months of the civil war. the president rose to speak. waves of cheering flooded the capitol plaza. and as if by prearrangement. the sun broke through the daylong overcast. abraham lincoln. our 16the president. delivered his last address. six weeks later he was dead. assassinated by a man who loved the confederacy. on this inauguration day he gave to us a timeless message. one that is well to recall today. it expresses the continuum of american government and the responsible philosophy it embraces: \"with malice toward none.. with charity for all. with firmness in the right as god gave us to see the right. let us strive on to finish the work we are in.\" we are inevitably struck by the solemn significances of those words. our minds wander back over history. and we ponder the short but unwavering narrative of american government. despite its youth. our political experience has drawn the respect of the major part of the world. not because of military might. nor because of economic achievement. rather. we bear this international credit because of our democratic example before the world. it is a record that invites study. it has been achieved by a united nation perpetuated by a man whom the world generally reveres as one of the foremost of all americans. the great emancipators uniamericanlsm of a century ago continues into the future to give our nation inspiration and guidance. it was lincolns firm belief that the things for which he labored were achievable goals. one of these objectives. the most pressing of his era. was achievedthe goal of a united country where all men are free. as citizens of this great state of illinois. where abraham lincoln got his political start. we should all honor his birthday with appropriate observances and sentiment. on february 12. 1965. the flag of the united states of america should fly from every home. factory. office. and civic building. today americans should honor and love abe lincoln for what he did 100 years ago. a962 austin. tex.: historic past. dynamic present","mr. president. when the house committee on appropriations reported out h.r. 10809. the appropriations bill for the departments of labor and health. education. and welfare and related agencies. it deleted a request from the public health service for $1.5 million which would have been an initial appropriation for the establishment of an environmental health center presumably to be located in the area of the district of columbia. the house. when it passed the bill last april. wisely sustained the committee action. the house committee report commenting on this disallowance stated: as has happened in connection with past requests for this facility (or these facilities. as the case may be) the committee was presented with a considerable amount of confused and indecisive information. at the time the public health service testified on this item. they were not able to tell the committee where the facility or facilities would be located if congress appropriated the funds. i strongly urge that the senate appropriations committee and the senate concur with the house action on this item. i believe that an appropriation of any amount of money for such a facility in the district of columbia area is not only premature at this time. but unwise at any time. in view of the civil defense recommendations for federal decentralization and the fact that the proposal is vague and in a state of confusion. the uncertainty over just what the plans of the public health service are concerning this proposed environmental health center is well stated in an article published in the july 1964 issue of science magazine. this article reads in part: new dimension of public health activity figures in the controversy over location of the environmental health center proposed for the washington area by phs. the proposals vicissitudes in congress and what from the outside appears to be phs uncertainty on just what kind of center it wants. leave it a matter of speculation as to whether the installation would be an administrative headquarters or a center for basic research on problems of environmental health. mr. president. the center of activity in environmental health research is now in the city of cincinnati. ohio. in the environmental health center. which is the initial institution in which this research is done. it was chosen as the center for this activity because of: first. its position on the ohio river. second. its health problems as a metropolitan area. third. its location in an industrial area where the source of many of its subjects of research are found. fourth. its facilities providing higher education in health matters. fifth. its special facilities for pilot plant operations for water and waste treatment. for pilot scale work on milk processing equipment and for air pollution. for pilot scale work on auto exhaust research. incineration. and air cleaning. and sixth. its supporting laboratories for physics. chemistry. microbiology. and aquatic biology. above all. the environmental research center in cincinnati is not just a local or regional federal installation. it serves all states and is a national facility and an important one. mr. president. i ask unanimous consent that the article published in the july 1964 issue of science magazine. entitled \"environmental health.\" to which i referred previously be printed at this point in the record.","mr. chairman. as i rise here i am reminded of the wornout story of the man who was asked how he felt when he saw his motherinlaw drive his brandnew uninsured cadillac off the cliff. he answered that he had mixed emotions. i have mixed emotions about this bill. but i support it because i think it is necessary. i think we will phase out this program. i think it will not be with us very much longer. but i do not want to see it done with a meat ax. just 4 years ago 427.000 mexican nationals came in under this program. how many last year? only 194.000. we are phasing it out. it is down more than half in just these 4 years. i do not think we will have any extension beyond the 2 years we are trying to get today. if we are successful in getting it. i think a lot of the arguments against thisand they are sincere. i feel deeply the emotions my friend from san antonio expressesbut a lot of opposition is from people who have not seen the bracero program. i want to talk to some of my city friends who are somewhat emotional against this. i share with them the concern about 5 million americans being unemployed. you say. \"how in the world can you justify bringing these mexican nationals across the border to do this to your own people? how can you do it when americans are hungry and do not have jobs?\" the short answer is that you are not going to help americans by killing this legislation today. you think it will but you will not. i share the concern about the american migrant worker. we must do something for him. if. we can get constructive migrant labor legislation i will support it. it is a shame that in this great. prosperous country with cars in every garage for most of us. good food. paid vacations. television. and all the rest thatwe have left this small number of americans at the bottom of the economic totem pole. these people have a right to their share of our general prosperity. the farmers who grow oranges. beets. tomatoes. peas. and the other crops did not cause the migrant labor problem. the bracero program did not cause the plight of the migrant workers. the problem was here before the bracero program and it will still be here tomorrow even if we vote this program down today. we are told that defeat of this bill will make jobs for americans. we are told that this program depresses the wages in the farm industry. it does not. in the time i have i am going to discuss a couple of these points. my friends who oppose this program cannot have it both ways. they tell you in one breath it is just 1 percent of the farms that use braceros. therefore. it is a subsidy and we should do away with it. in the next breath they tell you that using braceros on 1 percent of our farms has depressed wages all over the country. i submit they cannot have it both ways. the gentleman from texas made another important point. let me tell you about the wetbacks. i have the whole mexican border from yuma to douglas in my districtabout 400 miles of it. do you know in 1955 how many mexican people came illegally across the border looking for work? there were a million of thema million mexicans in 1 year were rounded up by the immigration service. we had some disgraceful things happen. we did have mexicans deported way down to the interior of mexico when they came across several timesthere were a million of them. last year. how many came across? because we had an orderly program to utilize mexicans who wanted to work where they were really needed and where they would not displace american workersnot a million came last year but only 30.000just 30.000. you will have a flood of wetbacks again if we cannot phase this out in a somewhat orderly fashion. now let us get another thing straight here. you would think from the arguments that you are going to hear that a farmer in his airconditioned house picks up the telephone and says. \"please send me one gross of mexican workers.\" and that they shortly arrive in a bus. that is not the case. you cannot get mexican workers in this program unless you satisfy the secretary of labor. he administers this. i do not think the migratory workers of america have any better friends than arthur goldberg and mr. willard wirtz who is now secretary. they hold the trump cards and they run the show. you get workers only when you have tried to find them yourself and you have satisfied the labor department people that you cannot find them. and after the employment agencies have tried to find them for you and cannot find them. you get them only when you are willing to pay wages that will not depress the wage standard in that area as determined by the secretray and only when you have paid for the transportation and only when workers are not available from any source. then. and only then. do you get them. and even then at that point when they go out in your field to work. if an american worker comes up and says he is ready. willing. and able to work. you are required to lay off the bracero and put the american worker on right then and there. these are facts which people who get emotional about this problem do not realize. i do not think that two wrongs make a right. we have done a wrong to our migratory workers. we should improve their condition. but we cannot help them by damaging the small farmer. we cannot help migratory workers by choking off the flow of strawberries and lettuce and vegetables to the eastern cities and raising the prices. doing a second wrong is not going to right the first wrong.","mr. speaker. the longrange program in which industry and government are working together to save helium now lost when natural gases containing it are burned as fuel is one of the most forwardlooking and commendable efforts ever made in the field of conservation. when the federal government acts to curb waste of a limited. irreplaceable resource. esential to the nations scientific and industrial progress. such action surely can be called worthwhile. when the governments program also manages to attract private capital at private risk. creates many new jobs for industry. stimulates the national economy. and brings rapid advances in technology. it can even be termed praiseworthy. but when this same program is so conceived and carried out that it accomplishes all of these things and also pays for itself in the process. then it must inevitably be rated close to ideal. the heliumconservation program is destined to achieve this. and more. it is my conviction. too. that the program is providing for the world an outstanding example of how industry and government can cooperate in an enterprise that is beneficial to both. and to the entire nation as well. consider what has already been accomplished. enabling legislation for the heliumconservation program was enacted by the 86th congress in september 1960. however. funds for the program did not become available until august 3 of the following year. on august 15only 12 days latersecretary of the interior stewart udall announced approval of the first longterm heliumpurchase contract between the departments bureau of mines and the helex co.. a subsidiary of northern natural gas co. within 90 days. three additional heliumpurchase agreements had been negotiated and approved. with cities service helex. inc.. national helium corp.-a panhandle eastern pipe line co.-national distillers &amp; chemical corp. subsidiaryand phillips petroleum co. the four 22year agreements to date have obligated all of the bureaus purchasing authority. originally limited by congress to $47.5 million worth of helium a year. at about the time these remarks are being madethat is. in little more than a year from the date of the first contracthelium from the helex co.s new extraction plant at bushton. kans.. will be on its way to the cliffside gasfleld. operated by the bureau of mines at amarillo. tex.. some 350 miles away. there. the helium conserved by the program will be stored underground until it is needed to meet future demands. building and equipping a multimilliondollar installation at bushton in a matter of months is remarkable enough. but is only one of a series of welltimed and carefully coordinated steps that have brought helium conservation to the verge of reality in a fantastically short time. besides the helex plant at bushton. four other heliumextraction plants are being builtand will be maintained and operatedby private industry under the contracts approved thus far. work is well along on all of these installations. as their scheduled operation dates indicate. two of the plants. under construction for phillips. in sherman county. and dumas. tex.. are expected to begin delivering helium in december. the national helium corp. plant near liberal. kans.. and the one being built by cities service helex at ulysses. kans.. are both due to go on stream next march. to get the crude helium from these five industrial plants to the cliffside gasfield with minimum delay and expense. the bureau of mines arranged for construction of a 430mile pipeline system running north from cliffside to a terminus near bushton. this line. designed by william bros. of tulsa. okla.. and built under two construction schedules by groninger &amp; king of pampa. tex.. and r. h. fulton &amp; co.. of lubbock. tex.. is all but complete. the main section already has been laid and is ready to receive helium from the bushton plant. laterals that will connect the main line to the other new plants are being installed while i am speaking. between october 1961. when the designengineering firm was selected. and midjuly 1962. when the main section of the line was completed. the bureau advertised and awarded more than 90 contracts totaling over $4.2 million. on items ranging from telemetering and flowrecording equipment to pipeline wrapping. paint. and milepost markets. these were in addition to the two construction contracts. the speed with which the heliumconservation program has moved forward is a tribute to the care that was taken in planning it. the department of the interior realized. for example. that the price of helium would have to be increased to make the program selfliquidating. accordingly. the price of the element f.o.b. the bureaus plants was raised from $19 per thousand cubic feet to $35. this price. calculated on the basis of present and anticipated demand. will enable the bureau to pay back in 25 years. with interest. all funds that must be borrowed from the treasury to purchase helium during the early years of the conservation program. thus. the users of helium will pay the costs involved in insuring the continued availability of this valuable substance. foresight has characterized the heliumconservation program from its inception. it was foresight that made the department and members of congress from helium areas recognize the urgent need for prompt action to conserve the relatively small percentages of helium being lost in natural gases serving fuel markets. after all. the helium content of these gases average only about onehalf of 1 percent. and the governments own helium plants in the southwest already are producing more than enough to satisfy present requirements. where. then. was the justification for a largescale conservation effort? the answer. of course. is that half of 1 percent of the billions of cubic feet of heliumbearing gas now produced annually is an impressive figurerepresenting waste of approximately 4 billion cubic feet a year. or more than 9 times the amount of helium we now consume. and demand for helium has been increasing rapidly ever since world war ii. with no end to the upward trend in sight. in fact. essential uses for helium in electronics. nuclear energy. missiles and space exploration. and the growing field of cryogenics research promise to increase further the nations requirements. it was obvious that unless conservation began quickly. helium requirements could be expected to exceed supply as early as 1985. hence. immediate efforts were instituted to formulate legislation to meet the problem. the entire matter was originally heard by the mihes and mining subcommittee of the house committee on interior and insular affairs. of which i was chairman. the impressive facts that had been gathered together caused an awakening in the congress as to the need for conservation of such an essential resource. there was one strong school of thought to the effect that helium. wherever found. should be taken over by the government under the exercise of the right of eminent domain. this was based primarily upon the theory that helium would become an indispensable element in our defense structure and the space exploration activities. nevertheless. those of us who have long supported the basic free enterprise theory were successful in defeating moves to make this an allgovernment project. the development of the oil and gas business to its present worldleadership position is due to the exercise of private initiative and not government ownership. therefore. it is logical to assume that the proper development of our helium resources can be accomplished through the same route. experience in the heliumconservation program has refuted irrevocably those who would malign the natural gas industry as selfinterested and hungry for profits. the program has been implemented more rapidly. more efficiently. and at less cost to the taxpayer than would have been possible had the federal government attempted to go it alone. under contracts negotiated by the bureau of mines. the dynamic capabilities of a free industry in a free economy have come into full play. five private heliumextraction plants. incorporating technological advances undreamed of at the start of the program. are now nearing completion in less time than it would have taken the government to build one installation had it been forced to tackle the job by itself. this can be illustrated with a single example of the technological innovations that have been stimulated by the cooperative program: the helium plants built by bureau of mines during world war ii utilized multipleextraction units that could process only 21/2 million cubic feet of heliumbearing natural gas daily. the bureaus newest plant. which began operating at keyes. okla.. only 3 years ago in 1959. has three extraction units each capable of processing gas at the rate of 25 million cubic feet a day. in contrast. the private plants now in construction are designed to process between 400 and 500 million cubic feet of gas daily in a single extraction unit. i want to emphasize here that some of this advanced technology is so new that it is virtually untried on a commercial scale. of course. the companies incorporating it are confident that it will work. but if by any chance it does not. the companies themselves must invest whatever additional money is needed to make it work. they are taking the risk. not the government. under the present contracts. the government guarantees only to pay a fixed pricenegotiated separately with each company and depending on the helium content of the gas and the difficulty of extracting itfor the helium it receives. another advantage has been realized by having industry participate in the conservation effort. the terms of the purchase agreements now in effect provide private companies with maximum incentive to make adjustments in their natural gas operations that will enable them to process as much heliumbearing gas as possible. pipeline systems. for instance. might well be worth modifying if such modifications would mean increased efficiency in extracting helium for sale to the government. in this way. the fullest possible conservation of helium has been encouraged. many side benefits also have accrued from the program. hundreds of new jobs have been created. not only in the companies participating directly in helium conservation. but also in industries supplying structural materials and equipment for the new industrial plants. the scientific and technological progress resulting from the program can be expected to lead to additional improvements in processing and transporting natural gas and. possibly. to economic extraction of larger quantities of such desired products as propane. butane. and ethane. moreover. removal of inert heliumnitrogen. which is used in the lowtemperature heliumextraction processautomatically increases the capacity of pipelines to transport burnable hydrocarbons. finally. gas consumers no longer will have to pay for the transmission and distribution of a substance that has no value as a fuel. of course. helium could have been conserved without the gas industrys help. the bureau of mines could have paid the companies for the helium in fuel gases and then built its own plants to extract the element. under arrangements similar to those now governing helium production at four of the bureaus five helium installations. however. such a course would not have achieved the programs objectiveto obtain maximum conservation at minimum cost to the taxpayer. to attempt to save the quantities of helium that will be conserved through governmentindustry cooperation. the bureau would have had to expand its staff enormously. even then. the government could hardly hope to amass and concentrate efficiently the manpower and other resources that industry has poured into the program. from the very beginning. the most vital factor in helium conservation has been time. with every day that passed. more than 10 million cubic feet of an indispensable resource was being lost forever to the atmosphere. the saving of time has been industrys major contribution to the program. by cutting drastically the time that would have been required to get the conservation effort moving. industry has made it possible to conserve even more helium than was originally considered possible. furthermore. this saving has been accomplished at an extremely low cost. while much pride can be taken in the fact that great progress has been made over a relatively short period of time. it should be pointed out that the job is not finished. nor is it near completion. in the early analyses of the current situation. the department of the interior proposed the conservation of 52 billion cubic feet of helium in addition to meeting current demand to 1985. of this total. about 411/2 billion cubic feet will be saved at plants operating under purchase contracts already in effect. this means that 101/2 billion cubic feet remain to be conserved. perhaps even more if progress to date is any indication. so. our efforts must continue to the end that this country will not be caught short because of waste and lack of foresight. washington report","mr. speaker. i requested this special order today to discuss the residual fuel oil import control program. it is highly appropriate. i believe. for the house to focus attention upon this program at a time when the entire nation is concerned withour security. we all know that trying days are ahead. we have been put on notice by premier khrushchev that a major test of strength could occur over berlin this fall. even if the berlin crisis is resolved without resort to force. as we all hope. there will remain many serious problems in all parts of the world which threaten the peace. therefore. we have no alternative other than to see that our military position remains unassailable and that the national security be strengthened wherever possible. it is my conviction that the residual oil import control program is essential to national security. the program was instituted in march of 1959 by presidential proclamation because the president found. on the basis of reports from the office of civil and defense mobilization and a special cabinet committee. that imports of residual oil were coming into this country at such a rate as to threaten to impair the national security. in other words. mr. speaker. there was an official finding by the government. at the very highest level. that if imports were not held in check the capacity of the nation to defend itself in time of peril. such as we are facing today. could be seriously impaired. it seems to me that a determination such as this. involving the national security and emanating from the white house. cannot be ignored or taken lightly. it is a serious matter. yet. there are groups in this country which are demanding that all controls be lifted immediately and that unlimited imports of oil be permitted. this would be a highly dangerous course to follow. mr. speaker. and one the entire nation could live to regret. this is not the time to take any action to weaken our security posture. in time of crisis. the nation will have to depend upon domestic supplies of fuel to meet emergency needs. just as it always has. we cannot. with any degree of safety. base our mobilization plans upon the assumption that unlimited supplies of foreign oil would be available in times of emergency. we know from the bitter experience of world war ii that shipments of oil by oceangoing tanker are highly vulnerable to submarine attack. and in any future military action. we know the russians will have more and better submarines than the germans had at the beginning of the last war. and therefore. will be in a much stronger position than were the germans to disrupt our shipping. the only reasonable and safe course which those charged with protecting the nations security can follow is to see to it that there will be ample fuel available in this countrywhere it can be transported to points where it is needed without exposing it to attack by enemy action. to assume that the russian submarine force would not be a serious menace. and that foreign oil could continue to be imported in amounts sufficient to meet the greatly expanded emergency needs of the nation. would be an open invitation to national disaster. the residual fuel oil import control program is a part of wise mobilization planning. unlimited imports of residual fuel oil would play havoc with the domestic fuels industries. it is highly significant. mr. speaker. that domestic oil producers. and their organizations. favor stringent controls on residual oil. along with crude oil. the chief spokesman for removal of controls among the oil people are the international oil companies. they are the ones who produce the residual oil in foreign countries and they are the ones who are leading the fight for having controls taken off so they will have an unlimited market for a cheap. foreign produced product. i represent a major coal producing district. i have seen firsthand what imported residual fuel oil can do to coal markets on the east coast. it is taking over coal markets. if it should become available in unlimited amounts and at cutrate prices. we face the very distinct danger that the entire coal marketas much as 135 million tons a year in the east coastwill be lost completely to foreign residual oil. the loss of a market of this size would have a devastating effect on the coal industry. production would have to be cut back even further than it is today. there is serious doubt that many companies. denied this large and important east coast market. could continue to operate. the nation faces the sobering fact. mr. speaker. that if coal production is depressed any further. it is extremely doubtful that it could possibly expand production significantly or rapidly enough to meet emergency needs of the nation. we must remember that it will fall to the coal industry not only to meet any such expanded emergency needs but also to fill up the considerable fuels gap which would be caused by the cutting off of foreign oil shipments. this is a sizable order. in world wars i and ii the coal industry was able to step up production by as much as 200 million tons in a comparatively short time. but remember this fact: today we have a depressed coal industry. coal mines could not be maintained indefinitely on a standby basis even if the operating companies could afford the tremendous expense involved. the only way the nation can possibly insure that the coal producing capacity will be available when needed is to see to it that a market for coal is maintained during peacetime. the presidents special cabinet committee. which made a detailed study of the problem and its effect upon national security. recognized that unreasonable imports of residual fuel oil adversely affect the coal industrys ability to maintain production at safe levels. this committee said the coal industry must. and i quote. maintain a level of operation which will make possible expansion of output. end quote. that is why they recommended. and the president instituted. controls over residual fuel oil imports. the oil import controls program is a national security measure. mr. speaker. there is no question about this. an adequate supply of fuel is one of the nations most pressing wartime needs. the fuel must be immediately available. we cannot gamble on foreign oil getting through a submarine blockade in sufficient amounts to keep our defense plants operating at maximum levels. we cannot afford to have our vital defense industries mark time. once the foreign oil supplies are cut off. while we spend a lot of money and a lot of precious time. getting the neglected coal industry back into shape to operate at maximum productive capacity to meet the nations needs. a large segment of the vital east coast industrial complex. which accounts for about 40 percent of the nations economic activity. is already dangerously dependent upon foreign oil. we would not have to have a full scale military emergency for the full impact of this dangerous situation to affect the country. a political crisis in venezuela. or in some of the middle east countries. could just as effectively deny this residual oil to the east coast as would a war. if controls were to be removed. there would be a flood of foreign oil to the east coast. there would be extensive price cutting as the big international oil companies compete against each other for a lions share of the large industrial fuels market which they do not now control. all of this would mean that this vast east coast complex would become even more dependent upon foreign oil as a fuelso dependent. in fact. that any interruption in supply would bring about immediate shortages. an acute fuels shortage along the east coast. which under the conditions i have described above. could close vital defense plants and work a great hardship upon less essential consumers of foreign oil. would add to the emergency demands on the coal industry. i submit. mr. speaker. that those groups and individuals who are demanding an immediate end to all controls on residual fuel oil. had better pause in their campaign and think a little bit about the consequences of their proposed action. i hope and trust that we will never reach the stage in this great nation of ours that our ability to survive in time of crisis will be determined by outside sources. that is the direction in which the opponents of oil import controls would be pointing us if we get rid of controls. our ability to produce the sinews of war. to remain industrially strong over a long period and to provide the massive amounts of material which a modern war demands would. if these opponents of controls prevail. be decided by how much foreign oil we could import into the nation. they completely disregard the devastating effect excessive imports could have on our domestic fuels industries. particularly coal. the opposition to the residual fuel oil control program is concentrated in new england. the new england council has retained the wellknown international public relations firm of hill &amp; knowlton to spearhead the campaign to bring about the end of controls. personally. i believe the new england council and the good people of new england have been taken in by the international oil companies. aided and abetted by those few traffickers in residual oil who have seized the opportunity to make a few extra cents a barrel from their customers while placing the blame on a convenient whipping boythe import control program. the people of new england are being told constantly that the residual fuel oil control program is costing them millions of dollars each year. the national security aspects of the program are glossed over with a simple statement that controls and national security are not related in any way whatsoever. no authority is offered for this statement. which runs counter to official u.s. policy. we are asked to take the word of some press agent for this. those groups and individuals in new england who are determined to bring about an end to import controls contend that without controls they could buy residual oil a great deal cheaper. this is a lot of poppycock. i challenge anyone from new england to show me that the import controls program has been responsible for higher fuel costs to new england. i would like to remind them that the posted price for cargo or tanker lots of residual fuel oil in boston is today the same as it was in march of 1959just prior to the imposition of controls. the cargo price is the meaningful price. mr. speaker. if import controls had created shortages. as has been alleged. this fact would be reflected in a higher cargo price. but the posted cargo price today is $2.26 a barrelthe same as it was in march of 1959. and for 7 months during the control period. the posted cargo price was even lower than $2.26. these prices are a matter of record. they cannot be challenged. if there have been price increases in new england. they have been in prices for smaller lots. and these prices were fixed after the oil reached this country. these price increases would reflect increases in labor. transportation. or perhaps a greater profit for the importers and distributors. i mention these facts because the alleged increase in fuels costs for new england constitute the only arguments the big oil companies have been able to come up with for the lifting of controls. i do not believe the residual import control program has penalized new england. but even if it has added $10 million to the fuels costs of the region. as the new england council claims. but which it certainly has not. as i have just pointed out. could not this be considered the price one area of the nation must pay toward greater national security? are we to concern ourselves with security only if it does not cost us anything or if it is painless? our new england friends devote a lot of their propaganda to make it appear that import controls involve a fight between new england and the coal industry. this is not a regional matter. mr. speaker. the appalachian coalfields against new england. the reasons for controls are far more basic and serious than mere jockeying for economic advantage among regions. the national security is involved. residual fuel oil controls are essential to national security. the president and his top level advisers have so found. it would be highly dangerous for controls to be removed. the director of the office of civil and defense mobilization is currently engaged in a review of the residual fuel oil import control program. in view of the worsening international situation and the compelling need for this country to strengthen its security forces. it is inconceivable that he would make any recommendations to increase quotas at this time. if anything. we feel findings will necessitate lowering the quotas. import controls on residual oil are more important now than they have ever been before. the world is in ferment. we cannot assume that foreign sources of oil will always be available to us. therefore. controls cannot be removed at this time and permit such an influx of foreign oil that the ability of the domestic fuels industries will be so undermined that they cannot meet the national security responsibility assigned to it by the president and his toplevel advisers. import controls on residual fuel oil must be retained in the interests of national security and the nations welfare. the effect that residual oil imports have had. even under controls. is easily seen by looking at the unemployment figures from my own district. in the 4 major labor market areas in which my 12 counties are located. there are presently more than 17.750 unemployed. many of them coal miners or workers in coalrelated industries. if residual oil controls were completely removed. there would be even larger numbers of unemployed. mr. speaker. i yield to the gentleman from kentucky [mr. perkins1.","mr. speaker. on sunday. august 14. 1960. i had the privilege of being a panelist on the program \"metropolitan probe\"-wnewtv. channel 5. 7:30 to 8 p.m.-with gov. robert b. meyner. councilman stanley isaacs. representative of new york. and the moderator. william peer. we discussed the question of the authority of congress to investigate the activities of the port of new york authority and the justification for its investigation. this matter will be considered by the congress. in view of the fact that the full house committee on the judiciary has voted to cite three members of the authority for contempt for refusing to produce the records of the port of new york authority. the port of new york authority was created in 1921 with the consent of congress. without the consent of congress. this bistate agency could not have come into being or into operation. this was the first bistate agency in the united states. since then many other bistate agencies have come into being. these agencies operate in a manner which affects interstate commerce and. consequently. would be encroaching upon federal authority if congress had not approved the compact and the scope of its activities. the original compact of 1921. approved by the 67th congress in chapter 77 of session 1. set forth the port authoritys purposes. its scope. its powers. the resolution of congress granted consent to the agreement for the creation of the port of new york district and for the establishment of the port of new york authority for the comprehensive development of the port of new york. the congress in its approving resolution declared as follows: that the consent of congress is hereby given to the said government. and to each and every part and article thereof: providea. that nothing herein contained shall be construed as impairing or in any manner affecting any right or jurisdiction of the united states in and over the region which forms the subject of said agreement. sec. 2. that the right to alter. amend. or repeal this resolution is hereby expressly reserved. approved august 23. 1921. again in 1922 when the 67th congress. 2d session. granted consent and authority to the port of new york authority to execute the comprehensive plan approved by the states of new york and new jersey by chapter 43. laws of new york. 1922. and chapter 9. laws of new jersey. 1922. it stated in section 2: that the right to alter. amend. or repeal this resolution is hereby expressly reserved. this matter shortly coming before congress is a very important one. it is fundamental and far reaching. i am attaching a copy of the tv broadcast in which i was a panelist. this broadcast will provide certain information to my colleagues. and i trust it will to a certain extent be helpful to them in arriving at a correct decision on the question whether the port authority representatives are in contempt of congress. the broadcast follows: peer. good evening. this is bill peer with another session of \"metropolitan probe.\" tonight another inquiry into the way our most powerful leaders fulfill the responsibilities that necessarily go with power. our guest tonight is a distinguished visitor from across the hudson river. gov. robert meyner. of new jersey. governor meyner is in the middle of a hot dispute over a. current congressional investigation of the port of new york authority. the agency which handles the operation of port facilities on both sides of the river and the huge airfields that serve the metropolitan area. tonight we probe into governor meyners reasons for opposing this investigation. commuter problems of new york and new jersey. and governor meyners own political future. our panelists for this evening. on my right. councilman stanley isaacs. of manhattan. the only republican in the city council. and on my left. congressman alfrei santangelo. democrat. of manhattan. councilman isaacs. i believe the first question this evening is yours. isaacs. governor meyner. i understand that in connection with this controversy that mr. peer has mentioned. you wrote a letter to the various governors of the states and members of congress. asking their support in your dispute with congressman celler can you tell me why so few have responded? meyner. well i might say. councilman isaacs. that practically every governor feels favorable to the proposition. i was out at glacier national park at the national governors conference. and it was there that a resolution was presented which in essence opposes the very thing congress is trying to do. this resolution was passed unanimously. now to date i have probably had about six governors answer me personally and not one has taken the side of the congressional leaders. and quite a number of congressmen have replied and many of those are favorable. of course congress hasnt gotten back to washington and many of the replies are coming from secretaries. saying. \"when the congressman comes in i am sure he will give serious consideration to your letter.\" i think the response has been excellent. i know that practically all of the governors are opposed to the proposition of probing into the internal records. i want to make it clear that we are not trying to prevent congress from looking into the areas congress is expected to look into. what we are objecting to is that they look at the internal records. for instance. we might as a port authority look into the question of whether a contractor is fit to do business. look into his financial responsibility. get a lot of internal confidential information. i dont think that should be available. we might check the employment record of a person who is to be employed or promoted. we dont think that should be the subject of a record. as a matter of fact when the subpena was issued aaginst the three people from the port authority they took seven packing cases of information down there. and apparently the subcommittee was more interested at the moment in establishing a record to hold these people in contempt. even the congressmen who might be favorable to a probe in the sense that they want some of these internal records. say that there ought to be some method by which we ought to determine this controversy without holding reputable citizens in criminal contempt. isaacs. you do feel that congress of course has general power over interstate commerce and foreign commerce and is interested in the substance of what the port authority does. is there anything in the original act which gave you and the governor of the state of new york the power to organize this commission originally? and to continue to appoint its members? is there anything in that act that gives congress continued supervision over its details? meyner. congress takes the attitude that they do have this continuing supervision. we say it is not supervision. we say that they have the power to give consent now i think what happened was originally when the constitution was formed. the thirteen states didnt want two or three states developing a competing sort of government. to that extent this limitation was put in the constitution that said. \"no contract between the states can be entered into without the consent of congress.\" i think what the framers were thinking \"well we dont want these two or three states developing a competing form of government.\" now i say if theyif the government gives us money for airways or for airport they can come in and check our records to see that we use the money properly. if we are engaged in some type of enterprise by which commerce is affected they can come in and look at that. but i dont think that they can come in and look into the internal administration of the port authority. the port authority is carrying on functions that a6199 a city or a state could be carrying on. for instance. new york city has a marine division where they build piers and rent them. we dont think congress will come in and say to them \"now lets look at all of your detailed records in this area.\" and by the same token when we are doing something that is properly a state function and which we think can be done better with the two states through the port authority that this power of infinitesimal investigation should go on. isaacs. i see. peer. congressman santangelo. santangelo. governor. i am glad to see that you feel that congress has the power to investigate the port authority if the conditions warrant. your position apparently is diametrically opposite to that taken by the attorney general of the state of new york who has sent letters and briefs to the congressmen to the position. to the effect. that congress does not have the power to investigate the port authority. and that it is a bistate agency. and so i am very happy to see that you feel that we have the right if conditions warrant. meyner. i dont think i am in disagreement with the attorney general of new york. i think that this particular investigation is a fishing expedition. after all i dont see any resolution of congress on the record saying that we want to check this phase of interstate commerce. or we want to check customs. or we want to check the aviation problems. they want a staff study by which they are going into all ramifications. there is no pending resolution before congress. as i see it. which says that there is some problem here weve got to look into. i think it is a fishing expedition that they are interested in right now. santangelo. well of course we havent heard from the congress in the full house the reasons why the investigation is wanted. but it is a fact. is it not that since 1921 when the compact between the state of new york and the state of new jersey was entered into with the consent of the congress of the united states that not one investigation. or one inquiry. into the inner workings of the port authority has taken place. meyner. i cant say that that is a fact. santangelo. i know that in 1954 when i was in the state senate i introduced a resolution to the effect that we should investigate the exploitation of the motorists who were compelled to pay 50 cents for crossing the bridges and the tunnels when the original bonds which had constructed these had been paid off. and it was at that time the port authority approached me and said that this was a bistate investigation. or a congressional investigation and therefore should not be done by one particular state. or one particular legislature. now the question is whether or not this investigation should take place. not whether or not congress has the power because in the compact of 1921 congress reserved unto itself the right to repeal. alter or modify the compact. meyner. it reserved the right to withdraw its consent. i fully believe that consent is a lot different from having power. it is my feeling that most of the activity in the port authority is in the area that can be normally done by a state or a municipality or authorized by a state. these are functions that are ordinarily done by well say a port like norfolk or mobile or new orleans. it happens that this port is in two states and because it is in two states we get together and do it by compact. and the constitution only says \"consent.\" it doesnt say a power. it doesnt say you run the thing. and i think it is very much like this. i dont think congress can go into the presidents office and get his records. or into a cabinet members office and get his records. if conservation and economic developments are engaged in some program that effects navigable streams they can come in and look at it and well give them all the information. but to look any time at general records it seems to me is going a bit too far. peer. governor. the point that congressman sanrangelo made about the continuing tolls on the facilities operated by the authorities. tolls not being reduced despite the fact that the original bonds have been retired. do you feel that some of these tolls should be reduced? meyner. i dont see how under existing conditions they can be reduced. for instance. holland tunnel has been paid off many years ago. but the revenues that they get from the holland tunnel will enable them to build piers. peer. the motorist is paying for the piers. that hardly seems fair. dont you think the motorist is entitled to some relief? we have been told that the authorities have large surpluses for various purposes. why should they continue to soak the motorist with a 50cent toll because they want to build piers? that doesnt make a great deal of sense. meyner. well. i should like to point out to you for instance that if the third tube of the lincoln tunnel had to pay its way the charge would be a dollara dollar and 10 cents. now they are building a second deck on the george washington bridge out of the 50 cents. now it may take present day costs. they are going to spend for double decking for approaches on the new york and new jersey side the cost wouldnt be 50 cents for going across but it would be $1 or $1.25. now the fact that they have these facilities which were built at a lower cost enable them to pledge that revenue to raise more money to take care of additional facilities. and by the same token if they didnt build these modern piers wed be losing our traffic. or very vital international traffic to some other ports along the eastern seaboard or maybe to the st. lawrence seaway. this is vital. maybe we wouldnt have any jobs to drive to in an automobile. if we didnt develop the new york port--the new york and new jersey port. i might say in this connection that when we build them we pledge this revenue. we build them and we get money back that pays for them. but this enables us to finance. the port authority through new jersey and new york has no power. for instance. to levy a tax against the citizens of new york and new jersey. all they have is this revenue. it is a billiondollar corporation. but i dont know how the job would be done by the respective states if we didnt have this agency and i might say that it is a bipartisan agency. it was started out by alfred e. smith and walter edge. a democratic and republican governor of the respective states. it subsisted even though weve had republican governors and democratic governors in new york and new jersey. and republican and democratic legislators. and any time it is not being operated properly it is subject to investigation by the legislatures of new york and new jersey. i am sure. congressman. that at times it resisted some investigation but the power is always there for the governor to ask for any information and on the part of both branches of the state legislature to do it. and i dont see any overwhelming sentiment of congress to do it. of course. you are a congressman. you may encounter different sentiment. pere. councilman isaacs. isaacs. id like to bring up a different subject. you mentioned the george washington bridge and the new level being built. when that was originally designed as i understand it it was intended for rapid transit at least in part. but that has been abandoned. and of course you are interested in all your residents whether they work in now york or not. here people arrive at the other side of the river by all of the railroads or they have no connection today in most cases with new york city where they want to work. so far too many people. from my point of view. come in by bus and by cars. that is encouraged and everything else seems to be excluded today by the port authority. that is true of the narrows bid in their proposal. isnt it time that someone per. suaded the port authorityill put it that wayto build an underground railroad connecting all the railroads in new jersey at their terminals and swinging in either through the hudson tube or through the narrows bridge or the george washington bridge or what have you. carrying them by rail into our city. it is infinitely better for us to have people come in underground and connect with our local transit than it is to have our streets flooded with busses and automobiles. meyner. i couldnt agree with you more. councilman isaacs. but i am afraid that you put the cart before the horse. before we persuade the port authority i think weve got to persuade the traveling public. the traveling public somehow would much rather jump in a car parked outside of their respective apartment or home and travel into a crowded. congested city and pay the costs of parking. by the same token because a bus carries fewer passengers but gives more frequent service we want to use the busses. i think something must be done to counter this trend because i think if it continues well have nothing but chaos. and we try to counter it by setting up a division of transportation in our highway department so that we say to the highway builders \"well now look at rapid transit. the port authority whether you want to criticize them rightly or wrongly have merely followed this public trend of people getting into cars and busses and they furnishing the facilities for those people who want to go into cars and busses. isaacs. but they have encouraged the trend. meyner. well. on the other hand. on the other hand. any of these propositions that have been developed cost money400 million. $600 million. and there isnt in any of those studies any indication that you can make them pay for themselves. it may be that we can ask the port authority to be sensible about this thing and get the public to support them to subsidize this rail transportation which is much more efficient. you can travel and occupy much less space but how to sell the public on this? places like los angeles where i think 60 percent of the downtown section is occupied by parking lots or streets are just clogged. all you have to do is get one or two cars stuck and everybody is jammed up for an hour or two especially at the rush hour. they are looking for something that we got and we should retain. i agree with you that there ought to be some method but first weve got to sell the public on using these facilities. santrangelo. governor. the purpose of the port authority was to enhance the transportation facilities of interstate commerce between states and between nations and also to aid in the general mass transportation. since the last 10 years the port authority or the business in the port of new york which includes new jersey and new york has been falling down and you may recall within the last 2 years in new york. the new jersey legislature the port authority opposed the bills that had been proposed in the new jersey legislature to have them take over transit facilities and cooperate in trying to streamline the transportation between the states. now why is it that the port authority which has as its purpose improving the transportation facilities. en7 couraging transportation. comes into new a6200 jersey and opposes aiding in the transit facilities of railroads and other transit facilities and at the same time their major objective. to increase the travel and cargo *.shipments out of the port of new york has been falling off? for example within the last several months we have heard through governor rockefeller that the wheat shipments through the port of new york have dropped to the lowest point since 1953. the port authority seems to be going into all other businesses. it has been labeled an octopus extending its tentacles throughout the state of new york. it has gone into newburgh. 90 miles from the port of new york. and opened up a hotel. it is running a bowling alley. it is doing every other thing in real estate. much of its business is going into areas unrelated to transportation. unrelated to the motorist. unrelated to the port. do you think. governor. that all this extension into areas which are not their primary concern and which prevent them from reducing the toll of the motorists who are financing and paying for the port authority revenue is fair? and should something be done about this? and dont you think an investigation by the congress of the united states should inquire into this area to see whether they are applying their .funds for the purposes of transportation into state commerce and dont you think that congressman cellers resolution to investigate along these lines is appropriate? meynee. does that question really call for an answer? santangelo. it certainly does. meyner. it is the kind of question that starts off like \"when did you last beat your wife.\" no i think you have got to differentiate here. i think obviously that originally it was thought that rail transportation would become important and that the port authority would move in this area. but i call your attention to the fact that in boston. in los angeles. in san francisco in chicago. transportation by rail became a rather difficult kind of thing because people couldnt make money at it. people were leaving rail transportation and going to bus or to motor vehicle. now the port authority representing the view of the publicthe public wanted these facilities. i didnt hear any objection to building an extra tube on the lincoln tunnel or building a lincoln tunnel or any of the bridges that have been built. i havent heard one. the public wanted them. they were responding to it. if any objection can be made of the port authority it is that it is conducted as a successful business. they always look for the successful projects rather than for those which would be subsidized. i think what they are worried about and remember you have got six reputable citizens in new jersey. six from new york. and these people realize that they can only exist and build new projects which they feel will serve both states. if those projects will be paying propositlns. now if they have too many on the subsidy side they are going to be in difficulty. i think we found out long ago in transportation in new york city that it is a losing proposition. and they have been reluctant to take over. the governor of new jersey and the governor of new york are interested in trfng to get them to take some of these facilities over. i think we are making progress in that direction. but we cant saddle too much of a burden on them. now with respect to these independent enterprises it has beenthere are cases where they own airports and where they have to control the land which is the flight of the plane. the actual runway. now they have leased some of that to private enterprise. they say they are leasing it as comparable rates charged other people. and the money they get from that enables them to maintain the services. now this was written in their original constitutiontheir original laws. the legislature of new jersey and new york can withdraw this authority to build a hotel out at an airport or to maintain piers. they can withdraw that. as i say we might have to furnish them the money somewhere else to replace what revenue they get there. santangelo. thats $5 million for the hotel over in idlewild and there is a bowling alley that they are operating and also a plan on the part of them to take over with $300 million all the east side of new york. dont forget this is a taxexempt corporation. it pays no taxes. interest on the bonds are tax exempt. meyner. by the same token we dont take any of our revenues from the state of new jersey or new york to appropriate them to the port authority to maintain bridges and piers. peer. now. governor meyner. to get away from themeyner. i brought piers in here too often. peer. you know several of them. to get away from the port authority for a little while. lets get around to gov. robert meyner. there was some criticism of you. you probably have suspected or heard. at the los angeles convention for keeping your delegates to what appeared to be a commitment to go along with you as a favorite son. what do you feel that has done to your political future? meyner. i dont know what it has done to my political future. peer. what is your political future? meyner. the political leaders in new jersey decided early in january in 1960 that they wanted me to be a favorite son. the delegates were elected on that basis. we went to the convention on that basis. i assured all of the contenders that it looked to me as though i would be the favorite son on the first ballot. and kennedy would get most of the votes on the second ballot. we lived up to the assurances we gave to everybody. we gave any of those people who felt they had an opportunity after the first ballot to get their bandwagon rolling. we lived up to what we said to all of the delegates was going to happen. we didnt change at the last minute. peer. now. governor. under the new jersey law you cannot succeed yourself as governor. can you? meyner. i cannot. peer. what are your political plans from here on in? meyner. i plan to be as strong a voice as i can present for the democratic party in new jersey. i have given. or will have given 8 years of my life to state government. and we have tried to establish integrity in government. we have tried to establish a 21county party. we have tried to make our politics synonymous with good government. i am going to try to exercise what influence i havelittle or greatfor the future to keep that kind of a party and that kind of government in new jersey. peer. if the democratic ticket is successful in november. do you feel that you may be a member of the cabinet of the incoming president? m ener. i wont be in a position to accept any job openings until january 1962. peer. until 1962? .eynen. thats right. i go a year beyondpeer. i see. well then is there any possibility that you may run for the senate? meyner. i have always found that jobs are available when you dont seek them too fervently. peer. and that is your position at this time? you are not seeking fervently but you sort of hope that it comes along? meyner. well i love public life. it gives more satisfaction. i think. than having a lot of money or being an outstanding person in your profession. or running a successful business. peer. governor. i wish we had more time to go into a great many aspects of our discussion. but that is all the time we have on this session of \"metropolitan probe.\" thank you. governor meyner. cuba. down the red road","mr. speaker. i take the floor today as i did in the last congress in the interest of labormanagement reform legislation. i earnestly believe this to be one of the most crucial legislative issues facing the 86th congress. i have introduced both the original kennedyervin bill and the bill as amended by the senate which passed that body by the overwhelming margin of 90 to 1. it is my hope that after the committee and the house have worked their will. similar legislation will be approved by the house with a margin no less overwhelming than that given in the senate. there can be no doubt that the american people are united in their earnest desire for the congress to pass without further delay urgently needed labor reform legislation. no reasonable person wants us to pass legislation to cripple or destroy the labor movement. neither are we called upon to pass legislation that would interfere with the legitimate relationships of the employer to his employees. what the nation does expect is a reasonable bill designed to end the corruption. racketeering. and undemocratic practices that have crept into a small but highly significant portion of an otherwise honest labormanagement field. the american people. the rank and file of organized labor and nearly all of labors leadership are disgusted with the dave beck type of union leader. as well as the shadowy management operators characterized by nathan shefferman. in some unions the members are wondering what has happened to their dues and the union treasury. others are concerned about the breakdown of democratic election procedures. still others are embarrassed to see important leadership posts go to convicted felons. in some instances local unions are chafing under overextended trusteeships. there are other equally disturbing and unwholesome relationships which have developed over loans by employers or unions to union officers. conflictofinterest situations and the underhanded activities of some management middlemen whose function is to keep out honest unions that cannot be bought off by management. congress can take a long stride in the direction of cleaning up these abuses by enacting with necessary modifications the labor reform bill which was passed with near unanimity by the other body. i realize that this legislation which i introduced in the house following its passage by the other body is not perfect. there are parts of the bill that need to be revised to eliminate loose wording. possible inconsistencies. contradictions. and needless redtape. these parts are largely confined to that section of the bill which was added in the heat of debate on the senate floor rather than being carefully studied and evaluated in the committee room. with minor changes. however. the legislation passed by the senate and h.r. 3028 and h.r. 6752. which i have introduced. are sound and workable measures that will meet the need for legislation to end shabby and dishonest labormanagement practices. labor and management both have some legitimate complaints against all of the reform proposals thus far made. but if we wait for the perfect bill we will be granting a permanent license to the racketeers to continue their outrageous conduct. the kennedyervin bill is a compromise settlement that will not satisfy anyone entirely. but who can deny that it moves substantially in the direction of more responsible and cleaner labormanagement relations? as walter lippmann. the distinguished columnist. put it in his column of april 30 following passage of the senate measure: the main debate (in the house) will be on whether the amended kennedy bill should be toughened or softened. in fact. however. the overriding national interest is that a bill should be passed which establishes the principle. as does the senate bill. that there is a public interest in the internal management of labor unions. and that the right to regulate them is legally recognized and universally accepted. this is ever so much more important than any specific provision of the bill. it would indeed be tragic if the 86th congress should repeat the failure of the last congress by dissipating the opportunity to make a constructive beginning in the field of labor reform because of bitter arguments as to exactly what kind of provisions such a bill should contain. i said at the close of the 85th congress that the two greatest failures of that congress were the lack of constructive action to meet the mounting crisis in agriculture and the defeat of the kennedyives labor reform bill. i feel those convictions even more strongly today. it was a tragic mistake last year when a few shortsighted but powerful business lobbies and a very small minority of labors leadership joined hands to bury labor reform in a flood of propaganda. senator ives summed up the defeat of the bill which he had cosponsored as follows: the kennedyives bill was a good bill. it would have put hoffa out of business. for example. but a lot of house members were misled by false propaganda. to its lasting credit. the aflcio took a courageous stand in favor of the labor reform bill of last year. although the aflcio has objected to the wording in some of the hastily drafted floor amendments added to the kennedyervin bill. i am confident that these responsible labor leaders are as anxious now as they were a year ago to see wholesome reform legislation enacted. i have no sympathy for those loud critics in other quarters who are shouting as they were a year ago that the legislation before us is worse than no bill at all. these are the same narrow groups who deliberately set out to destroy the efforts of those of us in the 85th congress who did our best to secure passage of a reasonable reform bill. for years. the earnest wish of the american people for legislation to end racketeering has been choked in a vise set up by those who say the particular bill goes too far and those who say it does not go far enough. the real issue is whether or not the congress will resist the pressures from extremists on both sides and enact into law a reasonable measure which will put us on the road toward unionmanagement relations free from racketeering. graft. and undemocratic procedures. my pride in cosponsorship of the kennedy bill does not extend to resisting those amendments which thoughtful men can demonstrate will strengthen the legislation. unfortunately there are those who may try to kill labor reform legislation by loading it down with extreme. controversial amendments. these cynical efforts must be defeated. the following is a summary of the basic provisions of the bill based on some of the remarks of senator kennedy. the chief architect of the legislation: first. it guarantees the basic rights of all union members. including their freedom of speech and assembly. freedom to set union dues. provides safeguards against improper disciplinary action. and protects the rights of a member to sue in federal courts for the enforcement of his basic rights. second. it sets up strong barriers against the control of unions by unreformed convicted thieves. racketeers. and thugs. or their service as union officers. it prevents union officials from using union funds to perpetuate themselves or their friends in office. third. it sets up safeguards in court proceedings so that members of unions can protect themselves against arbitrary control by large international unions through the device of the trusteeship. fourth. it guarantees americas working men and women the fundamental right of the secret ballot in selecting their union officers and permits the majority of the members of a local to remove crooked officials at any time. fifth. it provides workable machinery for contesting in federal courts crooked or rigged union elections and insures fair election procedures. regular elections. due notice of all union elections. and real opportunity to nominate opposing candidates. sixth. it puts the spotlight of publicity on middlemen racketeers and unscrupulous antiunion employers. seventh. it compels comprehensive detailed reporting of union economic and administrative data so that the members and the public can really know what is happening. eighth. it strikes hard at the \"sweetheart\" contract by penalizing both the giver and the taker of a bribe in labormanagement relations. ninth. it requires union officers to reveal personal financial transactions which might conflict with their responsibilities as union officers. tenth. it places strong power in the secretary of labor. with adequate safeguards of individual rights. to compel compliance with the provisions of the act and imposes heavy criminal penalty for violations. eleventh. it requires that all union officers or employees handling union funds be bonded in sufficient amount to protect their membership. twelfth. it prohibits picketing for 9 months where a union has had an election and lost it. thirteenth. it outlaws the vicious hotcargo clause in the trucking industry and prevents the enforcement of existing contracts containing such clauses. fourteenth. it imposes criminal sanctions for embezzlement of union funds. false reporting. false entries on books. failure to report. or destruction of union books. fifteenth. it prohibits loans by employers or unions to union officers. sixteenth. it authorizes suits by union members for recovery of funds embezzled or misappropriated by union officers. seventeenth. it prohibits picketing for extortion or to secure payoff from employer. eighteenth. it prohibits the solicitation or payment of fictitious fees for unloading cargo from interstate carriers. in short. it is a strong. effective bill. it will enable all union members to know how their dues are spent. instead of having them carried around in a little black box by anthony doria. the friend of racketeers. or used to purchase an airconditioned cadillac by the secretarytreasurer of the garbage local in new york. it will require minimum standards of union democracy. with elections at regular intervals by secret ballot or by a convention of delegates elected by secret ballot. and prevent johnny dio from setting up fake paper locals and casting votes in the names of persons who did * not even know they were members of the union. much less council delegates. it will bar convicted felons from serving as union officers. so that herman kierdorf could no longer go straight from his prison cell in the ohio state penitentiary to an appointment as business agent for the teamsters in detroit. it will limit and supervise union trusteeships. so that the vice president of the bakery and confectionery workers cannot again appoint himself trustee of two chicago locals whose funds he misused on his personal hobbies to the tune of some $40.000 in 5 years. it will require union officials to completely disclose all possible conflictofinterest transactions. so that teamster members urged to buy lots in a socalled model teamster community in florida would know that jimmy hoffa had arranged the financing of this development through coercion on the unions banks. had placed the promoter on the teamster payroll. and stood prepared as a hidden partner to reap a large hidden profit. it will prohibit loans by either employers or unions to union officers. so that the president of the old bakery workers would not again be able to borrow heavily from one of their employers to buy expensive homes in washington and palm beach. and then negotiate a substandard union contract with his benefactor without consulting the local members. and it will expose and prevent the undermining of honest unionism through management collusion. middlemen. and unionbusting techniques. operations of socalled consultants like nathan shefferman. who promised employers he could keep out the responsible unions which could not be bought. through his various techniques of antilabor committees. company unions. payoffs. and teamster collusion. i do not say that the kennedyervin bill. or any law. under our constitution. can eliminate jimmy hoffa. he is entitled to the same rights as any other citizen. including the protection of the fifth amendment and trial by jury. but we can eliminate the evil practices by which he and his associates rose to power. their conflictofinterest transactions. their destruction of union books. their manipulation of trusteeships. their rigged elections and conventions. their appointments of exconvicts as union officials. their use of management middlemen. their use of union funds to build personal financial empires. their private arrangements with employers. their shakedowns and tribute for unloading interstate trucks. their falsification of union reports. their reprisals against honest members. their insistence of hotcargo clauses in trucking contracts and their strongarm picketing of plants where the union has already lost an election. labor reform legislation is long overdue. passage of a proper bill will be in the best interests of labor. management. and the american public. although i am no longer a member of the education and labor committee. i keenly appreciate the difficult task which faces that distinguished committee in drafting an acceptable bill. i testified before the committee on june 4 urging that they act with all reasonable speed in bringing solid legislation to the floor for house action. the committee has been working diligently to offer such legislation for our further consideration before we adjourn. i am sure that no one of us wants to see this present session of the congress close until we have passed a workable labormanagement reform bill.","mr. speaker. i thank the gentleman from oklahoma for yielding. in presenting the need for quotas on oil imports he raises a question that applies equally to industry and labor over widespread areas of our nation. i refer particularly to the administration of the reciprocal trade agreements act. as originally conceived this act promised a means of revitalizing trade with nations in possession of strategic materials we could use in return for products of our farms and factories. from 1934. the date of its enactment by the congress. until 1940 it had little effect toward increasing the volume of our foreign trade. our exports remained negligible until we began to produce military hardware prior to and during world war ii. after our european allies had exhausted their american credits the united states adopted lendlease. a policy that prevailed during the course of. hostilities. at wars end our production potential was overgrown while that of our allies had reached near total destruction. in our magnanimity the united states industrial potential was indulged to its fullest in order that we might restore and improve european industrial capacity beyond their prewar capacity. during this period. europe for all intents and purposes discarded trade barriers and quotas for what was virutally a free trade policy. since they were then of necessity on the receiving end. this course gave them all the advantages. now that their industries. through our help. are able to produce for themselves and for export as well. they no longer need from us such commodities as they are able to produce. they buy from us only such things as are needed to further enable them to compete with us in world markets. for selfprotection they now find it necessary to restore quotas and tariffs against our exports. while requiring us to admit free. or practically so. such items as they can export in order that they may build up dollar credits in our country. now it so happens that most of the items they would have us buy from them are items we ourselves have production capacity in excess of our needs. so when we import such commodities in quantities that flood our markets. our own factories and the labor they employ are crowded to the wall. it might not be so disturbing to our american producers if we were able to sell our own excesses in world markets. but this is no longer possible when the standard of wages paid foreign laborers is so low in comparison that these industrial foreigners are able to undersell us in any market. so here we are. in no position to compete in world markets for the type of exports for which our capacity is overexpanded. while our competitors insist that we buy these like products in order that they may have dollars to purchase machine tools and other scarce industrial products which they still have short supply they lack visible means with which to pay their cash. at this particular time the american products they most need are largely in the category of military suppliesitems representing high dollar value. since the volume of consumer goods we are able to absorb will build up only a minimum of credit it would appear that some form of subsidy must be arranged if we continue to support a policy of bolstering our nato allies. the dangers of such a program are selfevidentwe will overindulge our financial structure while at the same time we will dislocate too much of our domestic economy by weakening our small businesses. and industries no longer able to operate profitably. while mandatory quotas recently proclaimed by the administration may serve to improve domestic oil production the decree avoided any reference to imports of residual fuel oil. this is coals chief competitor. it is allowed to enter american markets in increasing quantities. each barrel represents the equivalent of 4.16 tons of coal. the coal industry has been hard pressed since world war ii. at the rate this competitive fuel is entering this country the cost for maintenance of producing mines will soon be too great for the industry to bear. this solid fuel has always been the dependable right arm of the nation in times of emergency. renewal of the reciproal trade agreements act should by all means provide adequate means for the preservation of this vital industry.","the gentleman is exactly correct. mr. speaker. there can be no question about the feeling of oklahoma. in their conviction that something is wrong with .a government policy which leads to drastic shutdowns in our domestic industry while the countrys consumption of the product stands at a high level. the action of our state legislature. in calling for washingtons attention to the mounting imports of lead and zinc. is evidence of this feeling. on april 25. 1957. editor ed livermore of the claremore progress had this to say: news that eaglepicher is closing down its operations in oklahoma brings to light a muchdiscussed problem: is it better to continue building up foreign countries and -providing markets for their goods than to take care of our own economy? r oklahoma is going to suffer as a result of the eagleplcher shutdown. possibly 2.000 men will be out of work. and perhaps a fourth that many more jobs will be wiped out in service establishments. etc.. in the miami and henryetta communities. * * * this is a very serious matter that affects more than just these two communities. * * * it affects the entire state. and similar situations affect the entire country. foreign manufacturers can produce at a -cheaper figure because of the cheaper labor overseas. true. we must always have an interest in conditions abroad. but when we damage our own economy in the process. soon we will find ourselves in no position to help anyone -* 0 * even ourselves. congress has been bombarded long and loud about increasing the embargo on foreign merchandise. a yardstick must be $163 found that will measure out unfortunate circumstances such as the eaglepicher situation before they occur. there is a limit to how far one can go to be a good neighbor. on the same date. editor c. allan mathews of the tristate tribune had this comment: meanwhile with eaglepicher closing down for a while. which in turn forced many other companies dependent upon their milling facilities for their own \"dirt.\" morale has dropped a peg or two in the area. while we can never probably forgive the company for building \"the big fence\" in the middle of town. and after all these years. it still rankles a bit. we can still see the companys side of the present problem. the government is importing tarifffree zinc from many foreign countries. including mexico. canada. south america. africa. and spain. to name a few. with seemingly little concern for effect on domestic mining companies or the american miner. americans cannot and should not be expected to compete with the subwage standard and the subliving standards of most of these foreign laborers and companies. it is impossible to produce as cheaply in america as it is to import. under those conditions. in recent years our nations major goal seemingly has been to appease and woo our foreign neighborsto buy their friendship. regardless of the cost. wed be the first to admit that it is important. perhaps necessary. on the other hand. its hardly fair to the folks at home. who are footing the bill. to be entirely neglected. ignored. or forgotten. the tristate zinc and lead industry deserves protection from foreign importseither in the form of a tariff or a subsidy. tristate mines deserve an operating margin of profit and return on their investmentfrom the eaglepicher co.. down to the smallest \"gouge.\" senators kerr and monroney. and representative edmondson. can follow their telegrams to the president with indignant demands that our foreign policy include the interests of our own citizens. the spirit of the people in oklahoma. however. has not been dimmed. editor leland gourley. writing in the henryetta daily freelance. has spoken eloquently of this spirit: henryetta will not die on the vine. this is a sad day for henryettas economy with the announcement of the closing of the smelter here due to market conditions. thus making 750 more men unemployed. come monday. half the breadwinners in this community of 8.000 will be unemployed. we must not give up the ship. now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their community. let confidence. courage. harmony. and effort be the watchwords in the days ahead rather than despair. defeat. and disunity. we must marshal our forces to keep henryetta from being wiped off the face of the map with a giant blow. as soon as this newspaper learned the bad news. it went to work immediately contacting every possible source that might be of some help. this action already is beginning to bear fruit. it has resulted in action in washington and in oklahoma city. the president received a telegram this afternoon from our representatives in washington. governor gary already has pledged his support and our legislative delegation in the state capitol is at work. forsaking all other matters to place this paramount issue foremost. this is just a sampling of the kind of thing that we must do with fervor and endurance. our hometown chamber of commerce must become more vigorous in its efforts to secure new industry. and in this difficult assignment every citizen must lend his support. our hometown unions are faced with a choice to make. we predict they will take the course of the union employees of phillips petroleum corp. in okmulgee who salvaged an industry there. rather than the course of the bitterness in picher. okla.. that resulted in the making of a ghost town. our churches must call on god to guide our thinking. wisdom. and direction in the proper pathway to a solution. your hometown newspaper pledges to help lead the way and provide encouragement and a rallying point for leadership. but this is something that will take the best guts and brains we have and every ounce of energy the entire community can muster. it is a problem. all problems have a solution. we will find it. we will emerge victorious. while these editorials testify to the spirit of oklahoma. they also reflect some of the confusion and disappointment of the people of america with administration of the trade policy of the united states. that policy is sure to be under increasing fire. if something is not done to meet situations such as we now confront in the tristate area. when i testified before the house ways and means committee on february 2. 1955. in support of extending our governments reciprocal trade program. i tried to make one congressmans position clear with these concluding remarks: i am also hopeful that this committee will fulfill its responsibility in seeing that the spirit and meaning of reciprocal trade are not destroyed by the executive branch of our government. i cannot believe it was ever intended by congress in writing this policy into law. that sound and productive american industries should be destroyed through its implementation. i cannot believe it was ever intended that hundreds of thousands of american workers should be thrown into unemployment as a direct and immediate result of trade agreements which flood our markets with competitive products from abroad. i cannot believe that it was intended that the escape clause should be ignored by the white housewhen a case is made under it. as it was in the case of the lead and zinc industry of this nation. the time has come for the congress to take positive steps in support of the reciprocaltrade program. to assure that its true meaning and objectives are continued. rather than perverted. by the executive. like any other program. the reciprocal trade program must have the support of the people to survive. we cannot undermine and destroy our nations mining industry. its glass industry. its petroleum industry and others. and hope to continue the popular support which is essential to reciprocal trade. let us. therefore. write into law the safeguards which are necessary to protect american industries essential to national security and any emergency effort which might ariseand send our reciprocaltrade program to the white house with these safeguards in it. i am sure this committee is capable of correcting the injustice we now see in the international trade picture for great segments of american industry and of correcting that injustice by wise and effective amendment of the reciprocaltrade legislation. in response to that request. and to similar requests by many other members of this house. we placed in the reciprocal trade law the protective section known as section 7. which i quoted at length at an earlier point in these remarks. congress has therefore acted to provide protection for domestic industry when our national security is impaired by the substantial weakening or destruction of an industry. such as the lead and zinc industry. it is now up to the president. and i earnestly hope that he will act speedily. every day of delay means additional suffering and distress for the unemployed miners. mill workers. and smelter workers of this great industry. every day of delay means an additional drain upon the welfare and relief resources of oklahoma and the nation. every day of delay means another day lost in the all important struggle to maintain americas full strength and preparedness in the cold war. i am deeply grateful to the other members of the house of representatives who have joined with me in this appeal for prompt action on behalf of our executive. and i hope and pray that the sun will not set on another day of needless delay.","mr. president. in a unique sense. the niagara river is familiar to more people than is any other river on the north american continent. the grandeur of its scenic spectacle. the magnitude of its potential hydroelectric power. are well known to the people of all the states of the united states and the provinces of canada. and countries the world over. who have been visiting it by the millions for many years. in 1955 the recorded visitors at the falls numbered 4.252.000. i am sure every senator recognizes the tremendous value of this marvelous resource of nature and takes pride in its conservation and development as a priceless part of our national heritage. now. just a word about the treaty obligation to preserve and enhance the beauty of the falls. this is being done (a) by remedial works designed to control the flow of water to insure an unbroken crestline over the escarpment now threatened with ultimate destruction by progressive erosion. and (b) by provisions. in the pending bill. to make the niagara more accessible to the public by the construction on the united states side of the river of a magnificent parkway. comparable to the improvements already made on the canadian side. mr. president. the hydroelectric project will create 1.600.000 kilowatts of new generating capacity. it will produce an annual average of approximately 10 billion kilowatthours of lowcost hydroelectric energy. i am confident that legislation for these purposes commands the support of an overwhelming majority of the people of my state. and of the nation. the passage of this bill. at this session. and its signature by the president. would be an historic and constructive achievement in the public interest and reflect lasting credit alike upon both the congress and the president. at the public hearings held in this congress. and under the preceding administration. the committee on public works has found no difference of opinion among the executive departments. their power experts. their engineers. and hundreds of other witnesses as to the economic feasibility and the desirability of developing the full power potential of the niagara river. the complete soundness of this development in a selfliquidating project is generally conceded. it is not questioned in the views filed by a minority of the committee. the minority. in fact. recognizes the tremendous value of the niagara resource and favors its prompt utilization. but the minority does express a preference for its private exploitation by private utility corporations of new york state. let me turn now. briefly. to the socalled safeguard provisionsprovisions designed to protect the interests of neighboring states. of the nation. and of the general public. and of the consumers of niagara power.. the committee found that these safeguard provisions are essential if the millions of consumers in new york. and in its sister states of the northeast. are to realize the potential benefits of the niagara. once it is publicly developed. the committee accurately points out that the average residential rates in new york state for domestic and rural consumers \"are among the highest in the nation\". the committee bill carries the usual congressional provisions for service to public and rural electric cooperative agencies as preference customers. it provides for the use of existing transmission lines. or of nonduplicating lines built only where needed and where economically justified. it provides further that neighboring states shall have equal access to and a reasonable share of project power. subject to allocations by the federal power commission in the event of disagreement. with these safeguards. the committee estimates that niagara power could be used to produce \"an annual saving of about a third of a billion dollars in the regions annual electric bill.\" i need not labor the point that niagara power is desperately needed in the northeast and will readily be absorbed by consumers in new york. pennsylvania. ohio. and neighboring states. there is general and complete agreement on this point. the needs which will be served by the pending bill have. indeed. grown more urgent since the senate gave its advice and consent to the ratification of the treaty nearly 6 years ago. in the meantime. with the sanction of the canadian parliament. the province of ontario. through its public agency. the hydroelectric power commission. has already nearly completed a gigantic new project. directly across the niagara river from the state of new york. this new powerplant. with an ultimate capacity of 1.275.000 kilowatts. is already in operation and will soon be utilizing the entire canadian share of the waters of the niagara made available by the treaty of 1950. unless and until congress acts. ontario will also be free to use the united states share of the flow of the niagara to produce power for consumption in canada. ontario has every right. under the express terms of article viii of the treaty. to utilize our share of this water which otherwise. in the absence of the new york power development authorized by the present bill. would continue to run to waste. it is therefore unmistakably clear that. until congress acts. all the additional lowcost power that can be produced in such great volume on the niagara. under the 1950 treaty. will be publicly developed and transmitted by the ontario commission to municipalities. rural electric cooperatives. and the expanding industries of that province. many of these industries. including the dairy industry. are directly competitive with producers in the northeastern united states. ontario already enjoys a competitive advantage. with electric rates far below the cost of power and electric service in new york. pennsylvania. ohio. and the new england states. the rate for power in niagara falls. n. y.. is almost twice as high as the rate in niagara falls. ontario. immediately across the river. in the light of these conditions. presented at the hearings. the committee has wisely recommended the immediate public development of our share of the niagara water. it has reported the present bill as the best means of utilizing this resource. under longestablished congressional power policy. and in a manner to assure lower electric bills to consumers throughout the northeast. when the magnitude and the value of this power are taken into account. it is shocking to contemplate the losses which have already resulted from our delay in authorizing the development of the united states share of the treaty water. most recently. in the pending majority report. and before that. in 1954. in minority views. there was an estimate that rate reductions obtainable from the niagara development could reach as much as $300 million annually for consumers in the northeast. my successor as governor of new york. the honorable thomas e. dewey. presented a pertinent engineering report to the committee at its hearings in the last congress. this report estimated that the coordinated development of the niagara and the st. lawrence. and the integration of hydro and steam power supply. would result in rate reductions for new york state consumers alone. amounting to annual savings of $95 million. so great is the value of this power. and so great is the demand for electric energy in the northeast. that the corps of engineers reported to the committee in the 82d congress that the sale of niagara energy will yield revenues exceeding the estimated project cost of $400 million within 10 years. these and other estimates on the record support the committee bill and the conclusion that domestic and rural consumers of the northeast. and many small industries of the area. depressed and stunted for lack of lowcost power will enjoy a direct savings from this project. amounting to tens of millions of dollars a year. in our consideration of the bill. there is another important factor which will surely not escape public notice and the thoughtful attention of the members of this body. the united states being the leader of the free world. it has been a part of our foreign policy under the present and the preceding administrations to aid and encourage the development of water resources. and thereby to raise the standards of living of the people of friendly and uncommitted nations. whose well being and security are important to our own. all over the world the people are aspiring to improve the conditions of their daily living and to increase their industry and production by utilizing the gifts of nature from a bountiful providence. great hydroelectric projects are rising. or are finding a place on the drafting boards. in pakistan. iran. india. formosa. israel. egypt. turkey. greece. afghanistan. and in other quarters of the globe. many of these countries have looked to us and have secured loans and grants for such projects. virtually all of these projects call for the public development of these water resources. under government auspices. and those projects which have been built have resulted. in those countries. in lower electric rates and production costs. the creation of new wealth. new industry. and new taxable income and values. i have consistently supported the appropriations we have made to stimulate and assist these projects abroad. because i am convinced that raising the standard of living of these people is of critical importance to the security and well being of theunited states and the free world. but i say it would be nothing less than an economic crime against the american people if. while we are rightly aiding other nations to develop their great rivers. we continue. with profligate waste. to delay the use of such a magnificent resource as the niagara. after we have finished authorizing more foreign aid at this session. i do not see how any of us will be able to explain or justify a vote against the bill. a bill which would merely permit one of the sovereign states of the united states to proceed with a selfliquidating project that can be built. operated. and maintained in perpetuity without a single dollar of cost to the taxpayers of the united states. the authorization of the niagara proj ect at this session of congress under the present bill will. of course. bring its most direct benefits to the people of new york. pennsylvania. and ohio. and to the powerstarved rural electric cooperative. municipal plants. and many of the diversified industries of the northeast. by the interconnection of the niagara and the st. lawrence developments. and with the delivery of power by interchange and displacement. this project will also fortify the available power supply throughout the northeast. and thus directly serve the interest of neighboring new england states. but. mr. president. i am not urging the passage of the bill solely because of its direct and indirect benefits to the northeast and to the people of my own state. my colleagues will bear witness that i have consistently supported and voted for the authorization of sound river development projects in all parts of our country. and i have also supported and voted for the vast appropriations usually required for such projects. projects unlike that proposed in the pending niagara bill for which no federal appropriations will be required. i have cast my votes for tva. bonneville. and the upper colorado. for instance. on the principle that a sound development of our resources in one section benefits the whole nation. and that what is good for our country as a whole is good for the people of new york. the wise application of this principle by congress has made possible the great developments on the colorado. the tennessee. the columbia. the missouri. and other major streams. i have supported such projects. as i support floodcontrol and power development in the northeast. while these projects seem to bring their most immediate benefits to people living in the vicinity of a given development. they inevitably contribute to the strength of our economy as a whole. on precisely the same principle. i am appealing to the senate now. not for the appropriation of federal funds for the construction of a federal project in the northeast. but for the authorization of a state development of the unused resource which lies on our threshold on the niagara frontier. without expense to the federal government. under the terms of the bill. this wholly selfliquidating project will be financed by the state through the sale of the revenue bonds of the new york power authority. that agency has already successfully marketed $335 million of its revenue bonds for the st. lawrence project now under construction. mr. president. the proposal for a public development of our hydroelectric resources is certainly not new or radical in new york state. this policy has been recommended and advanced by virtually every governor of the state of new york for more than 50 years. regardless of party. long before i was elected governor in 1932. the state development of our great waterpower resources in new york was urged by theodore roosevelt. by gov. charles evans hughes. and by gov. alfred e. smith. the power authority of the state of new york was set up under gov. franklin d. roosevelt in 1931. this was the first public agency of its kind created in the united states. mr. president. you will find many of the important safeguard provisions contained in the pioneering power authority act written almost verbatim into subsequent federal statutes. and in the enabling legislation which set up similar agencies in south carolina. texas. nebraska. oklahoma. and other states. my immediate predecessors. governor smith and governor roosevelt. envisioned the coordinated public development of both the st. lawrence and the niagara by the power authority of our state. but both projects were bitterly opposed and obstructed for many years by the private utilities and allied special interests. during the 10 years of my administration as governor of new york there never was a time when the private utilities were not using every device to gain control of the remaining undeveloped power of the niagara. time and time again. by action taken in the executive department. in the legislature. and in the highest courts of our state. it was necessary for the state government to beat back the importunate claims of private power companies to the outright ownership of the niagara resource. in 1939 i submitted to the legislature. and forwarded to the appropriate committees of congress. the exhaustive engineering report of the new york state power authority for the development of the niagara along with the st. lawrence. this report. for the first time. formulated a definite program for the coordinated public development of niagarast. lawrence power and for the integration of these new sources of hydroelectric power supply with expanding steam power facilities of the state. both public and private. in many messages and public statements as governor of new york. and in testimony before congressional committees. i strongly urged this program. a long step toward achieving its benefits was taken in 1951. in that year the legislature finally passed. and governor dewey signed. the state law giving the power authority the same mandate to construct the niagara power project. subject to federal approval. as that agency was given in 1931. and is now exercising. to build the st. lawrence power project. i have cited this history to show that new york state. by the action of its governors of both parties. republicans and democrats. has effectively conserved its major public power resources in the interest of the people. and thus far has prevented their alienation to private monopoly interests. if the principle of states rights is to be respected. then there is only one method by which the niagara resource may be immediately utilized. and that is by public development. to this end. i introduced the original version of the pending bill promptly after the united states and canada signed the niagara treaty ear:yin 1950. house hearings were held on a companion bill after the senate approved the treaty. but it was then oo late in the session to obtain a vote to authorize the project. so that we might keep pace with canada in utilizing the treaty water. the bill i introduced in 1950 has. of course. been revised to meet changing conditions. the very complete hearings held by the committee on public works and close study of the project by the able members of the committee now give us a bill which has been greatly improved and strengthened. it retains. however. the basic provisions of the 1950 bill. namely. that the niagara waters shall be publicly developed and the project shall be operated by the state of new york. through its accredited public agency. and that the usual safeguards shall be maintained. in authorizing the development. so as to protect wholesale customers and ultimate consumers in neighboring states as well as in the state of new york. the bill containing these provisions was unopposed at the public hearings held in 1950. the distinguished senator from arkansas [mr. mcclellani. at the next session in 1951. promptly called and ably conducted senate hearings on the niagara development. as chairman of the public works subcommittee. in the course of those hearings. as the senator from arkansas will recall. my bill for public development of the niagara was endorsed by the federal power commission. the corps of engineers. the united states army. the rural electrification administration. and all the executive departments principally concerned with this project. the niagara mohawk power corp.. which dominates the power supply in most of upstate new york. presented no witnesses against the public project at the initial house hearings in 1950. by 1951. however. formidable opposition had been organized to resist public development on the niagara in any form. the organized opposition which was then launched has continued unabated. up to this session of the congress. against -the utilization of the niagara resource by the method approved by the committee on public works in the pending bill. as a matter of fact. niagara mohawk had set its sights on winning control of all the remaining power at the falls long before the senate approved the 1950 treaty. through a whollyowned subsidiary. the niagara falls power co.. niagara mohawk presently uses 20.000 cubic feet per second of niagara water for power production. under a standardform license for 50 years. granted by the federal power commission in 1921. that use will not be disturbed. in fact. it may be considerably enhanced in efficiency and economy. under the terms of the committee bill. for many years. the niagara falls power co. boldly asserted its claims to the use of all the water of the river and all the remaining power that could ever be developed from the niagara falls and rapids. during my administration as governor. this company tried by every means to establish its claims. but it tried in vain. the courts of the state of new york upheld and vindicated the dominant rights of the public over the public waters of the niagara. and when the company. in a test case. sought to increase its diversion of niagara water beyond the limit then fixed in the federal license. its application was flatly rejected by the federal power commission. the pioneer developments of power at the falls. at the dawn of the electrical age. were not. of course. made by the niagara mohawk power corp. or by its whollyowned subsidiary. the niagara falls power co. through a long series of mergers and consolidations. the properties and rights of the original owners and enterprisers. and their successors. were taken over. step by step. until generations later. they passed under the complete control of niagara mohawk. having failed to establish its claims to all the remaining power of the river. niagara mohawk saw the glittering prize almost within its reach during the consideration of the niagara treaty of 1950. that treaty. for the first time in 40 years. permits increased permanent diversion of water from the niagara for power purposes. beyond the limit of 20.000 cubic feet per second for the united states. fixed in the boundary waters treaty of 1909. under the new treaty. the united states share of the niagara diversion will amount to an annual average of 65.000 cubic feet.per second. this more than trebles the amount of the permanent diversion heretofore used by niagara mohawk under its federal power commission license. which will continue under the committee bill.","mr. president. recent foreign policy developments have convinced me that the administration is fashioning the free worlds worst defeat since the end of the second world war. i have some words to say about these developments which i hope may be useful. i shall be speaking mostly about the forthcoming big four meeting at ge.neva. but what i want to emphasize is attitudes. not events. not the administrations acts and statements. but the complacent ard visionary thinking the administration is encouraginga men.tal atmosphere every bit as lethal to the free worlds cause as an atomic fallout is -to the tissues of the human body. i have done my very best over the past weeks to understand the reasons for the dramatic turnabout in american policies. i might say. without pleading superior wisdom. that recent soviet moves are frighteningly easy to understand. researching american foreign policy is infinitely more taxing: those chaotic sentences that are uttered at presiden- tial news conferenceswhich even mr. haggertys editors are hard pressed to pound into a semblance of orderand the attempts of the secretary of state to translate strategic concepts into chummy commonplaces. are formidable barriers to finding out what american policy is. let alone the reasons for it. but. if pressed. the struggle can be rewarding. and i think the answers come out pretty much like this: the administrations present foreign policy is to cooperate in the current communist peace offensive by having this country play the role of straight man for the soviet union. and the marginal reason for adopting such a pol- icy is that the administration has a - hunch that international communism no longer insists on conquering the free world. i think it a fair statement that when the eisenhower administration took office. it accepted. as a matter of course. the assumption that communism was irrevocably committed to rule the world. i think it is also a fair statement that 90 percent of the american people still entertain that assumption. it was and is an assumption that fully accommodatesin fact. anticipatesperiodic switches in soviet tactics within the framework of unswerving soviet aims. i submit. mr. president. that the present administration position is absolutely incompatible with the assumption of communist implacability. the administration is advising the american people that we may be witnessing a turning in the tide of history. it is telling us that the policies of strength and firmness are beginning to pay off. that the soviet union maynowbe feeling that it may be more convenient for them to conform to some of the rules and practices of a civilized community. in a word. the administration is saying that communism may. have changed its mind about ruling the world. of all. the . administrations reversals and contradictionswhich it has managed to bring off at the rate of about two a month since it took officethis altered estimate of soviet intentions and strategy is. far and away. the most significant. past reversals have had to do with tactics. this one involves a change of outlook and implies changes in our fundamental strategy. this one is indeed historic. and it may be fatal as well. mr. president. you may feel i am wrong in calling this a new policy. and you may cite.the administrations past truck. with the concept of coexistence. but i .believe that the phrase \"peaceful coexistence\" was originally. in administration usage. a mere propaganda slogan.designed to placate our alleged allies. it is now clear. however. that the administration has. in mr. dulles phrase. \"got religion.\" and is a firm believer in the concept. the big four conference is no mere expedient for the eisenhower administration. while the british elections may have influenced the timing of the invitation to the conference. it is now clear that the administration actively desires a meeting at the summit and earnestly expects it to be rewarding. this signal factthat the administration believes we can profit from negotiations with communistsis the true measure of the new and terrible trouble we are in. i repeat.. mr. president: this signal factthat the administration really believes we can profit from negotiations with communistsis the true measure of the new and terrible trouble we are in. now it ought to go without saying that - our previous assumptions about communist implacability are still validthat neither verbal arguments nor \"positions of strength\" will permanently distract the communists from their ultimate goals. but in the light of recent statements about the \"coming of new dawns.\" i suppose this had better be spelled out. let me cite a speech delivered by dmitry manuilsky in 1930 to the lenin school of political warfare. i do not use the speech to prove a point that any informed student of communism regards as quite beyond dispute. i use it because it states the point briefly and sharply. this is what he said to the lenin school of political warfare. and this is still a part of the communist bible. if you please. he said: war to the hilt between communism and capitalism is inevitable. today. of course. we are not strong enough to attack. our time will come in 20 or 30 years. he said that in 1930. mr. president. to win we shall need the element of surprise. the bourgeoisie will lidve to be put to sleep. so we shall begin by launching the most spectacular peace movement on record. there will be electrifying overtures and unheardof concessions. the capitalist countries. stupid and decadent. will rejoice to cooperate in their own destruction. they will leap at another chance to be friends. as soon as their guard is down. we will smash them with our clenched fist. now i ask you. mr. president. to weigh this statement carefullyand to note the contemporary parallels that leap out of it.. is it not clear that our genera.tion.. inthe 1950s. is simply. supplying the justification for traditional communist theory? what is striking here. of course. is not that communist tactics are unfolding as predicted. but that our reaction to them is precisely as. anticipated. and can there be any quarrel with manuilskys description of our reaction as just plain \"stupid\"? -i submit that there is not a single event of the -past 6 or 8 weekswhich have .supposedly been marked by \"dawns coming.\" suns rising.\" and \"horizons opening up\"-that is notfully accounted for .by manuilskys thesis. president eisenhower originally statedit seems like a very long time agothat this country was not interested. in negotiations at the summit until. among other things. the communists had proved by deeds that their intentions .were \"sincere.\" by \"sincere.\" i take it - the president meant \"genuinely prepared to abandon their ambitions of world conquest.\" that was a sound positionand. incidentally. an encouraging one. because. it was another way of saying there would be no meetings at the summit until the communists had decided their job was not to conquer the world. but we are going to have a meeting. and the question that naturally intrudes amid the rejoicing is: where is the evidence that the communists may have changed - their minds about conquering the world? the administration. and the president. in particular. cite one eventthe signing of the austrian treaty. but if the administration really believes this is evidence of communist sincerity. we need go no further for proof that the creeping madness. that for some time has been gnawing at our foreign policymakers. has finally taken hold. there is not a competent observer in the western world who does not see in the signing of the austrian treaty an attempt -to woo the german people out of the anticommunist camp. and if there is in the state department any alleged expert on the subject who has not advised his superiors that this purpose is there. he ought to be fired from his job. beyond this. the austrian treaty fits into the pattern of soviet overtures to yugoslav. japanese. and german leaders--a program destined to soften the wests will to resist at precisely the points in the world where the soviets hope to make their next gains. to cull from the signing of the austrian treaty evidence of communist \"sincerity\" is a feat of perversity unequaled since owen lattimore asked whether the stalin blood purges might not. after all. be a \"triumph for democracy.\" if the president really accepts this patent stratagem as evidence of communist sincerity. then we must haul out into the open a question that heretofore has been only in the back of our mindsnamely. whether- the president ever did understand the real nature of the free worlds fight against communism. the president himself raised the issue at a recent press conference. a reporter had asked him why he had changed his mind about a conference at the summit. and the presidents answer. finally. boiled down to this: that he hoped that. as the result of the meeting. \"my own mind would be clarified a little bit.\" mr. president. just what is itand this is a question to which i think the president ought to give a clear answer before he asks the american people to elect him for a second termjust what is it relative to soviet intentions that he is unclear about? or. more concretely. what is it he is unclear about that he feels nikolai bulganin or. if he is there. nikita khrushchev. might clear up? what is unclear. at the moment. is what shape our impending diplomatic disaster will finally take. there are many persons. some of them in this body. who believe that the precedents for geneva are teheran. yalta. and potsdam. this view is shared by millions of other persons in -the world who are in the front lines of the battle. and whose very closeness to the danger bids them to keep a wary eye on the lessons of history. they cannot forget that teheran. yalta. and potsdamled to the enslavement of 120 million people in eastern europe and 498 million people in asia. they cannot forget that in the past. world tensions were relaxed by giving control of poland to the lublin communist government. by delivering yugoslavia to titos partisans. and by serving up chinese territory to the soviet union. many of the 9 million on formosa and of the 50 million in west germany quite naturally wonder whether they will be the free worlds next contribution to the cause of world peace. are these fears of a repetition of teheran. yalta. and potsdam justified? or are we entitled to think that this time things will be different? obviously. nobody can say for sure what agreements will be reached at the conference. only time will tell whether we shall make actual territorial concessions to the communists. but i can tell the senate this. much: regardless of whether we give away physical territory. the cause of freedom will suffer a serious setback at this big four conference. whether it is tangible things. such as territory and people. or intangible things. such as propaganda gains. the soviets will pull in all the chipsnot because the administration will deliberately throw the game. but because it has agreed to play with a deck that has been stacked against us. apparently the president agreed to the conference with the best intentions. but we know that such intentions pave many roads. some of which do not lead to heaven. this road is headed straight the other way. and there are three arguments--as i see the situationthat make this verdict difficult to question. first. let us consider the probable agenda of this conference. according to the president. we are going to try to \"relax world tensions.\" but where are the areas of tension in the world? are they in places controlled by the communists? is the world at the moment holding its breath over who will rule the mainland of china? is the world anxious about the disposition of poland or czechoslovakia or hungary? are these the places where the cold war is being fought? obviously not. mr. president. the secretary of state has recently ventured a few stoploss remarks about our concern for the satellite countries. but the administration is careful not to press the point. dutifully observing our commitment to peaceful coexistence. we have. for all practical purposes. conceded those countries to the communists. then where are the tensions we are going to relieve? is it not perfectly clear that they are in the formosa straits and in west germany? the tinder boxes of the world are now. as always. places the free world controls. this is the first lesson to learn about negotiating with the communists while we are committed to a policy of coexistence. let me put this thought a little differently: because communism .is inherently acquisitive and because the free world is committed to living peacefully with the communists. it follows that the negotiable areas of the world are those which the free world dominates and to which the communists lay. claim. a corollary implication of coexistence is that areas under communist domination can be longed for by the free world. but they cannot be negotiated about. if we want to make deals. it is in the frontier areas of the free world that we have to make them. this is what the ifhen who share my views on foreign policy mean when they say. \"we are fighting the cold war on communist terms.\" this is why they ask. often wearily. \"will we ever learn?\" history. i think. bears us out. ten years ago. at the time of yalta and potsdam. the tensions between the communists and ourselves were in polandwhere the free polish governmentinexile was trying to reestablish control. in yugoslaviawhere the chetniks were fighting titos communists. and in chinawhere chiang kaishek was defending his country against maos communists. in each one of these places. mr. president. we \"relaxed the tensions\" by giving the communists all or most of what they wanted. two years ago. the area of tension was korea. our army was in a strong position. poised to strike out for the yalu. the communists requested negotiations. so we obliged. and granted them a trucethus surrendering our military advantage.  one year ago. the area of tension was in indochina. we negotiated at geneva. and ended up handing over all of northern viet nam to the communists. today. there is every sign that history will repeat itselfas it always will while we fight on communist terms. the headlines in the press afford a reliable indication of the subjects that will come up for discussion at the big four conference. the news stories are about formosa and about west germany. and the columnists speculate. quite naturally. about how the big four will settle those problems. but what the press does not make sufficiently clear is that this means we are to talk about. not communist territory. but the free worlds territory. not about what we may get. but about what we may give away. if we continue this way much longerdealing on communist terms--the day will soon come when our leaders will sit down with the communists only to discover they have nothing left to give up. let us now turn to the second argument. let us assume that in exchange for a concession or two by the free world. the communists give us something in return. this is what some who favor negotiations with the communists expect to happen. and they ask. \"what is wrong with that?\" they argue that mutual concessions--a little\"give and take\"-will let off the pressure in the hot areas of the cold war. this is presumably what president eisenhower meant when he said he would be willing to meet the communists \"half way.\"  what sort of \"give and take\" should we expect? in return for our surrendering quemoy and the matsus and our promise to prevent free china from attempting to recapture the mainland. the communists may agree to a ceasefire in the formosa straits. and they may even promise not to try to take formosa by force. in europe. in return for our agreement to slow down on german rearmament and thus \"neutralize\" west germany. the communists may agree to cut down the east german \"police force.\" socalled. and to neutralize east germany. there may even be some deal for the unification of germanya \"neutral\" germany. to be sure. the secretary of state has disavowed any intention of agreeing to a \"neutral belt\" in central europe. but senators will recall that a little over a year ago. mr. dulles was resolutely assuring the country that indochina would be defended. only to have the ground cleanly cut from under him by the british. the french. and finally by the president. moreover. at a recent press conference. the president brought up. on his very own. the subject of a neutral belt in central europe. even more important. whether we will it or not. our talk about \"new dawns\" may well create pressures on behalf of german neutrality that will prove irresistible. even by the sturdy leadership of chancellor adenauer. let us face itthe principal reason west germany is now in the western camp is its thoroughly warranted fear of a soviet attack. remove that fear by creating illusions about soviet intentions. and we may lose an ally. and i do not doubt for a moment that the administration will find suitable words for justifying a deal for german neutrality. they will cite reciprocal soviet \"concessions.\" from which it will follow that geneva was a great success. we can see the picture nowa televised meeting at the white house where the returning diplomats. smiling and very pleased with themselves. will report to the nation that \"a hard bargain has been hammered out.\" and perhaps even the old saw. \"we will have peace in our time.\" they will say that instead of surrendering a la teheran. yalta. and potsdam. we have shrewdly \"horse traded\" with the communists. some horse trade. some horse trade. mr. president.. yalta was a horse trade. too. at yalta. in return for our agreeing that poland should be organized by the lublin communist government. the communists agreed to holdand i quote from the yalta protocolfree and unfettered elections as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and the secret ballot. \"as soon as possible.\" they said. that was 10 years ago. and still there have been no elections. at yalta. in return for our agreement to give tito a free hand in organizing yugoslavia. the communists agreed to form a coalition government with noncommunists \"who have not compromised themselves by collaboration with the enemy.\" the communists immediately fulfilled that pledge by executing or imprisoning the followers of general mikhailovitch. who had madethe mistake of fighting communists as well as nazis. at yalta. in return for our handing over portions of north china to the soviet union. the russians agreed to conclude with chiang kaishek a treaty of \"friendship and alliance.\" that treaty was duly signed the following august. it provided in part: the u. s. s. r. agrees to render to china moral support and aid in military supplies. and other material resources. such support and aid to be entirely given to the national government as the central government of china. . senators may remember the- strong military support the scviet union gave chiangs government during his war with the chinese communists. russia has nearly always met us. as president eisenhower says. \"halfway\"\"halfway\" on paper. but communists. as most people know. dont keep their word. in their textbooks communists teach that promises should be broken when it furthers the cause of world revolution. lenin said. \"wemust. if necessary. resort to lies. deceit and trickery in order to achieve our aim.\"  i simplydo notunderstand how our leaders can go into a big four conf erence. seeking an agreement with the russians. knowing that the soviet government in its 38year career has an unblemished record of not keeping a single agreement that it was to its advantage to break. let me cite a few examples of how the soviet union lives up to its treaty obligations. when we get negotiation fever. we are apt to forget that we are dealing with an international bandit. in 1932 russia signed a nonaggression pact with poland. in september 1939. while polands gallant army was engaging the nazis in the west. soviet troops smashed across the polish border. in 1932 russia signed a nonaggression pact with finland. in november 1939. the soviets invaded finland. and annexed a huge slice of finnish territory. in 1926 russia signed a nonaggression pact with lithuania. andin 1932 similar pacts were signed with estonia and latvia. in october 1939. the soviets fbrced these three countries to sign socalled mutual assistance pacts which compelled them to accept russian military missions in the teeth of soviet promises to respect their territorial integrity. then a few months later the soviets broke the mutual assistance pacts. in the spring of 1940 the three baltic nations were incorporated into the -soviet union. in 1929 russia joined in the kelloggbriand pact along with rumania and. of course. most of the other nations of the world. that treaty outlawed war as an instrument of national policy. in the summer of 1940. however. the soviets threatened to go to war against rumania unless she surrendered the provinces of bessarabia and northern bukovina. rumania yielded. and the red army marched -into the two provinces. let us move closer to home. in 1933when we made the profound mistake of recognizing communist russia the soviets signed with us the litvinov agreements which provided. among other things. that russia would not permit her agents to interfere in american affairs. in july 1935. 2 years later. at the seventh congress of the third international which convened in moscow. american communist leaders gave progress reports on the revolutionary movement in the united states. . these preworld war ii treaty violations were only a hint of what was to come after the war. when the communists were strong enough to press in earnest their imperialist ambitions. in 1950 the house committee on foreign affairs made a study of the subject. the committee found that between 1945and 1950 the soviet union violated 52 treaty obligations. this figure does not include the broken promises of the chinese communists and the satellite countries in europe. it covers only the 5year period. 19451950. even so. 52 broken pledges constitute quite a record. it is an unfathomable mystery to me why our government should want to make an agreement with the communists when we knowfrom their teaching and from our experiencethat they will break that agreement the moment it stops paying them dividends. so much for the possibility of mutual concessions at the summit. let us turn now to the third agreement. let us assume that we stand firm at the conference. that we make no concessions whatever. this will mean that the conference itself will be a stalemate. that is what still other commentators expect to happen. now it is most important to understand that in this situation. too. the free world loses. -the communists are perfectly willing to settle for a stalemate. because they know they can turn it into a propaganda victory for themselves. the.communists have carefully prepared the ground for this conference by having launched in advance a spectacular peace offensive. their \"electrifying overtures\"-let us keep manuilskys prediction in mindhave persuaded large numbers of benighted souls in europe and asia that communism has changed its mind about conquering the world. and the communists have built uptthe big four conferences as the place where they will prove their peaceful intentions. the stage. is thus -set :for the communists to propose a \"neutral belt\":in central europeand a \"ceasefire\" inthe formosa straits. if the west is sucked in. well and good for the communists. but if not. the west can be made to look unreasonable. wewill appear to be the obstructionists.. either way. the communists win. it will: not matter that we in america know the truththat we appreciate what the communists are. up to. the point is that. the neutralists have already been halfwaygihooked by communist peace propaganda. and they will conclude that our refusal to cooperate means we are blocking world peace.  let us not be put off by the argument that we would also appear uncooperative by not agreeing to a meeting at the summit. it is one thing to quietly refuse to be seduced by communist blandishmentsas we were doing up until 6 weeks agoand quite another thing to get ourselves up upon a floodlighted stage and proclaim to the world that although we believe. communist intentions may have changed. we refuse to let them prove it.. \" far better that our diplomats stay at home and make the communists prove by deeds that their intentions have changed. by meeting them at the summit. we simply present the communists with a sounding board- off which their false peace propaganda can reverberate throughout the world. let me how briefly summarize the reasons the big four meeting is bound to benefit the communists. no. 1. we are going to negotiate about areas the free world now controls. we are going to talk about what we may. give away. instead of what we may get. no. 2. even should we get. reciprocal concessions from the sovietsa quid pro quowe know they will not.keep their half of the- bargain. no. 3. even if there are no. concessions. we will suffer a crushing propaganda defeat .by appearing to be uncooperativeby. refusing to act upon. our own advic to the world that.communist objective. may have changed.... . . . i -. i this. is why. i say the. president has agreed to play with a.stacked deck. this is why the decision to meetthe communist leaders at the summit is a tragic blunder. like teheran. like yalta. like potsdam. it will be a thumping communist victory. now what to do? i hesitate to criticize the administration without offering a constructive alternativewhich. to meet the immediate needs of the moment. is this: announce to the kremlin leaders that we have decided to be more specific about the geneva agenda. advige them that we are prepared to talk about the liberation

learned how not to fight communism. and this is the first step forward. we cannot coexist with communism. coexistence with communism is as plausible as the theory that cancer and healthy tissue can subsist side by side in the human body. we cannot meet communists halfway. they do business only on their side of the street. we cannot satisfy communists by serving up just one more morsel. their appetite grows with eating. -. these truths about communism are as valid when the russian bear is simulating slumber as when he is baring his fangs. today the world has been lulled into a false sense of security by communist peace overtures. it followsnot that the world situation has improved. but that it is more dangerous than ever before. when we turn a receptive ear to these illusory offers. it is a sure sign that the peril has deepened. in 1898 rudyard kipling . wrote a stanza that might well be framed over the desk of. every state department officerand. indeed. in the white house

(discussion off the record.) mineral leasing act\n830240268|mr. speaker. legislation has been enacted by the congress which provides for the multiple mineral development of the public lapds of the united states. i wish to commend the mining. and the oil and gas industries. for their sincere efforts to rise above narrow selfinterests in order to assist the congress in arriving at legislation that will permit the maximum utilization of our mineral resources. in all these efforts to arrive at a fair answer to the problem and to protect the prospector and smallmine operator. i and other members of the house interior committee have had the cooperation and able assistance of the american mining congress. the nevada mining association. and the western oil &amp; gas association. in view of the fact that s. 3344. as enacted. is a very complicated measure. and because i know that the miners and prospectors of nevada and other western states will wish to learn how they may be affected by the new law. i have prepared an explanation of it which should answer many questions raised by those concerned.\n830240269|mr. speaker. under leave to extend my remarks in the record. i include the following statement concerning the centennial of elmira college:\n830240270|mr. speaker. protestantism in brooklyn early this year celebrated its 300th anniversary. included in the many festivities was a huge banquet at the hotel st. george. the following article. which appeared in the january 23. 1954. edition of the brooklyn eagle. tells of the highlights of this gala affair:\n830240271|mr. speaker. one of the most important problems facing our nation today is that of civil defense. unfortunately there can be noted a great deal of apathy with regard to the need for a sound civildefense program and unbelief of the fact that it could happen here. i am proud to have from my state a man who has long been cognizant of the weaknesses in our civildefense program. he has worked diligently to improve our preparedness for a day which we hope will never come. i refer to charles a. hendel. assemblyman from mineral county. nev.. whose keen interest and support have added so much to civil defense in my state. the following is an article which was prepared by mr. hendel and which i feel is well worth reading by all citizens: civrl defense civil defense. what is it? is it something that is practical or is it just a lot of hooey and nonsense. and a lot of people shootin off hot air? what do you. the reader of this item. think about it? and. what is more important. what are you doing about it? what is your opinion of the man down the street. or the fellow in las vegas. in reno. or somewhere else whom most people seem to think is just another one of those dippy guys with a lot of yaketyyak about this and that that is going to happen to us unless we get a solid. united civilian force united and lined up for something that just cant happen to us. or are you by chance. one of those dippy guys\n830240272|mr. chairman. i yield the balance of the time to the gentleman from new york .\n830240273|mr. chairman. members of the committee. including farmers. i think the house has fallen rather low when a member comes before it and says you are trying to sell a program you have failed to explain or justify. and you have to accuse that colleague of being illiterate. instead of trying to explain. someone said there would be a revolt against this farm program unless you do the right thing. and the revolt will come. if it comes at all. because of the confusion and the lack of understanding that is attendant upon this program. my distfnguished friend from new york says he is opposed to this bill. despite the fact that he voted for flexible price supports. this gentleman from new york now addressing you tells you i am opposed to this bill. despite the fact that i voted for rigid price supports. even though this bill does not involve the question of rigid or flexible price supports. i must say that there is something radically wrong with this entire program. either in the law or in the administration of the law. with rigid price supports we now find that cotton goods sold you in the store are selling for less money despite the fact that they are made with cotton that comes from cotton supported by rigid supports. the milk we are buying in the store is selling for more money. despite the fact that it comes from the milk producer who is getting less for that milk which comes out of the milk produced under flexible price supports. maybe we city consumers are illiterate. but you better start doing some tall explaining because we have votes. we have representatives in this house and in the other body who vote. and i. for one. am not going to vote to expand this program. i have always voted for the farm program. i have followed the farmers and their advice. but i am stopping today. i am going to vote against this bill because i say to you. as indicated earlier in the debate. this bill is born of political trickery and chicanery. i do not accuse any of the members of this house of that political trickery or chicanery. although i have the highest respect for secretary benson. his honor and his integrity. i must point my finger at him. he is the man who has been picked by the republican- administration as the agricultural expert of this country. he was that during the campaign when he advised candidate eisenhower on the farm programs. he was named the official governmental expert on agricultural problems when he was named secretary of agriculture. he was studying the problem during the campaign. he has been studying it since. and he has told the committees on agriculture that he is studying the problem. he has told the committees on banking and currency he is studying the problem and he still does not come up with a plan to do something about any of these problems. this house only a short time ago authorized the cancellation of $741 million of losses sustained by ccc. wrote it off the books and canceled the indebtedness. restoring that much money or buying power or lending power to ccc. having urged that that be done. secretary benson came before the committees of the congress and asked for another $1% billion to increase the borrowing power of this corporation to $8% billion. he did that on the basis of estimates. facts. and figures which he submitted to both houses. he said the increase would carry him through this year and until the next congress meets next year. now. within 4 months he comes back and tells us he has made a mistake. that he needs another $1 v2 billion to carry him through until next january. mr. chairman. there is something wrong with the planning and thinking of a secretary of agriculture who can make that kind of an error. the best he can do to support his argument for another billion and a half is to tell you that up to june 30 of this year he has used $6.400.000.000 of the $81/2 billion authorized. having on hand another $2.100.000.000 at this time. yet he says he needs another $1% billion to support this program. on his recommendation this house passed the agricultural bill and sent it to the other body. it contains a provision. which i am sure will prevail. perinitting the commodity credit corporation and the secretary of agriculture to set aside out of the $8% billion as much as he chooses up to $21/ billion of the products he has stored away. and the treasury department is authorized to cancel that $2y2 billion indebtedness. that way the $8 y billion will not be impaired one penny. so he will take the $2/ billion of surplus that is stored awaysome of it rotting awayset it aside. cancel the indebtedness. and still have $8 / billion to use for this farm program. i supported that provision in that billat least. i did not raise my voice against it. i thought maybe that was one way to accomplish the purpose that was sought to make the farmer prosperous. to keep him prosperous. and selfishly the city boy is saying to keep us prosperous. too. because his prosperity is my prosperity. and vice versa. but when you have done that and you have given him the right to write off the books $2/ billion and to use that $2/2 billion. and having given him $1% billion more only 4 months ago. how can you possibly justify coming here now and asking for another $11/ billion when he has on hand $2.100.000.000? if you are going to destroy this program. mr. farmer and mr. farm representative in this house. if you want to destroy this pricesupport program. this is the way to do it. let me recapitulate the figures for you. four months ago you increased the authority of the commodity credit corporation by $1% billion. making the total authorized lending and buying power of the corporation $81/2 billion. on june 30 the congress. both houses. approved the conference report on the agricultural trade development act of 1953 and authorized the president to use $741 million of agricultural surplus products now stored and owned by the government. that same act calls for the cancellation of the notes issued by the ccc to the united states treasury in the equivalent amount. that means that as those surplus products are given away the equivalent amount is made available to the ccc. so that the $8y2 billion is thereby increased by another $741 millionthat makes a total of $9.241 billion available to the ccc. this house passed and sent to the other body the agricultural act of 1954. in which you authorized the setting aside of $21/ billion of surplus products now owned and stored by your government. taking it completely off the market and. at the same time. authorizing the cancellation of the indebtedness to the united states treasury of the equivalent amount. thereby making available to the ccc another $2 y billion. or a total of $11.741 billion. if you pass this bill now as you are bent on doing. you give them another billion and onehalf dollars. or a total of $13.241 billion. now lets look at the other side of the ledger. what is the maximum amount that may be needed for this program? under no prior administration did it ever run to $6 billion. four months ago when the secretary of agriculture asked for another 1% billion he told us that the maximum outstanding liability of this corporation was at that time $6.1 billion. when he came in and asked for the additional $1% billion provided for by this bill the secretary of agriculture told us that the maximum liability of this corporationas of june 30. 1954. was $6.4 billion. in other words. as of the time he was testifying in support of this bill he had an unused balance of $1.200 billion which has since been increased by the $741 million provided for in the agricultural trade development act of 1953. and which will be increased by another $2/2 billion provided for in the agricultural act of 1954. making a total that he will have available of $5.141 billion. even without the billion and onehalf you now seek to give him by this bill. he cannot possibly justify the need for a fund of $6.641 billion over and above the $6.4 billion that he now has outstanding. this is without attempting to discount the moneys that will not be needed because of the tremendous losses of corn and wheat and other crops because of the extensive drought that various areas of the country have suffered in the last few months. some members have indicated some doubt as to whether or not it is not essential to give them this additional authority in order to implement the flexible price support program as written into the agricultural act of 1954 by this house. permit me to direct your attention to the fact that the under secretary of agriculture has testified before our committee that his estimate which he uses to support the need for this additional money called for by this bill is not based upon a flexible price support program but it is based upon a rigid pricesupport program. he says that he needs this money in order to carry on his rigid price support program. he concedes that he doesnt need this additional money for a flexible price support program which he urges will necessarily call for less money than the rigid price support program. i suspect that the request for this authority is part of the pressure that the secretary of agriculture and the administration seeks to exert upon the congress in an unfair effort to force the congress to adopt their views as to a flexible price support program. incidentally. i trust no one will try to say that this money is necessary because of any maladministration by any previous secretary of agriculture or because of any action of any prior democratic administration. the testimony before our committee is that the program is being operated exactly the same now as it was during prior administrations. the method of estimating is the same. the method of computing what is coming in and going out is the same. the method of making loans is the same. and the use of banking facilities is the same. the only change has been in personnel one other facet of this problem requires some attention. the testimony before our committee shows that the treasury department has advised the secretary of agriculture that in using $6.4 billion of the authorized $81 billion the government will come within a half billion dollars of the debt limit. for the ccc to use another billion and onehalf dollars win necessarily exceed the debt limit by a billion dollars. that is without considering any part of the cancellations heretofore referred to. if any part of that $3.241 billion worth of cancellations is used then you get that much closer to exceeding the debt limit a5559\n830240274|mr. speaker. next to war. illness is the greatest destroyer of human and economic resources. sickness puts more americans in hock every year than the 1929 wall street crash. and. ironically. more americans are better insured against death than against the ravages of poor health and its two evil companionsaccumulating medical bills and payless paydays. here are some shocking statistics: americas sick bill is a staggering $9.4 billion a year. this is the private expenditure for medical care. it does not include more than $2 billion in tax money paid out annually for treatment of illnesses in local. state and federal institutions such as clinics. state mental hospitals and veterans hospitals. how much of this does health insurance pay? only $1.6 billiona mere 17 percent of the total. the rest comes out of the individuals pockets. often to an extent that hurts and sometimes bankrupts. fifty million american families spent 4 percent of their income on medical care. 29 million spend under 5 percent. 17 million spend 5 to 20 percent. then comes the category of those who pay and pay until they go broke. they are the 4 million families who have to spend from 20 percent to more than 100 percent of their income paying sick bills. illness puts 8 million families in debt every year for a total of $1.1 billion. according to the securities and exchange commission. three of the larger small loan companies last year made a total of 445.000 loans for payment of medical bills. more grim statistics: do you know that it costs $4.380 a year in hospitalization for a chronic heart patient? that it cost $10.000 a year to keep a polio patient in an iron lung? to treat a child 1 month at a cerebral palsy center offering all the necessary medical. psychological. and social services comes to $750. these figures tell the story of a great american tragedy. it is a heartbreaking story that has been unfolding for many months before the committee on interstate and foreign commerce of the united states house of representatives. of which i have the honor to be chairman and which has been studying the problem with a determination to find a happy ending. if arithmetic confuses you. let me tell you two storiestwo real life stories of the tragic consequences of disastrous illness. the first was told to our committee by mrs. oveta culp hobby. secretary of health. education. and welfare. hers is the story of a struggling young couple whose fifth child. a girl. was born defective. the parents spared nothing in pursuing the forlorn hope that the child might some day be normal. the best medical care that money could buy was all in vain. the baby lived only a year. most of it in a hospital. now the father. a reporter making $100 a week. is paying off what to him and most families is a heavy debtmore than $1.200and the other four children must do without much that they need so that their father can pay for the baby who died. the second is the story of a man i knowa man whose wife was stricken with cancer. the second greatest killer of all. the patient was in one hospital for months. the treatment. exclusive of doctors fees. cost $5.000. after a brief interval at home. the patient was taken to the hospital for another long stay. same treatment. same cost. then she was removed to another hospital where death mercifully ended her agony about a year later. the expenses for a total of 18 months of hospital treatment--still not including the doctor feesamounted to about $20.000. there was hospitalization insurance. but it did not begin to meet the cost. benefits were paid only for a time anyway. and then ceased. the womans husband went through his hardearned lifes savings long before she died. this catastrophic illness wiped him out financially. i know. the man was my brother. that personal tragedy. which occured some years ago. was not in vain. more than ever it impressed upon me the urgent need for bringing to american families adequate protection against the harsh financial burden imposed by a long and costly illness. it is a recognition of this need that prompted my committee to initiate a study of this whole subject to find out what can and must be done to help solve the problem of financing medical care. this problem does not beset those at the opposite extremes of the economic spectrum. society has made provision for hospitalization and medical care required by the very poorthe indigent. and the very rich are quite able to underwrite their own medical expenses. it is the great middle class that is caught in the middle. the ancient chinese had their own peculiar approach to the problem of medical economics. they paid the doctor for keeping them well. the doctor paid when the patient got sick or died. not such an archaic theory. it is. in fact. the idea behind modern prepayment health insuranceyou pay the insurance when you are well and the insurance pays you when you are sick. but does it pay enough? does it cover enough people? if not. what can be done about it? voluntary health insurance has made great strides in the 20 years since it became part of the american way of life. under the triple stimulus of greater insurance consciousness. more and more labor union collective bargaining agreements with group insurance provisions for workers. and extension of employee coverage to dependents. the number of persons with some form of health insurance protection has jumped from 8 million to 92 million. the most widely purchased type of insurance is for hospitalization. it is estimated that nearly all of the 92 million who have some form of health insurance protection have hospitalization. which helps defray costs of a hospital room for a specified period. certain drugs when they are administered in the hospital. use of the operating room and the like. growing in popularity is surgical insurance. which helps meet the costs of operations. some 73 million of the total with health insurance protection have surgical insurance. compared to 3 million in 1939. comparative newcomers to the health insurance scene are medical expense insurance which doesnt require a patient to be hospitalized in order to receive certain benefits such as for physicians fees. xrays. and catastrophic illness insurance. for major illnesses of long duration and great expense. benefits have expanded with the years. so have hospital costs. for example. the first commercial hospital insurance policies 20 years ago provided $3 a day toward the hospital room and board bill. up to $15 for operating room. laboratory. and anesthetics charges. now they pay up to $15 and $16 a day. and instead of only $15 for operating room and laboratory services. they pay for nearly all necessary hospital services and supplies. the early model policies put a 21day limit on the period of hospital confinement for which payment would be made and a person had to be confined for 24 hours before he could become eligible for payment. today. the limit has been increased to 31 and 70 days. with some as much as 120 days. and there is no minimum confinement period. dependents of employees were not included at first. as they are now. a5560 premium rates have necessarily increased. conspicuous. in the march of progress have been prepayment groups such as blue cross. the kaiser health plan. and hiphospital insurance planwhich provide services differentiated from cash benefits such as are made ugler commercial policies. illustrating this type is the kaiser plan. a creation of henry j. kaiser. the builder of ships and automobiles and dams. motivated by personal tragedythe death of his mother for lack of medical care when he was 16 and the blight of multiple sclerosis which fell upon his son henry. jr.. now 36--devised an innovation in healthcare protection. he built up a system of nonprofit medical centers and created a plan supplying comprehensive. lowcost. prepaid medical. surgical. and hospital care to 416.000 persons on the west coast. the basic kaiser plan provides for the subscriber himself. 111 days of hospital care annually for each illness or recurrence. this includes board. room nursing. operations. specialists consultations. and other hospital treatment. plus all drugs and medicines while hospitalized during the 111daysayear limit. subscribers dependents receive the same benefits except that free hospital care and treatment are limited to 60 days a year for each illness. half the private rates are charged for the next 51 days. basic monthly membership fees are $4.30 for a subscriber. $7.60 for a subscriber and 1 family dependent. and $9.50 for a subscriber and 2 or more family dependents. no benefits are provided for mental illnesses. congenital conditions and those present at the time of joining the plan. tuberculosis and epidemic or disaster illnesses and injuries. the kaiser foundation has 14 hospitals manned by general practitioners and specialists who are united in participating doctors groups. these doctors are paid by the kaiser health plan. subscribers are urged. but not required. to select a doctor from the group as their personal physician. these illustrate the strides and efforts being made toward the goal of bringing proper medical care to the people at a price within their means. but for all the progress that has been made. the blunt and tragic fact is that there still are 63 million americans with no health insurance protection of any kind whatever. even more bluntly. 12 to 15 milllion of them cannot afford health insurance even at the lowest premium prices reputable companies can offer. another 10 million or more cannot. because of geographical or occupational circumstances. avail themselves of group health insurance protection. they are the farm workers. the selfemployed such as maids. and persons working for small firms which do not employ enough workers to qualify for group health insurance coverage. then. there is that vast group of unfortunates in the no mans land of health insurance. those who cannot beg or buy health insurance even it they were to offer a kings ransom. yet those who most need protection against the cost of medical carethe aged and the chronically ill. an unfortunate fact we must face is this: those who need health insurance protection most are least likely to have it. a recent government study showed. for example. that the lower the family income the fewer the number of families participating in voluntary hospitalization insurance programs. thus. 3 out of 4 families with an income of $5.000 or more a year are protected. but only 1 of every 4 families with incomes below $2.000 a year have hospitalization insurance. the insurance companies are not to be blamed for this condition. one of the cruel ironies of medical progress is that it is multiplying the problems of health care and costs. it is all to the good that in the past half century the average life expectancy has increased from 47 to 68 years. miracle drugs and new techniques have created a new race of older peoplemore people who are ineligible for health insurance. penicillin may save uncle bill from going to an early grave with pneumonia. he will live to a ripe old age. at 65. he will be retiredor maybe firedfrom his job because of age. will uncle bill enjoy his retirement? probably not. more likely he will be tormented by the fear of getting sick or becoming a senile invalid. and there will be the terror of this thought: if i have a long and costly illness. how can i pay for it? for. you see. when uncle bill is old and needs insurance protection more than ever before he will not have it. he will not have it because he was dropped automatically from the factory or office group health insurance plan when he became 65. or even before that if he lost his job. uncle bill will have to use up the little nest egg he had put aside for the enjoyment of his life in retirement. maybe he will have to sell or mortgage the little bungalow he had hoped to leave to his children. if. for one reason or another. he has n6t saved anything. then he must face up to the greatest dread of old agebecoming a burden on others. he will have to depend on the relatives orworse still from the standpoint of pridecharity. again. modern medicine may save a patient from dying of polio and keep him alive for years in an iron lungat a cost of $10.000 a year. if the patients family is fortunate. it had polio insurance which paid perhaps as much as $5.000. and maybe it had hospitalization insurance which. at the very best. provided benefits covering 180 days of hospital treatment. but even if the family had hospitalization. surgical and medical insurance. it collected only part of the initial expenses. let alone the longhaul costs. insurance against socalled catastrophic illnessa serious longterm sickness or major injuryis the most recent and perhaps the most important development in group insurance coverage so far. even so. the maximum coverage is $10.000. and only about 1 million persons are covered by major sickness insurance. most of them under a group plan. because the cost of an individual policy of this kind is prohibitive for most people. testimony before our committee shows that major sickness insurance was pioneered 5 years ago among a group of general electric employees. the ge plan embodies the socalled deductible and coinsurance features. neither of which is commonly found in basic coverage such as hospitalization. surgical. or ordinary medical insurance. the deductible feature involves the same principle as automobile collision insurancethe patient pays the small claims or. in the case of a major illness or injury. the first $200 or $300 of the bill. the coinsurance feature provides that the patient must pay a certain percentage of what remains to be paid after the basic insurance pays its share and the patient puts up the amount required under the deductible provision. there are gimmicks in such plans. as there are in even the most advanced health insurance plans. for one thing. you cannot buy major medical expense insurance unless you also have basic health insurance such as hospitalization and surgical protection. like most basic policies. an employees dependent parents are not covered. and you cannot buy it if you are 65. gimmicks of this kind are known in the trade as exclusions. many reputable insurance firms have such exclusions in their policies. to protect themselves against abuses and unnecessary risks. these reputable insurance companies are trying their best to provide the kind of health insurance america needs. but they cannot write policies that would destroy them. unfortunately. there also are a great many outfits peddling the kind of health insurance that america does not need. and should not buy. they are the ones who advertise that their policies provide a getrichwhilesick bonanza-just a case of sniffles will get you $50 in benefits. but the small print in their policies takes away just about everything promised in the big print. how can you tell whether your policy is a good one? examine it carefully. does it carry a clause providing benefits for bodily injury sustained through accidental means? if so. watch out. accidental means means that if you fell from a ladder while cleaning leaves out of your house gutters and broke your neck. the company could claim that the means of injury was not accidentalthat you deliberately climbed the ladder. therefore you cannot collect. better that the clause read that benefits will be paid for accidental bodily injuries.*$ legally. that means exactly what you think: if you hurt yourself accidentally while doing something you intended to dolike climbing the ladder to clean out the guttersthen you are protected. how does your policy define total disability? does it say inability to engage in any occupation or employment for remuneration. wage. or profit? if so. the one word any can bring you lots of grief. that means if you cannot do your chosen joblet us say carpenteringas a result of a total disability. but can earn a few dollars doing something elsesuch as making hooked rugsthen you are not likely to collect insurance. a5561 you are better off if the policy defines total disability as inability of the insured to engage in his occupation. be on guard against policies which provide sickness benefits when confined within doors. this means that if you have had a serious operation that will require weeks of convalescence. you could lose your benefits if you spend any part of that convalescence sitting on your front porch. basking in the sun on the hospital grounds. or motoring through your favorite park. make sure there is no houseconfinement provision in your policy. that is important. for if your doctor advises you to go to the mountains during your convalescence. you are still covered for the period of your disability. these are a few of the pitfalls that should be avoided. many unsuspecting persons discover when they get sick or hurt that their insurance benefits amount to much less than they expected. indeed. some find that their policies are canceled suddenly. upward of 90 percent of nongroup. individual healthinsurance policies sold today can be canceled by the insuring companysometimes at once. frequently when the insureds next premium payment is due. such policies usually carry a clause saying: this policy may be renewed with the consent of the company from term to term. the term could be a monthly one. in that case. a company could pay benefits for the last few days of one term and then cancel when the next premium came due. on file with our committee are a number of letters giving firsthand accounts of such practices. one sadder but wiser iowan told how he filed a claim with his insurance company after his doctor hospitalized him for diabetes. i sure was surprised how fast they dropped me. he wrote. he enclosed a letter from his insurance company saying: you will find stated on your policy in large type that it is renewable at the option of the company only. we reserve the right to refuse to accept a premium payment on any date that a premium is due. america doesnt need the kind of insurance policy that is canceled just because the insured becomes ill and eligible to collect benefits. a company which plays that kind of surething game violates the very spirit and purpose of insuranceto provide protection at the time of need. not to take it away. here are a few simple guides in buying health insurance. especially insurance purchased on an individual basis: first. choose a reliable company. one that is licensed in your own state. that way. you will be protected by your state insurance department. second. avoid policies which give the company the privilege of canceling at any time. a noncancelable. guaranteedrenewable policy is the preferred type because it assures you benefits during long periods of illness or disability. third. carefully read the exclusions and exceptions. on the other side of the coin. i regret to report that evidence has been presented to our committee that some patients with health insurance are charged more than those without insurance. it is a fact that. in fixing fees. the medical profession takes into account the ability to pay. some physicians. in calculating ability to pay. take into account the fact that a patient has health insurance. but generally speaking. health insurance actually tends to stabilize fees. we know. too. that there are abuses by persons covered by health insurance. some are guilty of taking unneeded hospital rest cures they otherwise would never even contemplate if they had to foot the bill themselves. this type of abuse not only leads to higher insurance premiums. but contributes to hospital overcrowding which often deprives sick people of desperately needed hospital care. as part of our study of what must be done to bring our people proper medical care at a price they can afford. our committee made an onthespot investigation of foreign health plans. we toured england. australia. new zealand. and other countries that have national socializedmedicine programs. we found that their programs could be successful only through full cooperation of physicians. and we were told that the wide area of opposition from the medical profession has largely disappeared. in england. for example. we obtained figures showing that more than 90 percent of the doctors are cooperating with the program. medical opposition has disappeared because the rough edges are being smoothed out. agreements have been reached on the fees to be charged. let me emphasize that the purpose of our study abroad was to gain some knowledge of foreign medical programswhat mistakes they have made. how they have corrected them. what pitfalls we should avoid. what we can and should do to shape a sound. adequate. workable american healthinsurance program. we definitely did not make the study with the thought of adapting to our freeenterprise system what would be acceptable under a socialistic form of government. i am opposed to socialized medicine. even compulsory health insurance such as was proposed by the truman administration in the form of a payroll tax. health insurance. as i think i have made plain. has come a long way in 20 years. but much yet remains to be done to curb the losses which disease inflicts upon our national economy. what must we do? what kind of health insurance does america need? private insurance companies could write the kind of health insurance that millions of families need in order to bear the burden of a major medical expense. but the premiums would have to be so high that most of these same families could not afford to pay them. so there is a great gapon the one hand. millions of families in need of broader and deeper coverage. on the other. insurance companies that cannot give them the coverage at premiums they can pay. so what is the answer? my view is that the national health is partly the responsibility of the federal government. firmly rejecting the concept of socialized medicine. i believe the federal government can step in and help within the framework of private enterprise. i believe the federal government must step in for two reasonsto give us the kind of health insurance millions need but cannot now get. and to help provide the medical facilities that are neecpd to assure that no one wants for medical care. how can the federal government help? how can we provide the kind of health insurance america needs? here is how: first. federal aid to states so that states or nonprofit health groups can build chronic disease hospitals. clinics. nursing homes and rehabilitation centers. such institutions would provide less expensive care and more benefits per dollar. we have statistical proof of this. we know that the cost of taking care of a patient in a chronically ill hospital is only about $6.63 a day compared to $18.35 in a general hospital. one reason for this is that it is cheaper to build. equip and operate a hospital for the chronically ill. you do not have to have specialized technical facilities such as special diet kitchens. operating rooms. laboratories or oxygen equipment in every room. even greater savings would result from federally aided construction of clinics and nursing homes. for example. a clinic in a rural area would save a farmer the time and expense of traveling to a city hospital where he would have to spend a day and a night to get the same xray treatment he could get at the rural clinic in a couple of hours. nursing homesbuilt with federal aid and operated by local communities or nonprofit groupswould provide care at small cost for the aged and the chronically ill. the unfortunate group which now is ineligible to buy health insurance. but which needs protection most. our committee has been told that care in such nursing homes might not run more than $2 or $3 a day. second. to encourage individuals to carry voluntary prepayment health insurance. every taxpayer should be allowed to deduct from his incometax returns all health insurance premium payments up to $100 a year. this would be in addition to the present allowable deduction of all medical expenses over and above 5 percent of gross taxable income. third. government insured mortgage loans should be made more readily available to voluntary prepayment health groups such as blue cross. hip. and kaiser to encourage and help them to build more hospitals. clinics. medical centers. research laboratories. and other medical facilities. fourth. direct longterm government loans at reasonable interest to voluntary prepayment. nonprofit health associations to help them meet all or part of the cost of equipping or building health service facilities. fifth. to start with. a $50 million federal reinsurance fund to encourage private insurance companies and nonprofit health groups to provide broader insurance coverage for more people and especially to many of those who do not a5562 have it nowthe selfemployed. farm families. workers in small firms. the unemployed. and possibly the aged. just as the federal government. through the federal deposit insurance corporation. insures individual bank deposits up to $10.000. the government would offer reinsurance to private companies and nonprofit groups willing to try selling broader health insurance. under this plan. uncle sam would share policy risks with the companies by underwriting part of the benefit payments. particularly for catastrophic illnesses. it would guarantee policyholders that the conditions set forth in their policies would be fulfilled. provide for extended coverage and benefits to meet the higher cost of medical and hospitalization not covered under many policies issued today. and maintain health insurance protection for the person who loses his job by providing for waiver of premium. the reinsurance plan. in my opinion. is a vitally important approach to the problem of meeting major medical expenses. because the government would underwrite a share of the risk. a policy could. for example. pay up to $10.000 of medical expenses instead of $5.000. reinsurance premiums and reinsurance benefits would be established by state law. reinsurance benefits would be twothirds of each claim in excess of $1.000 during any 12month period. the plan would provide for 6 months of hospitalization during any year. a free choice of contracting hospital. subscription charge based on the income of the subscriber. the policy would pay 95 percent of the cost of medical services in the hospital and 75 percent of the cost of 12 doctor visits at home or at the doctors office during any year. excluding the first visit. the government would not underwrite any policy unless it is noncancelable. that way. we can discourage the sale of policies that can be taken away from persons when they need insurance protection most. i have introduced legislation to do just these things. there have been charges that some of my proposals amount to socialized medicine: that the reinsurance plan would be a form of government invasion of the insurance business. to this i say. nonsense. no insurance group would be forced to get government reinsurance. the same cry went up against the idea of federal insurance for bank deposits. the private banking business seems to have survived very nicely. the federal government helps farmers with farm price supports and soil conservation. it helps states build better roads with its federal highway aid program. it helps you put a roof over your head through phainsured loans. that is not socialization. neither is my proposed health program. indeed. i believe that my reinsurance plan will stimulate competition among private companies and encourage them to provide ever better protection. i am hopeful. too. that prepayment health groups will be able to open their membership rolls to farm families. the selfemployed and workers in small firms. an entire rural county could come under the protection of group health insurance by making arrangements for some bank to be the collecting agency for the county group. community groups and trade. bar and medical associations could perform a similar service for the selfemployed. in our efforts to bring america the kind of health protection its citizens need. let us concentrate on the common enemy--disease. cooperation is necessary to fight this battle. we must mobilize our energies and our talentsin the research laboratories. hospitals and clinics. in the medical societies and the physicians offices. on the farms and in the factories. in washington and in the state legislatures. let us dedicate ourselves to the task of guarding our most precious resourceour national health. let us wage allout war against disease so that we can emancipate innocent little children from the cruel bondage of steel braces. conquer cancer. heart disease. multiple sclerosis. cerebral palsy and all of the other dreadful diseases. and let us strive to provide proper health protection for every american. for. in a land so provident as ours. it is a reflection upon our national honor when any american wants for medical care or dies for lack of it. heroine of dien bien phu","yes. i shall cover that. i am concerned about the private property on the snake and on the columbia down to portland. those property owners do not appreciate that they are expected to cope with \"infrequent\" floods. a flood when it comes can wash up a farmer or factory owner for life. once the flood is too high. it is too much. and we should plan for it. and we should plan for the long future pull. the flood of 1894 or 1948 can occur at any time in the next 100 years. the engineers tell me. we should build for the next 200. multimilliondollar flood losses in private property mean lost investment. lost savings. lost plans. lost farms. lost jobs. and disasters of that sort weaken the whole surrounding countryside and region. the bureau plan for hells canyon is an integral part of the main control flood plan for the northwest. should there be a reoccurrence of the 1894 flood. disastrous as that flood was. the losses now. because of the increased population. the greater concentration of population and the building up of congested areas along the columbia river. would be many times greater than they were in 1894. when the area was more sparsely populated. i repeat. the bureau plan for hells canyon is an integral part of the main control flood plan for the northwest. aimed at trying to prevent or greatly to reduce the damages of such great floods as those of 1894 and 1948. the corps of engineers. charged with the responsibility of analyzing flood problems and planning for their control. has categorically stated that hells canyon will provide complete control of the snake river at that point in the river (see letter from col. f. c. itschner. corps of engineers. dated april 18. 1952. hearings on h. r. 5743. pages 618 to 620). quite obviously brownlee. if feasible. would fall 2.800.000 acrefeet short of complete control. it is pennywise to pretend to cut expenditures that will result in tens of millions of dollars of loss to american citizens. i say \"pretend\" to cut expenditures because 90 percent of the money spent for hells canyon will come back to the treasury with interest. that is investment. and we need such prudent investment for flood control also. i emphasize that statement. mr. president. and it needs to be repeated many times as we discuss the problem of appropriations in the congress of the united states. of course. it is obvious to me that what the secretary of the interior does not realizealthough i am surprised that he does not. since he has kept business booksis the difference between capital investment and operating cost. and the fact that in the governments bookkeeping the two are mixed up. we simply do not have a sound system of bookkeeping in the federal government. capital investments ought to be entered in one place and not carried as part of the operating costs. if that were done. people could not use economy as an alibi in connection with the question of whether to build hells canyon dam. hells canyon dam is not going to be built at the expense of the taxpayer. it is going to pay for itself and. over the years. of course. it will create in terms of the value of an expanding economy. in the tax dollars that will flow from that expanding economy. many times its original cost. i ask again. how are we to impart that information to the american people so they will clearly understand? i do not know how to do that except by repeating and repeating and repeating. by illustrating and illustrating and illustrating. they must see that when mckay talks about economy in connection with this issue he is fooling them. there is no economy in failing to build hells canyon dam. in fact. it is wasteful not to build it. it is a false economy not to develop the maximum resources of the snake river at hells canyon. including power. flood control. and irrigation. i say. mr. president. we should invest in hells canyon. because we also need such prudent investment for flood control.","mr. chairman. i move to strike out the last word. mr. chairman. debate on this pending civil functions appropriation bill presents a clear challenge to all members in their consideration of the socalled foreignaid bill that will come before the house in the next few weeks. i listened to almost every word of debate on this measure yesterday afternoon. and i must say it was often with a degree of amusement. speaker after speaker arose on this floor and wailed aloud because in this or some other bill. a reclamation. flood control. power project. or river and harbor improvement in his or her district had fallen victim to the necessity for saving money. saving money for what? the chairman of the subcommittee. the gentleman from michigan . stated repeatedly the cuts in this bill were made necessary because of huge expenditures for other purposes. since this alleged foreign aid is the second largest item in the proposed spending budget for the next fiscal year. it must be assumed the subcommittee chairman included that. the singular fact is that many of those who protested the loudest and appealed without avail yesterday for the relief of their people have voted at every opportunity for the lavishment of billions of dollars upon foreign countries. the gentleman from new york told you yesterday. in a short 5 minutes. where hundreds of millions of your dollars are being spentfor huge and splendidly appointed new railroad stations in italyfor hydroelectric and floodcontrol dams in france and italyfor plush new hotels and apartment houses. he could have spoken for an hour and still lacked time to tell you in detail of the modern roads and airconditioned apartment houses american taxpayers dollars are making possible. directly or indirectly. in the belgian congo. british equatorial africa. and the french cameroonsto mention a few. the stock answer for this spending is that it is to contain communism. do you contain or do you make communists by building hotels and refurbishing night clubs and gambling casinos that only the wealthy can patronize? what happened in the last local elections held in italy is astounding. the communist and prosoviet socialist parties actually obtained more of the total vote than the gasperi christian democratic party. and the fascist vote increased. several months ago i said on the floor of the house that it was becoming increasingly apparent that the political struggle in italy would be between communism and a rebirth of fascism. i reiterate that statement. what of france. the geographical pivot of western europe? does anyone in this chamber seriously contend american dollars have bought a stable government or real support from the people of that nation for the containment of communism? i have not forgotten the debate on the floor of the house in 1949 in connection with the scheme called the marshall plan. i have not forgotten how the statement that came from the republican side of the aisle that american citizens must understand a continuation of foreign spending would mean a lowering of the standard of living for them. i asked then of members of the foreign affairs committee what in their standard of living they were willing to give up or whether they proposed to lower the standard of living of the people living at the crossroads of america. these republican internationalists refused to answer the question then. but you here today. republicans and democrats alike. who have supported these freewheeling international spenders on both sides of the aisle. are getting the answer. how much longer are you going to be a party to raising the mirage before the eyes of your people that they can carry the financial and material burdens of the world and still enjoy the fruits of their own labor?","mr. chairman. i appreciate the need for economy and i also appreciate the temper of this house as to all amendments to the floodcontrol section of this bill. but when there is a leak in your house i think it is poor economy to wait until it rains and then start to repair the damage and attempt to stop the leak. it is. much better to fix the leak while the weather is good. that is exactly the situation you have with this vincennes flood wall. during the wpa days a flood wall was constructed at vincennes out of earth and part of it out of concrete. it was not built according to specifications employed by the army engineers when they do this type of work and the workmanship was probably faulty. because the wall has begun to crumble and gave way. every time there is a flood the army engineers spend about $50.000 to sandbag that levee. just a short while ago they drove in some piling to hold up the wall and that cost approximately $50.000. every few years they have extremely high floods on the wabash. they had one in 1950. and at that time the government spent over $300.000 to prevent the town from being inundated. there were thousands and thousands of volunteer workers. and locally $90.000 was spent. now that was a total of over $400.000 spent at that time. and this amendment only calls for an appropriation of $300.000. i am not adding the damage to property that would have occurred if the town had been flooded and the great loss of life and suffering that goes with such a disaster. vincennes is a town that has about $20.000.000 worth of war contracts. it is on the main highway and the railroads running north and south from chicago. this city is not in my district. but i am especially interested in this project. because if vincennes is inundated. practically all of the north and south traffic in the western part of my district is stopped. in the appropriation bill last year $600.000 was authorized for this project. it was taken out under the taberthomas amendment. mr. chairman. i have not spoken to anyone who did not think this was a worthwhile project and that it should be in the budget. they say it is a new project. this program was authorized under the flood control act of 1946. because that is when the flood wall gave way. so it would have to be a new project. i think we are considering the form and not the substance. if we refuse to approve this amendment. because of rules the committee has laid down. it is not economical to spend $400.000 to prevent a town from being flooded when you can start this present project for $300.000. i think this is a very worthwhile amendment.","that is not the question in point. the point is these goods would be brought here tariff free. which is just another step in the direction of letting this country be flooded with every kind of. foreignmade goods that are made at a wage rate from 2 to 20 times less than we pay our american workers. if we are not careful it will not be long until everyone will demand cheap foreignmade goods. then who will or could support our churches and the salvation army?","mr. chairman. i move to strike out the last word. mr. chairman. i have read. very carefully. all of the 12day debate in the other body. on the european relief problem. this debate should be read by every member. because the short time given to this important legislation in the house. makes it impossible to have a complete discussion and airing of all of the complicated problems in our relief program. after reading the debate and weighing the pros and cons. it is my considered judgment that the marshall plan ought to be tapered off far more than is proposed in our present legislation. i say this because i am convinced that events taking place in our own country will make it impossible for this country to continue its generous dishing out of our resources all over the world. and at the same time. stay economically strong at home. evidence in the other body indicates that out of last years appropriation. there is still about $2.500.000.000 in the pipe lines that have not yet reached the marshallplan countries. it is my opinion that the proposed appropriation of $5.500.000.000 for this year. ought to be drastically reduced. i do feel that the aid so far under the european recovery program has been of much assistance to the marshalplan countries. in regaining some of their economic stability and has helped them to ward off communism. our help has given these people new hope and confidence. i feel we underestimate how much they would have regained without our aid. they had hit bottom. there was no place to go but up. there is much evidence now in the testimony that these countries are reaching for our dollarsnot asking for less. but demanding more and more. i just do not feel that we ought to be doing things for these countries that they can. but will not do for themselves. the appropriations committee so far has seen fit to reduce appropriations for our own domestic program of reclamation. flood control. and similar activities by 15 percent. no such reduction by the administration is proposed in our foreignaid program. most of these european countries have already recovered 100 percent of their prewar production. under the marshall plan. we find england deliberately cutting her imports from the united states. the eca spent $354.000.000 last year for canadian wheat. when the united states had the largest surplus in her history. today wheat is selling below parity. yet the taxpayers money buys wheat from other countries. the marshallplan countries have about $14.000.000.000 worth of securities in the united states. why should not they use some of this for their ownrecovery? the evidence is unmistakable that our money has been used to finance experiments in socialism in europe. england could never have adopted socialized medicine. nationalized her mines. her banks and transportation without the aid of our dollars. to me socialism. when carried to its final conclusion. is the first cousin to communism. this country has been liberal in its help to europe. the record shows that since 1945. we have made loans. grants. and mostly gifts. of over $24.000.000.000 to assist europe in its recovery. this does not include the $6.000.000.000 of lendlease to england or the $6.000.000.000 of loans made under the bretton woods agreement. our aid program this year. including the military aid to germany and japan. will be nearly $8.000.000.000 or about $55 for every man. woman. and child in the united states. if you live in a county of 10.000 people. it means that the congress will bond you for more than a half million dollars just for this one program. it means an indebtedness of $71.500.000 for my state of nebraska. mr. chairman. our country has about 7 percent of the working people in the world. and this 7 percent has developed about 36 percent of the worlds income. this leaves 93 percent of the people in the world having 64 percent of the worlds income. i am fearful that the road we are now traveling is designed to divide the wealth of 140.000.000 americans on a share and share alike basis with the other peoples of the world. if we do this. certainly we are lowering our own standard of living to a point where we will no longer be able to help those in distress. or even help ourselves. mr. chairman. i did vote to send food. medicine. and clothin.. to european countries. to greece and to china. i believe in that kind of relief. if they are still in need. i would want to carry it on. that is not the type of relief we are now giving under the marshall plan. mr. chairman. under the marshall plan. the european countries were obligated to furnish us scarce materials for stockpiling. this provision has been a failure. i am further concerned about certain trade agreements which the 16 marshallplan countries have with the ironcurtain countries. these countries have completed some 88 trade treaties with the countries behind the iron curtain. most of them have been completed since world war ii. forty of these treaties are restricted and confidential. the evidence before the senate is unrefuted that under these treaties. the marshallplan countries have sent nearly $5.000.000.000 worth of equipment to the ironcurtain countries. this equipment includes jet engines. locomotives. steel rails. and all types of items that are certainly warpotential materials. i find. also. mr. chairman. that england just last week. has made arrangements to loan russia $36.000.000. it seems to me that some of the equipment and materials we .are supplying to the 16 marshallplan countries is merely in transit. and has found its final resting place in one of the ironcurtain countries. in the form of manufactured goods. mr. chairman. it is quite evident that this european aid bill will pass the congress. i am convinced that some of my colleagues will vote for the measure because they think it may help to stave off a depression in the united states. it may help to do that for a short time. i shudder when i think of what might happen to our economy. which is now geared to tremendous production for the military. lendlease. and aid. all over the world. when all that aid is shut off at one time. very soon we must pay the fiddler. mr. chairman. last week. there was a meeting in washington. attended by industrialists and manufacturers. considering ways and means of getting more gravy out of the marshall plan. they are finding it rather difficult because of the red tape and restrictions to come under the provisions of this aid. if you followed the discussion of this group. you are convinced that they must either supply goods under the marshall plan or curtail their production. one hundred and nine of these industrialists appeared before the committee insisting their products be included under the marshall plan. in fact. the chairman of the committee declared. and i quote: there will be a fight if the demands of the folks at home are not recognized. in other words. ladle out the gravy and make big appropriations to the special interests. or the bill is in danger. the getitnow boys feel it may stave off a depression in the united states. and they may be right. but i am wondering if they are really interested in the recovery of europe. or saving the economy in this country. i am also amazed to find. that since the close of world war ii. some 25 large industries in the united states have established themselves in europe. they are making automobiles. washing machines. typewriters. vacuum cleaners. and hundreds of other products. they are taking tile knowhow of our country to europe. and there produce goods in competition to our own. our industries go there because they can take advantage of the lower labor costs. with labor that seems willing to work. and they can then ship these foreignmade goods back to the united states. over lower. or no tariff walls at all. many of these products now flood our country. take the case of automobiles. we find that in 1947. only 48 automobiles were imported into the united states. in 1948. more than 38.000 automobiles were imported. and we are just getting started. all of these industries establishing themselves in europe will soon be flooding our country with their products. this is emphasized by the fact that just last year. our imports increased $1.700.000.000 over 1947. and our exports decreased $3.000.000.000. mr. chairman. we have in the united states today about 4.000.000 people unemployed. there are another 9.000.000 people who are working part time. unemployment is the first symptom of the job loss through imports of goods from asia. africa. and europe. the workers of this country had better wake up to what these trade agreements will do to their jobs. they just have no protection and under the marshall plan we are gradually lowering our standard of living to those of the rest of the world. i feel we ought to look further at the economy of the marshallplan countries. the debt of this country is nearly twice that of all of the marshalplan countries. and yet we dig into our pockets to help them pay their debts. the per capita debt of those countries is $650. while ours is well over $1.890. their total debt is about $150.000.000.000. ours is more than $250.000.000.000. i am sure these european countries do not understand that we have this large debt. and that our own economic structure is wobbling on shifting uncertain economic sands. there is no question but what there is i jittery condition existing on our economic front. i read in this act these words: no assistance to the participating countries herein contemplated shall seriously impair the economic stability of the united states. it is my considered judgment that this huge foreignaid program. and our military spending is jeopardizing our economic stability. prices in this country are down. unemployment is rising. we may be facing more than just \"disinflation.\" the handwriting is on the wall. it is time to stop. look. and listen. before we find ourselves bogged down in the morass and uncertain waters which will bring economic destruction. to me it is a great hoax upon the american people. when we deal out our money to these marshallplan countries and let them make treaties as fast as they can to trade with russia. eightyeight treaties since the close of world war ii. we find our state department has attempted to give the people the understanding that we have broken off negotiations with russia and would send nothing which they could use in making war against us behind the iron curtain. that just is not true of the goods we send to europe. mr. chairman. it seems we ought to labor diligently to keep our democracy strong. it ought to be responsive to our needs. or we will find ourselves losing our freedoms. certainly if we overextend ourselves and must levy higher taxes. which we must do if we continue with all of this spending orgy. it will mean certain depression in this country. it will bring unemployment and a disaster which none of us want. we cannot continue to dissipate our godgiven resources in these unusual amounts. what if we do save europe from communism and bankrupt our own government and exhaust our natural resources? i am most apprehensive about the future economic stability of our own country. it is for that reason that i earnestly hope that the funds for the european recovery program can at least be cut in half. should we find. within the next year. our assistance is bringing .a deep and more serious impact on our economic stability. then our aid will cease. our first duty is to ourselves and to future unborn generations who must pay for this program. it is more important. mr. chairman. that the spending policy of our country be right rather than bipartisan. i know we want to have unity. but unity solely for the sake of unity can well be disastrous. the history of the world is strewn with the wreckage of countries that were supposed to be united. but in the wrong cause. the propaganda which has been given to the country on this program makes my opposition more difficult. we who oppose this reckless spending of our resources will be branded as isolationists and smeared with all types of innuendoes and false accusations. but i submit. mr. chairman. that whenever loyal opposition is silenced. either by force. threats. or sundry smear techniques. or if it fails to speak. then the freedom of this country is lost. i have spoken because i have a sincere and earnest desire to do the right thing and i have come to the conclusion. after reading the hundreds of pages of debate in the senate. that to continue this program on such a full scale will certainly bring us to the brink of economic disaster. if economic. spiritual. social. and political disaster comes. we lose much of our cherished freedoms. the folks at home and future generations who must bear this extra burden will wisely question the steps we are about to take.","officer . the queston is on agreeing to the motion of the senator from kansas for himself. and other senators.\n800178802|i suggest the absence of a quorum.\n800178803|the clerk will call the roll.\n800178804|seventyseven senators having answered to their names. a quorum is present.\n800178805|mr. president. i intend to support the motion made by the senator from kansas . for himself. the senator from new hampshire and the senator from michigan . the distinguished chairman and two members of the appropriations committee. to recommit the bill with the instruction that $200.000.000 be eliminated from the $735.000.000 program. i support the motion because i feel.that today the country is in such condition that all expenditures should be reduced i. in. any way they can be reduced. i feel. in particular. that this is a time in which a general program of public works should at least not be increased. but that. in fact. it should probably be reduced.. i pointed out yesterday that the budget contains an increase in public works expenditures from $2.000.000.000 in the current year to $2.800.000.000 in the next year. i think it is unfortunate from the general standpoint of inflation and from the general standpoint of the budget that there should be any such increase at this time. cutting off $200.000.000 from the appropriations will still leave the sun. in excess of the amount used in the current year for rivers. harbors. and flood control. i believe. in general. we should not go beyond the appropriations for the current year in the construction of public works. this does not in any way indicate any disapproval of the general program of flood control. i believe very strongly that we should proceed with the longrange plan to improve our rivers to their utmost capacity and to use all our rivers and all the power we .can obtain from them but that is a job which will take 25 or 30 years. it will involve many billions of dollars. in a general way i feel that we should go lightly when we have an inflationary condition. when we have such tremendous private activities. so many other expensive government programs. and that we should make our plans and have the projects ready to proceed whenever private activity falls off and we are threatened with a depression. there is no question that we are in the midst of an inflationary condition. it is not as bad as it was. it has gradually tended to. stabilize. yet every expert feels that we still face a serious danger that prices will increase. wages will increase. and we shall have a further spiral which will decrease the value of savings and cause serious hardship to the lowerincome groups and persons who live on fixed incomes. in my opinion our whole policy should be directed toward avoiding that result. some persons say we can go ahead and impose controls. my opinion is that controls simply postpone the evil day. in the first place. they will not be effective. they will not really prevent the result which must flow from such enormous spending programs as we are now endorsing. they will simply retard increase in production and the ultimate solution of the problem. the difficulty. as i see it. is that we are trying to do too many things at one time. until we have reached a point where we are beyond the capacity of the govetnment to do all the things we are trying to do. by trying to do them all. we are creating a condition in which prices must increase and wages must increase. until gradually a situation may be brought about resulting finally in complete depression. we are at the present time still trying to catch up on consumers goods with the expenditure of money saved during the war. there has been a tremendous production of semidurable consumers goods. to say nothing of the great increase in the use of consumption goods. so that today people are living better than they have ever lived in the history of the united states. a farreaching program is involved in trying to catch up with the housing deficiency created by the war. last year i think we spent very close to $7.000.000.000 on housing. of course. there was private construction. with some government expenditure. and yet it involved money which went into the market and built up a huge demand for materials of all sorts. with which we compete the moment we increase public works on the part of the nation itself. in order to battle communism throughout the world. so that eventually we may have peace and prosperity. we have embarked upon an extensive program of foreign aid. far beyond anything that anyone in this country has ever seen in time of peace. apparently we shall spend approximately $7.300.000.000 on foreign aid during the next 12 months. we are also faced with a military threat. we spent this year $10.500.000.000 on the army. navy. and air force. and the chances are that we will spend at least $2.500.000.000 more than that in the next fiscal year. or a total of $13.000.000.000. that is a program which we consider necessary for the safety of the country. but if we have to undertake that kind of military expenditures we must cut down somewhat on civilian expenditures. we have a large veterans program to take care of the education of veteransa program of which i thoroughly approvebut which is entirely nonproductive. we are spending $3.000.000.000 maintaining men in educational institutions who produce nothing. who add to the demands for consumers goods. but who do not participate in creating a supply of such goods. we have an additional general program with which the whole world. outside of europe. is trying to keep up. making tremendous demands on exports from this country. in addition to those covered by the europeanaid program. all these programs are good things in themselves. the civilworks program is a good thing in itself. the difficulty is not that there is any objection to any one of the programseach one has the highest reasons behind itbut when we try to do all we create an inflationary condition which may actually bring more harm than the combination of the programs can bring good. it seems to me we have only one choice. we cannot abolish any of these programs. but we can try to hold them down to the very minimum. we can try to take something off all of the programs. so that when we get through we shall have relieved to a considerable extent the inflationary condition. mr. president. i read from the economic report of the president. which states the general condition regarding inflation. the president says: the question has been raised as to whether we have inflationary pressure because of large exports. because of the very low rate of business investment. another program which i have not mentioned is the expenditure for machinery and plant which is going on at such a rapid ratebecause of the large amount of residential and commercial construction. or because of the high level of consumer spending. the answer is that we have inflationary pressure because the sum total of these combined factors exerted too great a demand on available supplies. no one factor can be singled out as the principal cause. the inflationary impact of spending was strong in all fieldscapital expenditure. exports. and consumption. the high level of domestic business investment and construction aided in unfolding a total demand which increased prices. individual incomes. business profits. and government receipts. the supply of consumer goods was limited by the large amount of resources devoted to capital goods and exports. consumer demand. swelled by wage increases. by high farm earnings. by the use of consumer credit. and by the cashing of terminalleave bonds. was in excess of the supply at the current prices. so we had last year a dangerous increase in all prices. the report says further: the stubborn and intractable fact about an economy already operating at peak levels is that output cannot be expanded except by slow degrees. nor are the immediate consequences of inflation as favorable as superficially appears. some people are gaining at the expense of others. the heavy weight of higher costs of living bears down upon the millions of families who are unable to keep up with advancing prices. economic relations de.generate into a hectic struggle to catch up or keep ahead. no firm basis can be established for orderly and stable progress. we had before our committee mr. marriner eccles. who certainly is in favor of spending in times of depression. and has such a record. he said: in restraining inflationary pressures under present and prospective conditions. monetary akid credit policies mbust be combined with fiscal and other government policies. the public should be given every possible assurance that the government will protect the purchasing power of the dollar so that the public would be more willing to defer the satisfaction of wants. . particularly for houses and durable goods. wherever possible. government expenditures that will add to the lpessures on the labor and capital goods markets should be deferred. and state and local governments should be requested likewise to defer nonessential expenditures of this type. i might add the last word of the presidents council of economic advisers. given in a memorandum published on april 9. in which they said. with relation to the additional expenditures for military purposes: every citizen must recognize that further diversions of productive effort to military uses inevitably involve some sacrifice of civilian types of consumption. it is our particular application of the old alternative of guns or butter. our people hadand we believe quite properlylooked forward to a postwar period in which larger numbers of people would achieve higher standards of living than had ever been realized before. those hopes are not nullified by the defense program. but they must.be in some measure postponed or for the present revised downward. so. we have the advice of the presidents economic advisers. and of the chairman of the federal reserve board. i now read from the report which will be filed shortly. probably. by the joint committee on the economic report: the substance of our conclusion is that the inflationary condition is due to our attempt to accomplish more than is possible at our present capacity for production. just as england has been criticized for proceeding too rapidly with her housing program instead of devoting more time to production for export. so our people and our government. both executive and legislative. may well be criticized for trying to carry on at the same time so many huge programs as those represented in our expansion of business transactions. our expansion of residential housing. our support of veterans education and rehabilitation. our government public works program. our huge military establishment. and our economic support of free peoples throughout the entire world. liberal credit policies on the part of private and public agencies alike and the maintenance of low interest rates have encouraged the expansion of these programs. we do not intend to criticize these programs or question their desirability. we merely point out that the attempt to carry them all on at once with very little restraint in the field of consumer spending and liberal credit policies is the basic reason for inflation. which otherwise could hardly coincide with a large government surplus. so. mr. president. in the case ot public works in particular. it seems to me that we can reasonably ask that we defer some of these works. which have been deferred now for 160 years. and which can certainly be deferred another year without any very dangerous consequences to the country. there are some things which cannot be deferred. but i do not think there is anything which cannot be somewhat cut down. and that is all we are asking in the motion filed by the distinguished senator from kansas. i believe very strongly that if we shall continue to insist on allout development. of every one of the programs i have mentioned. we will face another period of inflation in prices. which will mean probably further increases in wages. and a general inflationary ronditlon throughout the united states. which will injure many people. which will produce hardship and suffering among many families. and which may ultimately lead to a serious depression. mr. president. with special reference to the budget which we face this year. and the effect of the appropriations .5954 which we. are asked to make. not only -in this field. but in many other fields. so far as i can judge at the present time. the best advice is that after the tax cut which was made by congress. there will be receipts to the government in the next 12 months of $42.500.000.000. it is. of course. more difficult to estimate what the expenses will be. but i have had prepared a table which i think gives a fair idea of about where we are today. it assumes that national defense. for which $11.000.000.000 was _asked. will cost $13.100.000.000. it may cost more. international expenses have been increased from $7.000.000.000 to $7.300.000.000. veterans benefits have been increased from $6.100.000.000 to $6.300.000.000. and the interest on the national debt is $5.300.000.000. refund of taxes is estimatednow at about $2.500.000.000. the reduction in all other expenditures is estimated at from about $8.300.000.000 to $7.800.000.000. or about $500.000.000. that is not a very large decrease. but it is as much of a decrease as we can see any evidence of. so far as all present appropriations have proceeded. mr. president. -that would. mean a total expenditure of $40.600.000.000. and would leave a balance of $1.900.000.000. this congress has said that we should apply at least $2.600.000.000 to the public debt. and on the basis of the present outlook. and a fairly conservative estimate of military expenditureswe do not know how much of the money is to be spent in the next 12 monthswe have already trenched upon the $2.600.000.000 which should be set aside to reduce the national debt. inaddition to that. in all probability we face an increase in the salaries of federal workers generally and of postal workers. which mayeasily total four or five hundred million dollars. some of the bills provide even more than that. it seems to me that if we are really to succeed in balancing the budget. $40.000.ojj0.000 is an outside figure for expenditure the coming year. i do not think the taxpayers should bear a greater burden than $42.500.000.000. their burden is already great. government expenditures already take more than 25 percent of the national income. which means people have to work more than 1 day in 4 for the government. and only 3 days for themselves. the burden has been somewhat relieved by the inflation which has taken off the taxpayer the burden of the increase and really passed it on to the consumer in higher prices. but when that stops the burden will be so heavy as to discourage any further investment or increase in production. i think it is a burden beyond anything we should stand. in order to meet our promises. i believe very strongly we should confine the expenditures of the government to not more than $40.000.000.000. which would leave $2.500.000.000 to apply on the public debt. with special reference to the public works program. i call the attention of the senate to the presidents budget. page 1283. and ask that there be incorporated at this point in the record table no. 5. giving the federal civil public works expenditures by functions and subfunctions.\n800178806|mr. president. this table shows that in the year 1947 the government actually spent on civil public works $1.422.000.000. that in the fiscal year 1948 it is expected the government will spend $2.002.000.000. that the estimate for 1949 contained in the budget. apart from any increase congress may make. is $2.825.000.000. or an increase of $823.000.000 over the expenditures for the current year. mr. president. i believe very strongly that under present conditions there should be no increase in public works. that it is something which can be put off. as i said yesterday. i do not think there is an economist. a leftwing economist. or a rightwing economist. or any other kind of economist. who does not accept the general theory that we should let up on public works in time of boom. in time when private activity is rampant. and that we should save those expenditures and pile them up when a depression is threatened. that theory is accepted by everyone i know of. it was accepted by the last republican president. mr. hoover was very strong for the theory of using public works as a balance to private activity. it was accepted by president roosevelt. it has been accepted by president truman. it is accepted i think by all parties as a matter of principle. i believe we should abide by that general principle. some persons have said. you were in favor of a government pay increase. and also in favor of federal aid to education. in the first place those expendi-. tures are small compared to what we are doing in these other fields. in the second place it seems to me that we have a prior obligation to federal employees to see that their salaries are increased atleast as much over prewar as their cost of living. i believe that is a priorobligation to undertaking any public works. it seems to me that we have an obligation in that case to a million or more men and women to see that they receive a reasonably decent living. the same thing is true in the field of education. if a million children perhaps. who are not receiving any education to speak of today. continue without education. it will be lost and gone to them forever. i believe again that where we have that kind of a current obligation it should come ahead of public works. i believe that in a budget of the size of our countrys budget such increases are reasonable increases. i do not believe that being in favor of increases in salrcies and aid to education in any way milittes against the position of economy respecting every program. after all. it is a question of weighing the importance of different public expenditures. but all of it. it seems to me. must be included finally in a $40.000.000.000 expenditure budget. and if we are to come within it it is necessary to have to shave every single appropriation bill that comes along. therefore. mr. president. i think it is unfortunate that we have to make this decision now when we do not have the final report of the bureau of the budget as to where we are finally going to land in the way of governmental expenditures. but we do have to proceed step by step. i believe we will be far safer. i believe we will adopt sound principles. i believe we will keep our promises. if we vote to recommit the bill to the committee and reduce by $200.000.000 the civil public works appropriation measure.\n800178807|mr. president. i wish to speak briefly on the bill. and i speak as a member of the senate committee on appropriations. the senator from ohio today has made. as he usually does. a very able argument. and certainly there is ample room for an honest difference of opinion as to what policy we should perform in this regard.\n800178808|mr. president. will the senator yield for a moment?\n800178809|i yield.\n800178810|i meant to say that it is not my desire or intention by what i have said to reflect in any way on the action of the committee. the committee has a particular job to perform. just as a particular job must be performed respecting each program that comes before us. i am rather trying to suggest an overall policy for congress. i have the highest respect for the committee. i know the difficulty the committee has had in picking out particular projects and rejecting others. and i do not want what i have said to be in bny way considered as a reflection on the details of the bill or on the action of the committee on appropriations.\n800178811|mr. president. i merely wish to point out a few of the problems that faced the committee on appropriations. and also a few basic policies of national import which i think should be of interest to the senate of the united states. in the first place. as we all understand. but perhaps some of the public does not. there is not a single item in the bill which has not first run the gantlet of a congressional authorization. over a period of years after consideration by the proper senate committee and the proper house committee congress has passed authorization bills. our authorizations are far ahead of our appropriations. as a matter of fact. if the senate should diligently try to for the next 10 years we could probably not catch up with the authorizations which are ahead of us. mr. president. in addition to that there is a further matter which should be kept in mind. after a bill has been authorized. it is the duty of the army engineers to give careful scrutiny to the various projects throughout the country. of both a floodcontrol and a rivers and harbors character. and then to make recommendations to the presidents director of the budget. the engineers have to deal with this problem day in and day out. they see the living examples of what happens to an area which is subject to floods. they see industry destroyed. they see people made homeless. they see livestock and land destroyed. their job is to help to fight the floods on the firing line. if i may use that expression. mr. president. i regretted. i think more than any other member of this body. to hear the senator from kansas say yesterday that he had lost confidence in the intelligence and the integrity of the army engineers. but i am sure that on reflection he will find it may have been something which was said only in the heat of debate. because i do not know a single agency of the federal government which over a long period of years has given more faithful service to the public and the nation than has the corps of army engifieers. i know of no agency of the federal government which has been more free from any partisan charge than has the corps of army engineers. i know of no agency in the government of the united - states which has more conscientiously tried to reach proper decisions in regard to the vast program with which it is confronted. the senator from kansas and some of the other opponents of the pending bill have questioned the emergency nature of some of the projects contained in it. i would certainly be the last individual to stand on the floor of the senate of the united states and say that of the vast number of projects included there are not some which could be classed as having a higher priority than others. but i do say to the senate that when a little community on the mississippi river or on one of the other great river systems of our nation is faced with having its homes destroyed. its livestock killed. perhaps its families lost. to that community it is the greatest kind of emergency. it is as great an emergency as one facing us in international affairs. who are we to sit in the senate of the united states and say that when a community of 500 people or 1.000 people is apt to be wiped off the face of the map. that is not the greatest emergency which such a group of americans have ever been called upon to face? i want to say to the able senator from ohio. who i know is very conscientious in all these matters which he discusses. that as i have gone around the country. into the valley of the tennessee. into kentucky. into other states of the union. i have made a point of familiarizing myself insofar as i could with their various problems and inspecting their floodcontrol projects. i was in the city of louisville not long ago. it is a great distance from my own state of california. but in company with the junior senator from kentucky and army engineers i went over their floodcontrol project. i saw the vast industrial capacity in that community which was in danger of flooding. i saw where the floodwaters at various times in the history of louisville had destroyed property and caused great loss to the economic wellbeing of that area. i select that merely as one of innumerable examples. the committee in this instance has endeavored to plug the dike before there are additional vast losses in that section of the country. to pick up my story. the army engineers use their blst estimates as to what. in their opinion. will be the most productive and most economical rate of construction on these projects throughout the nation. and they send their recommendations to the director of the budget. what were those recommendations? the army engineers stated that in their judgment. in the interest of protecting the soil. the industry. and the economy of the nation. $874.441.600 should be spent during the next fiscal year. the next process is that thedirector of the budget. representing the president of the united states. aid having a serious responsibility in the matter of the expenditure of funds. scrutinizes and screens the various recommendations of the army engineers. what was the recommendation after such screening? it was recommended that the army engineers figure of $874.441.600 be reduced to $737.804.300. that is the second process. what happens next? the recommendations go to the house of representatives. which holds a long series of hearings. members of the house committee exercise their judgment and discretion. the house committee finally reported the bill with a figure of $606.558.766. the bill went from the house committee to the floor of the house. and was considered by the house of representatives. after some minor changes. the bill was passed and sent to this body. under our procedure. it went to the committee on appropriations. mr. president. i have served in a state legislative body. and i have been a member of this body for a little more than 3 years. i have never known a harder working committee than the committee on appropriations of the united states senate. it worked long hours. for days on end. hearing the various witnessesnot only members of congress. but everyday citizens from the various communities. including farmers. businessmen. mayors. boards of supervisors. and others who have a vftal interest in the entire program. after the hearings were closed the evidence was examined. the committee worked long hours. far into the night. and finally prepared its report. contrary to some of the implied charges. i wish to say that i have never known a committee whose work was so completely free from any suggestion of logrolling as is the work of the senate committee on appropriations. i can say without fear of contradiction that every project in this bill received as careful. honest. and thoughtful consideration as possible. whether the state was represented on the committee or not. i think i can say without fear of contradiction that if anything. the members of the committee lean over backward in order to make sure that no charge of the nature which i have described could ever be made or implied on the floor of the senate. after going through this process. the committee recommended a figure of $737.804.300. this is under the estimates by $29.217.634. if the united states senate sees fit to sustain its committee on appropriations. that does not end the matter because. as we all know. the bill must go to a conference between the senate and the house. whether some persons recognize it or not. we do have a twohouse congress. and. consequently. when the bill reaches conference there will be a process of give and take as between the views of the two houses of congress. so while the senates figure is almost $30.000.000 under the budget estimate. which was approximately $100.000.000 under the estimate of the army engineers. the practical aspect of the situation is that when the bill is finally enacted into law the figures will be somewhere between the senate figure and the house figure. the able senator from ohio has stated that since we have gone along for 160 years. we can wait another 3. 4. 10. or 50 years if need be. he also mentioned the question of national defense. i submit that national defense does not depend alone upon armies. navies. or air forces. the economic wellbeing of the people. is also an important factor. i fully recognize thb fact that. of course. we wish to operate with a balanced budget. in my judgment we shall operate with a balanced budget if the action of the full committee is approved. i have just had taken from the united press ticker in the anteroom some late figures from the treasury department. showing government expenses and receipts for the current fiscal year through may 14. as compared with a year ago. the comparison is as follows: government expenses and receipts for the current fiscal year through may 14 compared with a year ago this year last year expenses- $30.793. 833. 867.87 $34. 920. 861.258.27 receipts - - 38. 512. 038. 259.94 36. 216. 477. 945.14 surplus -------- 7. 718. 204. 392.07 3.295.616.686.87 cash balance... 5.027.898.903.72 4.139.385.449.16 public debt-...- 252. 201.407.876.30 257. 728.056. 540.85 gold reserve--- 23. 235. 360. 449.03 20.878.077.860.83 the able senator from ohio has made some comment with regard to the question of payment on the national debt. i believe that no member of this body has had more interest in the gradual reduction of the federal debt than has the junior senator from california. it was my amendment a year ago which was placed in the then pending resolution. and which made it a part of the policy that each year we should reduce the debt by at least two and a half billion dollars. i invite the attention of members of the senate to the fact that according to the 6fficial treasury figures. which i have just read. this year we have already reduced the public debt by five and onehalf billion dollars. which in effect. is more than a 2year reduction at the. rate of two and a half billion dollars a year. furthermore. mr. president. in order to get a proper perspective. i think we should have some additional figures in mind. from 1802 through 1948 the total expehditures for rivers and harbors amounted to $3.370.000.000. that was for 146 years of our domestic economy. in building our great harbors. developing our great river slstems. and our systems of canals for the commerce and economy of the nation. in passing. mr. president. i merely mention the fact that that is less. by some $400.000.000. than the amount of the british loan. it is true. of course. that the other day the senator from kansas listed the expenditures for rivers and harbors and floodcontrol works by years. over a period of 11 years. the chart he presented at that time shows that for 11 years we have expended for those two items $2.975.510.688. and that figure includes the appropriation which is now under debate. as a matter of fact. mr. president. just to give some comparisons so that we may keep a proper perspective. let me point out that for the 11year period those total approprations are $774.490.000 less than the british .oan. let us consider the situation under the european recovery plan. a plan of tremendous consequence to the general stability\n800178812|the able senator and other things. he made certain men- dent. that

that i can recalland i think i am not making a mistakethat has not had the approval of the army engineers. there are few. if anythere are a fewthat have not run the gantlet of the bureau of the

of the army engineers that they do not approve projects and report them to the congress. unless there is economic justification for the projects: thatis to say. unless the benefits to be derived will exceed expenditures made in the completion of the projects?\n800178818|the able senator from florida is correct.\n800178819|mr. president. will the senator yield at this point?\n800178820|i yield to the senator from west virginia.\n800178821|it has been brought out in the colloquy very clearly that the army engineers have approved each of these projects. as a matter of fact. each one of them contained in the bill has had prior congressional authorization. has it not?\n800178822|the senator is correct.\n800178823|mr. president. will the senator yield?\n800178824|i yield to the senator from minnesota.\n800178825|mr. president. i have been listening to the remarks of the junior senator from california and i have been greatly impressed. the hydroelectric and floodcontrol projects he mentions are really developing new frontiers in this era of power. i commend the senator for his able remarks. i regret that i must leave to attend a committee session and shall therefore be unable to listen to the remainder of the senators statement.\n800178826|i thank the senator from minnesota. mr. president. i have already detained the senate longer than i had intended. but i felt that some statements had been made on the floor which. in fairness to the army engineers. and in fairness to the committee on appropriations and the subcommittee. led by the very able senator from south dakota should be clarified before a vote is had on the motion of the senator from kansas. i wish to read into the record at this point. mr. president. a copy of a resolution adopted by the western governors conference. held in the city of sacramento. the capital of california. on april 23. 1948. it is as follows:\n800178827|mr. president. will the senator yield temporarily to permit me to make an insertion in the record. to come at the end of his remarks?\n800178828|i yield.\n800178829|mr. president. i ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the record at the conclusion of the remarks of the senator from california an article from the washington daily news dealing with the record of the congress in the present session.\n800178830|without objection. it is so ordered. the article was ordered to be printed in the record. as follows: heres how the record of the eightieth con-. gress. second session. will look when its completed a month from now: stalin was responsible for most of what was done: european recovery program. 70group air force. other increased arms spending. limited draft. mundt bill (if it passes). on the domestic front. the record is practically blank except for tax reduction. house republican leaders will continue to sit on taftellenderwagner housing and federalaidforeducation bills. last year we told you. republican leaders were telling committee chairmen to keep bills bottled up during first session. pass ones that would be popular with voters just before election. but theyre keeping them bottled up this year. too. instead of broadening social security theyve reduced its scope. minimum wage. about which there was much talk. has not been raised. wont be. its still 40 cents. therell be no civilrights legislation. republicans will make noise about antilynching in the closing days. rely on southern fillbuster to kill it. thats now standard procedure. reciprocal trade act will be extended for. 1 year only. bit with crippling amendments. modified rent control has been extended. farm price support will be. republicans are anxious to make as few enemies as possible. hope jokers in reciprocal trade wont be detected. and theyre putting off fight on appointments to atomic energy commission. theres been no national health legislation. republicans hope everyone forgets their inflation controls of special session. they arent working. theyll study better controls. they say. congress isnt even coming close to saving $2.000.000.000 it planned to trim from budget. its just passed deficiency appropriation to make up for savings last year on tax refunds which were quarter of billion bigger than the $800.000.000 republicans boasted of saving. closing days may see congress overriding truman vetoes to give to states vast oil reserves in sea. exempt railroads from antitrust laws. fate of margarine tax repeal bill is in doubt. if taft goes to bat it has a chance.\n800178831|mr. president. will the senator yield?\n800178832|i yield to the senator from michigan.\n800178833|mr. president. on sunday. may 16. carl m. saunders. editor of the jackson city patriot. jackson. mich.. published an editorial in that newspaper entitled suppose all america prayed for peace. the editorial struck me so forcibly that i ask that it be printed in the record as a part of my remarks.\n800178834|mr. president. there are two ways to arm for defense. one materially. the other spiritually. the* governmen itself can arm only materially. but the people. who compose the government. must arm spiritually if we are to defend america. today when the great nations of the world are concentrating on arming the people of their countries with weapons of war in the hope of preserving the peace. it is vital that we think constructively and objectively. with the emphasis on billions of dollars. on worldly goods. on material resources. and armament. can we pause for a moment and feel the futility of such emphasis? each nation is intent upon the most devastating and deadly weapons of destruction before others can outproduce them. where can it lead but to the end of civilization? the bible has warned us that faith without works is dead. have we lost the faith and clung to the works of destruction only? can we not seriously. with honesty of purpose. try a new approach. for us. but one old as the ages? the approach of faith faith in each other as human beings. faith in god to preserve the human beings he created. the faith that moves mountains of distrust and enmity. of hatred and horror. the faith that believes in prayer. with sublime belief in that faith. we should petition the president to declare a period of prayer for peace. and with a nation united in that prayer. other nations could join in the beginning of a new world. mr. piesident. i therefore ask unanimous consent to introduce a joint resolution requesting the president to issue a proclamation designating memorial day. may 30. 1948. as a day for nationwide prayer for peace. the joint resolution reads as follows: joint resolution requesting the president to issue a proclamation designating memorial day. 1948. as a day for nationwide prayer for peace resolved. etc.. that the president is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the united states to observe memorial day. 1948. by praying. each in accordance with his religious faith. for permanent peace. designating a period during such day in which all the people of the united states may unite in prayer for a permanent peace. and calling upon all the people of the united states to unite in prayer at such time. and calling upon the newspapers. radio stations. and all other mediums of the nation. to join in observing such day and such period of prayer.\n800178835|without objection. the joint resolution will - be received and appropriately referred. the joint resolution (s. j. res. 217) requesting the president to issue a proclamation designating memorial day. 1948. as a day for a nationwide prayer for peace. introduced by mr. ferguson. was rece ived. read twice by its title. and referred to the committee on the judiciary.\n800178836|mr. president. will the senator yield?\n800178837|i shall be glad to yield to the senator from wisconsin.\n800178838|mr. president. the statement of the distinguished senator from michigan does himself honor and honors this august body. i think i have on another occasion called attention to the fact that last summer. as i returned to this country on the queen elizabeth. i was introduced to mr. vishinsky. who is the leader of the russian delegation to the united nations. i was introduced by mr. mcneil. the head of the british delegation. the queen elizabeth was sailing along at a good clip. the wind was blowing. the crowd was pretty jolly. i took vishinsky by the hand and held on to his hand. looked him directly in the eye and said. mr. vishinsky. every night i pray that britain. russia. america. and all the other nations of the earth may have a sincere desire for peace and may be adequate to consummate that desire by some international organization. vishinsky. through his interpreter. said. i do not pray. that is why i say the resolution and the remarks of the distinguished senator from michigan do honor to himself and to this august body. mr. president. at this time i ask that there be inserted in the record an article published in march 1941 by alexis carrel. the great physicist and scientist. on the meaning of prayer. i think it is the most significant article that has ever been penned by a human being. i inserted it in the record on march 17. 1941. on another occasion when we as a people found ourselves in deep water.\n800178839|mr. president. i also ask that there be inserted in the record the definitions of prayer as given by sincere thinkers throughout the centuries. they will be found at page 9050 of november 21. 1942. starting with montgomery. who said: prayer is the souls sincere desire. uttered or unexpressed. the motion of a hidden fire that trembles in the breast.\n800178840|mr. president. as we reckon time. human life is buta short voyage. and. with hubbard. we can say: teach me to know and observe the rules of the game. let me never lack due sense of humor. preserve me from growing stogy and unimaginative. deliver me from atrophy of the emotions. i desire to radiate health. cheerfulness. calm. courage. and good will. to live without hate. jealousy. envy. fear. i wish others to live their lives. too. up to their highest. fullest. and best. to that end i pray that i may never meddle. interfere. dictate. give advice that is not wanted. or assist when my services are not needed. if i can help people. i will do it by giving them a chance to help themselves. and if i can uplift or inspire. let it be by example. inference. and suggestion rather than by injunction and dictation. i desire to be radiant. mr. president. it was my privilege to read the presidents recent thanksgiving message. the first sentence of the presidents proclanation. it is a good thing to give thanks unto the lord. arrests my attention. did we ever ask ourselves. why is it a good thing to give thanks unto the lord? what is the effect upon us and upon others who hear us? the answer must be that the expression of gratitude is a form of worship by which man renews himself by drawing closer to his maker. plutarch said: the worship most acceptable to god comes from a thankful and a cheerful heart. the sentence quoted by the president comes from the ninetysecond psalm. all through the scripture we find the admonition to give thanks. to rejoice in all ways. the one hundred and eighteenth psalm states the rule thus: 0 give thanks unto the lord. for he is good: for his mercy endureth forever. when we give thanks. we engage in the . process of rejoicing . thus the psalmist says: let mount zion rejoice. let the daughters of judah be glad. (fortyeighth psalm.) offer unto god thanksgiving. (fiftieth psalm.) 0 sing unto the lord a new song: for he hath done marvelous things. (ninetyeighth psalm.) 0 give thanks unto the lord. call upon his name. (one hundred and fifth psalm.) that thought carries over in the new testament. in the first chapter of the book of colossians we find: giving thanks unto the father. which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. in the third chapter of the book of colossians we find: let the peace of god rule your hearts. * * * and be ye thankful. in the first book of thessalonians. chapter 5. we are told: in everything give thanks: for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you. the great teacher. the wayshower. said. father. i thank thee that thou hast heard me. and i knew that thou hearest me always. he taught that godis a spirit. and that in him we live. and move. and have our being. god certainly dwells in a thankful heartin the mind that is filled with gratitude.\n800178841|mr. president. i believe that more things are accomplished by right prayer than by any other force known to man. when i make that statement. it is bolstered by a scientist. dr. carrel. who says that prayer is more significant than is gravity. in this article which i have taken from the readers digest. it is said: prayer is a force as real as terrestrial gravity. as a physician. i have seen men. after all other therapy had failed. lifted out of disease and melancholy by the serene effort of prayer. * * * properly understood. prayer is a mature activity indispensable to the fullest development of personalitythe ultimate integration of mans highest faculties. * * * prayer. like radium. is a source of luminous. selfgenerating energy. i repeat for the third time. the distinguished senator from michigan. in this political body. does himself honor and does the senate honor by introducing this joint resolution and asking for action on it.\n800178842|mr. president. what i am about to announce. of course. depends upon the approval of the senate. it is the intention at present that the senate shall proceed to debate the pending question for a full session this afternoon. if necessary. in order to get a vote on the pending motion today if possible.\n800178843|mr. president. will the senator fromnebraska yield?\n800178844|i yield to the senator from kentucky.\n800178845|i wish to associate myself with the senator in expressing the hope that we can get a vote on the motion now pending. the motion will probably determine what is to happen in regard to the bill. and in view of our crowded calendar. i hope we may be able to conclude the debate and get a vote this afternoon.\n800178846|i thank the minority leader for this expression. which i think represents the desire of the members of the senate. so we will work toward that goal in the remaining time left this afternoon. if the motion shall prevail. as the distinguished minority leader has said. it will mean the end of the consideration of the civilfunctions appropriation bill for a while at least. if it shall not prevail. it is the intention to continue with the bill until it shall be disposed of. following action on the motion and the bill. it is the intention to bring up the displacedpersons bill. and it is the hope that we may conclude its consideration. if possible. by friday of this week at least. if not before. if it shall run until friday. it is the intention then to adjourn until the following monday. so that there may be a morning hour. and at a later date there will be a unanimousconsent request for a call of the legislative calendar for the consideration of measures to which there is objection and for the disposition of a motion or two on the calendar at that time. if possible. inasmuch as the distinguished senator from michigan has introduced a joint resolution and mentioned the date of may 30. i suggest to the senate that the intention is now. if it shall meet with approval of the senate. for the senate to recess or adjourn on may 28 until the following tuesday morning. in view of the fact that monday. may 31. will be a holiday.\n800178847|if the senator will yield. the 30th of may. which is decoration day. will fall on sunday. so the holiday will occur on monday. and it will be the purpose to adjourn from friday to tuesday.\n800178848|the senator is correct. and i thank him once again for his remarks. when the recess is taken. i repeat. it will be from friday night until the following tuesday noon. of course. that depends upon the approval of the senate. but those are the plans. and i trust they will meet with the approval of the members of the senate. i once again admonish those who are about to speak on the bill now pending that it is very much desired that a vote be had on the motion to recommit tonight. and then that the senate may proceed with the bill itself. in the event it shall not be recommitted. but if it shall be recommitted. the intention will be to take up the displacedpersons measure and proceed with that.\n800178849|mr. president. my understanding is that there is a unanimous request made by the distinguished senator from louisiana that a speech on civil functions be read. which speech was prepared by the late senator overton. of louisiana. i think it is proper and fitting at this time to ask that that speech be read under the unanimousconsent rule. and i make that request.\n800178850|without objection. the clerk will read.\n800178851|mr. president. in view of the very unusual circumstances. i feel that there should be a quorum present. i therefore suggest the absence of a quorum.\n800178852|the clerk will call the roll.\n800178853|seventyseven senators having answered to their names. a quorum is present. under the order of the senate. the clerk will read the speech on the pending bill which had been prepared by the late senator overton. of louisiana.\n800178854|mr. president. the senator from louisiana is absent because of the death of his distinguished colleague. at his request. i wish to read the speech of the senator from louisiana on the pending motion. it is as follows: i wish to give my unqualified support to h. r. 5524 as reported out by the appropriations committee. and to urge its adoption by the senate. additionally. i wish to endorse in full the intellectual and forthright remarks of my late colleague. senator overton. which remarks have been presented in absentia and read by the clerk of the senate. generally speaking. in the past i have followed the lead of my colleague in matters affecting flood control and rivers and harbors improvements. ofmy own knowledge. however. as a result of careful study of the problems involved. i am familiar with the proposed legislation and its importance to the welfare of the country. before discussing this measure insofar as it affects my own state. let me say that my observations of the last 12 years lead me to the conclusion that there is nothing in the actions and recommendations of the corps of engineers which could possibly indicate that they are in any way motivated. in their conclusions and recommendations. by anything but their desire to perform their duty in the fearless and efficient manner which for so many years has characterized their activities. knowing that the engineers possess the professional capacity to properly appraise the dangers which face us as a result of the rampages of nature. of course i am inclined to follow. and i think all of us should be guided by their recommendations and professional analysis of our requirements rather than the general economic conclusions reached by laymen who without rhyme or reason. would tinker witfl the safety of the lands and lives of citizens of the united states. i have. of course. carefully examined the proposed legislation with respect to the state of louisiana. which. containing the lower end and mouths of the mississippi river. has the greatest floodcontrol problem in the united states. my state is subject to flood by the excess waters draining from all or a part of 31 states. comprising an area that is 41 percent of the united states. let me briefly describe for you what is the scope and status of the floodcontrol project for the mississippi river and tributaries. it comprises: (a) the protection of the great basins of the lower alluvial valley from headwater floods of the mississippi river. (b) the protection of certain areas from inundation by backwaters of the mississippi river. (c) the protection of the st. francis and yazoo basins from floods of the st. francis and yazoo river systems and the protection of certain areas of the north banks of lower white river and lower arkansas river. (d) the improvement of numerous interior streams for the dual purposes of flood control and improved drainage. (e) the stabilization of the banks and channel of the mississippi river. (f) channel improvement for open river navigation and the improvement of certain harbors. protection against headwater floods of the mississippi river is accomplished by building levees which. in general. extend from high ground at the heads of the several basins into which the valley naturally divides to the major tributaries which normally form their lower boundaries. to cite an example. the territory subject to overflow in arkansas and louisiana between the arkansas river and red river is known as the tensas basin. it is protected by a levee which starts at high ground on the arkansas river at pine bluff and extends without a break for 381 miles to point breeze. la.. near the mouth of the red river. its average height is 25 feet and its width at ground level about 250 feet. in the authorized project there are 1.705 miles of mainline levee and an equal mileage of smaller embankment on tributaries and in floodways and backwater areas. i agree that the amount of $67.500.000 recommended by the senate committee is the minimum amount that would permit the construction. efficiency. and progress required to complete the project at minimum cost to the government and in a reasonable length of time. the budget estimate of $70.000.000 for construction and maintenance cannot be reduced by $10.000.000. as provided by the house. without seriously curtailing operations essential to optimum construction and maintenance of the integrity of the substantial works so far completed. there are still many miles of substandard levees which must be brought to project grade and section. there are miles of caving banks where new revetments must be placed or old revetments repaired. there are partially completed floodways where premature operation would cause widespread damages. and there are authorized. but incompleted. works in minor tributary basins that have suffered annually from floods that could have been prevented if funds had been available to complete the authorized works. may i add at this point that in the matter of navigation improvements louisiana is traversed from north to south by the greatest inland waterway in the world. the mississippi river. and from east to west by the gulf intercoastal waterway on which traffic has far exceeded the conservative estimates of the corps of engineers made at the time this waterway was authorized. in new orleans the state has one of the nations greatest seaports and at baton rouge. the head of seagoing navigation there is located the largest oil refinery in the world. i should like the record to show the justification for the various rivers and harbors projects within louisiana. as follows: the 1946 river and harbor act adopted a modification of the project for calcasieu river and pass to provide for deepening the existing jetty and approach channel in the gulf of mexico from 92 to 8 feet and deepening the channel from the inner end of the jetty channel to lake charles from 30 to 35 feet. together with a 35foot channel around clooney island. funds provided in the 1948 appropriation are being applied to deepening the clooney island channel and inauguration of deepening the main 35foot channel southerly from lake charles. while the approved budget estimate was to be applied to completion of the 35foot main channel. a reduction in the 1949 estimate will therefore postpone completion of the 35foot channel until a later year. completion of the 35foot channel will permit use of deeperdraft tankers for oil shipments with resultant savings in transportation costs. commerce during 1946 amounted to 10.052.000 tons. waterway from empire. la.. to the gulf of mexico: the 1946 river and harbor act adopted a project providing for the construction of a channel 9 feet deep. 80 feet wide. extending southerly from the stateowned doullut canal at empire by natural channels and land cuts to and through pelican island to the gulf of mexico with initial jetty construction to 6foot contour and later to the 9foot contour. if found necessary. funds provided in the 1948 appropriation are being applied to the dredging of the channel to the gulf of mexico. while the $638.000 provided in the approved budget estimate was to have been applied to the construction of jetties to the 6foot contour in the gulf of mexico and dredging the channel between these structures. this waterway when completed will be of considerable value in the operation of existing oil fields and the development of new oil fields in the tributary area. however. that portion of the waterway now being provided cannot be used until the channel into the gulf is completed. intracoastal waterway. apalachee bay. fla.. to the mexican border: construction of a main waterway 12 feet deep. 125 to 150 feet wide. authorized in 1942. has been completed. the 1945 and 1946 river and harbor act provided for alternate connection. 12 feet deep. with the mississippi river in the vicinity of algiers. la.. plaqueminemorgan city alternate route. 12 feet deep. salt water guard lock 231 miles west of harvey lock and about 8 miles east of the calcasieu river. and an 8foot canal between the main waterway and franklin. la. funds available are being applied to excavation. foundations. and floors for the algiers and the salt water guard locks. the franklin canal is being completed with advanced funds. the 1949 budget estimate included $2.920.700 for continuation of work on the algiers lock. for drainage structures. and bridge construction. and $450.000 for the salt water guard lock. the reduction in the amount allowed for 1949 will result in postponement of construction of the railroad bridge and reduce construction work on drainage facilities that must be provided prior to excavation of the navigation canal. the reduced amount available for construction of drainage structures will result in a delay of approximately 1 year. delay in initiating the cqnstruction of the railroad crossing will likewise result in prolonging the project. commerce on the intracoastal waterway. new orleans district. during 1946. was 11.215.000 tons west of the mississippi. the capacity of the existing route is overtaxed by this volume of traffic and it is important that the alternate route be completed as soon as practicable. overtonred river waterway. louisiana and arkansas: red river rises in new mexico and flows easterly and southeasterly for 1.300 miles. entering the mississippi river through old river near phillipston. la. the project provides for a 9- by 100foot channel from the mississippi river through old river and red river. approximately 31 miles. thence by a lateral canal across the mississippired river backwater area along the right bank to shreveport. la.. for 175 miles through nine locks. each 55 by 650 feet. the waterway will serve a trade area bounded by the watershed of the red river in louisiana. which contains the commercial region tributary to shreveport in northeastern texas. southeastern oklahoma. and southwestern arkansas. principal industries within the area are petroleum. lumber. glass. fertilizer. grain. sand and gravel. chemicals. boxes. and clothing. agricultural commodities include cotton. corn. hay. oats. wheat. peanuts. and garden vegetables. about 1.100.000 tons of commerce will develop on this waterway at an estimated annual saving of $4.000.000 in transportation costs. in addition. it is estimated that incidental drainage benefits of about $350.000 annually would result from construction of the lateral canal. further benefits will conslst of greater operating economies for tows now using the lower red river en route to or from ports on the ouachita river. the ratio of benefits to costs is 1.28:1. the amount that could be profitably expended during 1949 would be applied to preparation of plans and specifications and initiation of construction of the lateral canal. pearl river. miss. and la.: the 1935 river and harbor act adopted a project providing for the improvement of the pearl river to provide a channel 7 feet deep from lake borgne to bogalusa. la.. a distance of about 60 miles. by dredging. snagging. cutoffs. and lock construction. dredging of the waterway to project dimensions in the lower 20mile reach has been completed. and available funds are being applied to completion of lock no. 1 and inauguration of construction of lock no. 2. under a continuing contract. the budget estimate of $3.509.500 was intended for completion of lock no. 2. the construction of the remaining third lock. and bague chitto and pools bluff sills. the amount allowed by the house is insufficient to. complete lock no. 2. by an amount of about $200.000. and will result in suspension of work under that contract. the effective utilization of the pearl river project is predicated on the total completion of the project. and very little benefit can be derived from that portion of the project already constructed and to be constructed under the*house allowance for 1949. since local interests provided the funds for acquisition of rightsofway. payment for damages and construction of terminal facilities. through a bond issue in 1938. and since all work on the project was suspended during the war. it is believed that completion should not be further delayed. with reference to the general floodcontrol projects in louisiana. i should like to describe and give the status and justification for the following: aloharigolette area. louisiana: the project consists of enlargement of existing levees from mile 151 to mile 141 and extension of those levees to the hills on the left bank of bayou rigolette at mile 124 with two floodgates at bayou crossings. construction of a diversion ditch from bayou darrow to saline bayou and clearing and snagging saline bayou from the end of the diversion ditch to bayou rigolette. clearing and snagging bayou rigolette from mile 21.5 to its mouth and closing the head of bayou darrow. the project when completed will protect approximately 46.000 acres of alluvial plain in the aloharigolette area. construction of the project is under way and will be about 34 percent complete by june 30. 1948. the amount of $500.000 allowed by the house will permit continuation of construction of the levee between miles 135 and 124. it will not permit completion of the levees from mile 151 to mile 135 and construction of the floodgate structure on bayou rigolette. full protection for the area will not be provided until the levees and floodgate structure are completed. completion of the project will be delayed if the amount of $549.600 is not restored for prosecution of the project and the aloharigolette area will remain subject to damaging floods for a period of at least one additional year. bayou bodcau. red chute. and loggy bayou. louisiana: this project. in conjunction with the bayou bodcau reservoir now under construction. will greatly reduce flood damage in the flood.plain between the dam site and the limit of the red river backwater. headwater stages in loggy bayou will be reduced and a more rapid removal of backwater when red river recedes will result. the average annual benefits are estimated at $24.000. bayou teche and vermilion. la.: the project consists of a channel excavation for 21 miles in bayou teche. excavation of a navigable channel from vermilion bay to intracoastal waterway. excavation of a 100foot channel in vermilion river from the intracoastal waterway to lafayette. la.. and excavation of a nonnavigable flood channel from lafayette to the junction of bayous bourfeau and fusilier. the project is under construction and the navigable channel from the intracoastal waterway to vermilion bay and portions of the navigable channel from the intradoastal waterway to lafayette and the flood channel above lafayette have been completed. clearing and snagging on vermilion river and bay fusilier channel enlargement on bayou teche and reconstruction of the woodlawn bridge over vermilion river are in progress and will be substantially completed by the end of fiscal year1948. the project as a whole will be about 73 percent complete on june 30. 1948. the amount of $200.000 allowed by the house will permit completion of bridge alterations on the vermilion river and continued channel excavation on the vermilion river below abbeville. it will not permit completion of channel enlargement on the vermilion river below abbeville and initiation and completion of channel work above ruth canal as contemplated by the construction schedule for this project. early completion of the project is essential for protection of the basin from constantly recurring flood damages to the crops. livestock. improvements. and roads during floods which occur almost yearly and more serious damages resulting from major floods like those of 1913. 1940. and 1947. completion of the project will be delayed beyond fiscal year 1949 if the amount of $400.000is not restored for prosecution of the work resulting in the delay of at least 1 year and realization of floodcontrol benefits and probable increased costs for the project as a whole due to the necessity for entering into contracts involving less yardage than can be economically handled by dredging contractors. mermentau river. la.: the project consists of channel enlargement of the lower mermentau river below grand lake and construction of a gated control structure at catfish point. channel enlargement of the north prong of schooner bayou. and channel enlargement and realinement of the existing navigation project from vermilion bay to white lake and from white lake to grand lake. construction of the channel - enlargement of the mermentau river below grand lake is under way and construction of the control structure at catfish point will be initiated in fiscal year 1948. the project as a whole will be 18 percent complete by june 30. 1948. the amount of $1.000.000 allowed by the house will permit completion of the mermentau river control structure at catfish point. it will not permit completion of the enlargement of the mermentau river and initiation and completion of the white lakevermilion bay control structure at schooner bayou lock as contemplated in the construction schedule for this project. completion of the project will be delayed if the amount of $1.500.000 is not restored for prosecution of the work resulting in a delay in realization of benefits from the project consisting of flood control and salinity control for large areas of rice lands and low prairie croplands in the mermentau river area. pineville. la.: the project. when completed. will protect property at pineville. la.. valued at approximately. $745.000. and approximately 700 acres of agricultural land from red river floods. it is believed urgent to complete the project during the fiscal year 1949 in order to realize the maximum benefits and to alleviate the possible danger of flooding from incompleted. works. the estimate of average annual benefits is $14.000. red river below denison dam: this project is an integral part of the comprehensive plan for the .protection of the valley of red river. pending completion of the reservoir system thelevees will provide protection against floods equivalent to. that of 1945 and prevent an annual flood loss of about $2.000.000. the operation of tfe reservoirs will provide additional freeboard and safety to the levees. the systematic construction of bankstabilization works will obviate the necessity of levee setbacks at locations where they would require costly relocation of railroads. highways. and other utilities. it will save from destruction valuable lands and improvements which would otherwise be lost on account of bank caving. shreveport. la.: the project consists of revetments and dikes constructed at locations where caving banks endanger the controlling levees and highly developed urban property in the vicinity of shreveport. bossier city..and their suburbs. corstruction of the project has been initiated and during fiscal year 1948 will be advanced from 18 to 60 percent completion. the amount of $1.000.000 allowed by the house will permit construction of stabilization works in douglass island bend and at miles 311 to 312 on the right bank of the river. it will not permit completion of works in honore bend on the left bank during fiscal year 1949. completion of the project will be delayed if the amount of $475.000 is not restored for prosecution of the project and bank caving will continue along unprotected portions of the river front for at least an additional year with possible damage to waterfront structures and property. jonesville. la.: this project provides for the construction of earth levees and concrete flood wall encircling the town of jonesville. la.. to provide protection against floodwaters of the ouachita. red. and mississippi rivers. this town is located on the right bank of black river in catahoula parish. la.. 56 miles above its mouth at the .junction of the ouachita and little rivers. a drainage structure and pumping plant for disposal of interior drainage would be provided. no work has been done on this project. funds are needed in the fiscal year 1949 for preparation of construction plans and specifications and for completion of construction of the project. the allocation of $368.000 will be applied for construction of the levees. concrete flood walls. drainage structures. and pumping plant. the town of jonesville. la.. with a 1940 population of 2.080. is located in the vast backwater area of red river. which is subject to annual overflow by backwaters of the red and mississippi rivers. in 1945 an emergency levee was constructed at a cost of $30.000 to the federal government and $15.000 to local interests to provide interim protection during -the flood of that year. this levee is deficient in giade and section and its alinement does not encompass a large area. the proposed works will provide complete flood protection to public and private property. utilities. equipment. and fixtures. and eliminate the cost of evacuation of inhabitants. moving mercantile stocks and household goods during flood periods. the protected town of jonesville would become a safe haven of refuge for the rural population of a large agricultural area in the unprotected backwater region. the average annual benefits are estimated at $27.000. lake pontchartrain. la.: the project provides for the reconstruction and enlargement of the existing protective levee along the lake pontchartrain shore in jefferson parish. la.. and the return protection levees along the orleans and st. charles parish. the total work consists of 10 miles of lakeshore levee and 71./z miles of return levee. construction has not been initiated. funds are needed in fiscal year 1949 for initiation of construction. the allocation of $900.000 of federal funds. together with funds provided by local interests. will be used to prepare plans and specifications for the work and enlarging the low sections of the existing embankment as the first stage of construction. in view of the large amount of damage done during the hurricane of september 1947 a review rbport covering this project is now being prepared. this report gives consideration to the provision of a higher degree of flood protection than is contemplated under the existing project. the portion considered in the review report has an estimated federal cost of about $4.500.000 and the cost to local interest of $1.400.000. any work performed at this time on the existingproject will not be wasted as the modified project will follow the same alinement as the existing project. records show that destructive tides occurred along the gulf of mexico coast east of the mississippi river in 1901 and 1915 and were repeated in the hurricane of 1947. records of dangers to property along the lake front in jefferson parish during the early storms are not available because of the lack of development in that area and residential development has progressed at a rapid rate by extending lakeward and into reclaimed marshlands. during the hurricane of september 19. 1947. excessive tide and storm wave action caused many serious breaks in the lakeshore embankment allowing free passage of lake waters into the lower areas behind the levee. during that hurricane the crown elevation of weakened sections of the embankment were reduced and a total length of 4.200 feet crevassed. floodwaters in residential sections as far as 21/8 miles from the lake were flooded with actual depths ranging up to 8 feet. of the total 50squaremile area of jefferson parish between lake pontchartrain and the mississippi river. with an assessed value of $21.000.000. approximately 39 square miles were inundated. the 3 pumping stations which normally removed the interior drainage were flooded and out of operation as was the parish incinerator and sewagedisposal plant. creating a serious health hazard to about 25.000 people. an international airport was closed. urban bus lines interrupted. public schools made untenable. stock of many small mercantile establishments damaged by the water. ad many dairy and poultry farm stock destroyed. about 2.000 homes were damaged. 800 families were evacuated. and home furnishings. automobiles. and personal effects damaged or destroyed. the average annual benefits are estimated in excess of $500.000. as i stated to the committee when i appeared before it. i deemed this project very urgent in that in the last 6 months the people living on the south shore of the lake at a place known as metairie have been overflooded twice. during september most of the inhabitants living in that area suffered tremendously because of the flood. many lost their meager savings and several lost their lives. in that area there are over 36.000 people. and i am informed that there were from two to three thousand residents of that section who were compelled to move out and live for from 1 to 2 months with neighbors. my distinguished colleagie the senator from south dakota [mr. gusey] was in that ylcinity right after the flood of last fall. there was a similar flood shortly after he left. this project is vital to the interests of the city of new orleans and its suburban areas. the souths largest city is entitled to the protection which this project affords. it is natural that i should ekamine this appropriation bill with particular reference to my own state and refer to the work i have briefly outlined. however. from a nationwide standpoint i want also to add my voice to that of the able senator from south dakota who conducted the painstaking and impartial hearings on this bill and who has made an eloquent presentation of the matter to the senate. in short. when we consider the manner in which the work contemplated becomes authorized. the remarkable record of sound engineering and impartial recommendations established by the executive agency under whose jurisdiction the congress has placed this work. the urgent. yes desperate. need for these improvements in our own country. not some foreign country. and the great secondary benefit that such improvements will have in helping this nation to fulfill the foreign commitments it has already made. i am amazed. even astounded. at the illadvised and unsubstantiated charges that some senators have made regarding the measure before the senate. it has not been many years since this congress. tired and disgusted with superplanners who wasted public funds and infinite time in planning the plans to plan natural resource development. rose almost in unity and legislated the natural resources planning board out of existence. the primary objection was that nothing tangible was being accomplished. now some senators find themselves in the uncomfortable position of attacking a program because something very real and tangible is being accomplished. these works for which appropriations are now being asked are not boondogglingneither are they hastily prepared visionary schemes. there is not a single project for which funds are asked that has not traveled through a most rigorous engineering tnd economic examination. not only once but again and again as pointed out by the senator from south dakota. this procedure is prescribed by laws adopted by the congress and is meticulously prosecuted by the corps of engineers. repeated hearings are held before local people. before authorization committees of both the house and senate. before appropriation committees of both the house and senate. and before the bureau of the budget. comments are secured from governors and state agenciescoordination with interested federal agencies is carried out. under these circumstances it is difficult for me to understand why any senator would attack this whole program simply because there is a greater need for these improvements in some states than in others. on my second point. namely the excellent record of sound engineering and impartial recommendations established by the corps of engineers under whose jurisdiction this work is placed. i need say little by way of enlargement. in fact there is little that i or any other senator can say that will add to or subtract from the superior record that has been established over a period of 150 years. on the third point concerning the need for and benefit of this work to our own country a great deal can be said. let me mention just one or two highlights. aside from the human suffering and economic loss to established industry occasioned by floods i call attention to the fact that there are hundreds of thousands of acres in the humid agricultural regions of these united states that are uninhabitable and unproductive because of flood hazards and poor drainage. logically in a stepbystep manner these lands are being brought into production by the very projects we have before us now. we can make no greater contribution to the welfare of this nation and to our effort to fulfill our foreign commitments than to proceed with this work at the maximum practical rate. does the senate realize that not a single completed federal floodcontrol project has failed to perform its desired function in flood? is it realized that conservative impartial estimates of the benefits of completed projects indicate on an overall basis that these projects will afford savings that equal their original cost in from 6 to 10 years? in the alluvial valley of the lower mississippi river the project with which i am most familiar has prevented damages estimated at nearly $5.000.000.000 since the last direct overflow in 1927. the federal expenditure on the plan that has afforded these great benefits has been about $600.000.000 over that 20year period. in other words. eight times the cost of the work to date has already been saved. the story in the ohio river basin is much the same. and the story in the other major river basins will be the same if we get on with our work. in the case of navigation our prewar tonnages have increased from 50 to 100 percent. single cargoes are bigger and required depths are greater. do we want to continue to progress or do we want to turn the clock back? when we are contemplating the expenditure of billions of dollars overseas to rehabilitate foreign nations do we want to hamper the logical development of our own countryi think not. furthermore. i challenge anyone to prove that there is any other way under the sun that we can spend the amount asked for in this bill to greater advantage toward accomplishing the foreign commitments already made or contemplated. in the long run i am confident that increasing our agricultural production and industrial capacity at home by expenditures for flood control and navigation improvements will pay greater dividends toward fulfilling our foreign program than any equivalent expenditures as a dole to foreign nations. before closing i want to say just a word or two about the size of this program in dollars and cents. there has been considerable said by some senators in comparing this program with the dollarandcent size of prewar programs. is there a single senator in this chamber who finds that he can buy a steak. a pound of butter. a suit of clothes. or an automobile for the same price he paid before the war? the answer. of course. is no and needless to add no senator is receiving the same pay he did before the war. the same story applies to the work we have under consideration. in fact the overall construction price index shows that it took $1.83 in late 1947 to accomplish what $1 would accomplish in 1940. costs are still rising. add to this fact the wellknown situation that much of this internal improvement work was rightly curtailed during the war and that the people back home are now clamoring for the improvements they have patiently waited for. and you must conclude as i do that double the prewar program in dollars and cents is not an unreasonable increase. yes. mr. president. i wish to be on record as giving my unqualified support to h. r. 5524 as reported out by the senate appropriations committee and to urge its adoption. i should. of course. have preferred an even more elaborate appropriation for the outlined projects. but although construction of some projects will be delayed. the amount recommended by the senate appropriations committee represents a substantial improvement over the bill as passed by the house. to do any less than is presently being recommended would indeed be folly. mr. president. at the request of the senator from louisiana i have read the speech which he would have delivered had it been possible for him to be in the chamber today.\n800178855|mr. president. from the joint committee on the economic report. i ask unanimous consent to submit a report dealing with the 1948 economic report of the president. this report consists of the committee findings. a summary of the presidents report. and a long analysis of the presidents report by the staff of the joint committee. it also includes a dissenting minority report signed by the senator from wyoming and others. attached are various exhibits. i request that the report be printed.\n800178856|without objection. the report will be received and printed.\n800178857|mr. president. i ask unanimous consent that when the senate takes a recess at the close of the session today. it recess until thursday next at noon.\n800178858|mr. president. i object.\n800178859|subsequently said: mr. president. i believe i misspoke with respect to the day to which i asked unanimous consent to recess. it is tomorrow. wednesday next. at noon. i renew my unanimousconsent request.\n800178860|mr. president. i renew the objection.\n800178861|the question is on the motion of the senator from kansas . for. himself. the senator from new hampshire . and the senator from michigan . to recommit the bill with certain instructions.\n800178862|mr. president. i rise to oppose the minority reporton house bill 5524. and in opposition to the motion to recommit the majority report. i was very much interested in the speech made earlier this afternoon by my good friend the distinguished senior senator from ohio . i respect his views on this question. as on all other matters. in this instance. however. i find myself in disagreement with him. particularly as to some of the premises which the senator from ohio laid down in his speech. toward the end of his speech he raised what i think is the vital question for us to consider in determining the position we should take on this particular bill. i think i quote the senator from ohio correctly when i say that he said in effect that the question before us is one of weighing the importance of different public expenditures. on that point i am in agreement with the senator from ohio because i think the question before us is a question of weighing the importance of different public expenditures. however. in answering that question. i have come to a position diametrically opposed to that taken by the senator from ohio. because i think the projects which are covered by this particular bill are of such vital importance to the security and the economic welfare of our nation that this bill should be passed. and the motion based upon the minority views should be rejected. earlier in his speech the distinguished senator from ohio referred several times to these projects as public works projects. he pointed out again the theory which he has so ably defended not only in the senate but elsewhere in the country in months past. namely. that in times of boom we should. in effect. put public works on the shelf. to take them down in times of slackened. employment. slackened business. and approaching depression. i would make two points in presenting my point of view in contrast with the point of view of the senator from ohio on that particular matter. i do not deny that these are public works by definition. in the sense that we are using. public funds for the building of these projects. such as great power projects and river and floodcontrol development and harbordevelopment projects. nevertheless. i wish to point out that they are also in a very real economic sense private works. in that i think they are essential to the advaficement of the best interests of our privateproperty economy. they are essential in order to develop to the maximum extent possible. in the shortest period of time. an expanding economy in the united states. the distinguished senator from ohio talks in terms of a balanced budget and in terms of a $40.000.000.000 budget. which is now ours. he stresses the importance of paying $2.500.000.000 on the national debt. i agree with the senator from ohio that we should be thinking and acting in terms of a balanced budget. but i do not agree with him that at the present time in our government we are dealing with a scientific. businesslike budget. the budget we have is not a sound business budget. no .corporation or large businesd would think of building a budget on the same accounting basis which we use in building our federal budget. on other occasions i have mentioned this point on the floor of the senate. i think budget reform is inherent in the argument that is before us now. i wish to repeat that i think we should talk in terms of a balanced budget only in the sense that we talk in terms of a budget which has taken out of it. and set over to one side. separate and distinct from an expenditures budget. insofar as administrative costs of government are concerned. all capital investments and all money that goes into selfliquidating projects. what we have at the present time in the form of a federal budget. mr. president. is really a hodgepodge budget in which we include socalled expenditures for the administration of government itself and also include the money that is paid out for capital investments. thus. we include in the budget as expense money which is .necessary for the building of great projects that are necessary in order to expand our economy. but which after all are. for the most part. selfliquidating projects. i say it is error to speak in terms of a balanced budget. so far as the federal budget is concerned. as long as we follow such accounting principles. i support the principle of a balanced budget but i say that we should separate from that budget these vital. selfliquidating. capital investments. we should not be including them. it seems to me. in a socalled balanced federal budget. this point of these projects being selfliquidating always raises a question of fact on this subject. mr. president. the question of whether most of these major projects. particularly the projects for flood control. reclamation. and the projects for power development. will. in due course of time. in fact be selfliquidating. in taking my position on issues in the senate of the united states. i always seek to find the answer to the question. what are the facts? on the basis of such research as i have been able to make to date. since i have been in the senate studying this particular problem. and on the basis of all the data that have been made available to me from the various government departments and agencies concerned with these projects. i am of the opinion that the fact is that. in the main. these major projects will in the course of years be selfliquidating. if i am correct in that finding of factand it is the only finding i can make on the basis of the data which have been supplied to me by the departments that have jurisdiction and control and supervision over these projectsthen. mr. president. i am not going to join in any view presented by any member of the senate that we should consider these projects within the concept of a balanced budget. i think they must be considered aside from and independent of a budget which goes to the question of administrative costs for the operation of the government itself. we ought to look upon these projects. then. as federal projects in the sense that they will return into the united states treasury. in the form of new tax dollars flowing from the wealth which these projects will produce over the years. much more money than we shall ever invest in their original cost. i think that statement marks as clearly as i can mark. at least. one line of difference which exists between the proponents of this bill and those who are in favor of the minority views and the motion to recommit. i think it should be kept perfectly clear in this debate that the proponents of these projects believe in a balanced budget but we do not think it is fair or right to include capital investments of a selfliquidating type in the federal budget when it comes to applying the tests of a balanced budget. these costs are really loans to the people and their return to the treasury is assured. i do not think that those of us who are in favor of going ahead now with the development of these wealthcreating projects should let anyone put us in such a position that it might appear that we are not in favor of a balanced budget as far as operating administrative costs of government are concerned. there is another point which i wish to make. and i think it has a very direct bearing on the very able speech made by the senator from ohio. the point is that i am greatly concerned about the representations which are being made to the members of congress. these days. and the facts which are being presented before various committees in support of those representations as to the world crisis. today we happen to be living in a world situation which can properly be characterized. it seems to me. as a world situation of tension. i think that is an understatement. i do not wish to overstate the situation. mr. president. but having sat as a member of the armed services committee for weeks in public hearings and in executive sessions. and having either listened to or read all the evidence and representations presented to that committee in connection with a great piece of major legislation which still is awaiting action by the senatenamely. military manpower legislationi know that i make no overstatement when i say that today world conditions are such that they can be correctly described as creating a state of world tension. i think it is only fair and proper to go beyond that statement. and say that it is my honest judgment that although war is not inevitable and although it is my judgment that we can avoid war if all of us keep our heads. yet there is the everpresent danger that some international accident or incident might place us in a very serious war emergency. because i do not think such a danger can be denied by anyone who goes through the records of the senate armed services committee and the hearings held before that committee on the international problems we on the committee have been considering as we have considered military manpower legislation. i say. mr. president. that i cannot sit in the senate of the united states and not do all within my power to keep my country prepared to enforce the peace. we owe the obligation to our country to do that not only from the standpoint of manpower. not only from the standpoint of air power. not only from the standpoint of naval power. but also from the standpoint of economic power. in fact. i think the greatest defense weapon we have is to be found in the economic power of the united states. it is to be found in our privateproperty economy. it is to be found in our capitalistic system. it is to be found in a sound industrial mobilization program. such a program does not endanger our privateproperty economy. rather it gives to that economy its greatest assurance of perpetuation. what is the relation of that observation to the pending bill? a very important relationship. mr. president. because i think the bill pending before the senate of the united states is of great interest and great concern and vital importance to the business interests of america. i think it is through such legislation as this that we have our greatest hopes of expanding our economy to the point so that we shall be in a position to meet the financial obligations of our government. we must meet this huge debt of. in round figures. $255.000.000.000. may i say. incidentally. mr. president. we should meet it by a payment of at least twice $2.500.000.000 a year. i want to repeat in a sentence or two the observations i made in the tax debate. i want to say that i do not now. any more than when the tax debate was on. share the view of the leadership of my party that $2.500.000.000 is all we ought to pay on the national debt during this year of tremendous economic boom. i want to repeat that i think the republican party in the -senate of the united states should have stood for a payment on the national debt of at least $5.000.000.000. why do i say that? because that is what the carrying charge on the debt is. if. in a year of a great boom. apparently the year of the greatest boom in our history. we cannot pay a sum on the national debt at least equal to the carrying charge. then i think we are failing the people of our country in living up to the responsibility which is ours to keep the value of the american dollar as stable and as secure as possible. mr. president. you are not going to keep the dollar stable. are not going to protect the value of the dollar. unless you retire the debt at a more rapid rate than $2.500.000.000 a year. i am satisfied. mr. president. that the issue of paying our debt once taken to the american people and thoroughly understood by them. will result in an overwhelming verdict on the part of a great majority of the american people that we made a mistake in not adopting a budget that would pay more than $2.500.000.000 on the debt. we could have done it if the senate had been willing to adopt the tax program of the committee for economic development which ta:x program i offered in a series of amendments. as i go about the country. mr. president. the american people. as i find them. want the debt retired at a more rapid rate than $2.500.000.000 a year. * can it be argued that. if that is my position toward% retirement of the debt. then i ought to support a reduction in the appropriations for the particular projects covered in the pending bill? i think not. mr. president. i do not think that would be a logical reply to me. why do i say that? because i am convinced that these projects are needed if we are going to develop the wealth in this country which must be developed in order to give us the economy out of which we can obtain the new tax dollars necessary to retire the debt at a more rapid rate. we are dealing here. as i see the picture. mr. president. with a great american economic frontier. the potentialities of the projects. as far as creating new wealth in this country is concerned. i do not think have been grasped yet by the imagination of a majority of my colleagues in the senate. i do not think the members of the senate fully appreciate the importance of the development of these projects to a great and ever expanding american economy. i want to direct my attention and the attention of the senate in the course of these remarks to the economic potentialities of some of these projects. and to their relationship to national security. mr. president. i do not think there is any logic in voting to meet our national security problems from the standpoint of manpower unless we back up that vote by an industrial support which that manpower is going to need if an international accident or incident thrusts us into an international conflict. that is why i share the objectives of the senator from georgia when in the armed services committee he proposes an industrial mobilization amendment to the manpower bill. mr. president. you cannot approach this matter of national security just from the manpower angle alone. we must recognize that war is now a total operation involving all segments of our economy and all segments of our people. also we must recognize that preparation for defense must be looked upon as a national problem which necessarily involves our total economy. total defense as total war places responsibilities and obligations upon our total economy. i sat in the armed services committee this morning. i listened to testimony and argument in regard to the importance of saving for defense purposes some of the great war plants of this country. some 32 out of a total of some 160 under consideration cost in round figures $735.000.000. they would cost twice that amount if we found ourselves in an international conflict and had to replace them quickly. their replacement cost as of today would double their original cost. i took the position in the committee this morning. and i shall take it on the floor when the bill gets here. that it is of vital importance in protecting our boys who we are going to draft into the services. that we mobilize those plants for defense by. keeping them in the control of the federal government rather than permitting them to be salvaged or junked. the testimony before our committee shows that few of them will be used for commercial purposes. but most of them will be junked if we do not save them. rather than permit- them to be salvaged and junked. and then in case of emergency proceed to replace them at great increases in cost. i think they should be mobilized for defense now. mr. president. as long as we find ourselves in the position of living. in a world characterized by international tension. then we must look at all legislation such as the legislation pending before us from the standpoint of its relationship to national defense. i want to say that in my opinion not to appropriate the money for the projects covered by h. r. 5524 would be contrary to the best interest of national defense. i wantto say that it would be inconsistent to proceed to spend great sums of money for building up the ground army and the air corps and a naval force. unless we are willing also on the level of economic production to spend money to build these projects covered in this bill so that we can build the war materials necessary to protect the lives of our boys in the event an international incident should occur which would take them to war. i was also interested in the observation which my good friend from ohio made when he pointed out again today. as he has many times in the past. that in effect the american people are working for the government some 3 days out of every 10. i shall not dwell on the point at any length this afternoon because i covered it during the tax debate. i simply deny the soundness of his premise. for this reason: we must look at federal expenditures for services rendered the american people from the standpoint of their interest in and needs for those services. when we do that. save and except in those instances where there is unneccessary waste i think it is up to the budgetcutting proponents to show that the elimination of any given service is not a pennywise. poundfoolish budget cut. the instances of wasteful governmental expenditures are only a drop in the bucket compared with the total services rendered to the american people by their government. i do not know of any dollars which the american people spend from which they receive greater value for their individual interest and welfare than from the tax dollars they spend for government service. i repeat. that i do not accept the argument that when american taxpayers pay money for a health program. an educational program. police protection. for roads. for reclamation. for power development. for national security. they are working for the government. they are working for themselves just as much as when they go to their daily occupations. we have entered that era in our history. mr. president. where a great many services must be performed by the government in the sense that they must have government financing and government backing. roads are a good example. our federal treasury has recovered from expenditures for highways. mr. president. many times the dollars we haye invested in them. when we spend money in the interests of national security we are not working for the government. we. are working for ourselves and american. children yet to be born throughout future generations. it becomes a matter of degree as to how fast we shall move forward with improved services needed by all of our people. i am willing to admit. that premise. but.on the basis of that premise and on the basis of the test as to whether the particular projects covered by this bill are projects which should be considered at this time. my answer is that most certainly we should proceed with them immediately. it is my honest opinion that time is of the essence. these projects should not be put on the shelf. either from the standpoint of national security or from the standpoint of the economic welfare of the country.. as to the latter. we must expand our economy in order to get out of the economic mess in which we find ourselves. and these projects will help along that course of action. they will create new wealth. new industry. more jobs.and increased tax revenues. referring to the minority report itself. i want to point out that it seems to me one of the fundamental misconceptions of that report is that it lacks consistency. on page 2 it is stated: if we must violate our pledge for curtailed governmental spending. certainly it should be for the purpose of strengthening our national defenses against the threats of the totalitarian powers. above all. it should not be used to chew up the very materials which. should they be needed. are so vital to our national security. on page 4 the minority report states: a few hydroelectric power projects account for over 40 percent of 1949 construction allotments. mr. president. during most of the remaining part of my remarks i shall lay particular emphasis upon the relationship between those hydroelectric power developments and national security. i shall seek to prove the proposition that these power projects are of vital concern to national defense and to our power as a people to protect ourselves in case we find ourselves thrust into a war. therefore i want to point out as my major premise that i take the position that the power projects andother projects involved in this bill will not chew up vital materials needed for national security. i take the position that without these projects we cannot. in the new type of war which will be fought. if we have a third world war. manufacture in the quantities necessary the materials vital for the prosecution of that war. we learned that lesson in the last war. where would we be today and where would we have been during world war ii had we not had bonneville. grand coulee. hoover dam. and the great dams of the tva? what would have happened to .our atomicenergy program?. we would not have been able to complete that program which was so vital to winning the war. the fact remains that our success in carrying forward the atomicenergy program was determined largely by the existence of those dams. mr. president. i have listened to the witnesses appearing before -the armed services committee over the weeks and i have heard their testimony regarding the strategic -problems we may have. if we find ourselves in a third world war. i say.to the american people here and now that it is in our selfinterest that we proceed to develop to the maximum extent possible. in the shortest period of time. the power resources. of the country. what is my record for consistency on that? i want to direct this remark to the senator from- wisconsin . with whom i had a cloakroom conversation earlier this afternoon. i voted for the st. lawrence waterway project. not only because i thought it important to develop the transportation facilities involved. in that project but because. as a member of the armed services committee. i recognized the importance of using that project also to develop to the maximum extent possible the hydroelectric resources of america. if we do not do so. we will be as shortsighted as many people were during the 1920s and 1930s when they did not prepare the country for the defense of its security. we paid in the long run an exceedingly high price for the lack of preparedness. i do not propose to make the mistake which many members of congress made during the 1920s and 1930s by failing to keep up our national defenses. so i say that i shall vote for the development of the hydroelectric power resources of america whether they be in florida. texas. mississippi. georgia. michigan. wisconsin. ohio. or any other state. i am satisfied that from the standpoint of national security every dollar we spend. and as soon as possible. in the development of the hydroelectric power resources of america will be money just as well spent and. in my judgment. better spent. for the security of the nation than spending it now for battleships or airplanes or manpower needs. i think the development of our power resources are nore important. mr. president. than any other defense need we have. important as other needs 6f defense are. i think the development of the hydroelectric resources of the country is the most important nationaldefense development for which we could appropriate money. i propose to defend that premise in this speech. mr. president. referring to the two statements in the minority report to which i have referred. which appear on page 2 and page 4. i would say that those two observations are in total conflict and fall to recognize the critical material situation facing this nation. it is not a question of chewing up materials. but the more important requirement of producing those critical materials needed to protect us against an atombomb war. measured in terms of power. this nation is immediately short about 1.000.000 kilowatts of highclass hydro power capacity which is necessary to make a start in providing adequate defense. steam or other types of power cannot be used on account of cost and other production characteristics and problems. without light metals. chemicals. or ferroalloyswhich are nothing more than frozen lowcost hydro kilowattsthe talk about strengthening our national defense has little real meaning. as used in the report of the minority. i repeat. mr. president. the light metals essential to the new type of warfare in which we will be thrust if we go into another war constitute nothing else than frozen lowcost hydro kilowatts. right now we are a million short. the demand for additional kilowatts. both for national defense and for our economy. is a tremendous demand. yet there is talk about putting these projects on the shelf until we get into a depression. there is talk to the effect that such was the position taken by president hoover on this issue. such talk does not recommend itself to me. because i am inclined to believe that had we gone along and developed these projects to a greater degree than we did in the 1920s. we would have had a fighting chance. at least. of preventing the tremendous depression in 1929. we found ourselves late in the twenties with a honeycombed financial structure and a restricting economy instead of an expanding one. as a result we were. thrown headlong into a depression. the moment this economy of ours starts to restrict. then watch out for the danger signs of a recession or depression. to beat it before it starts. to prevent it before the spark is lighted. i say we should constantly keep ahead of a depression by ever expanding the economy. the possibilities for expansion as we make scientific advancements is almost unlimited. these projects are vital to an expanding economy. i say to those in the east that the tremendous values which eastern manufacture is going to make out of the development of the hydroelectric resources of this country have not yet been fully appreciated by most people in the east with whom i have talked. the significance of these projects to the economic development of all sections of america has not penetrated as yet the imagination and vision of many men in congress. my faith in this capitalistic system of ours. i submit. is greater than that of many people in the country who talk in terms of pessimism. people who talk in terms of not being willing now to spend dollars which will repay themselves many fold in the treasury of the united states by way of the new wealth flowing from the expanding economy these projects would create show an unconscious lack of confidence in our capitalistic system. the lack of critical materials. largely electroprocessed materials. will have a much greater effect on our industrial economy than is recognized. it often has been stated that the automotive industry of michigan would not have had its beginning if it had not been for the electroprocessed basic materials developed by low cost niagara hydro power. the older conventional fuelfurnace produced metals cannot be used where high strength. light weight. and high speed are the basic requirements. our new processing methods require great electric energy for the development of those metals. a cross section of our industry is now dependent on electroprocessed materials and this situation will increase year by year as we dig out our metal reserves. naturally. one who is not a member of the subcommittee handling this bill is not qualified to discuss all the details governing the inferences in this report. however. it does appear to one who has investigated this nations resource condition that some of the observations or inferences in this minority report can do a great violence to a properly expanded air force and the all out defense against the atom bomb. our electroprocessed metal situation is now being seriously jeopardized by a lack of the requisite power supplies. bearing on this point. mr. r. s. reynolds. who pioneered the expansion of light metals in this country as a defense requisite long before pearl harbor. said in an interview in the richmond timesdispatch of april 19. 1948. as follows: if the international situation continues to deteriorate the existing aluminum capacity will be wholly insufficient for the most critical wartime demands. the united states government no longer has a stock pile of aluminum. its stock pile of bauxite would not be sufficient to meet increased emergency demands for more than 3 or 4 weeks. at the close of the war our nation had a stock pile of 400.000.000 pounds. today there is not a pound of aluminum available from this source. the increased demand for this vital material has caused the consumption of the nations stock pile. without this stock pile the nation even now faces a military shortage. it will be impossible to replace the vanished stock pile with current production in view of the unprecedented demand for aluminum for vital uses. the current production of aluminum in the united states is at the rate of approximately 643.999 tons per annum. this would be increased quickly by 255.000 tons if economical electric power were provided to operate the idle plants including those about to be dismantled. unless we build up superiority in this vital metal it will be futile to spend millions on atomic weapons and new airplane designs. the modern war machine is useless without an adequate aluminum supply. our present armament program will fail completely unless the aluminum production is brought quickly to the absolute maximum volume.\n800178863|mr. president. inasmuch as the senator has paused for a moment. let me say that i am wondering how much longer he feels he will take in completing his speech.\n800178864|i am now on page 10 of my formal remarks. i have 22 pages in all. but as the senator knows. my extemporaneous remarks always make up the greater part of my senate speeches. i think i shall conclude in 30 minutes.\n800178865|i simply wondered whether the senator would mind concluding his speech tomorrow. if we take a recess now.\n800178866|i would like to accommodate the senator. but i am interested in the continuity of this speech. it is going to be reprinted for future reference in my state and. i hope. elsewhere. also. i should like to have it in one issue colleagues can read it more easily.\n800178867|that is perfectly agreeable to me. i shall be glad to remain here until the senator concludes his speech. i merely thought that if the senator would like to have us attempt to take a recess until tomorrow he could resume at that time.\n800178868|mr. president. does the same offer go for the senator from oregon in case the senate adjourns tonight?\n800178869|mr. president. i take just one ditch at a time. if the senator from oregon wishes to have the senate continue in session now. i think we had better wait and see just what time it is when the senate either adjourns or takes a recess until tomorrow.\n800178870|i want to say to my good friend from nebraska if he will per- mit this goodnatured humor to get into the debate-\n800178871|i appreciate the senators kind remarks. and i thank him for yielding.\n800178872|i am highly complimented to see as many people here as there are. seldom does almost a third of the senate listen to any speech by any senator. i am flattered. i usually. on this subject. have not nearly so large an attendance as i have today. although i appreciate what the senator from nebraska said. i want him to know that i will not object to his leaving. because i know he will read the record.\n800178873|that is right.\n800178874|i shall take no offense if he leaves.\n800178875|i shall remain.\n800178876|mr. president. there is still another defense and security item. our military air forces are becoming more and more important. the light and strong metals required for airship construction are nothing more than frozen kilowatts. therefore. as a nation we cannot allow the foundation of this protection to drift into foreign lands by not keeping lowcost hydropower production in step with an adequate airship construction program. airship design trends are now in the direction of supersonic speeds and jet prbpulsion. to accomplish such designs requires windtunnel experimentation under a duplication of stratospheric conditions. to accomplish such experimentation requires huge quantities of power. the only place in this country where these additional amounts of power can be cheaply secured is on the columbia river. from the defense standpoint. alone. which i have briefly outlined. the accelerated construction of mcnary dam and like projects is fully justified. the commercial justification for such projects is just as strong as the security justification. now. mr. president. i cannot disclose certain knowledge which i possess in regard to the relationship between supersonic experimentations and the development of hydroelectric power plants. -all i want to say to my colleagues in the senate is that the amount of electric power required for such experimentation and for the defenses that will grow out of such experimentation is so tremendous that it startles the imagination. the pacific northwest is one of the most strategic spots in america for the development of supersonic research. the great power resources in that area should be used for defense experimentation. but the congress of -the united states cannot justify installing experimentation in that area if it drains dry the electric power resources for the civilian economy of the pacific northwest. if government goes ahead with supersonic development in the pacific northwest we shall welcome it. we nevertheless need to recognize that the quantity of power required for supersonic research is so great that we would not have sufficient power available for our civilian economy unless we proceed to build the power projects called for by the committees report. that is why i stressed as strongly as i did earlier in my arguments. mr. president. the relationship between the report of the majority of the committee in this instance and our civilian economy and our national security. in fact. i want to compliment the majority of the committee for their foresightedness. for their understanding. for their recognition of the relationship between the development of these projects and our national security and our need for an expanding economy. it is not without significance that the chairman of the particular subcommittee making this report. the senator from south dakota . is also chairman of the armed services committee of the senate. he knows the facts. he recognizes the importance of these projects to a sound national defense program. he has available to him through our work in executive sessions of the armed services committee information and data and evidence not available to many members of the congress. i just cannot stress too much. mr. president. the relationship between his report in support of these projects and a sound national defense program. as i said earlier i think the issues raised by this bill have more importance than even legislation on manpower. important as manpower legislation is. large numbers of men in armies. mr. president. cannot possibly make this nation secure. if we cannot produce the materials necessary to back up those men in uniform. these projects are necessary for the manufacture of that defense material as well as material necessary for a sound civilian economy. payout the columbia river multipurpose power projects have from the start been sold to congress on the basis of reimbursability. actual performance to date shows that these projects. under the existing laws. are more than making a full return on the federal power investment. the bonneville act of 1937 requires such a return to the treasury and a rate level to insure this return. this act. similar to the boulder canyon project act. requires a rate review every 5 years in order to protect the federal government on return. so that such projects will not become a burden on the taxpayer. this rate review insurance provision is included in all power sales contracts. the columbia river multipurpose projects are among the very few defense projects that are fully paying their way without becoming a burden on the taxpayer. the books of the bonneville administration. the bonneville dam projectarmy engineers operationand the columbia basin reclamation project of the bureau of reclamation have been completely audited by outside independent commercial auditors of national reputation. from the certification of these nationally known auditors i am convinced that no better set of books can be found in the government. the last audit shows that in the past 7 years these projects have deposited in the federal treasury over $105.000.000 of gross revenues. included in this $105.000.000 total is a surplus of $23.000.000 over all items of cost such as interest. amortization. replacement. operating and maintenance costs. in addition to meeting all power costs. power revenues from these projects will contribute about $324.000.000 toward subsidizing such columbia basin project reclamation costs which will not be assumed by irrigation and the irrigators. this contribution to reclamation development exceeds the proportionate annual amount paid by private power companies in taxes. if this subsidy was not provided out of power revenues. such reclamation projects would become a burden on the taxpayer or the reclamation features would not be constructed at all. since the oregon rate payer receives no direct benefit from this rate contribution it rightly can be considered as a high level tax equivalent. i am raising no objections to this procedure. but am merely showing that the present power rate is meeting all existing elements of cost. i just cannot emphasize too strongly. mr. president. what i have said in years gone by here on the floor of the senate. you cannot get away from the economic fact. from the mathematical fact that these projects are selfliquidating. in an attempt to build a background for nonjustiflable rate increases. a large amount of theoretical misinformation has been put out. such misinformation does not check with the audited statements. to set out the facts in a simplified condensed form i have had the output statistics of the two plants combined with the audited figures and reduced to a series of simple tabulations which should demonstrate accurate facts on performance of the columbia river projects. such a series of tables are given at this point. so that material will be available for those who wish to pursue the subject on a sound basis. i believe. mr. president. in letting the facts speak for themselves. and the facts are that these projects are returning their cost to the government in selfliquidating dollars. therefore i ask that there be printed at this point in my remarks certain tables which i have prepared in connection with this selfliquidating issue.\n800178877|our massproduction industries long ago demonstrated that large volume sales at low unit prices produce greater net revenues than lower volume sales at higher prices. this axiomatic principle runs throughout the revenue figures i have just presented covering the wholesale power outputs of the bonneville administration. this relationship is even more pronounced in the field of retail power sales. my home city of eugene. under the lowest retail electric rates in the country. has fully paid off the full cost of its electric properties and has set up a sizable surplus. recently we have had other similar examples throughout oregon amongst rural cooperatives and municipalities. as an example of this business principle i will cite the experience of the little city of monmouth. in 1940 the city of monmouth constructed its own electric distribution system and power was purchased from the bonneville administration. on december 5. 1940. publicly owned power was first used in monmouth. to construct the powerdistribution system a bond issue of $40.000 was issued. just recently this municipality celebrated the fact that the last bond of this and other issues had been retired. after 1 years operation the city of monmouth made its first rate reduction. this was followed later by another reduction which placed the monmouth retail rates on a parity with the low rate structure which exists in eugene and tacoma. in 1941. after the first years operation. the electric revenues of the city of monmouth totaled in round numbers $15.900. at the end of the fiscal year 1947 this revenue had increased to nearly $41.000. which represents practically a threefold increase in 6 years. it was through this increase in revenue resulting from low rates that the city of monmouth was able to pay off its entire indebtedness. i have analyzed similar relationships in the costs of a number of oregon rural electric activities. i found that the same rapid growth existed in every case that i analyzed. i made that analysis in connection with another speech i shall deliver at a later date in regard to the whole rural electrification program. i want to say that the power developments are paying out and there can be no denial of the fact on the basis of the figures. monmouth is not what can be called an industrial community. it is a farmmarketing center. and the electric income is derived largely from residential sales rather than from commercial or industrial sales. the monmouth experience represbnts the normal. natural increase in electric consumption which is typical in the northwest. let me say. mr. president. that we had all better recognize that the people of the northwest will find it very difficult to understand any political program which seeks to put on the shelf the development of electricpower projects which they know are vita to their future prosperity. they know these projects are sound. because they have had such experience as the monmouth experience. which can be multiplied by scores of examples in the pacific northwest. they know the relationship between the development of power projects and the economic welfare of the pacific northwest. i am making no sectional argument when i apply this point to the pacific northwest. because i repeat that i shall support the same principle in any area of the country. north or south. east or west. i am convinced that the development of our electricpower resources to the maximum extent possible is essential to the prosperity o1 our country. i am convinced that we can make no sound political argument. economic argument. or national defense argument in support of putting such developments on the shelf until a depression hits us. the people are entitled to better treatment than that. mr. president. and i think they will demand it. once they come to understand the basic facts involved in this debate. the agricultural and forestry interests of the pacific northwest made outstanding contributions during the war. these contributions were proportionately greater than in world war i in spite of reduced manpower per acre. resulting from the large manpower requirements of the armed services in the last war. with less manpower per unit. a greater unit production was secured through mechanization. this high production rate has been continued since vjday and can be materially increased if more electric power were available. the agricultural production rate can be increased east of the cascades by 200 to 500 percent. depending on the type of crops. through powerpumped supplemental irrigation. to accomplish this result. under competitive markets and long transportation hauls. power costs must be kept low. while still maintaining a full payout. this is easily possible through coordination of all power transmission and distribution facilities. thereby keeping the overall investment low. as such investment costs are the largest factor in the level of resale rates. the last large virgin stand of timber in the united states is located in southwestern oregon. in fact. my home town of eugene is now recognized as the lumber capital of the world. though the lumber industry is ever moving southward as we deplete the existing ripe timber. with diminishing yields in other sections. the southwestern oregon lumber operations have recently been increased at extremely high rates. and i think. dangerously high rates. from the standpoint of sound forest conservation. that is why i am constantly raising my voice in support of a scientific. sustainedyield program in the field of forestry and lumber production. lumber operations are highly essential to the veterans and other housing programs. formerly timber wastes were used in the mills as fuel. but this type of power production has practically ceased as the amount of slab waste has been reduced by the development of hydraulic debarking machines. and what waste does exist is now more valuable for synthetic products like plastics. rayon. alcohol. and other similar materials and chemicals. with the reductiori of timber waste and the high value of the remaining products lumber mills must now depend on electric power. the power situation in southwestern oregon is so highly critical that unless additional capacity is quickly provided in this area the housing program will consequently be seriously restricted. to protect the national and regional economy. all of thqse elements must be considered together and not on an individual basis. if this is not done. an unbalanced development will result. it must be realized that to support one agricultural worker there must be at least four direct and indirect industrial workers. and at least 1/ service workers gainfully employed to consume the agricultural products of one farm worker. it is therefore apparent that the development of reclamation projects must be kept in step with industrial expansion.\n800178878|mr. president. twice this afternoon i attempted to obtain unanimous consent that when the senate concludes its work today it recess until tomorrow at noon. both times objection was made by the distinguished senator from california . i did not know what he had in mind. and he did not know what i had in mind. but i think we now each understand what the other intended. at any rate. there seems to be a question as to just when the motion which the senator from california has made to discharge the committee from further consideration of the hawaiian statehood bill should be talken up. during the able address of the senator from oregon negotiations have been in progress. and i think a compromise has been reached. the senator had been assured by the acting majority leader that a motion would be made to adjourn on friday. so that the question might be taken up in the morning hour on monday. the senator from california feels very strongly about the bill. and believes that every day means something in its behalf. he is of the opinion that it ought to be brought up sooner. i believe i state the situation correctly. the senator has agreed that a morning hour will be had by adjournment at the conclusion of consideration of the civil functions appropriations bill. -is that correct?\n800178879|mr. president. reserving the right to object. so that i may make a brief statement. i think the senator from nebraska. the acting majority leader. has correctly stated the situation. if i may state a little background. the junior senator from california felt that he had a definite understanding that there would be a morning hour last monday. i appreciate the fact that although i had that assurance from the able senator from nebraska. he ran into some problems of his own because of the press of legislative business. with time running out. and with the general understanding that an adjournment about the 19th of june will be attempted. every day counts in the matter of statehood for hawaii. for that reason i was not willing to agree to postpone for another week the start of the debate on the question of statehood for hawaii. therefore i withheld my consent from the unanimous consent request that when the senate concludes its business today it take a recess. because the only way we can have a morning hour is by adjournment. it had been my intention to raise the question of a quorum. if no quorum were available of course the only thing the senate could do would be to adjourn tonight. however. i wish to be cooperative with the leadership. as i have always tried to do during the time i have been a member of the senate. with the understanding. which has been joined in by other senators. that at the conclusion of action on the civil functions appropriations bill the senate will take an adjournment rather than a recess. and with the further understanding that we shall proceed diligently with the civilfunctions bill and not continue to lay it aside for something else. i will withdraw my objection so that the senator from nebraska mgy make his motion or submit his request.\n800178880|mr. president. in order that we may clearly understand the question of procedure. do i correctly understand that as soon as the civil functions appropriations bill has been disposed of an adjournment will thereupon immediately be taken. regardless of the day or the time?\n800178881|i have no objection to running through until the end of the day. if it is finished tomorrow. orrunning through until tomorrow night. however. it is the understanding that at the conclusion of consideration of the civilfunctions bill and such other miscellaneous matters as may be taken up. there is to be an adjournment of the senate. which will give us a morning hour. in order that my motion may be presented to the senate. that will take only 2 hours out of the day in any event.\n800178882|mr. president. i have only one suggestion to make to senators involved in this dispute. and that is that i do not see anything to be gained by a 2hour discussion. what will happen is that the motion will be brought up and debated until 2 oclock. and then it will automatically go on the calendar. i cannot see why we cannot agree by unanimous consent to place it on the calendar. then the senator can move to bring it up at any time if he can obtain the floor for that purpose.\n800178883|that is what i am afraid of.\n800178884|but even if the senator succeeds. his motion will be debated for 2 hours. and at 2 oclock it will automatically go on the calendar. i am suggesting that the senator can achieve that iesult by unanimous consent. without the necessity for 2 hours of debate. that is my only suggestion.\n800178885|mr. president. let me say to the distinguished senator from ohio that that proposal has been made and thoroughly discussed with the junior senator from california. now i shall let the junior senator from california speak for himself.\n800178886|mr. president. in view of the suggestion made by the senator from ohio. and in order to clarify the record. i think it should be made perfectly plain why i do not approve of that procedure. the first great difficulty which the statehood for hawaii bill has encountered is that. frankly. it is bottled up. by a vote of 7 to 5. in a committee which has no desire to let it out. the second point is that i believe that. if the attention of the public can be focused upon this subject. there will be sufficient support in the country. and i believe there will be sufficient support in the united states senate. if the question can be brought to a vote. to get the bill out of committee. i am hopeful that the proponents of statehood will not take more than approximately half of the 2hour period. and that the opponents will then state on the floor of the senate their objections to the proposal and to statehood for hawaii. one of the great difficulties which the prospective fortyninth state faces is that it is being whispered against. charges are beingmade which i do not think can be sustained. those who oppose statehood for hawaii have a perfectly legitimate right to their position. because everyone has a right to take whatever position he wishes on the question. but i want the arguments to be made on the floor of the sente rather than in anonymous letters or in statements which i do not think can be sustained. and which are highly detrimental to the people of hawaii.\n800178887|mr. president. it seems to me that the senator can have that debate at any time on any bill. if he wishes to take the time. i do not object. i am anxious to have the question settied as quickly as possible. so far as i am concerned. i am in favor of the bill. i doubt whether i would be in favor of taking it away from a committee of the senate. i am interested in saving the 2 hours of debate. we are pressed for time. if we are to get away from here by the 19th of june. we shall have to speed up action beyond anything we have done up to date. we have for consideration the civilfunctions bill. the displacedpersons bill. the army bill. the longterm agricultural program. and many additional appropriation bills. we must move very rapidly. in fact. it seems to me that we ought to begin very shortly to meet at 11 oclock and sit through regularly until 6. or even begin night sessions. and ask committees more or less to suspend operations on additional bills. we shall have practically everything of importance on the calendar within a short time. and i should like to save all the time possible. any member of the senate who insists on having time in which to present his arguments will get such time. there is no way to prevent a senator from having that opportunity. so if the senator insists on proceeding as he has indicated. it is perfectly proper for him to do so and to have that time. and he can have it. but we shall have the same debate over again when the motion to take the bill from the committee comes up. i am sure.\n800178888|mr. president. if the senator from nebraska will yield to me. i should like to offer a suggestion. the question which will be before the senate will be a motion to discharge the committee from the further consideration of the bill. a vote on the motion to discharge the committee from the further consideration does not necessarily indicate how any senator will vote on the bill itself when it is before the senate. i would have to be very strongly persuaded that a committee had been neg. ligent in the performance of its duty before i would vote to take a bill from it. i would wish to listen to all the arguments on that subject. but certainly my vote on the motion to discharge the committee from further consideration would be no indication of how i would vote on the bill when it was before the senate.\n800178889|mr. president. will the senator yield?\n800178890|i yield.\n800178891|i merely wish to -say that when we are dealing with the bill as a practical matterand that is what the bill relative to hawaiian statehood isit should be pointed out that the bill passed the house last year. and the senate committee has had it since that time. there have been five congressional investigations of this matter. hawaii has been a territory for 40 years and has been under the american flag for 50 years. if hawaii is to succeed in having the congress pass at this session or during the eightieth congress the bill looking toward statehood for hawaii. in my judgment. the only way that hawaii can have any possibility of obtaining statehood is by haviag the bill withdrawn from further consideration by the committee. because the bill is bottled up in the committee by a vote of 7 to 5. and in the committee there is a very clear intention not to release the bill. i realize that some senators are very loath to vote to discharge a committee from the further consideration of a bill. i am sure that in my 7 years in the california legislature and in my 3 years in this body i have been very reluctant to vote to withdraw a bill from a committee. but i say that the only way by which hawaii will have a practical chance to be admitted as the fortyninth statewhich is what the president of the united states and the secretary of the interior have recommended. and what the five congressional committees which have studied the question have rendered favorable reports onis by having the senate cast a favorable vote on my motion. once the bill is before the senate and on the floor. the senatewhich is the body which will have to pass on this questionwill be given an opportunity to consider it. when it is on the floor of the senate. of course. each senator should look into all the arguments pro and con. and finally should make up his mind whether he wishes to vote in favor of statehood for hawaii. but if a senator votes against the motion to have the committee discharged from the further consideration of the bill and to have the bill brought up on the floor of the senate. such a vote will be against statehood for hawaii.\n800178892|of course. i would wish to hear from the committee before making up my mind as to how i would vote.\n800178893|mr. president. i should like to ask the senator from california this question: if in the negotiations tomorrow the committee would agree to have the bill placed on the calendar. would that satisfy the senator from california. in respect to his motion and his intention to have a morning hour?\n800178894|yes. i would be very happy to have that done.\n800178895|mr. president. the committee certainly would not agree to do that. the committee might agree to have the motion put on the calendarbut not the bill.\n800178896|i did not mean that the committee might agree to have the bill placed on the calendar. i meant the committee might agree to have the. motion placed on the calendar.\n800178897|no. that would not be satisfactory. for the reason i have already stated. there is no question that under the very loose rules of the senate. those of us on this floorand there are many of uswho favor statehood for hawaii could take time during the discussion of any bill which was being considered by the senate to discuss for a very long period of time the question of hawaiian statehood. but we do not wish to do that. i merely wish to have the proponents have a reasonable length of time to present their views and then have the opponents have a reasonable length of time to present their views.\n800178898|mr. president. inadvertently i used the word bill instead of the word motion. but i wanted the senator from california to state for the record the reasons why he would not wish to have the motion placed on the calendar. even if the committee would agree to have that done.\n800178899|mr. president. will the senator yield to me?\n800178900|i yield.\n800178901|i am a little puzzled by the tactics of the senator from california. as i understand. he hopes to obtain 2 hours for the discussion of this matter. 1 hour to be used by the proponents and the other hour to be used by the opposition. during which time the bill or the objections to it would be discussed. but what assurance does the senator have that the opposition would discuss the bill. rather than the best way of making new england clam chowder. or some other subject?\n800178902|of course. we have no assurance as to that.\n800178903|how is the senator going to get the reluctant dragons to discuss it?\n800178904|but assuming that they have valid reasons or objections against statehood for hawaii. and assuming that we are trying in every reasonable way possible to bring this issue to a headwhich is our intentionwe have this course in mind.\n800178905|mr. president. i may say that i have seen the time in the senate when senators discussed the question of approving the journal. rather than the motion or other matter before the senate. anything may happen here.\n800178906|mr. president. will the senator yield?\n800178907|i yield..\n800178908|reserving the right to object. i should like to make sure that i understand the unanimousconsent request.\n800178909|there is no such request.\n800178910|then i should like to ask a question. suppose the suggestion that the senate adjourn were adopted. and suppose the senate debated the civil functions appropriations bill through to the end of thursday afternoon. let us say. would that mean that the senate would then take an adjournment until monday. with no session on friday?\n800178911|no. the senator has made quite plain that there is no objection to continuing the session on thursday until a reasonable hour. but that at the conclusion of the session on thursday a motion to adjourn would be made. so that there would be a morning hour on friday. instead of on monday. is not that the course which is agreeable to the senator from california?\n800178912|absolutely.\n800178913|mr. president. will the senator yield?\n800178914|i am glad to yield.\n800178915|i think we are getting our days mixed up. i believe this is tuesday.\n800178916|of course.\n800178917|it is my understanding. speaking only relative to the civil functions appropriations billbecause i wish to be sure that it is the order of business on wednesday. and also the order of business on thursdayin case action on the bill is not finished on wednesday-\n800178918|mr. president. for the record let me say that regardless of what days have been mentioned. i think i can assure the chairman of the subcommittee. once again. that it is the intention to conclude action on the civil functions appropriations bill before anything else displaces it. whether it be on tuesday. wednesday. thursday. or friday.\n800178919|i thank the senator.\n800178920|so that the record may be further clarified let me state that it now is the intention of the acting majority leader at the conclusion of the senate session on the day when action on the civil functions appropriations bill is completed. whether that be tuesday. wednesday. thursday. or friday. to move an adjournment. so that there will be a morning hour the day following. when the senator from california can take up in the morning hour his motion to discharge the committee from the further consideration of the hawaiian statehood bill.\n800178921|mr. president. will the senator yield?\n800178922|first. i should like to ask whether that is the clear understanding of all senators involved.\n800178923|now will the senator yield to me?\n800178924|will the senator add one more sentence? is it the intention of the acting majority leader to have the. senate take up the displacedpersons bill after the civil functions appropriations bill is disposed of. if there is an opportunity to do that later in the afternoon of the day when the civil functions appropriations bill is disposed of. and then to follow the displacedpersons bill with the selectiveservice bill?\n800178925|the intention. as i have announced it several times on the floor of the senate. is to have the senate conclude action on the civil functions appropriations bill first. after that is done. it is the intention to have the displacedpersons bill made the unfinished business. after action on that bill isconcluded. it is the intention to have the national security bill come up. i may add that after the displacedpersons bill and after the national security bill are disposed of. i think it would be in order to have the senate take up a conference report. or it might be that the senate would even desire to take up an appropriation bill. that decision will be up to the senate itself. but the unfinished business will be the proposed legislationwhich has been spoken of. and it will be taken up in the order stated.\n800178926|mr. president. will the senator yield to me?\n800178927|i yield.\n800178928|i simply wish to observe that the agricultural appropriation bill has been reported by the full committee.\n800178929|that is correct.\n800178930|and it is awaiting an opportunity for consideration by the senate. i believe that at the first opportunity we should move for its consideration. so that it can be acted on and go to conference. and be in conference while other matters are being discussed in the senate.\n800178931|that is correct. i think the point is well taken. and i think it would be good procedure to do as the senator has suggested. because no time would be lost if we were to proceed in that vjay. but i think the senate should clearly understand what the unfinished business is to be.\n800178932|mr. president. will the senator yield?\n800178933|i yield.\n800178934|i may say that what the senator from illinois has just said with regard to the agricultural appropriation bill might also be said with regard to the longrange agricultural program bill.\n800178935|if it appears that the members of the senate are reconciled in their views on that bill. so that in a very short time the bill might be passed. and then might go to the house of representatives. which is waiting for it. i would hope that would be done. however. if it appears that several days will be required for the consideration of that bill in the senate. i would not ask that it have preference over the armed services bill.\n800178936|mr. president. let me restate. as has been announced previously. that the proposed legislation immediately before the senate and in prospect will be the legislation previously mentioned: first. the civilfunctions bill. second. the displacedpersons bill. and third. the national security bill. mr. president. i made another announcement this afternoon. it will be found in the record. but it might be of interest to senators who did not hear the announcement for me to say that it is intended. if it meets with the approval of the senate. when the session is concluded on friday. may 28. torecess or adjourn. whichever motion is made. until the following tuesday. the reason being that memorial day comes on sunday. it will be followed by a legal holiday on monday. may 31. which we desire to observe. the senate will therefore recess or adjourn from friday may 28. until tuesday noon. june 1.\n800178937|what is the pleasure of the senate?\n800178938|mr. president. it appearing that the senate has concluded its work for today. i move that a recess be taken until tomorrow. wednesday. at noon.\n800178939|to be the conferees on the part of the senate. the message also announced that the senate insists upon its amendment to the bill entitled an act to amend the civil service act to remove certain discrimination with respect to the appointment of persons having any physical handicap to positions in the classified civil service. requests a conference with the house on the disagreeing votes of the two houses thereon. and appoints mr. langer. mr. buck. and mr. chavez to be the conferees on the part of the senate.\n800178940|mr. speaker. i ask unanimous consent to extend my remarks in the appendix of the record and include an article entitled doctor. my statistics feel funny. i am informed by the public printer that this will exceed two pages of the record and will cost $159.75. but i ask that it be printed notwithstanding that fact.\n800178941|without objection. notwithstanding the cost. the extension may be made.\n800178942|mr. speaker. i ask unanimous consent that on thursday next. after disposition of matters on the speakers desk and at the conclusion of any special orders heretofore entered. i may be permitted to address the house for 45 minutes.\n800178943|is there objection to the request of the gentleman from wisconsin?\n800178944|mr. speaker. i ask unanimous consent that my colleague the gentleman from new jersey [mr. towel be excused from attendance of the house all of this week on account of death in his family.\n800178945|is there objection to the request of the gentleman from new jersey?\n800178946|mr. speaker. i ask unanimous consent to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend my remarks.\n800178947|is there objection to the request of the gentleman from new york?\n800178948|mr. speaker. we are indebted to our colleagues on the select committee on foreign aid for the very illuminating study of european trade .patterns prepared with the assistance of the united states tariff commission and other organizations. . i found some mighty interesting figures on page 3. there we find some of the fats and oils estimates of the bevin committees paris report. this committee estimated that norway would need to import 99.000.000 pounds of fats and oils. the tariff commission studied this situation and came up with a report that norway would have no need to import fats and oils. in fact. the commission found that norway should have an exportable surplus of 280.000.000 pounds. for the small agricultural country of denmark. with a population of only a little over 4.000.000 persons. the paris conference reported an import requirement of 440.000.000 pounds of fats and oils. or more than 100 pounds per person. when the tariff commission analyzed the fat and oil situation of denmark. it found this dairy raising country should have a surplus of 100.000.000 pounds of fats and oils. it is probably only human nature to ask for more than you need. just think how much profit there would be in disposing of millions of pounds of unneeded fats and oils. i cannot help but wonder if all the requirements are not similarly padded. we can only hope that the appropriations committee will scrutinize these figureg carefully. there are not many items with higher prices today than the fats and oils which every family needs to keep clean and properly fed. we owe it to our constituents to see that no supplies are shipped. abroad unless they are absolutely needed for the relief or recovery of the recipients. and. by recovery. i do not mean the shipment of goods which can be reexported for unearned income. there must be no squandering of our resources if we are to keep our prices within reasonable bounds.\n800178949|mr. speaker- i ask unanimous consent to address the house for 1 minute and to revise and extend my remarks.\n800178950|is there objection to the request of the gentleman from illinois?\n800178951|mr. speaker. last evening you may have had the opportunity to listen to the two young giants who are aspiring to the presidency of the united states. if so. you would have observed that the one who had the affirmative of the issue. that the communist party should be outlawed. did not state how that could be successfully accomplished under our constitution. but limited his remarks to an approval of that portion of the socalled mundt bill which would prohibit the establishment in this country of a totalitarian dictatorship under the control of a foreign nation by any person or group of persons. he very properly stated that the other portions of the bill with reference to restrictions upon individual actions should be modified. his opponent. who had the negative of the issue. then very cleverly brought forth that the mundt bill did not attempt to outlaw the communist party. and while he intimated that the present laws would accomplish the main objective sought by the passage of that bill. he did not disclose his position thereon in any way. it is unfortunate that neither aspirant possesses the frankness and candor that has been exhibited by members of congress who are known to desire occupancy in the wellknown house at 1600 pennsylvania avenue. it surely appears that active participation and leadership in congress constitutes the best proving ground for the test of the knowledge. capability. and trustworthiness of one who would occupy that exalted position.","suite 1299. 222 west adams street. chicago 6. ill.

been done by the interior department. much as i favor and feel kindly toward the interior department. i cannot do that any more than i would attempt to justify and sanction everything that has been done by the war department in the past few years. much as i appreciate the war department. i am talking about policy. i feel that this bill looks in the wrong direction. that is what i am hurt about. evidently we cannot get all members of this congress to see that while reclamation development takes place west of the mississippi river in the 17 western states. in our integrated society it is for the benefit of the whole nation. that fact is not understood. so far as members not wanting to make any future investments because of the heavy debt. good heavens. what one among you being a father and having your son with a broken arm would say. \"i have no money in the bank and i will not borrow enough money to have that arm set\"? or how many among you having a horse or cow sick would say. \"i cannot hire a veterinarian to come in and fix the animal up so he will have to remain sick or die\"? such would be the same shortsighted policy we have heard offered here today. we are not good husbandmen. representing the united states as a whole. if we do not capitalize on and develop. as well as save. all of the vast resources out there. whether they be in the form of timber. minerals. or land. and especially including water. one other thing. i want to call the attention of the members. particularly. to the following statement on page 17 of the committee on appropriations report on the bill. i quote: with this background the committee called upon the commissioner of reclamation to submit a revised construction program giving his best estimate of where savings approximating 50 percent could be made with the least hardship. the commissioner reluctantly has complied with the request of the committee. suggesting that all reductions be made in construction items. the committee has approved the program as outlined in the commissioners letter. that statement is misleading. i do not assert that it is deliberately misleading. on the other hand i think it would be unfair to this body if the whole p4cture were not given. in order that the members may have the whole picture. i believe i should read the following paragraph from the letter of march 13 addressed to my friend and colleague. the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee which handled this bill. the letter in question is to be found at page 485 of the printed hearings. the paragraph which i am about to read is on page 487. that paragraph reads as follows: the effect of any such drastic reduction. which would be contrary to the recommendation of the executive agencies. would be disastrous to the program for the development of the west. disruptive to the presidents fiscal program. and to the bureau of reclamations programs. and would jeopardize the bureaus plans for compliance with the repayment requirements of the reclamation law inasmuch as all of these projects would be left to some smaller or greater degree in a nonincomeproducing category until further congressional action repaired the damage. such action would also wreck the integrated program of veterans employment in reclamation construction and veterans settlement upon the newly irrigated lands that the construction program as it was presented to you by the president would provide. in the light of that statement by commissioner straus. i fail to see how the committee could make the statement that it \"has approved the program as outlined in the commissioners letter.\" and now. mr. chairman. having presented these matters to clarify the facts apparently not clear to some of those who spoke before me. let me next present the case as. it seems to me in my official position. relative to reclamation. as chairman of the committee on irrigation and reclamation. the committee that is charged by the house with the responsibility for developing the federal reclamation program. i regret exceedingly that the appropriations for the bureau of reclamation for the fiscal year 1947 are reduced in the pending bill so drastically below the budget recommendations of the president. -in failing to include. in their entirety. the budget estimates for the bureau of reclamation. i fear that the bill places in jeopardy the entire reclamation program for the great west. at the rate appropriations are recommended in this bill. it will take nearly 200 years to complete the projects the bureau of reclamation is authorized by congress to build. can we afford to wait that long? let us look at the amounts reported out as compared with the budget estimates sent to congress by the president. out of some $147.000.000 requested for construction on about 40 projects. the bill carries only $63.000.000a reduction of about 60 percent. construction will be greatly retarded by these cuts. the item for general investigations. without which the economical development of the water resources of the west is impossible. is reduced from $11.000.000 to $3.250.000a reduction of 70 percent. this reduction will seriously affect this important work. the item for investigations payable from the colorado river development fund was reduced from $500.000 to $300.000. this fund. by the way. is accumulated at the rate of $500.000 per year from boulder dam power revenues. and not paid out of the treasury pursuant to the boulder canyon project adjustment act of 1940. and is earmarked in the treasury to be used for no other purpose. the item for salaries and general expenses is reduced by more than 25 percent. from $5.500.000 to $4.000.000. without the full amount recommended for the administrative expenses. the bureau of reclamation will be seriously handicapped in performing duties congress has imposed on it. affecting my own state of arizona. the budget request of $15.000.000 for continuation of construction of davis dam is reduced to some $6.500.000a reduction of 60 percent. a large portion of the amount eliminated is for the construction of transmission lines necessary to help meet the urgent demands for power in central arizona where a most serious power shortage exists. in addition this reduction will seriously retard the construction of the dam itself. the budget estimate of $2.000.000 for continuation of construction of the gila project is reduced to $800.210. this drastic reduction will delay completion of the gila project which offers so much hope as a means of providing irrigated farms for veterans. the predevelopment work on the gila project recommended in the budget estimates is of great value to future settlers and will protect the federal investment. the importance of the energetic prosecution of the reclamation program to the west. and to the nation as a whole. yes. and even to the world. cannot be too greatly stressed. i have on many previous occasions emphasized to the house the lasting values of the reclamation program. water is the lifeblood of the arid west. for the west to achieve that position of equality with the rest of the nation that is its due. its sparse water resources must be stored and brought to its dry. but fertile. acres. not only must this be done. but the great reservoirs necessary to be constructed must serve multiple purposespurposes of providing protection against floods. for paradoxical though it may seem. many areas of the arid west are ravaged by periodic floods caused by the melting of mountain snows and the runoff of occasional torrents. purposes of navigation. of hydroelectric power production to ease the burden of the farmer and to pump his irrigation water. of providing domestic and industrial water supplies for the towns and cities. and of providing for other purposes such as fish and wildlife conservation and recreation. the historyof our country amply demonstrates that the development of one region aids all others. in the reclamation program jobs are created not only at the site of construction. but in the east and south where machinery and other materials necessary in construction are produced. jobs are created on the railroads and truck lines which convey these materials to the site. in fact more than half of the jobs created by prosecution of the reclamation program will be in the mines. mills. factories. and transportation systems of the midwest. east. and south. but the beneficent effect of the reclamation program does not stop with production. to quote a phrase. \"its only the beginning. folks!\" new farms and homes and other enterprises are created. these farms provide badly needed food and fiber. the products of irrigated farms are. in the main. not competitive with crops grown under dryland farming. they provide specialty crops. crops which fill voids in the nations agricultural production. these new farms and enterprises which are created also provide important markets for the goods produced elsewhere in the country. in short. the reclamation program is of the greatest importance in contributing to the development of an expanding. but balanced. economy. congress just this session has taken a great forward step in passing the high levels of employment and production bill. in so doing. congress recognized that our economy must expand if the nation is to avoid the catastrophe of future depressions. but those laudable goals will not be achieved merely by passing highsounding legislation. to achieve those goals. a job must be done. the reclamation program is a part of that job. at the outset of my remarks. i referred to the importance of the reclamation program to the world. it is important to the world because if the united states. the greatest nation in the world today. does not achieve an expanded. stabilized economy. the entire world will be in turmoil and unrest. but to return to the effect of the reclamation program upon this country. and particularly on the west. construction of reclamation projects. resulting as it does in the creation of new wealth. brings into the local. state. and federal treasuries new revenues in the taxes paid on the wealth so created. the expenditures made by the federal government to create that wealth. and the homes. farms. jobs. markets. and industry it provides are not mere donations made to the general welfare and written off as a pumppriming contribution. far from it. the expenditures made by the federal government for the construction of reclamation projects is an investment by the government in the wellbeing of the nation which is reimbursable to the federal treasury. coming back in the form of repayments of construction charges by water users. payments for the sale of water for municipal and industrial uses. and payments for the sale of hydroelectric power. congress has recently concerned itself with concrete measures to ease the transition of the veteran from military to civilian life. it has passed measures to provide temporary housing for veterans. a more permanent veterans housing bill has passed the house. congress has passed the gi bill of rights. it has facilitated the purchase. by veterans. of surplus government property. but congress must do more to even begin to repay the incalculable debt the country owes its veterans. construction of reclamation projects to provide farms for veterans is one of the most practicable ways of providing veterans with the means of a decent. civilian livelihood. the cuts made by the appropriations committee in the presidents request for the bureau of reclamation will. unless restored. drastically curtail the opening up of new irrigated farms for the veteran. i say it is penny wise but pound foolish to appropriate millions of dollars for temporary housing and unemployment relief for veterans and then balk at appropriating funds. which as i said before are reimbursable. necessary to provide permanent opportunities for a livelihood. it is false economy. also. to make appropriations for construction of power plants and then to refuse funds for the construction of electric transmission lines necessary to carry that power to the market centers. power must bear by far the greatest share of the cost of reclamation projects. failure to appropriate funds for the necessary transmission lines will result in the governments being at the mercy of the few wealthy power companies that can afford to build lines to the government dams. it jeopardizes the whole repayment structure of the reclamation program.. not only that. but it results in a denial of the very policies of preference to public bodies and cooperatives in the sale of reclamation power that congress has written into the reclamation laws for 40 years. without transmission lines. those preferences are meaningless. because those public bodies do not and cannot command the financial resources necessary to build networks of transmission lines. congress has recently increased by millions the lending authority of the rural electrification administration. but rea coops are distributing agencies. not transmission agencies. in many parts of the west. rea depends largely on the bureau of reclamation to deliver power to its local cooperatives. unless transmission lines are provided by the bureau of reclamation to deliver its power. the rea program in the west will. in large measure. fail to achieve the policy laid upon it by congress of providing lowcost power to farm customers. in concluding my remarks. i say to you that the bureau of reclamation has -a most important job to do. that job cannot be done unless it is provided with adequate funds not only for construction of projects. but for investigations of the feasibility of proposed new projects. for the operation of existing projects and for the salaries and expenses of administering the reclamation program that congress has authorized.","mr. chairman. it would be utterly impossible within the 30 minutes assigned to me to answer in detail the various charges made by the gentleman from california. i do propose to answer some of those charges in part. i respectfully submit that the charges have bee4 answered in detail and to the complete satisfaction. i believe. of every member who will read the testimony by mr. charles taft. who is presently employed by the state department. and who is the son of a former republican president of the united states. since other members of the committee have discussed in detail the past record of the reciprocal tradeagreements program and have explained the amendments adopted in the committee. i propose to discuss the amendments to h. r. 3240. which the republicans offered in committee and which will. according to press releases. be offered again on the floor. the house should know the reasons justifying the defeat of these amendments by your committee and why they should be defeated by members. the general purpose of these amendments is to make the authority bontained in the bill unworkable. i will take them up in order and show why this is true. the first two republican amendments would shorten the period of renewal to 1 or 2 years. it will be claimed by the opposition that it is dangerous to renew the authority for as long as 3 years in view of the great uncertainties which lie ahead. this argument can be made equally to renewal of the act for 1 year and to the increase of authority which section 2 provides. the fact is that these uncertainties. which all of us know exist. are one of the best reasons why the renewal must carry adequate authority and be for an adequate period. the greatest uncertainties facing american business from abroad are what foreign countries are going to do about trade barriers and how far they are going to go in the direction of government trading and government control of trade. we are in favor of free enterprise in this country. but we do not know how many other countries are going to be with us on that question. in all of devastated europe the pressure is very strong to say that only the state. only the government. is big enough and strong enough to do what has to be done to get factories and mines repaired. production started. and people back to work. there is the closest balance in many of those countries between those people who want government to take over everything. and those who want to return to private enterprise. private trade. and a sound international economic situation. if we want them to come out on the side of private trading and an international relationship that will permit our surpluses to find markets abroad. we must give our representatives something to offer to them. and we must give them enough time within which to accomplish the desired results. it takes many. many days of labor to make a trade agreement. the careful study which has been described in the hearings and the debate. and the working out of safeguards to fit all the special cases that arise. and the process of negotiation all take much time. if we want anything done. we must extend the law sufficiently to afford an opportunity for action. the last 6 months of whatever time we fix is lost. anyway. because no one is going to start negotiations with us when the act is almost ready to expire. three years is the shortest period we should consider for the renewal of this program. the peoples of devastated europe. who think as we do and desire our way of life. need leadership as no other peoples in all history needed statesmanlike guidance. will we quibble over whether we will afford them economic leadership? should our ability to lead be jeopardized by fear to place in the presidents hands an instrument of sufficient life to do the needed work? next year may be too late. in the economic field. for us to awaken with the desire to aid those longing for free enterprise in europe. by then they may have lost their desire to carry on if given no cooperation now by us. let us. in considering h. r. 3240. be motivated by the lofty opportunities of tomorrow and not be deluded by the fears of the pessimist whose vision is limited by the boundaries of yesterday. another proposed republican amendment provides for congressional review of trade agreements. but such review is neither necessary constitutionally nor desirable from a policy viewpoint. five times. beginning in 1934. the ways and means committee has carefully considered the socalled constitutional objections to the program. its conclusion remains. as always before. on the basis of precedents and authority. going back to the early days of the republic. that no constitutional or other legal considerations require senate ratification of trade agreements. and the trade agreements act involves no improper delegation of legislative power. the question of whether individual trade agreements should be submitted to congress or the senate is purely one of policy. we know what would happen if they were submitted. we would have long hearings. we would take up every item. and we wourd very seldom ratify what was proposed. the senate has ratified three effective trade treaties in all our past history. that is the record of the past on tariff treaties. and it would be the record of the future. the only way we can successfully get action. through international agreement. on trade barriers is to give the president a carefully guarded authority to make agreements on his own responsibility and with the best advice that he can get. we should lay down the standards. as we do in this law. and we should make clear what we want. then we should let the president operate. just as we let the interstate commerce commission operate on freight rates. and we should carefully review what has been done each time renewal of the act comes up. just as we are doing now. if we hogtie this program with a requirement of senate ratification or congressional approval. we may as well forget the program. certainly the world will. another republican amendment would strike out section 2. that would leave the program a nice memory but not mlch else. when congress first considered and passed this bill. back in 1934. the proposition was to let the president reduce individual rates by not more than 50 percent of what they were then. the bill with section 2 proposes to let him do the same thing now. it lets him start from the rates as they were on january 1. 1945. and make new agreements on that basis. that does not mean he is going to cut every rate tomorrow. or next year. when president roosevelt was operating under the original authority he made 50 percent cuts in the first 3 years on 121/ percent by value of our dutiable imports. and in the first 6 years on 24 percent. in the first 11 years. that is down to now. the full cut has been applied on 42 percent of our dutiable imports. unless someone thinks that president truman is going to operate much more rapidly and recklessly than president roosevelt did. he need not worry about too rapid use of this authority. what section 2 proposes is an enabling act. not a tariff cut tomorrow.. the reason for the change of the base date is to relate the authority to present facts. and give our representatives something to bargain with. in the course of the last 11 years the original authority has been completely exhausted in respect to 42 percent of our dutiable imports on the basis of 1939 values. that is. duties have been reduced on this percentage of our dutiable import trade by the full 50 percent permitted under the existing law. the authority has been partially exhausted. and in some cases almost fully exhausted. in respect to an additional 20 percent of our dutiable imports. of the remaining authority. which has not been used at all and which covers about 38 percent of our dutiable imports. a considerable portion relates to products of germany and japan. if we want to have authority to deal with our chief allies and best customers. we must leave section 2 in the bill. should you be asked whether you desire barriers and discriminations to our trade reduced or removed. all would answer yes. yet when you are given the privilege of adhering to the only plan so far advocated which offers hope of accomplishing your desires. many of you stand ia awe of complaints from protected industries and avoid the possible means of correcting many of the economic evils we see arising in the postwar period to confound us. dispel this awe. for the complaints are unfounded. no industry has been injured. no industry will be injured under this program by greater world trade. be not misled by false predictions of what may happen. be convinced by the record of what has happened. two other republican amendments would require the president. in absolute terms. to withhold all tradeagreement rates of duty from any country which discriminated at all against united states trade. or would require each country to give us compensating concessions for receiving tradeagreement concessions granted by us to other countries. the act as now worded provides that the tradeagreement concessions shall. as a general rule and in accordance with the unconditional mostfavorednation policy formally adopted in the early 1920s by a republican administration and adhered to ever since. be applied to like products imported from all countries. however. the president is authorized to suspend the application of such concessions to products of countries found by him to be discriminating against american commerce. thus. some republican members urge the rejection of a wise policy adopted by a republican administration and for which they voted in 1922 and 1930. these provisions of the law as it stands represents a realistic approach to the problem of foreign discrimination. under these provisions. and with the gradual spread of the whole program. many foreign discriminations previously existing have been removed. many more have been greatly reduced. and an untold number have been prevented from occurring. the record of accomplishment on this score is impressive. it could not have been as impressive as it is if the punitive power to suspend or to require special concessions in exchange for extension of concessions on our part had been used automatically and blindly whenever any discrimination. no matter how small or indirect. had been discovered. the mandatory provision proposed by the republicans overlooks a number of practical considerations. for one thing. we have many commercial treaties and agreements which obligate this country to accord unconditional mostfavorednation treatment to the commerce of the foreign countries concerned. would the opposition have the president ignore these obligations whenever any evidence of discrimination. however small and possibly unintentional. could be dug up? for another thing. there are a number of small countries which have been practically forced in the past through no great fault of their own but under strong economic pressure from abroad. particularly from germany. to enter into bilateral trade arrangements which have in some cases had an adverse effect on american export trade in certain articles. being short of dollars and under the practical necessity of using blocked marks. such cofntries have sometimes restricted imports of some things from the united states while permitting imports of like articles from germany. would the minority have wanted to force the president against his better judgment. in such a case. to suspend the application of tradeagreement rates of duty to products of the victim of nazi economic aggression? would it have wanted to do so regardless of the cost in terms not only of trade but also of international friendship? in such a case the practical effect would have been to impair the ability of the victim country to sell its products in this country. and so to reduce further its supply of dollars and force it to restrict its imports from this country even further. punitive power in foreign relations should be permissive rather than mandatory. there are frequently mitigating circumstances which ought to be considered. there ought to be. in any event. the possibility of weighing the pros and cons of using the punitive power in a given set of circumstances. without such reasonable flexibility the result is likely to be to defeat the main purpose that we all agree on. namely. the promotion of american trade on a fair basis. as free as possible from discriminations. another republican amendment provides that no proclamation shall be made reducing duties below amounts necessary to equalize conditions of competition in the domestic market. that is another form of the costofproduction ideasection 336 of the republican smoothawley tariff act in disguise. on that one i want to quote a good republican. the former chairman of the tariff commission. mr. robert lincoln obrien. here is what mr. obrien said before the committee on ways and means way back in 1934: the notion that you can obtain costs of production. the notion that you ought to obtain them. the notion that tariffs between countries should rest upon differences in costs of production. even if omniscience should give us the power to determine them. is all wrong. the tariff is a question of national policy. on some things you ought to have a tariff greater than the difference in the cost of production. other things less than the difference in cost of production. comparative costs. when they can be ascertained. are. of course. important elements in any decision about tariff rates. in the administration of the tradeagreements program available cost data have been supplied by the tariff commission and have been given considerable weight. along with other factors. among these factors are the following: first. rank of the foreign country as a supplier. second. present duty and tariff history. third. effectiveness of the duty. including its relation to other duties. fourth. domestic consumption and markets. fifth. localization of foreign competition. sixth. competitive factors other than cost of production. such as methods of production. comparability as to quality. and technological changes. seventh. importance of the united states market to foreign suppliers. eighth. foreign controls of prices and markets. including cartel operations. ninth. exports from and imports into the united states. tenth. competitive conditions under the existing duty and probable effects thereon of a concession. and. eleventh. ability to supply quickly changing needs of a market. it would be quite wrong to substitute a single arbitrary rule for the flexibility which the present law permits. the escape clause so carefully worked out permits action to offset any excessive competition. whether due to cost advantage or other factors. those who favor an arbitrary costof production formula argue that after the war united states costs will be higher than foreign costs and that domestic producers will therefore be at a great disadvantage. the fact is. however. that all the available evidence points to a further advance in the competitive efficiency of american industries in world trade. the united states will emerge from this war with its productive machine intact. and with many of its industries and farms at a peak of efficiency as a result of rapid technological advances. in contrast. the productive efficiency of many foreign countries will have been gravely impaired by the war. not only because of direct war damage to industrial and transportation systems. but also because so many people have been killed or driven from their homes and starved. the danger is not that private enterprise in the arsenal of democracy will be unable to compete on an equal footing with enterprise elsewhere. but that it may be denied the opportunity to compete because of the failure of this and other countries to adopt reasonable commercial policies under which private enterprise can flourish. another republican amendment would delete the provision in the law which makes section 516 (b) of the tariff act of 1930 not applicable to trade agreements items. section 516 (b) is the section which lets a domestic producer institute a lawsuit to question the classification of an imported article. this is a most extraordinary proposition. the domestic producer. who has no direct interest in the transaction between the importer and the government. is nevertheless given the privilege of litigating it. this procedure was never known to our common law nor to our statutory law until it was introduced in the tariff act of 1922 and continued in 1930. this privilege has no relation to any legal rights of the protected producers. the supreme court has expressly recognized that no one has a legal right to any particular rate of duty. in norwegian nitrogen co. v. united states (288 u. s. 294). the supreme court states specifically that no one has a legal right to the maintenance of an existing rate of duty. it is simply wrong to assert that he has. the reason why section 516 (b) was made inapplicable to tradeagreement matters was because that section was incompatible with the purpose of the trade agreements act to free international trade from excessive and unnecessary restrictions and obstructions. in practice. section 516 (b) had resulted in obstructing american businessmen who were trying to do a legitimate import business. it had caused long delays in clearing goods through the customs. while protected interests litigated rates of duty over periods extending up to several years. there is no reason for now changing the law so as to extend this extraordinary privilege. its introduction in 1922 was a radical departure from the customary and longestablished procedures and precedents which had been known to our courts and to congress for many years. and it ought not to be expanded beyond its present limits. another republican amendment would exempt from duty reduction articles competing directly with the products of domestic handicraft industries. handicraft industries are described as those in which the salaries and wages of direct or indirect labor constitute 50 percent or more of the cost of production and on which the census bureau can obtain and publish industrial statistics. special privileges of this sort for one group of producers would be out of harmony with the general spirit of equal treatment. as regards safeguards from possible injury and on other matters. to all components of american economy. this has been a basic principle in the trade agreements act and its operation. in negotiating and administering trade agreements great care has been given to avoiding tariff reductions of a sort which would seriously injure any domestic industry. but no privileged class of exempt producers has ever been set up. if we start setting up special exempt and privileged classes there is no telling where we will stop. i suggest that we should not begin. amendments may be proposed to deny the benefit of tradeagreement rates to countries where wage rates are low. or it may be proposed to deny entry altogether to goods produced in such countries. to do that would be a tragic blunder. the idea back of such amendments is. of course. that low wages mean low costs. it is claimed that our markets will be flooded by the cheap products of cheap foreign labor. and that american producers will be forced to cut their costs by cutting wages in order to compete. . the inference is that no tariff should be cut. this is an old argument. and represents an old fear. but there is nothing in it. if there were. this act would have been repealed long since by unanimous consent. the quickest proof that there is nothing in the argument lies in the fact that the historical record is against it. this act has been in force for 11 years. many american tariff rates have been reduced by operations under ita large part of them by half of their original amount. but wage rates have not come down. on the contrary there has been a substantial movement upward. throughout the country and over the whole period. not only of hourly wages but of weekly takehome pay. obviously the gain in general prosperity. from 1934 to 1939. was not caused solely by this law. but this law helped. and the record shows that numerous and -substantial reductions in the rates of duty did not depress wages. the plain fact is that costs do not depend on hourly wages only. but on productivity per labor hour. henry ford is only one of many american businessmen who have demonstrated by example that high wages and low costs are possible together. the superiority of american manufacturing methods. of which high wages are a part. rests upon that demonstration. if it were not true. we could not sell abroad at all. for american wages. in almost all lines. are higher than the wages paid for corresponding work abroad. what are the reasons for the extremely lowlabor standards of a country like china? clearly not the desires of the chinese people. the fundamental trouble is that under the conditions of production there prevailing. both in industry and agriculture. the production of wealth per manhour is not great enough to pay a decent wage. as one witness for a leading labor union put it to the committee: high wages result from high productivity. imaginative and progressive managerial leadership. and good union organizationand not from tariffs. that same witness. jacob s. potofsky. the secretarytreasurer of the amalgamated clothing workers and the chairman of the latinamerican affairs committee of the cio. went on to say: moreover. we think that real standards of living depend not only on what is in the pay envelope but on .what we can buy with it the only effective protection the american worker has against socalled foreign competition is not a tariff barrier against foreign goods but efficient production at home and a decent standard of living abroad. no. our friends on the other side cannot pose as the only friends of the american workingman. all of us want to give laborers a fair deal. on both sides of the aisle. but on this proposition the people who really speak for them are on our side of the argument. read the testimony before the committee and see whether working people think this law is good for them or not. our friends on the republican side did not propose in the committee any amendment relating specially to farm products. but it has been urged here on the floor that this whole program is bad for farmers. and that imports of farm products under a: continuation of the program will ruin domestic agriculture. we import a lot of agricultural products into the united states and always have. most of them are things we do not produce in the united states at allcoffee. tea. cocoa. bananas. and so on. they are on the free list. another big import is sugar. and if a lot of sugar did not come in it would be necessary to have rationing all the time. because we have never produced in this country anywhere near what we consume. the tariff on sugar is not the main protection of domestic producers. their real protection is in the quota system under the sugar act. this tradeagreements legislation gives no one any authority to change that act in any way. the future of that act will be strictly up to us in congress when the time comes. it has nothing to do with the present legislation. the tradeagreements program directly benefits farmers in three ways: first. it improves foreign markets for the crops we normally exportwheat arid flour. tobacco. cotton. pork products. apples. and so on. second. it improves pay rolls in industry in the united states. and makes a better market here for all farm products. third. it brings in more cheaply some of the things that farmers need to buy. the best proof that this is true is that the american farm bureau and national farmers union say so after very careful study. look at their testimony in the record and see what farmers really think. let me read you a short passage from that testimony: the proposed legislation. h. r. 2652 (now h. r. 3240) grants the president authority to change our tariff duties 50 percent of the rates existing january 1. 1945. rather .50 percent of the rates existing in 1934. as provided in the present legislation. we believe that this additional authority to be used on a selective basis is essential to the successful operation of the trade agreements program. in closing. i would like again to state that the american farm bureau federation favors the extension of the trade agreements act until june 1948. with the granting of permissible authority to change our tariff duties in such a manner as to permit an expansion of the trade agreements program. it has been demonstrated that this program has made a significant contribution to the welfare of this nation. that it has had an influence on increasing our foreign trade. and that it has been intelligently and fairly administered. without causing undue hardships upon any segment of our economy. we believe that it is absolutely essential to continue this program in order to fulfill our hopes of maintaining international peace. and as a vital instrumentality in aiding national prosperity and maintaining a prosperous agriculture. my next witness in point is the president of the united states. in a signed statement inserted in the record by senator thomas of utah on march 26. 1940. and appearing at page a1647. mr. truman said: during the recent debate in connection with house joint resolution 407. to extend the reciprocal trade agreements act for an additional 3year period. charges were made by opponents of the measure that domestic agriculture has been injured by the operation of the act. it seems selfevident that if the trade agreements program has been in fact injurious to american agriculture as claimed. opponents of the proposal to extend its operation another 3 years would produce facts and figures to support their charges. none have been produced. why? it may be asked. the answer is simple. because in reality. throughout the entire tradeagreements period domestic agriculture has been substantially aided by the trade agreements program. it is my judgment. therefore. that such amendments as have been discussed should be defeated so that our president may be given the greatest possible freedom within the limits of the bill as written to work toward the accomplishment of our goals of more liberal world trade. prosperity. and peace.","mr. president. the tennessee valley. prior to the act of congress passed in 1933. faced much the same problem that we face in the missouri valley today. it had a tremendous potential resource in the tennessee river. but it was relatively undeveloped. it was subject to devastating floods. the fertile topsoil of its basin was steadily wasting away under the prevailing agricultural practices. forest resources were disappearing rapidly under the generally accepted cutting practices. in the -hills were valuable minerals which lay -dormant or were little used because of .the lack of technical knowledge which .could enable the discovery and demon.stration of the possibilities of.development by private businessmen. today that picture has changed.* in little more than a decade the tennessee river has been substantially harnessed and controllednot for one purpose. but for three. last spring. while the missouri raged out of its banks. causing more than $30.000.000 damage. the tennessee valley also had heavy rainsfar above normal for 2 months. in the tennessee valley. also. the river rose: but the rise was checked by great dams. the crests were clipped from the floods. and the excess water was stepped down harmlessly through a succession of great reservoirs. ever since the days when the flatboats of the pioneers. westward bound. floated down the tennessee. the value of the river as a navigation channel has been talked about and promoted. as early as 1825. over a century ago. the.first attempts were made to master muscle shoals. the greatest barrier to navigation. but they failed. today a commercially useful channel extends the 650mile length of the tennessee. and on it are carried wheat. coal. pigiron. automobiles. military vehicles. forest products. limestone for synthetic rubber manufacture. and many other types of cargo. freight traffic has multiplied four times in almost the same number of years. in 1933. the power potentialities of the tennessee river were almost undeveloped. a dam here and there captured and released but a fraction of the possible power in the uncontrolled river. today. the system of 20 dams of the t. v. a.. supported by several steam plants. produces 10.000.000.000 kilowatt hours of electricity a yeartwice as much power as st. louis. kansas city. and omaha use in a year. with practically threequarters of this total going into war industry. the industrial contribution of the tennessee valley to the winning of the war has been several times multiplied. that this industrial production. depending upon power. has been due to the tva is shown by the fact that this organization. under the mandate of congress. has practically doubled its generating capacity since the war started. the t. v. a.. a unique organization among government corporations. was able to deliver the results. and it did. in the longer. slower process of rebuilding the land. the t. v. a. likewise has made progress. here the results have been centered around the use of phosphatic fertilizers used in farming systems which promote the growing of soilconserving and waterconserving cover crops. some 30.000 testdemonstration farmersmany of them outside the tennessee valleyhave reported increased income. increased production. and more stable farm resources as the result of the use of concentrated phosphate fertilizers developed at the muscle shoals plant of the t. v. a.-an unused asset of the federal government prior to the tennessee valley is primarily an agricultural area. as is the missouri valley. but with the t. v. a. the tennessee valley has made great strides in new industrial development. from 1933 to 1940. the period prior to the war. new chemical and lightmetal industries established themselves in the valley. drawn by the available raw materials and ample lowcost power. existing heavy industry expanded. and a substantial expansion and addition of existing or new enterprises. ranging from the processing of frozen foods and the development and processing of dairy products to the manufacture of aircraft. stoves. ground mica. metal dies. and forestry and timber products. took place rapidly. all these developments are reflected in the story of what happened to the level of income in the tennessee valley between 1933 and 1940. in the seven tennessee valley states. per capita income increased 73 percent. as compared with a 56percent increase for the country as a whole. bank deposits increased 76 percent in the tennessee valley states. while the whole country showed an increase of 46 percent. retail sales increased 81 percent as compared with a 71 percent increase for the country as a whole. the tennessee valley is moving to the front among the regions of the nation. it is no longer regarded as our no. 1 economic problem. the tennessee valley is now known as the region of great promise and rapid fulfillment. the region of expanding opportunity. mr. president. what does the tennessee valley possess that we in the missouri valley lack? the people of the tennessee valley know. and they will tell you. they have an agencyan expert partnercharged with the overall purpose of showing how the people can develop. conserve. and use all of their natural resources. they have a working partner able and willing to see the problems of their valley as a wholenot just flood control. not just navigation. not just power. not just big business. not just agriculture. the people of the tennessee valley have an agency which makes its decisions in the region. not in washington. its experts. its engineers. its technicians and managers work under a board of directors. with offices in the region. with doors open to the people and their agencies and institutions. \" the people of the tennessee valley know that the t. v. a. is not the special agent or adviser of one interest against another. they know that the t. v. a. is under a mandate from congress to see each problem and opportunity of the valley as it is related to other problems. the people of the tennessee valley know that the t. v. a. cannot escape responsibility and accountability for what it does or fails to do. it must live face to face with the people it is there to serve. the distance between the tennessee valley and washington is no protection to the accountability of the t. v. a. it is always on the spot. always at hand. it is always held to the task of a full development of all the resources of the valley for all the people. i say this is what we lack in the missouri valley. our destiny is not clear until we get it. mr. president. i do not propose that the missouri valley copy the experience of the tennessee valley in detail or in its technical plan or program. i do propose. however. that we obtain and adopt to the peculiar circumstances of the missouri valley the main idea so successfully demonstrated by the tennessee valley. that means we must have a regional agency. free from the evils of remote vetoes by the scores of bureaus in washington. its officers of decision and its experts must be located in the region where their work will be. it must have a responsibility broad enough to encompass the major resource problems of our region in its studies. demonstrations. and program of work and accomplishment. it must view itself as a working partner of existing agencies of the federal and state governments. and of private groups and organizations pledged to promote the public interest. it must have sufficient authority to achieve its responsibilities without the power of.coercion. persuasion by force of fact and reason will be the instrument at its handnot dictation by directives or administrative decree. congress will determine its broad charter and the policies by which it will be governed. congress and the president will hold it accountable for its broad accomplishments. the people of the valley will judge it every day by how well. how efficiently. how honestly. and how devotedly it carries on its work. it will be an instrument of the people. a union of technicians. experts. eng ineers. managers. and laymen working at the side of the citizens and institutions of the valley. these are the essential features of the t. v. a. idea we would adopt for our own in the missouri valley. this new departure pioneered for all of america in the tennessee valley did not come overnight. it came after mature consideration. for more than a century since 1825 the possibilities of development of the tennessee river for navigation had been recognized. talked about. and promoted. with the development of longdistance transmission lines for electricity and advances in engineering technique in harnessing water power for electricity. a second purpose for development came to the fore. the building of wilson dam as a project of the first world war highlighted this phase of river development. and for 15 years before the t. v. a.. congressional and public debate over the tennessee river was concentrated on this issue. at the same time. the damaging force of the flood waters of the tennessee were recognized. both for their effect in the tennessee valley and for their contributions to the devastating floods on the lower ohio and mississippi rivers. while the debate went on. little was accomplished in the way of control of the river. it ran on as usual. sometimes surging in great floods and at other times diminishing to a relative trickle. this is a familiar story to those of us who live in the missouri valley. we have been witnessing and suffering from repeated floods. idle gnd wasted water power. clogged river channels. we are the victims of the repeated paradox of too much or too little water in the wrong places at the wrong time. the tennessee valley went through the same general era of doubt. surveys and more surveys. reports and more reports. controversy. false starts. frustration. and piecemeal planning. but with the establishment of the tennessee valley authority. given the responsibility for development of the river in its essential unitynot for flood control alone. power alone. or navigation alone. but for the maximum benefits of all three purposesthings began to happen. in little more than a decade the things which people of the tennessee valley and the nation hadtalked about for a century were practically achieved. the old controversies over what kind of developmeat should be attempted dissolved into thin air when congress boldlyattacked the problem of developing the river as a unity. in passing the t. v. a. act. the congress departed from the usual custom of assigning the development of one use of a river to one agency. another use to another agency. and the problems of the land. the forests. and the minerals to still other bureaus and departments. instead. it looked upon the tennessee river and its great basin as a unity. as in plain fact it exists in nature. congress and the president saw the tennessee river in the entirety of its possibilities for developmentnot separately . as a possible navigation channel or as a power producer or as a monster only to be controlled against floods. nor was the river viewed as something separate from the land. it was recognized that what happens in the river is inevitably and closely related to what happens on the land. if land is unwisely used. for whatever reason. the effect is immediately apparent in the river. the slashing of forests and the continual planting of row crops which leave the soil barren to the rains shows in the murky and muddy character of the river in flood. water which is not held on the land. captured by vegetation. and retained for the use of plants. rushes headlong to the river. carrying with it always some of the components and fertility of the soil. those were the principles congress observed in devising a remedy for a whole region. the same principles are there for us to observe in the missouri valley. we want an opportunity to see our region and its resources as a whole. but congress knew that the t. v. a. would need more than the application of a broad and unified policy. congress recognized the fact that the assignment of broad responsibilities must be accompanied by the granting of a reasonable degree of managerial discretion for daytoday decisions within the policies congress laid down. having placed upon the t. v. a. the responsibility for carrying. out a program of unified development. the congress also gave to the new agency the tools of modern management needed to do the job. congress outlined the broad objectives. made sure that the t. v. a. could be responsible and accountable for results. and then gave it freedom to operate to obtain the desired results. thus it avoided bureaucratic overcentralization. red tape. and the overburdening of the agency with specific detail of methods and with division of authority over various phases of its operations. for example. the t. v. a. was given the power to hire its staff without reference to the federal civil service laws or regulations. nor was t. v. a. to be an agency of political patronage appointments. congress stipulated that appointments must be made solely. on the basis cf merit and efficiency. and without any political tests or considerations. the t. v. a. was given the power to acquire land for its reservoirs. this task was not turned over to some federal department not having responsibility for the final result. which is the usual federal practice. - congress gave the t. v. a. the power to make purchases of materials and equipment in its own right. after weighing such considerations as suitability of equipment for the task in hand and the reliability of the seller. as well as the price bid. with this freedom of action. of course. congress imposed measures to hold the t. v. a. to strict accountability and responsibility for results. the t. v. a.. endowed with the powers of modern management. cannot pass the buck when results are not up to expectations. it cannot. for example. complain that another department of government is responsible if land is not -purchased rapidly enough to meet engineering construction schedules. it cannot claim that dams were poorly designed or built badly byanother agency. if they do not achieve the results expected of them. for the results. whatever they may be. the t. v. a.. and the t. v. a. alone. is responsible. it may reap the praise for a job well done. conversely. it must bear the blame if the job goes badly. mr. president. i say this is what we want in the missouri valley. how great a departure this is from the usual government practice is indicated in a recently published book. \"t. v. a.-democracy on the march.\" by david e. lilienthal. present chairman pf the t. v. a. board of directors. in this book. based on his 11 years experience on the board of the t. v. a.. he pointed out thatthe policies of lawmaking in the immediate past have been largely regulatory and negative: \"this shall not be done.\" the tradition and climate of the skill of management. however. are remote from all such negation. management is affirmative and initiatory: \"this is to be done.\" it is in the process of defining. with skill and sense. what is to be done. and with it the fixing of responsibility for results. with wide freedom for judgment in the managers as to how it may best be done. that you have the essence of the best modern management. can there be any doubt that we could use this idea to break the inertia of our missouri valley? but congress. in its wisdom. went one step further in creating the t. v. a. the t. v. a. was not to be a superbureau of the federal government imposing its will upon the people of a vast region. congress wanted to be sure that this regional agency would be at home with the people and their problems of resource development. in setting up this government agency. the congress decreed that it shouldnot establish its headquarters in - washington. remote from the locale in which its work lay. with only regional offices in the valley. instead. having settled upon the broad policies which govern the development. the congress provided that the. t. v. a. should maintain its headquarters in the region where its -responsibilities for development lay. in t. v. a.s office in washington there are only 10 employees. the administrators. engineers. and technicians are living and working in the tennessee -valley. . by those measures. the congress assured that the work of the t. v. a. would be closely related to the particular needs of the tennessee valley. in the valley. the t. v. a. is close to the people. accessible to those who have ideas -or complaints. and sensitive to their needs and desires in the matter of the development of resources. for it is not enough to say that \"resources shall be developed\". they must be developed in a way which squares with the basic needs and aspirations of the people concerned. only in that way can the regional. and national interests in the -development of resources be fulfilled. there is another reason why i want this close relationship between the missouri valley authority and the people of the valley. it is the best guaranty we can find to hold our agencies of government accountable for what they do. how they do it. and the results which they obtain. as mr. lilienthal pointed out in his bookworking at the grass roots is the surest guaranty of that daytoday adjustment to the needs and aspirations of the people which is the liveliert form of public accountability. when the managers and the experts are close to the people and their problems. it does not ordinarily take the formality of a congressional hearing to determine whether the program undertaken is succeeding or needs adjustment. whether the staff members are alive to their opportunities or are arrogant and selfseeking. thdse principles have been incorporated in the missouri valley authority bill because they have been tried and tested and found good on the basis of practical results. under the bill which i have introduced the m. v. a. would have the freedom of management. with all that implies. necessary to do a good and thorough job. with that essential freedom of management the m. v. a. likewise would be subject to full accountability for the manner in which it carried outits purposesboth formally to congress and less formally to the people directly involved. in general. the proposed missouri valley authority act incorporates the essential provisions.of the t. v. a. act. but i believe we have profited by the experience of the t. v. a.. and in some respects have made improvements which should be helpful. - one of the major objectives of the m. v. a. bill. providing for decentralization of administration. is to strengthen the role of state and local agencies in the broad developmental program. for many years we have heard the protests of those who feared too great a concentration of federal powers and the administration of them by remote control from washington. the t. v. a. experience has shown that such does not have to be the case. in plain fact. the role of state. educational. and local. institutions has been greatly enhanced in the tennessee valley through the t. v. a. the t. v. a. has developed to a high degree cooperative relationships with other agencies and with the people of the region themselves. it has actively sought their participation in carrying on the various phases of the program. because it was recognized that an active interest and participation by the people concerned was the very touchstone of the democratic method of getting things done. thus the agricultural program of the t. v. a. is not solely a federal affair. the t. v. a. had the responsibility of using the muscle shoals plants. built during world war no. 1. for the development of fertilizers. but the actual job of developing and testing the fertilizers. getting them to work on the land in soilbuilding and waterholding types of agriculture.- has been a cooperative job which has not only carried out the mandate of t. v. a. but has strengthened the programs of other agencies. for example. the decision to devote the plants to research and experimental production in phosphatic fertilizers was made cooperatively at conferences among representatives of t. v. a.. the department of agriculture and the landgrant colleges. it was decided that phosphates. rather than nitrates. were the more basic soil need. since most soils- are deficient in phosphorus. at the same time. using phosphorus in leguminous cover crops. such as clover and lespedeza. automatically fixes another great fertilizing agent. nitrogen. in the soil. as the fertilizers were developed and improved. the task of testing them was not undertaken as a federal project by the t. v. a. the testdemonstration program of the t. v. a.-now extended to more than 30.000 farms in 28 statesis a highly democratic process. the test demonstratorsactual \"dirt\" farmersare selected by groups of their neighbors joined in soilconservation associations. in return for receiving t. v. a. concentrated phosphatic fertilizers. on which they pay only the freight charges. the cooperating farmers agree to use the materials in accordance with plans of farm management which they work out with the assistance of their county agents. and to keep records by which the efficacy of the fertilizers may be judged in terms of increased productiveness of the soil and increased income to the farmer. the extension services of the landgrant colleges administer the program in their respective states. . thus the objectives of the t. v. a. in this field are achieved not by encroaching upon- the fields of the other agencies. but instead by strengthening their programs. the same principle is applied in other fields where t. v. a. stands ready to proyide the technical services needed. but where initiative and purpose is vested in the people and the agencies concerned. thus states. municipalities. and counties have been assisted by the t. v. a. in developing parks and recreation areas on the shores of the t. v. a. reservoirs. state and local planning commissions have been strengthened by the cooperation. assistance. and technical services of the t. v. a. in the task of planning readjustments necessary or desirable to adjust communities affected by the building of dams and the filling of reservoirs. the job of developing new uses for resources of the valley and improving processes and machinery has likewise been carried xc--447 on cooperatively by t. v. a. with the departments of conservation of the states. with. engineering experiment stations. and with private business. for example. a superior type of cottonseed oil cooker now in use in a number of cottonseed mills in the southeast was developed by t. v. a. and the university oftennessee in cooperation with private business associations. in the course of its 11 years of work in the tennessee valley. the t. v. a. has developed this cooperative technique to a high degree. the t. v. a. program. as a result. is far from a federal affair with the aspects of overlordship which so many fear. but instead is a program soundly based on the participation of the people of the valley and their various governmental. educational. and private institutions. in drawing up the proposed. m. v. a. bill. we.have taken care that.this lesson of cooperation shall not be lost in the missouri valley. in this respect. the t. v. a. act was largely permissive. the t. v. a. was authorized to cooperate with other agencies. as a matter of policy. and as a means of getting things done in the best and most democratic manner. the t. v. a. board developed this policy of cooperation to the utmost. in the m. v. a. bill the lesson thus learned has been written specifically into the act. thus. it is provided that the authority \"shall utilize to the fullest possible extent the advice. assistance. and cooperation of the people of the region and their public and private organizationslocal. state. and federal.\" those. then. are the ideasthe principlestested in the tough crucible of experience. which are incorporated in the m. v. a. bill. they point the wayand i believe it is the only wayto the orderly development of the great basin of the missouri river. we must view the task in its overall aspects. taking the valley and all its resources as a unity and developing them as such. just as democracy itself is a constantly unfolding experience. so no one today can say the last word as to river valley developments. through the years and on the anvil of experience new vital concepts will be hammered out. it may not be possible yet to legislate definitely and wisely as to the priorities in water usage. but factually based determinations covering the equitable disposition of the total available supply will necessarily be a major task of the proposed missouri valley authority. mr. president. the objectives which are set forth in this bill ar6 not new. they are the -things for which we have been striving. without getting satisfactory results. for many years. what is new is the framework which it is proposed to set up to get these things done. a framework which will allow us to apply the knowledge of science and engineering to our problems in a way that will bring results. . we have in this country the engineering and scientific \"know how\" to accomplish our objectives. if only we give it free play under modern methods of management. if we assign a group of engineers to obtain flood control. or irrigation. or navigation. we know that they can produce plans which will provide the desired results. unfortunately. each of the plans. however excellent it may be for the specific purpose. meets with opposition from groups which feel that it endangers other results which must be accomplished on the same river. the result. all too often. is a stalemate. the m. v. a. bill simply provides the framework within which the engineers can address themselves. not to the problem of developing one or two of the latent possibilities of the river. but to an overall objective which is to develop the river as a unity. realizing all of the benefits which can be obtained from control of the river and from development and conservation of all the resources of the missouri basin. . here. mr. president. is a job for modern* pioneering on a grand scale in the national interest. such a development would help strengthen the nation. both for peace or for national. defense. just as the development of the tennessee valley has done. though the bill is concerned with only the basin of the missouri. it is truly national in character because the development of that region. and its increased prosperity. will add to the national strength and prosperity. the missouri valley authority bill proposes toput into effect the lessons learned in the development of the tennessee valleyits river and watershedwhich was envisioned 11 years ago as a national laboratory or pilot plant test of the unified approach to the development of resources. that project has proved immensely successful and it has opened up new possibilities for resource development all over the land. i think i can safely assume that my bill has the approval of the great conservationist who is our president. for franklin roosevelt. in asking for legislation creating the t. v. a.. used these words: if we are successful here (in the tennessee valley) we can march on. step by step. in a like development of other great natural territorial units within our borders. we were successful in the tennessee valley beyond our fairest dreams. the time has now come to march on into the great valley of the missouri.","mr. chairman. one of the questions of longstanding controversy in this nation. the socalled reciprocal trade agreements act. is again before congress today. as on previous occasions. when its extension has been before congress. we find those whose industries or businesses have been aided by these trade agreements loud in their praise of these trade treaties. while those whose interests have been injured by the act are joined in protest against permitting its undesirable features to become permanent policy in the united states. thus. the first law of nature. selfpreservation. or the law of survival. if you please. is again operating to influence the votes of members as they confront this issue. it is unfortunate that we are compelled to consider the extension of this executive authority to make trade agreements while we are in the midst of war. since it creates a highly artificial atmosphere in which to consider the operations of the act. the existence of war. furthermore. makes invalid.many of the arguments for either the extension or the discontinuance of the act during normal times because. by the very nature of things. very few items are now being imported into this country. consequently. our international trade during the war must inevitably continue to be controlled by the exigencies of war rather than by the operations of any tariff policy. and the terms by which the war is concluded and the arrangements which are or are not made for our particitbation in world affairs after the war will have a controlling effect upon our trade policy after peace has been secured and victory won. for that reason. our decisions here today are of less significance than they would be in normal times. because. regardless of what we do. the eventual trade and tariff policies of this country will rest very directly upon the eventual decisions on a much broader front which will be made determining our relationship with other nations after peace has come. today. we can do little more than indicate principles and policies which we feel should prevail under conditions of normal trade and to give assurance to the other nations of the world that this country is eager and ready to engage in mutually profitable international trade on a nondiscriminatory basis. our votes and decisions today. therefore. have much less of a permanent significance than similar votes would have in times of peace. we cannot possibly indicate an approval or disapproval of permanent reciprocal trade agreements in the postwar world until and unless we know what type of postwar world eventuates from this conflict and whether the operation of such trade agreements will prove an acceptable and workable part of the economic exchanges of that time. conditions at that time will have to govern our decisions concerning wise trade practices of the permanent future. the experiences of the past may help to light the path cf the future in that connection but they cannot guarantee the results to follow since we are all gazing into the crystal ball these days and none can foretell for certain what the pattern of the future will in finality reveal. for that reason. mr. chairman. i think the house acted wisely today in limiting the extension of these agreements to 2 years rather than to the traditional 3year period which has always been their period of operation in earlier legislation. two years from now we should be in better position to analyze the future than we are today. two years from now we all sincerely hope that victory will have been won and that we shall be well along the road to the adoption of a pattern of permanent peace for all the world. whether this pattern -will give additional value to reciprocal trade agreements as they have been administered or provide additional reason for their discontinuance or modification only the unfolding vista of the future can reveal. thus the limitation of this period of extension to two years will enable many more members to support the extension of this act today than would otherwise have been the case. by the same token. mr. chairman. since we are today dealing with theories and principles more than we are with the realities of trade it might be a good plan to incorporate in the extension of these agreements some of the features which past experience has indicated should have a place in their administration. should future developments indicate such features are unnecessary or unwise in the postwar world they co. id in turn: be modified but until and unless such time comes we might do well to incorporate these lessons of experience in this legislation as we give it a renewed extension of life. the gentleman from texas. congressman west. a great and good democrat from one of the strongest democratic regions of the union. is suggesting some of these desirable features this afternoon. this congress. operating under the mandate of section 8 of article i of the constitution which reads--= the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes. duties. imposts. and excises. to pay the debts. and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united statesis today giving deliberation to vhat should be the governing basis upon which reciprocal trade treaties can best fulfill their objectives. the amendment under consideration proposes thatno reduction shall be made in the duties of any competitive foreign product3 which will result in the entry of such competitive foreign products into the domestic market at prices which are less than the cost of production of like or similar domestic products. this amendment does not cripple nor condemn the reciprocal tradetreaty program except when and if it would admit into -this country products to be sold. competitively. with domestic products on such a basis as to force prices down to the point where american f armers. laborers. and manufacturers could not secure the cost of production for their products. obviously. america can neither prosper nor remain solvent if its producers are to be forced to sell for less than it cost them to produce the manufactured article or to raise the foods and fabrics on our farms. this amendment simply would prevent such a sabotaging of american economy by any unwise tradetreaty provisions. the financial security of this country. mr. chairman. is no greater than the col.lective financial security of its citizens and its producers. we must protect that if we are to avert national bankruptcy. the amendment proposed by the gentleman from texas seeks to protect that national solvency and individual financial security. it does nothing less nor nothing more. and it does -it equally for laboring men. for farmers. and for manufacturers. the gentleman from texas has announced other features which he believes should be incorporated in this legislation as it is now extended for another 2year term. some of these appear to have high merit. for example. if the present costofproduction amendment is defeated by those who believe the interests of american producers. workers. and businessmen can be ignored in the interests of promoting imports of cheap competitive foreign products. he will.. i understand. offer an amendment which will specify. \"no farm products can be imported under the terms of these treaties to sell in america for less than parity prices as determined by the department of agriculture.\" unless we are to provide permanent subsidies to the farmers of america. mr. chairman. they must receive parity prices for the foodstuffs and fabrics which they produce. the amendment of the gentleman from texas would assure that fact insofar as possible for tariff policy to do so and it would surely help provide parity levels for farm prices in this country. another approach offered by the gentleman from texas which will be of less importance if either of the foregoing amendments is adopted is an amendment providing that before agreements entered into under the terms of this act become effeotive congress shall have the right to approve or reject any items which appear to be of such a nature as to bring disaster and misfortune to any segment of this countrys economic activity. congress would have 90 days under the provisions of -that amendment to approve or reject such items in a given treaty. thus while congress would not write these trade agreements it would retain the power to protect its constituents against any possible gross inequities or glaring injustices. mr. chairman. none of us in time of war wants to do anything which would in any way make it more difficult for .the world to develop a working agreement for maintaining a permanent peace after the war is over. some of us may therefore vote for the extension of these trade treaties today simply as a gesture of good will to foreign countries realizing that until the war is over any trade and tariff policy is meaniagless since it cannot function in a world at war. however. it is likewise true that after the war is over steps must be taken to assure the fact that economic activity in america is not paralyzed or pauperized. some 10.000.000 men and women in uniform will resume their peacetime pursuits and they will be entitled to good jobs at american wage and salary scales. american farmers will be entitled to a fair price for a full crop and a chance to earn an independence cf their own. to absorb these millions back into our normal economic activities it will be necessary to permit producers of raw materials and manufacturers of finished products to operate at a profit and to employ laborers at decent american wage scales. if this is to be done. it will likewise be necessary that steps be taken to protect this country against any possible flood of foreign products at cutthroat prices which could force our own products from the markets as was done after the last war and force large groups in our population to look to public relief and the bread lines for a sustenance. we must be realists. mr. chairman. aswell as idealists in these troublous times. a prosperous america can consume and import much more of the worlds goods than an america which has reverted to the w. p. a. we should aim at an exchange oftrade with foreign nations at american price levels. rather than at world price levels. let us keep our sights high. a wise tariff policy forms the common denominator for translating american price levels and world price levels into a mutually profitable exchange. an unwise american tariff policy which is too low can isolate us from the rest of the worlds trade by reducing our rurchasing. power just as completely as an unwise american tariff policy which is too high can isolate us from. the rest of the worlds trade by barring its imports entirely from our shores. let us seek to attain*the wise and workable middle course which gives our domestic producers.the protection which they actually need and permits us to enjoy a prosperity which enables us to consume as much as desirable of the worlds products. let us in brief try to lift the world to our levels and ideals rather than trying to force our levels and ideals downward to those of less fortunate areas in the world.","mr. chairman. during the debate today the remark was made that each representative who spoke from the well of this house should let the opinion of his own district be submerged in the national good. however. i cannot follow that suggestion in this instance. and urge the congress to vote against the amendment which is here presented.. the dairymen of my section have been through much hardship. they have suffered great losses from flood. from fire. and from famine. now. to top it all off. they are being deprived of the labor which is necessary to run their farms and operate their dairies. add to that the cost of labor and the rising cost of feed and you will have the reason for my support of the gentlemans amendment. which will bring about lower feed prices.","mr. president. i may say to the distinguished senator from montana that i very much appreciate the reading of that telegram. coming from such an authority. i should say that it is very persuasive and conclusive. the newspapers in california announced my opposition to drafting boys under 21. before i left my office we received stacks of telegrams. and it was reported to me that there was not a single criticism of my stand. those telegrams came generally not from the pacifists or the isolationists. but from the american legioa and others who themselves had been following the president in his program. i am happy. however this legislation comes out. that the military affairs committee of the house of representatives. under the distinguished and courageous leadership of mr. may. and the house of representatives itself. have had the courage to stand up against the barrage of newspaper editorials and the demands of persons here in washington for the immediate passage of this bill. at least we can be happy that one of the great bodies of congress has had the courage to do what its members. believed to be the right thing. i now desire to call attention to another thing relevant to the telegram which has just been read by the distinguished senator from montana . i could almost have wept as our generals read to us the cruel and tragic statistics of our civil war. showing that an overwhelming proportion of our boys were under 20. 18yes. even 16 years of age. i thought of the ruined farms and homesteads in the south. where the barefoot boys of the south. 14. 15. and 16the only males left in their homeswent out with unbroken courage to die on the field of battle against overwhelming odds. i could have wept as i thought of that story. and yet apparently our generals wanted us to take that as a reason why we should again send out the boys of america. i thought of * the story of the federal army of men with money who paid bounties to the hundreds of thousands of immigrant boys. two or. three hundred dollars a piece. so that those germans or swedes or irish would take their places in the army. i thought of the desertions of those men. and.the sickness. and the deaths. and then. mr. president. i thought of exactly what is expressed by the telegram read by the distinguished senator from montana. of the psyco.paths. the criminals. and the moral breakdowns that followed the terrible civil war. i was born at the tail end of the pioneer age in wyoming. and i still saw the results of the civil war upon the character of the men who had fought in it as boysoh. not all of them. i do not mean that. there are boys of 14. 15. 16. 17. and 18 who have the morale and the courage and the character to endure the misery. the horror. and the fear of war. and their association in mass lots with other men. there are many boysperhaps half. perhaps a quarter of themwho can do that. but .here is many and many a boy who. at 18 or 19 or 20. is not ready for war. and he becomes a worse citizen if he survives the war. mr. president. distinguished members of the military affairs committee will corroborate me. i am suie. when i say .that one of the generals who appeared before the committee upon this very subject admitted that a large proportion of boys under 21 are not yet seasoned for war. he said some of them are. i think. perhaps. he expressed the opinion that half of them are. i have forgotten the proportion. he said that some are and some are not. the general went on to say: if i could personally talk to them. i could tell which boys are ready for the brutal. bloody business of war end which boys are not. unfortunately. neither that general nor anybody else can interview all boys in that respect. here on one side of the street is mike. a tough. hardy young irish boy of 19. seasoned for war his father is a poor man. across the street is another boy of the same age. the son of a wealthy man. who is not yet seasoned for life or for war. would any draft board dare to say. \"we have interviewed these two boys. one. by character and development. is ready for war. and the other boy is not?\" we cannot do that. the army said they felt so solicitous toward the men above 21. the 1.600.000 who have been declared ready for military service. that they did not want to draw upon any one age. but wanted to make parity everything from 19 up. mr. president. let me say that the generals are now getting their wish. because all over america the recruiting stations cannot handle the floods of recruits for the army. the navy. the marine corps. the coast guard. in 1 week alone in new york city the red cross fed 15.000 men waiting to register. and the account said that a substantial portion of them were under 19 and 20 years of age. so the army is going to have its fill of young boys. because i have no doubt that at least three or four hundred thousand of them. courageous. seeking adventure. will be inspired by patriotism. and will bravely go forth to enlist. mr. president. one of our most distinguished committeemen stated the proposition exactly as i have stated it. then said how unfair it would be to allow these young men to volunteer and not subject all the other boys to the draft. let us analyze that proposition. i am free to admit that some of our young men under 21 are eager for war. and i am willing to admit that as a class they will make the very finest soldiers. i venture to say. from what i personally know. that there is a marked correlation between those boys who are fit to go and those who volunteer. no general and no psychologist can segregate the group who should go from the group who should not go better than by the desire and the wish and the will of the boys themselves. i say that because i have talked to boys under 21. who are enlisting. and i find them almost uniformly fine physical specimens. well matured for their age. seasoned. and ready to take on the burdens of army life. but i know so many boys 17 and 18 and 19 and 20 who are not ready for the brutalities. and the discipline. and the danger of war. who cannot endure it without destruction to their characters and nervous systems. mr. president. the common law was a rather wise solomon. the common law fixed 21 as the age of adulthood. because it recognized that under that age the male sex were generally still boys. and over it they generally had become seasoned men. what will be the effect upon the boys under 21 if we enact the proposed law? there are 2.500.000 boys and girls in the united states now reaching majority each year. half of them are girls. roughly. and half are boys. so there are in the age group from 18 to 21 a million two hundred and fifty thousand boys coming of age each year. the army experts testify that at least onehalf of those would be without dependents. and would be fine war material. in the age group from 18 to 21. then. we would have almost 4.000.000 boys. scattered everywhere in the united states. in 4.000.000 homes. as i have already said. i have no doubt that the army will get three or four hundred thousand of that group. the cream of the group. the cream of the nation. by voluntary enlistments. but that does not satisfy them. although they admit it is true. let us now consider the balance of the group. we not only need military power. we more vitally need industrial power. let us assume a man. a farmer. in iowa. let us say. and that the department of agriculture has called for more corn to help feed more chickens. or more hogs. or the people in europe. here is a farmer with a 19yearold son he has an additional 60 acres of land which he can plant if he can utilize the labor of his son. if he should lose the labor of that son he would lose his seed and his crop. and he would not plant it. what kind of uncertainty is to be thrown upon that farm? how are we to cultivate national morale or national production by saying to that farmer. \"you plant that corn at your own risk. we want that boy of yours. the army is going to take him.\" the farmer will reply. \"i want to plant this corn. but i cannot do it unless i have my son.\" they will say. \"plant it at your own risk.\" i know a father with an 18yearold son in one of the chicken districts in california. who had planned to raise 1.500 additional chickens. at the request of the department of agriculture. he has now given up the idea. because he had to rely upon the labor of his 18yearold son. and just as soon as he saw the possibility that that boy might be made subject to the draft and taken from the chicken farm. he would not go ahead with his plan. what are boys in high school going to do? does anyone think they are going to enter. or that they are going to continue and work as they should. with all that uncertainty hanging over them? i say that it would be better for the army to take them outright than to make their lives so uncertain. what about the boys who might become apprentices. or go into some business in which the government needed them. but who dare not do it if this uncertainty is cast upon their lives? i contend we do not need to take these boys. voluntary enlistments will give us all we need in that age group. and to subject three or four million homes to the uncertainty of this proposal will not help the nation. but will profoundly demoralize and help to ruin it. mr. president. with the material we have above 21 years of age. in the next 2 or 3 years. if we include youths reaching 21. we could build an army of 4.000.000 men. if we do what the president says he is going to do. we cannot build such an army. every selectee who is drawn into service requires back of him the labor of 4 men in civilian and defense industries. if we take a million selectees and train them next year. that will be an abstraction from the manpower of the nation equivalent to 5.000.000 men. if we should try to handle 2.000.000 additional. it would mean an abstraction of 10.000.000 more. we already have plans for the equivalent of twelve or thirteen million men. we will soon be up to a requirement of 20.000.000. if we are to make good on our lendlease policies. if we are to provide arms and equipment to the chinese and russian fronts. we will have difficulty doing it and providing for another million men. even if we had an army of two or three million men. we do not have the ships available to move them to europe or to the orient. what is the good of planning for a great army which we simply would not be able to use. the building of which would prevent us from helping to arm the chinese and the russians? no senator dare rise here and say that we do not have ample military men available for the next 1 or 2 years. i say that the only sensible thing to do is to wait and to pass a neasure of this kind at a time when we know we shall need it. mr. president. it is my intention at some later time to call up a motion. which i now make. to recommit the bill to the committee on military affairs.","mr. chairman. 150 years ago in my county. york county. pa.. cigars were first made in this country. since that time the business has steadily grown until their cigars have gone all over the world. those communities have thrived and built large churches and schools. on tuesday of this week. due to the wage and hour law. the last cigar factory in one of those important towns closed its doors. throwing its last 200 employees on the rolls of relief or public charity. these towns and communities in my congressional district where cigars have been made for more than 150 years have grown and been recognized throughout the united states for their thrift and industry and their high standard of living. the banks have prospered as is evident to everyone who comes into the community. churches and schools have grown likewise. the 200 people thrown out of work this week when the last factory in craley closed its doors because of the wage and hour act willmany of thembecome public charges because of their age and the fact there is no other industry nearby to absorb them. one factory that paid in 1939 more than $25.000 in federal taxes has no assurance that it can continue in operation for any length of time. this is just about the end of a onetime great industry covering a large section of york county. many of these towns will now become ghost towns simply because of governmental interference with an industry in which thousands were employed and earned honest and honorable livelihood. recently the united states department of labor issued a permit to learners in this industry. just why they issued permits to learners in an industry that they are closing up is a question for the department to answer themselves. thousands of men and women were denied the right of apprenticeship through recent years because of the wage and hour act and have thus been consigned to the ranks of common labor with the result that today we find ourselves short of skilled mechanics in practically every trade. what the federal government should do rather than put people out of work is to leave those who can and would work alone. recently the american youth congress was flooded with literature definitely declaring that the work that youth could get was too fatiguing. setting up statistics they showed that many of the highschool girl graduates finally had to do domestic work. instead of the government belittling the very things that have made america great. they should be teaching the youth today the dignity of labor and the fact that it is every youths common obligation to work. whatever his hands find to do. no youth has a claim to a soft job. but he is entitled to it if he can get it. it was never the intent of the founding fathers that the government should be interested in every individual and keep them. it is the peoples duty to keep the government. if there is one thing that youth needs today it is to be disciplined and not wetnursed. there still are opportunities in america for those young people who have the fortitude to run against the stream. they are the only ones who really get anywhere finally. and they are the ones who believe that anything that is worth doing is worth doing well. the young man or woman who is willing to work and takes a pride in doing that work well will not need a paternalistic government to be looking after him all the time. i have on my desk this morning a bill asking for an appropriation to build farm houses and redig wells throughout the south. setting forth the dilapidated condition of what they term \"the rural slums.\" most emphatically i am against the federal government spending money in this fashion. the facts are these houses in the cotton belt have not just gone to pieces now. and if the wells are too close to the houses or too far away they are exactly where those people dug them. not many years ago when cotton still was \"king\" the cotton farmers came into york county and purchased our mules. paying anywhere from $150 to $500 per head. and they could just as well have been building houses for themselves. or at least keeping them in repair. as spending money for mules as they did. the practice in my county is if a farmers house needs repair he repairs it. if he has no money to pay someone else to do it he generally gets at it and does it himself. and after all that is the honorable way to do things.","not right now. in just a few moments i shall yield. mr. speaker. we have had disasters in other parts of the country and the government has extended aid. but never such aid as is contemplated by this appropriation. we had a great flood out in the mississippi valley and in the ohio valley. but in neither instance was the government ever asked to go in and rehabilitate private property. that is what we are proposing to do in this pending proposition. let us see what has happened. this was a great disaster and there no doubt is need for rehabilitation work in new england. what has the government done thus far to meet the situation? in the first place. we provide in this bill $500.000 for the forest service to clean up governmentowned lands up there. and it is appropriate that the government should remove fire hazards which exist upon its own property. that amount is in the bill as it passed the house and has not been disturbed by the senate. in the second place. we have put at the disposal of the damaged area 41 c. c. c. camps. which have been operating up there. and we are told they have done a splendid work and are doing a splendid work in removing the fire hazard and cleaning up the land. in the third place. we have put at the disposal of that stricken territory more than 15.000 w. p. a. workers. and we are told by these gentlemen representing the new england area that in this instance. at least. the w. p. a. has been doing a swell job. in the fourth place. through the medium of the reconstruction finance corporation the government is guaranteeing to the owners of property in that territory. whose timber has been laid upon the ground by the storm. 90 percent of the value of their timber in the form of loans. no other disaster has occurred in which the congress has been more liberal and more considerate than it has been in connection with the disaster that has befallen this splendid. fine territory. further than that. let me say that if a mistake has been made at all it was the mistake of putting into this bill any money for going upon private property at all. whether it be in new england. virginia. or any other place in the country. in this bill the house provided $3.000.000 for cleaning up the debris on private land.","the consumers of this country. both of foods and manufactured products. are in the market. they need practically everything that is produced and if they had sufficient buying power. they would more than absorb all the production of these industries which have been compelled to discharge labor. the whole thing goes back. then. to a lack of buying power. principally in the prices of agricultural products and in the wage scales. there you have the fundamental thing. and the reason we are called upon today to make this appropriation is because congress last year lost its nerve and failed to keep up its program of employing the unemployed until we had really achieved recovery. we failed. i say. to see that this consuming power of disemployed people is. after all. the key to the recovery of business. and that the reason we need to employ these folks who otherwise have no means of living is not merely for their own sake. not merely for the sake of decency. but is because it is the one thing we can do quickly and speedily to increase production and break the back of the depression. it is the one particular thing we can do that will bring back prosperity and will put people back into industry. this is the key to the thing. . i am not saying. and certainly would not say. it is the fundamental answer to the problem. but i hope it is an answer based upon the fundamental principle of democracy that every man shall have a right to a job. which will in the course of time compel us to see the importance of passing such legislation as i have already referred to in the matter of the monetary question. and such other legislation as the new deal has been responsible for. protecting the right of collective bargaining of labor. attempting to raise the proportionate income of farmers in the nation. and other legislation to bring about a better distribution of such buying power as we have. and i hope likewise that it will lead to our passing such legislation as will restore real confidence to this nation by enabling industry in a coordinated fashion to expand its production together instead of having every businessman worried for fear if he expands production others will not do so. i wantto say a word now about work relief. i agree. as it happens. with a great many of the things that were said by the gentleman from alabama . particularly when he talked about the kind of work that we should have. i do not believe the government should run a works program where the jobs are not essential jobs. but i think we have a whole host of very essential jobs to be performed in this nation. the only thing important for us to remember is that to do these essential jobsflood control. rural electrification. slum clearance. conservation of soils. and all those thingsis a more expensive proposition than it is to do the jobs where less material is required. for my part i stand ready to see to it that there is enough money available so these more worthwhile things can be done. i also believe we could develop a great number of selfliquidating projects if we tried. *","mr. chairman. i rise in opposition to the amendment. mr. chairman. this amendment was thoroughly discussed in committee. it was opposed by labor organizations. they did not want vocational training at all in the camps. they brought out the fact you cannot thoroughly equip an apprentice in 6 months at a camp. and they did not want any halfbaked plumbers. bricklayers. or machinists coming out of there and working in connection with labor unions when they were not fitted to do the work. it was brought out in letters to me and in conversations with labor men that it takes not 6 months but a long time to educate a workman in any skilled trade if he wants to be a skilled tradesman. they did not want vocational training in the camps. especially when a man can get only 6 months of training with only a quarter of his worktime spent in training. because he is in the camp for the development of reforestation. prevention of soil erosion. flood control. and all such purposes. the labor men do not want him to be taught vocational training in a haphazard and halfhearted manner. if there were going to be vocational training. they would want a real system of vocational training where the men could study and could learn trades. and then come out and be ready to join a union. however. this cannot be done in 6 months. labor does not want vocational training in a halfhearted manner and is opposed to it.","mr. speaker. there have been mistakes made by the federal government in this development. but we are doing all we can to take out marginal lands in the west as well as in the middle west. that is being corrected. certainly there was speculation. there were all kinds of promotion schemes. the federal government is doing away with that. for example. in the kittitas proposition at ellensburg they are taking out speculation. they arranged it so that land could be sold only at a certain reasonable price. there is also the matter of water waste that has been going on for years. and that is being taken care of. they are using their water to better advantage. they learn by experience. may i call attention. especially the attention of the chairman of the committee on appropriations. to the fact that the presidents budget provided for these projects named in amendment no. 53. the president is for this. why? only for one reason. because he has been out there and has seen with his own eyes what can be done with water. i wish some of these friends of ours who are opposing us today would come out and breathe our exhilarating air. would fish in our sparkling streams. would look at our majestic mountains. but. above all. if they would come there and see the desert sagebrush land. 1 year after it has water on it. blossom like the rose and be changed into beautiful and comfortable homes. although this senate amendment deals with many western projects i desire to speak on the particular project known as the roza unit of the yakima project. this is the last unit of a quarter of a century program. the other units have been completed. more than 90 percent of the funds have been repaid to the federal government. and these lands have yielded products worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. what was once a barren waste is now a fruitful valley. the home of an intelligent. prosperous. industrious people. of course we have suffered from the depression. but. may i ask. what section of our country has not suffered. however. the chambers of commerce representing our cities. the granges and farm bureaus representing our farmers. and labor organizations representing our laborers have all wholeheartedly endorsed the high coulee dam. and the roza. and why should they not? they are residents of the yakima valley and have seen its population increase from 13.462 in 1900 to 77.402 in 1930. its tax valuation increase from $25.004.000 in 1900 to $233.041.000 in 1930. and the value of its products during this period approximate a half a billion dollars on a loan from the government of about $33.000.000. most of which has been repaid. the federal government finished the cle elum reservoir at a cost of $2.813.000 to impound waters for the roza. last year the sum of $4.000.000 was allocated to construct tunnels. and dam work has begun and contracts have been let for this purpose. however. only up to theamount of $2.500.000. for this reason the president in march withdrew $1.500.000 of the original sum to take care of flooded districts of the east and other imminent necessities. now we are simply requesting that a $2.500.000 allocation be made so we can proceed with the completion of this unit as a component part of the yakima project. it will furnish labor for the present unemployed. it will provide homes to the thousands of seasonal workers who are needed in the fields and packing houses of the dozen cities of the prosperous irrigated sections adjoining the roza unit on the south. it has been stated here that we have an overproduction. is there too much food with millions of people in want of the bare necessities? is there too much cotton and wool with other millions without the necessary clothing for comfort and decency? let us resolutely set our faces toward the dawn of a new day when the problem of just distribution shall be solved. providing labor and homes for all. capplause.]","i certainly do not know. and i do not believe the committee has gone far enough to have a true picture of the operations of the national recovery administration. i have a very open mind in the matter. i do not know whether i shall vote for its reenactment or not. i have serious doubts about the whole problem. i do know that there are very powerful forces in the country in favor of it. it may be those which are benefiting through the monopolistic policies which it is alleged have been developed as a result of the administration of the law. i think most of the members of the committee have open minds on it. i think we want to hear all that is to be said for and against it. one thing is certain. that before we turn from n. r. a. we want to know what will be the consequenceswhether for benefit or injury to the public interest. i do not hesitate to say. notwithstanding all the criticism and all the objections to n. r. a.. that no man dares predict the depths to which the business of the country would have gone under the destructive and cutthroat practices that existed in business before we enacted the n. r. a. regardless of how it is operating it did lift up business. it stopped and ended sweatshops. it stopped and ended cutthroat monopoly. it stopped and ended the cutting down of wages and the increasing of hours of

objectiof to the present consideration of the bill?\n730121017|mr. president. i do not object. i had in mind particularly alaska where. my recollection is. the organic act provided that the common law with all its limitations should be the controlling factor. however. i shall not object.\n730121018|mr. president. i do not favor the practice of taking bills off the calendar unless it is a very serious emergency. am i to understand that the bill once passed the senate. that an identical bill has passed the house. and that the senator now asks to substitute the house bill for the senate bill?\n730121019|the senator is correct.\n730121020|is there objection to the present consideration of the bill?\n730121021|without objection. an order will be entered requesting the house of representatives to return the senate bill and accompanying papers.\n730121022|mr. president. i desire to submit in a few minutes a request to have printed in the record an article upon the land policy of the west. a very important and able article written by marshall n. dana. which i think is of very great importance at this time. it seems important and timely that the general attitude of the western reclamation states be made clear regarding a national land policy. such as has been indicated by the president. by the secretary of agriculture. and by the secretary of the interior. relating to marginal lands. economic feasibility. market outlets. and other factors. the department of agriculture. on the authority delegated by the agricultural adjustment act. is attempting to work out a program of unified. balanced. and controlled agricultural production. this program necessitates extensive surveys of land productiveness. market outlets. transportation facilities. and social consequences. ultimately these extensive surveys and experiments should produce a welldefined national land policy. representing. as i do in part. one of the publicland states. a state in which the federal government owns some 56 percent of the land area. i am exceedingly desirous that the claims of agriculture in these states shall be given full consideration under this new program. as every senator knows. agriculture in the publicland states is directly dependent upon reclamation. vast areas\n730121023|mr. president-\n730121024|does the senator from idaho yield to the senator from colorado?\n730121025|i yield.\n730121026|is it not true that our reclamation policy is essentially one of conservation of both natural and human resources?\n730121027|that is entirely true. mr. president. i now ask that the article of mr. dana may be printed in the record in full as a part of my remarks.\n730121028|mr. president. i have been greatly impressed by the testimony of judge william clark before the banking and currency committee. march 6. 1934. on proposed stockexchange regulation. i ask permission to have judge clarks remarks inserted in the congressional record.\n730121029|mr. president. in liberty for march 17. 1934. the able senior senator from florida. hon. duncan u. fletcher. chairman of the senate committee on banking and currency. has strikingly reviewed and summarized certain developments of the continuing stockexchange investigation. i ask unanimous consent to have senator fletchers\n730121030|mr. president. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record an address broadcast february 24. 1934. by hon. charles h. sherrill. former ambassador to turkey. which treats of the crusade against the illegal narcotic traffic by mustafa kemal. i am sure my colleagues will be impressed with the gigantic strides mustafa kemal has made in transforming his nation from a once flagrant violator of narcoticcontrol\n730121031|mr. president. i ask permission to have printed in the record an editorial entitled a parting of the ways . which appeared in the ashland (ky.) daily independent of march 21. 1934.\n730121032|mr. president. senators in charge of the conference report on the independent offices appropriation bill are not ready at this juncture to proceed. so i suggest that the senate proceed with the consideration of the unfinished business. the senate resumed the consideration of the bill to place the cotton industry on a sound commercial basis. to prevent unfair competition and practices in putting cotton into the channels of interstate and foreign commerce. to provide funds for paying additional benefits under the agricultural adjustment act. and for other purposes.\n730121033|mr. president. the objective sought by this bill has been under consideration for several years. the first bill introduced by me when i came to the senate. shortly after i arrived here. was based upon the same principle contained in this bill. on two previous occasions i addressed the senate on the principle of this bill. i mention those facts to indicate that this is not a hurriedly prepared program. but is one that has grown out of long consideration and thorough discussion through all sections of the cotton belt. especially during the past 12 months. the object sought to be accomplished by this bill is to make definite and certain a reduction in the present abnormal and pricedepressing surplus or carryover of cotton. we are seeking. if possible. to bring the price of our money commoditypractically the only money commodity produced in the southto a fair exchange value with other commodities. the fair exchange value or parity at present would be about 15 cents a pound. i think it is recognized by all students that the largest factor in the price of any commodity is the relation of the supply to the effective demand of the market for that commodity. so long as we have a carryover which approaches the one now on the markets. it will be impossible. under all wellrecognized trade laws. to bring about a fair exchange price for cotton. at present the carryover of cotton is nearly 12.000.000 bales. the world consumption of american cotton for 1931 and 1932 averaged a little under 12.000.000 bales. our surplus of cotton last year reached the staggering figure of 13.000.000 bales. in fact. there was in the warehouses of the spinners of the world and the cotton merchants a supply of cotton sufficient to supply the entire consumptive demands for american cotton for a full year if not a single stalk of cotton had been produced.\n730121034|mr. president. will the senator yield for a question?\n730121035|does the senator from alabama yield to the senator from michigan?\n730121036|gladly.\n730121037|do i understand that this enormous surplus results in spite of the plowunder campaign?\n730121038|i will come to that. mr. president.\n730121039|i beg the senators pardon.\n730121040|i shall be glad to come to that. the prewar period of 1909 to 1914 is generally accepted by economists as presenting the best period representing a fair exchange value of all commodities. industrial and agricultural.\n730121041|mr. president. will the senator yield there?\n730121042|does the senator from alabama yield to the senator from nebraska?\n730121043|i shall be glad to yield.\n730121044|i am very much interested in the figures the senator gives. but he always couples them with the qualification that they represent the american supply. how much of the cotton used by the world is produced outside the united states?\n730121045|america produces about 54 percent of the worlds supply of cotton.\n730121046|mr. president. may i ask the senator in that connection what is the relation between domestic consumption and export cotton?\n730121047|we consume in this country about 40 percent of the american production. we look to foreign markets for the sale of about 60 percent of our entire cotton production. during the prewar periodwhich. as i have just stated. represents the best period of fair exchange pricesthe average carryover for the 5 years involved in that period was 3.132.000 bales. since that time. as senators will observe. that carryover went up to 13.000.000 bales last year. and now is 11.750.000 bales. i have here a table. which i will ask to have inserted in the record. showing the carryover of american cotton from 1928 to 1933. i ask to have it printed at this point in my remarks.\n730121048|without objection. it is so ordered. the table is as follows: carryover aug. i prewar ------------------------------------------ 8. 132. 000 192829 ------------------------------------------_ 5.206.000 192930 ---------------------------------------- 4.517. 000 193031 -----------...........--------------------- 6. 187.000 193132 ------------------------------------------- 8.919.000 193233 -------------------------------------------- 13.228.000 193334 ------------------------------------------_ 11.754.000 average production -----------------------------15. 155.000 consumption 1929. 1930. and 1931. ----------- 12. 213. 000 consumption figures taken from 1933 yearbook of new york cotton exchange.\n730121049|in 1929. 1930. and 1931 the average production of american cotton was 15.155.000 bales. the average consumption for the same period was 12.213.000 bales. in other words. for 3 years the average production each year was nearly 3.000.000 bales more than the average consumption of cotton. that accounts for the very large surplus that has prevailed since 1931. increasing in 1932 to 13.000.000 bales. and now is still nearly 12.000.000. the senator from michigan -and i am glad to have any questions on this subject which occur to the minds of senators seeking informationinquired if this surplus continued notwithstanding the plowup campaign. the plowup campaign did not bring about the amount of reduction that its advocates hoped for. the actual production after the plowup campaign was practically the same as it was the year before. 13.000.000 bales. that crop. however. as is recognized everywhere in the south. was the result of the most ideal weather conditions. almost. in the recollection of the oldest people of the south. it is now known. may i say to the senator from michigan. that if we had not had the plowup campaign. our surplus would have been increased by four and a half million bales of cotton. in short. while we did not get the relief for which we hoped by reason of weather conditions. we did get relief in a way that absolutely saved the situation in the south. with a 17.600.000bale crop. which would have been produced but for the plowup campaign. we would have been here today confronted with a carryover not of 12.000.000 bales but of approximately 17.500.000 bales. and if we could have sold that seventeen and a half million bales at all last year. with a 13.000.000bale carryover. we would have sold it at 3 or 4 cents a pound.\n730121050|mr. president. will the senator yield?\n730121051|gladly.\n730121052|this is the matter in which i am interested. and i know the senator can illuminate the subject: we paid enormous benefits to these cotton planters in the expectation of a goodfaith effort to reduce the acreage by one third through this program. what i desire to know is whether or not it is possible to have a program of that character actually developed in good faith. and my question is addressed to this proposition. if the senator will permit me. i read a statement somewhere that the southern railway had declared that during the last crop season it carried four times as much fertilizer in the southern states as ever before. and i was wondering if that disclosed the fact that the moment the total acreage was reduced there was an intensified production on the remaining acreage.\n730121053|i shall be very glad. indeed. to deal in perfect frankness with the senator on that subject. i think the senator will recognize that it is human nature. it is inherent in all of us. to deal as best we can with our own personal problems without violating an express contract. it appears that around 90 percent of those formerly producing cotton have entered into acreagereduction contracts. those of us who are familiar with the situation know that the farmers will reduce their acreage. because it necessarily will be policed. but that phase of the program will be carried out in perfect good faith by those who have entered into the contract. we have no sort of doubt about that. we recognize that in good faith they plowed up their acreage last year. and we are sure that those who signed the contracts this year will limit their planting to the number of acres retained by them under the contracts. but notwithstanding the most perfect good faith in the matter of the number of acres planted to cotton. i know. and others know. that each farmer on his 6 acres out of 10 is doing everything he knows how to do to grow as much cotton on his particular 6 acres of land as was grown last year and in prior years on the 10 acres of land. that is a situation which no one can control. it is a situation which does not violate the letter of any contract. that is the situation. may i say to the senator. which makes the adoption of a baleage limitation. in addition to the acreage reduction. absolutely essential if we are to secure relief in the matter of reducing our enormous surplus of cotton.\n730121054|mr. president. i am frank to say that i am not very familiar with the bill. having read it only last night. but as i understand. the bill deals alone with the question of cotton baleage. it does not undertake to deal with acreage?\n730121055|not at all\n730121056|an individual may raise the cotton if he desires. but he is limited to selling only so much?\n730121057|that is correct.\n730121058|then this bill has for its purpose really. for want of a better term. coercing the minority who have not signed the acreagereduction contracts?\n730121059|i will say to the senator that it is not limited to those who have not signed up on the acreagereduction proposition. the cooperating and the noncooperating farmers get an allotment on exactly the same basis. i have taken the position all along that even if 100 percent had signed the acreagereduction contracts. this bill would be an absolute necessity in order to bring about. assuming average weather. a definite and certain reduction in the surplus of cotton.\n730121060|i have seen a statementin fact. it came to me in a letter from the souththat this would likely lead to production. although the producer could not sell. that it would enable speculators. those who would be in a position to hold the cotton. to control the surplus.\n730121061|how would the speculators get it if the producer could not sell it?\n730121062|he could sell it to the speculators. could he not?\n730121063|if he could sell to the speculators. he could sell to the market. but under this bill the only way he could sell his cotton would be by paying his tax on it.\n730121064|mr. president. will the senator yield?\n730121065|i yield.\n730121066|it would apply to that part of the cotton which enters into interstate commerce. that part of the baled cotton which is deposited in warehouses could be sold without the payment of any tax. and remain there. until the expiration of the period provided in the law. or the failure of the law. is not that true?\n730121067|this proposed legislation is not based on the principle contained in the original bill which i introduced and with which the senator is familiar. the original bill. introduced by me 2 or 3 years ago. and which the senator heard me discuss here. was based solely on the power of congress to regulate interstate commerce. and it was to avoid undue burdens on it. it required a license based upon the quantity of cotton going into interstate commerce. this bill is along entirely different lines and is based upon the same principle underlying the oleomargarine law. with which the senator is familiar. and which he so long supported. that is. the imposition of a tax upon cotton. with certain exemptions justified under the income tax law. and all other decisions on the subject of taxes permitting exemptions.\n730121068|i understand the senators statement as applied to this particular situation. he says now the production would be limited to 10.000.000 bales in the crop year 193435. ten million bales is the total number that may enter interstate commerce.\n730121069|it does not make any difference whether they enter interstate commerce or not.\n730121070|the balance in excess of 10.000.000 bales may enter interstate commerce. but must pay a prohibitive tax. namely. 50 percent of its value. in no case less than 5 cents a pound. so there is an inhibition against the free movement of cotton in excess of the quantity which it is specified by this bill should be raised. namely. 10.000.000 bales.\n730121071|that is exactly what i am driving at.\n730121072|the senator may be.\n730121073|i want to limit it to 10.000.000 bales. and. if i had my way. i would make it 9.000.000. i think 10.000.000 is entirely too much.\n730121074|i was trying to travel in a more direct route in order to answer the interrogatory propounded by the senator from idaho. a speculator. an investor. could acquire stored cotton. which does not move in interstate commerce. and hold it there until the expiration of the proposed law. or the exposure of any fallacy it may contain. and then he could obtain the advantage of the purchase. that is the proposition made by the senator from idaho.\n730121075|let me say. in answer to the senator. that. in the first place. the speculator could not acquire the cotton without paying the tax because the tax must be paid before the cotton can be sold or transported in any way under the provisions of the bill. then why would there be any profit in the program for the speculator in buying. except such buying as speculators do in the normal and usual course of business. when no such measure as this is upon the statute books? in the second place. let me ask the senator this question. if there may be a million or so bales of cotton upon which some speculator. or a number of speculators. might make some profit after paying the tax. i want to ask the senator whether for that reason he would be willing to penalize all of the cotton producers in the south. when their very life and the destiny of the whole section depend upon a fair price for the 10.000.000 bales of cotton? if the senator is so anxious that those speculators shall not make a profit. after paying the tax fixed by the law. that he is willing to leave this terrible burden upon the price of cotton and make it almost impossible. as we believe. for the farmers to get a fair price for the 10.000.000 bales of cotton. then i must admit that i cannot follow his philosophy. we are working here for the good of tho great masses of the people in that great section. and i am sure that no one is going to be deterred from that great objective by a suggestion that a speculator might make a little profit here and there.\n730121076|mr. president. will the senator yield further?\n730121077|i yield.\n730121078|i am not interested in speculators. i was trying to answer the question propounded by the senator from idaho. what i want to knowand i am asking the question good naturedly and in order to get the expression of the senatoris whether he means by this bill to supplement the law which involves the removal of excess acreage under the a.a.a. last year. according to a statement i have from the department of agriculture. 10.000.000 acres were removed from production. which caused the price level of cotton to be raised from about 4 cents to an average of about 9 cents. a hundred million dollars was paid to the cotton producers of the south as benefits under that law. with 100percent increase in price level. with a 25percent decrease in acreage. this year they contemplate a decrease in the acreage of 5.000.000 acres more. making 15.000.000 acres. and it is thought that the price level will probably advance 4 or 5 cents a pound. with increased benefits in the south amounting to $135.000.000. according to the estimate of the department of agriculture. i thoughtand i will say to my friend from alabamathat when we passed the agricultural adjustment administration act last spring it was thought by the committeeand by the congressthat it would give the cotton man all the benefits he desired. and those benefits he has been receiving have been reflected in a higher price level and a hundred million dollars in direct cash benefits. now. i am asking the senator whether he is dissatisfied with that effort on the part of congress. and whether he means. by compulsion. to supplement that act by his own measure. which will force production to be limited to 10.000.000 bales. irrespective of the processing tax and the voluntary character of the present statute?\n730121079|i think the senators question answers itself when he sees me here advocating this bill. why is he asking the question?\n730121080|i think i can answer it. and i think i have done so. is it the desire of the senator and is it his opinion that congress should take this other step in addition to that which has been taken and place a law back of the federal government compelling a majority of the owners. or two thirds of the owners. irrespective of their views. to meet the requirements of his bill? is that the purpose of the senator?\n730121081|mr. president. the purpose of the bill is to limit the number of bales that may be sold in the market free from the payment of tax. as i have endeavored i to explain in answer to the question of the senator from michigan . we recognize that an acrea~ge reduction of cotton does not assure and guarantee a reduction of the number of units to come from that crop. it may be difficult for senators from other sections of the country to realize that situation as we do. because their agricultural crops do not vary so much in the amount of production as does cotton. as a result of intensive cultivation. and the use of highgrade and highpriced fertilizer. or any other kind of fertilizer. we in the south recognize. may i say to the senator. that in the matter of cotton. as i stated a while ago. assuming the same weather conditions. by intensive cultivation. by placing the rows closer together and using more fertilizer. as now is being planned to be done in many sections. by retention of the best cotton acreage in the 60 percent retained by the cotton growers. and other methods of that kind. that we will not get. with any definiteness and any certainty. the reduction that the statistical position of cotton demands. and for that reason we are seeking here to put into legal effect and legal operation the implied agreements of the farmers who have reduced their acreage by 40 percent of their acreage under their agreement with the government. the theory of the cottonreduction contract is that there will be a reduction of 40 percent in cotton production. the grower will use 60 percent of the land used over the previous 5year average. because that is his acreage arrangement. we are by this bill proposing that the growers reduction to 60 percent shall also apply to the number of bales that he shall sell in the market this year.\n730121082|mr. president-\n730121083|does the senator from alabama yield to the senator from idaho?\n730121084|i yield.\n730121085|as i understand. the senator. speaking of the legal proposition involved. does not rely upon the interstatecommerce clause for full authority for the bill?\n730121086|no. mr. president. i do not. i rely upon the taxing power. i think the interstatecommerce clause helps it.\n730121087|yes. but the senator does propose to deal with cotton which never enters into interstate commerce?\n730121088|oh. yes. with respect to the tax.\n730121089|but i will say to the senator. if he will permit me at that point. that practically all cotton. or its manufactured products. moves into interstate and foreign commerce.\n730121090|yes. but the senator is not relying upon the interstatecommerce clause?\n730121091|not entirely. no. i said i thought it added strength.\n730121092|yes. but the senator is using the taxing power for the purpose of reducing the amount of cotton which may go into the market?\n730121093|it will have that effect.\n730121094|that is what the senator is seeking to accomplish?\n730121095|yes. exactly. exactly the same as the oleomargarine tax which was imposed upon that product.\n730121096|i cannot quite agree with the senator.\n730121097|the senator from idaho is a frank man and familiar with that question. i will ask him. why was it imposed?\n730121098|the taxing power with reference to oleo. margarine. in my judgment. went to the very limit. but here-\n730121099|i will say. mr. president. its purpose was to limit the amount and almost prohibit. if possible. the amount moving in interstate commerce.\n730121100|no. the question of deception in that case entered into the question. the question was that of fraud.\n730121101|that was the legal question. that was the justification legally for the act. but what was the purpose of the advocates of the oleomargarine act? i am getting at the purpose of it. i know the senator from idahg is a frank man.\n730121102|the senator from idaho did not support the oleomargarine act. so he is not defending it. but i think it clearly distinguishes oleo from the proposition here.\n730121103|the senator was here and knows the purpose of the advocates of the act.\n730121104|i am considering the bill now under consideration. i first want to know what the purpose of the bill is. as i understand. the senator departs from the interstate commerce clause and relies in part upon the taxing power of the government.\n730121105|i rely upon both.\n730121106|and the senator uses the taxing power for the purpose of reducing the acreage?\n730121107|no. i do not.\n730121108|for the purpose of reducing the amount of cotton that may come into the market?\n730121109|yes. that may be sold in the market free of the tax.\n730121110|in other words. when the cotton market has received a certain amount of cotton. the senator then proposes to lay on a tax to prevent any more cotton from entering the market?\n730121111|we lay a tax on it all. but exempt a certain part of it.\n730121112|yes. i understand that.\n730121113|we want to be legally accurate while we are discussing the legal phases of it.\n730121114|we also want to be entirely legally sincere.\n730121115|one is the same as the other. i understand. therefore. and i take it that from a legal standpoint the senator is relying upon the taxing power rather than the interstate commerce clause?\n730121116|i attach more importance to the taxing power. frankly. yes.\n730121117|the senator attaches more importance to the taxing power.\n730121118|mr. president. will the senator yield?\n730121119|i yield.\n730121120|the senator then accepts not only the dictum but the philosophy and statement of a great chief justice that  the power to tax is the power to destroy . and he wants to destroy the production of cotton by taxation?\n730121121|i think that question is so absurd that there is no occasion to try to answer it. i will say to the senator. he is speaking of the case of someone who is trying to destroy. whereas i am trying to build up.\n730121122|as i understand the senatorif he will pardon me for a further questionhis effort is to destroy production above 10.000.000 bales. and destroy it by invoking the taxing power of the government?\n730121123|i am not trying to destroy it. i am trying to discourage people from entering upon the production of it. mr. president. this is a serious program from the standpoint of not only the people of the south but of the whole country. unfortunately. we do not engage in general industrial production. except in a few small centers. in the cotton belt. nearly everything of an industrial character that is consumed in the south is manufactured in the industrial sections of this country. the southern people get no money from outside their section for industrial products. we produce nothing of that character that brings a flow of cash into the cotton belt. i asked the president of the tennessee coal. iron &amp; railroad co.. the greatest industrial unit in all the south. owned by the steel corporation. what proportion of all the manufactured products of that great plant at birmingham was sold outside the cotton belt. and through that channel brought money into the cotton belt. and to my great surprise he told me that only 15 percent of all their products moved outside the cotton belt. so. when a sufficient amount of money does not move into the great cotton belt. our people are unable to patronize the industries which are located in the sections represented by the gentlemen on the other side of the chamber. in 1932 the entire cotton crop brought only $397.000.000. in 1919 it brought $2.000.000.000. in 1929. which was the last year before the depression. it brought $1.245.000.000. just think of practically the total crop of the great cotton belt. reaching from southern virginia to southern california. having its income reduced from $1.200.000.000 down to less than $400.000.000.\n730121124|mr. president-\n730121125|does the senator from alabama yield to the senator from michigan?\n730121126|i yield.\n730121127|with great sympathy for the senators section. may i not inquire whether that is not almost the percentage of the total reduction in the national income during those periods?\n730121128|i think the reduction with respect to the price of cotton is a greater proportion of reduction than the average. there are some agricultural commodities in respect to which the reduction of income is as great as in the case of cotton. i desire to say to the senator from michigan. however. that as a member of the senate committee on agriculture i have stood. and every member of that committee knows that i have stood. with an open willingness to promote any agricultural program for the benefit of agriculture in any section of america that may be agreed upon by those who represent the producers in such agricultural section. my heart is with them. my judgment is with them. * i know. as i am sure the senator. great man as i recognize him to be. must know. that until we return purchasing and debtpaying power to the great mass of agricultural producers in america. wherever they may be located. we cannot bring a return of prosperity. and we cannot have consumption of the products of industries scattered throughout america. we have developed a concrete program for cotton. and we are not proposing to raid the treasury on account of itand i will come to that directlybut we have developed it as we developed the plowunder campaign. as we developed the 10percentloan plan. because we were looking after that particular commodity. for we represented the people who were producing it.\n730121129|mr. president. will the senator yield?\n730121130|does the senator from alabama yield to the senator from illinois?\n730121131|i am glad to yield to the senator from illinois.\n730121132|as i understand. the senator is in entire sympathy with the acreagereduction plan as applied to cotton?\n730121133|that is true.\n730121134|how does the senator reconcile that position with section 8 of the pending bill. to which i call attention. and in which it is provided: whenever an allotment is made pursuant to section 3. not to exceed 10 percent of the number of bales allotted to each state shall be deducted from the number of bales allotted to such state. and allotted in such state(a) to producers of cotton on farms where for the preceding 3 years less than one third of the cultivated land on such farms has been planted to cotton. (b) to producers of cotton on farms not previously used in cotton production. (c) to producers of cotton on farms where for the preceding 5 years normal cotton production has been reduced by reason of drought. storm. flood. insect pests. or other uncontrollable natural cause. and (d) to producers of cotton on farms where for the preceding 3 years acreage theretofore planted to cotton has been voluntarily reduced so that the amount of reduction in cotton production on such farms is greater than the amount which the secretary finds would have been an equitable reduction applicable to such farms in carrying out a reasonable reduction program. i will ask the senator if that is not directly an encouragement to increase acreage for the raising of cotton on lands which were previously taken out of the production of cotton.\n730121135|i will answer the senator in this way: section 8. as the senator will note. does not increase the quantity of cotton production. which is fixed at 10.000.000 bales. it simply sets aside where the administrative officials decide it should be done a percentage of that allotment for other purposes which the senator has indicated.\n730121136|if the senator from alabama will pardon me. the other purposes are to provide compensation and to bring within the provisions of the proposed act those lands and those classes of farmers who have voluntarily reduced their acreage or whose farms have not been used for the production of cotton.\n730121137|mr. president. if the senator will read carefully the grounds for the additional allotment he will see that the 10 percent is not an increase in the total cotton production authorized by the bill. a part of that 10 percent is utilized to remedy inequitable conditions. such as where there has been drought. where there has been devastation by insect pests. where there have been storms. excessive floods. and during such periods there has not been a fair representative average. in those contingencies a part of this 10 percent can be taken to build up the units in such territory which may have been thus affected. in addition to that. there is the small farmer who has been producing. say. one bale of cotton a yearand there are many of them. as there are a great many who produce two bales of cotton a year. in our desire. may i say to the senator from illinois. to treat with every possible liberality the little man. the small producer. and to be as helpful to him as we could. we have incorporated in the bill the provision which authorizes a reduction in the number of bales which may be produced here and there by what is known as the  cotton hog . the planter who plants nearly a hundred percent of his land in cotton. it takes away from him. to a limited degree. not to exceed 10 percent of the total. which is put into this small pool from which to make fair and just and humane allotments to the small farmer. to the little fellow. to the man who has suffered from drought. and so forth. and here and there to give to the man who has planted no cotton at all. as the result of the exceedingly low price that cotton has been bringing during the last few years and who has. therefore. been devoting himself to other agricultural activities. a bale or two of the 10.000.000 bales of cotton authorized: so we regard that as a humane provision of this bill. one that will remove injustices from the small man and in no way afford encouragement to a larger acreage and a larger production of cotton. that is the purpose. may i explain to the senator?\n730121138|mr. president-\n730121139|does the senator from alabama yield to the senator from north carolina?\n730121140|i do.\n730121141|i should like to ask the senator to be good enough. if he will. to address himself to the question of the power of congress. either directly or through the department of agriculture. to determine for the farmers how much cotton they may gin and sell or to allot to them a certain amount. i should like to hear that question discussed.\n730121142|i will say to the senator that i have not brought a brief here. if he will read the opinion which march 8. and which i had incorporated in the record for the benefit of senators who are interested in the legal aspects of the case. i think that his mind may be satisfied on that point.\n730121143|mr. president. will the senator discuss that opinion at this time?\n730121144|i will just say. mr. president. that at this time i do not wish to go into a discussion of that branch of the subject. it might take an hours time to discuss its constitutional phase. i wish to say that the power to levy a tax. which is the method of compulsion. if it may be so called. in this bill is analogous to the power sustained in the mccray case. known as the oleomargarine case . in which the supreme court held that the power to tax was an express and specific power given by the constitution to the congress of the united states and that the courts would not seek to supervise the purpose and objective of congress in levying a tax which it is authorized to levy.\n730121145|mr. president. let me ask the senator another question. is not that precisely what the court did do in the dagenhart case and in bailey against drexel? did not the court hold in bailey against drexel that since the tax levied under the childlabor enactment on goods in interstate commerce was not for revenue but for the purpose of preventing child labor. it was void for being unconstitutional?\n730121146|mr. president. in the dagenhart ease. the childlabor case. the court held that the tax was a direct tax upon production. that it was a specific and direct effort to regulate under the local police power the persons who should work in production. i believe. below a certain age. in that case the court. by divided opinion of 5 to 4. held that the tax related. as i say. directly to production. the law put an income tax of 10 percent upon the net income of any employer for a year who employed for 1 hour during the year a child below the prescribed age. that is a correct statement. is it not. may i ask the senator from north carolina?\n730121147|i do not think that is precisely correct. i will read portions of the case later on.\n730121148|very well. that was so patently direct legislation to control persons who engage in production that the court held that it was not. in its true sense. the levying of a tax but was nothing more. as the majority held. than an effort to supersede the police power of the state in the effort to regulate the age of children who could work in industry. this bill does not propose a tax on production. it proposes a tax on the sale of cotton. but even if it were a tax on production. mr. president. it is exactly like the oleomargarine tax. the law in that case levied a direct tax of 10 cents a pound on oleomargarine that was colored. and one quarter of 1 percent a pound on oleomargarine uncolored. in the decision in that case. which i have here. it was held: the oleomargarine act of 1886 (24 stat. 209). as amended by the act of 1902 (32 stat. 93). imposing a tax of one quarter of 1 percent on oleomargarine not artificially colored any shade of yellow so as to look like butter and 10 cents a pound if so colored. levies an excise tax and is not unconstitutional as outside of the powers of congress. or an interference with the powers reserved to the states. that was the pointthe exercise of local police power under which the dagenhart case was decided. that in that case there was an interference with the powers reserved to the states. nor can the judiciary declare the tax void because it is too high nor because it amounts to a destruction of the business of manufacturing oleomargarine. nor because it discriminates against oleomargarine and in favor of butter. so i submit that if the tax provided in this bill is not valid. it is necessary for the supreme court of the united states to overturn its decision affirming by a unanimous court the legality of the tax upon oleomargarine.\n730121149|mr. president-\n730121150|does the senator from alabama yield further to the senator from north carolina?\n730121151|i yield.\n730121152|i understand the senator refers the bill and his argument to the oleomargarine case. that is set forth in one hundred and sixtyfifth united states reports. page 526. permit me to read to him from that case: the oleomargarine legislation does not differ in character from this. and the object is the same in both. namely. to secure revenue by internal taxation and to prevent fraud in the collection of such revenue. very clearly the court held in the oleomargarine case that that was a revenue act. and the machinery. by way of a stamp and a label. was for the purpose of preventing fraud. will the senator undertake to explain to me how he refers the pending bill to the law in the oleomargarine case in view of the plain statement of the case which i have just read?\n730121153|i have not had an opportunity to examine the case referred to by the senator from north carolina.\n730121154|it is in re kollock. at page 526 in volume 165 of united states reports. it is an opinion by the late chief justice fuller.\n730121155|i have not had an opportunity to read that case and therefore it is impossible for me at the moment to comment on it.\n730121156|the senator has repeatedly referred this bill to the oleomargarine case.\n730121157|is that the oleomargarine case?\n730121158|yes. it is.\n730121159|the mccray case?\n730121160|the kollock case.\n730121161|i am talking about the mccray case.\n730121162|that is in one hundred and ninetyfifth united states reports.\n730121163|yes. the mccray case. the one about which i am talking. will be found in one hundred and ninetyfifth united states reports. i hope the senator from north carolina will read it.\n730121164|mr. president. since the senator is relying on the mccray case. i shall be glad if the senator will state to the senate the facts in that case.\n730121165|mr. president-\n730121166|does the senator from alabama yield to the senator from oregon?\n730121167|i yield.\n730121168|the senator is referring to the oleomargarine case which had to do with legislation which came from the committee on agriculture and forestry. i am sure the senator is conversant with that legislation. which was founded upon the idea of preventing fraud. as many other legislative enactments have been based upon the same philosophy. the incidental power is to collect taxes as a part of the revenue. in the case of the pending bill. its philosophy is based. not upon the collection of revenue. because none is anticipated other than in the nature of a penalty. but upon an effort to control production. which wholly. in my opinion. distinguishes and differentiates the bill from the oleomargarine law which the senator attempts to cite as a precedent. that act and the bill now pending are on wholly different lines of philosophy.\n730121169|i have been unable to find any statement upon which the court based its decision or any reasoning upon which it reached its conclusion growing out of the collection of any revenue under the oleomargarine law.\n730121170|i am not familiar with that case. but to understand a case and apply the law. i think it is necessary to understand the philosophy upon which it is constructed. the object of the oleomargarine law was to prevent a substitute. such as oleomargarine. a substitute which cannot be detected by the eye. from being sold as butter. therefore. the congress. in order to prevent fraud and deception and deceit. enacted that law. the courts have upheld it upon that plain right of power. incidental thereto is the collection of revenue. those are the two propositions upon which the oleomargarine law and similar statutes are founded. in this case. if the senator has presented it properly. he is attempting to limit acreage and. therefore. affecting compulsory crop production by taxation.\n730121171|no. i am not attempting to limit production.\n730121172|that is what the bill provides as i read it.\n730121173|there is nothing in it about limiting production.\n730121174|it is true there is no restriction or inhibition against the raising of 10.000.000 bales of cotton during the crop year 193435. that may be done. and that cotton when baled may be ginned without any tax being levied at all.\n730121175|that is true.\n730121176|all production in excess thereof. however. must pay a tax equal to one half the value of the cotton at the nearest market sales agency. and in no case less than 5 cents a pound. that is a tax to be covered into the treasury of the united states. that is a penalty to prevent an excess production of cotton. then there is a further provision that the producer. if willfully attempting to produce and put into interstate commerce more than his allotment. may be imprisoned or fined. or both. in the discretion of the court. if that is not clearly an effort through compulsion to limit production. then there is nothing in the senators bill supplementary to the agricultural administration act which was passed last april and is now on the statute books. it is clear to me that the philosophy upon which the oleomargarine legislation was based is wholly different from that of the pending bill. involving compulsion by the levying of a tax upon that which does not enter into interstate commerce. that which enters into interstate commerce goes without the tax. that which is produced in excess thereof is subject to the tax. therefore the senator is trying to apply a punishment in the way of taxation to prevent production. if that is not the object of the bill. then i do not understand it. and i do not understand its philosophy.\n730121177|i am sure the senator from oregon recognizes. because he was here and took an active part in the consideration and enactment of the oleomargarine legislation. that the sponsors of that legislation did not have in mind the welfare of the treasury of the united states. i think the senator will admit that.\n730121178|i stated it was incidental always. but the legislation was enacted in order to prevent deception and the practice of fraud in the sale of articles of food that resemble in physical appearance butter. a product of the cow.\n730121179|i am sure the senator from oregon recognizes that the purpose of the sponsors of that bill was to limit. as far as they could under the tax. the sale of that type of oleomargarine. not because of the fraud that might be involved but to prevent the sale of a commodity which came in competition with other commodities in which they were interested. let us be frank about it. i am sure that no one who took part in the enactment of that legislation will deny that statement. the sponsors of the bill were seeking there to avoid the sale of as much oleomargarine as they could. because it came in conflict and competition with the sale of other commodities and reduced the sale of other agricultural competing commodities. for that reason. in their ingenuityand i have no criticism of itthey worked out the plan of a tax upon the sale of that class of oleomargarine. the law was sustained by the supreme court. because it was held that congress had the power to levy an excise tax. and that the court would not go into the purposes which prompted congress to levy the tax. the only question was as to the power of congress to levy the tax. and that being conceded. the court held that it would not look into or impugn the motives of congress. it would not seek to supervise the action of a coordinate branch of government upon a subject with which that coordinate branch of government had express power under the constitution to deal. i stated a while ago that an opinion had been put in the record here. in connection with that opinion. it was stated in the record. when it was put in. that i asked the attorney generals office to give me the benefit of the advice and assistance of the best man they had on the subject. they did. they furnished me the assistance of an attorney who. i know. had the confidence of the attorney general. because he was with him in person before the banking and currency committee on an occasion when the legality of one of the great bills passed by congress was under consideration. i turned over to this attorney a bill that had been introduced here which was exactly the same as the pending bill on the question now under consideration and asked him to look into it. to go into it fully. and to give me an opinion upon the subject. i did not want to urge the passage of a bill that was unconstitutional i have heard everybody at this session who opposed a pending measure of any paramount importance. and which involved a new form of legislation. question its constitutionality here from time to time. i heard the constitutional question raised when the black 6hour bill was pending before the senate. i heard the opponents of that program day after day assail its constitutionality. i note that the senate proceeded. in the exercise of its matured judgment. to pass that bill. and leave its constitutionality. even if it was perhaps a close question. to the decisions of the courts. i heard the same character of objections presented by those who opposed the passage of the national industrial recovery bill. the legality of which is based upon the grant to congress in the constitution of the power to regulate interstate commerce. those who raise these constitutional objections may have been right. i do not know. i did not think so. however. i made an argument here 2 years ago on the power of congress under the constitution to regulate. in the flow of interstate commerce. all forms of harmless commodities. i was convinced. after a careful study. that congress had such power. and i invite anyone interested in that phase of this question to go back and read that argument. because it was the result of a most careful investigation. it was the subject of various colloquies here upon the floor. we had a protracted debate upon the question. i was convinced then of the power of congress to deal with these phases of interstate commerce upon which the national industrial recovery bill was subsequently based for its constitutionality. after those serious innovations and changes in our usual methods of government have passed through the senate in the face of determined opposition by their opponents on the ground of unconstitutionality. when a bill involving agriculture comes to the front. when a bill is before us involving the happiness and the prosperity and the comfort of millions of people in this country. we find captious objections raised to its constitutionality. i am sure some have genuine doubts on this subject. and i respect their views. but where there is such a genuine doubt i submit that in view of the various types of legislation that have heretofore been passed under criticism and under objection. all of which have been sustained that have so far reached the supreme court of the united states. and especially in view of the grave economic consequences involved. we should not here and now draw a new line when the welfare of millions and millions of people. not only this year but next year and possibly longer. is involved in legislation which at least meets the approval of the judgment of some of the best lawyers who are available. i pointed out the opinion of the assistant furnished by the department of justice. i pointed out a decision of the supreme court of the united states. which to my mind settles the matter. and there are many others upon which it is based. such as the prohibitive tax upon the issue of state bank notes long. long ago. which was sustained by the supreme court of the united states. mr. president. i recognize that this is the lunch hour. and that from physical necessity a great many senators are not here whom i should like very much to have hear one phase of this discussion. i assume. however. that under the rules and practices of the senate it will be necessary for me to proceed with the discussion. because i am extremely anxious. if possible. to secure final action on this bill before the senate shall adjourn today. planting is now going on down in southern texas. it will of necessity take some time to set up the machinery for the administration of this bill. it has been under consideration for some time. let me say that this bill has not come to congress from any theorist of any kind. this is a practical program which has developed out of the necessities of our situation. let me say to those who do me the honor to remain here that the demand for the passage of this bill comes up from the very cotton rows of the south. the man who thinks that the cotton farmer does not know his own business is simply out of touch with the experiences and the judgment of the cotton farmer. year in and year out he has seen the price of cotton fluctuate violently. even during the same year. he has watched with interest the announcement of the estimates of the government on the size of the crop. he has observed from time to time that as the estimate of the size of the crop increased the price of cotton decreased. he has observed the oppositeas the estimate was reduced the price of cotton increased. i assume that many other agriculturists are in the same condition as the cotton farmer. but what i have said is peculiarly true of the cotton farmer. because of his dependence upon the world market for the sale of around 60 percent of his total crop. no other agricultural commodity looks to foreign markets. and must look to them. for the sale of so large a proportion of the total production as does cotton. there is no commodity. industrial or agricultural. which must find foreign markets to anything like the percentage that cotton does. sixty percent of all the money brought to the cotton farmers comes not from the consumers in america but from the consumers in the foreign countries of the world. it is a new addition each year to the capital assets of this country. it includes an average of around 25 percent in dollar value. over a long period of years. of all the money that comes to america as a result of the sale in foreign countries of the products of america. industrial and agricultural combined. so. when we figure upon a fair and reasonable price for cotton. we must bear in mind that when we get a fair price we are increasing the volume of money going into all the trade channels in america. mr. president. every mail every day carries a volume of checks and remittances out of the cotton belt to the industrial and financial sections of this country. we send money out for shoes. clothes. hats. farm implements. automobiles. radios. nearly everything of common use and consumption except food products. and we send a lot of money out even for food products. so that in the cotton belt. from lower virginia to california. we are consumers. who provide a large market for the industries of the united states. we send checks to pay the interest upon mortgages. upon insurance premiums. upon railroad and utility bonds. and everything of that kind. they are not owned. except in a very small way. in the cotton belt. we must get the money from the sale of cotton to meet all those payments. only once a year do we have a return flow of money to the cotton belt. we ship very little of anything out of the cotton belt except cotton. and manufactured products of cotton from the textile mills located in the south. if we do not get in that return flow of money from the result of our cotton crop. a reasonable price for the cotton. then. of course. we cannot help to support the industries and financiers of this country. therefore it is not solely a local problem in the cotton belt. it is a subject which ought to be of interest to every thoughtful man in the united states who is interested in the welfare of the people in all sections of this country.\n730121180|mr. president-\n730121181|does the senator from alabama yield to the senator from oklahoma?\n730121182|i yield.\n730121183|i suggest the absence of a quorum.\n730121184|the clerk will call the roll.\n730121185|eightynine senators having answered to their names. a quorum is present.\n730121186|mr. president. will the senator yield?\n730121187|i yield.\n730121188|the senator just now took the position that he was relying upon the mccray case. and invited me to read the decision in the case. i have sent to the library for the volume containing the decision. and. with the senators permission. i wish to read him the last two paragraphs from the decision in the case. mccray v. united states (195 u.s. rep.) : such concession. however. is not controlling in this case. this follows when the nature of oleomargarine. artificially colored to look like butter. is recalled. as we have said. it has been conclusively settled by this court that the tendency of that article to deceive the public into buying it for butter is such that the state may. in the exertion of their police powers. without violating the dueprocess clause of the fourteenth amendment. absolutely prohibit the manufacture of the article. it hence results that even although it be true that the effect of the tax in question is to repress the manufacture of artificially colored oleomargarine. it cannot be said that such repression destroys rights which no free government could destroy. and. therefore. no ground exists to sustain the proposition that the judiciary may invoke an implied prohibition. upon the theory that to do so is essential to save such rights from destruction. and the same considerations dispose of the contention based upon the dueprocess clause of the fifth amendment. that provision. as we have previously said. does not withdraw or expressly limit the grant of power to tax conferred upon congress by the constitution. from this it follows. as we have also previously declared. that the judiciary is without authority to avoid an act of congress exerting the taxing power. even in a case where to the judicial mind it seems that congress had in putting such power in motion abused its lawful authority by levying a tax which was unwise or oppressive. or the result of the enforcement of which might be to indirectly affect subjects not within the powers delegated to congress. let us concede that if a case was presented where the abuse of the taxing power was so extreme as to be beyond the principles which we have previously stated. and where it was plain to the judicial mind that the power had been called into play not for revenue but solely for the purpose of destroying rights which could not be rightfully destroyed consistently with the principles of freedom and justice upon which. the constitution rests. that it would be the duty of the courts to say that such an arbitrary act was not merely an abuse of a delegated power. but was the exercise of an authority not conferred. this concession. however. like the one previously made. must be without influence upon the decision of this cause for the reasons previously stated. that is. that the manufacture of artificially colored oleomargarine may be prohibited by a free government without a violation of fundamental rights. that clearly distinguishes. as i think. the present proposed legislation from the oleomargarine decisions in the kollock case and in the mccray case. if the senator can enlighten me. in view of what i have readand he is certainly familiar with the case. and he is relying upon iti will be very greatly helped in my thinking on this important legislation.\n730121189|i will say to the senator that the statement of the court. which. of course. is arguendo and therefore not a declaration of law upon the subject. in which the court was answering the argument against the constitutionality of the oleomargarine tax. was to the effect that. conceding the position taken by the party to that case was correct. and to say no more than that. still it would not lead the court to declare the act unconstitutional.\n730121190|but in order to bring the senators proposed legislation within the doctrine of the oleomargarine act. he must show some analogy between the ginning of cotton and the coloring of oleomargarine. and i do not get the analogy.\n730121191|i do not think the oleomargarine tax was predicated upon the mere fact that the coloring of the oleomargarine authorized the tax.\n730121192|or the imitation of butter?\n730121193|i think the supreme court would have sustained the tax on oleomargarine in any form. whether colored or uncolored. as i interpret the case.\n730121194|we differ on that. let me ask the senator another question. what is the cost of the production of cotton? i take it no one here can testify more conclusively on that subject than the senator from alabama. m r. bainkhead. of course. that. as the senator knows. very greatly varies. it depends on many things. it depends on the cost of material. the cost of supplies. and the cost of labor.\n730121195|would the senator say that as a rule the cost of the production of cotton to the farmer is more than 50 percent of the price he receives?\n730121196|that depends on the price.\n730121197|does the senator mean to tell the united states senate that the farmers are now making 50 percent on the production of their cotton? i think we ought to get right at the facts here.\n730121198|i will say to the senator that i think the cost of production of cotton is practically its present price.\n730121199|its present price is 12 cents?\n730121200|i do not think the cost of production has anything to do with the levying of the tax.\n730121201|its present price is 12 cents? is that correct?\n730121202|i say i do not think the cost of production has anything to do with the levying of the tax.\n730121203|i am not now disputing that. but i am trying to get the senator to say that the cost of production of cotton. in his judgment. is today 12 and a fraction cents. that being the market price.\n730121204|the cost of some of it is and some of it is not. as i said. it depends on varying conditions.\n730121205|what is the general cost of production of cotton?\n730121206|that depends on what is included in the cost of production. there are many elements that may be included which the farmer does not include. the cost of the interest on the investment ought to be included in the cost of production.\n730121207|the senator just now. i thought. said that the cost of production was equal to the present market price.\n730121208|i think that is practically true on the average.\n730121209|that is 12 and a fraction cents. is it not?\n730121210|no. it is about 12 cents. or under 12 cents.\n730121211|how much?\n730121212|it is probably now under 12 cents.\n730121213|a little under 12 cents?\n730121214|let us call it about 12 cents. a tax of 50 percent on the cotton above a certain quantity ginned would add that much to it. or take that much from the return. would it not?\n730121215|i do not understand the senators question.\n730121216|if the cost of production is now 11 cents. and the tax is 50 percent upon the pound. that would be a tax of 51/2 cents on the pound. would it not? i ask the senator would that not suppress the production of cotton n excess of 10.000.000 bales. and is that not the primary object of this proposed legislation?\n730121217|the primary purpose. of course. is to discourage the production of more cotton than the 10.000.000 bales.\n730121218|and to make it financially impossible by imposing a tax that is equal to half the cost of production?\n730121219|i do not base it on cost of production at all. i do not think that is an element that enters into the question. i think it is the same proposition that industrialists engage in of disposing of their surplus somewhere.\n730121220|i wish the senator would come down and make it very plain now. is not the purpose of this proposed legislation to suppress the production of cotton in excess of 10.000.000 bales a year?\n730121221|no. it is to prevent the sale of it without paying the tax.\n730121222|if the senator prevents a man from selling a thing. if that man is not entirely crazy. he certainly will not produce it. is that not so?\n730121223|of course. the senator knows that we hope that no more than 10.000.000 bales of cotton will reach the market.\n730121224|and that is the objective to be accomplished by this proposed legislation. and if that does not justify the legislation. nothing else will. is that not so?\n730121225|the senator from alabama has the floor. i am glad to have the testimony of the senator from south carolina . let that go in the record. the senator from south carolina said in answer to my question. yes. what does the senator from alabama say?\n730121226|i think it will help. whether we limit it to 10.000.000 bales or they have slightly more.\n730121227|that is not answering the question. i do not wish unduly to press my friend. but i believe i will ask him once more: can this bill be justified on any theory other than the theory that it will restrain the farmers who produce cotton from producing in excess of 10.000.000 bales of cotton during the coming year?\n730121228|i am afraid it will produce too much revenue. i will say to the senator.\n730121229|that is not an answer to my question. i should like to have the senator answer the question.\n730121230|i have answered it.\n730121231|what is the answer. please?\n730121232|i said i was afraid it would produce too much revenue. there would be too much cotton sold at 50 percent.\n730121233|does the senator consider that an answer to my question?\n730121234|i have asked the senator what will be the effect of this proposed legislation. and he tells me he is afraid it will produce too much revenue. i submit that does not answer my question.\n730121235|i told the senator what i had in mind about it.\n730121236|i will ask the senator again: is not the object of the bill to prevent the production of more than 10.000.000 bales of cotton this year in america?\n730121237|it is not.\n730121238|then what is the object?\n730121239|the object is to limit as closely as we can the sale of more than 10.000.000 bales. and to collect revenue upon the excess sold.\n730121240|that is. to limit the sale. and to tell the farmer in advance that if he produces it he will be taxed 50 percent on the price?\n730121241|i submit i have answered the senators question.\n730121242|very well. i am satisfied with the answer.\n730121243|i desire to call the attention of the senate brieflyi do not want to take much more timeto the effect of the size of the crop of american cotton upon the price and the volume of money paid to the producers for their crop. i think to one who is really interested. mr. president. in beneficial results for the cotton belt. that tells the whole story of this situation. that story ought to appeal to one who is really desirous of helping the cotton farmer. so far as he can conscientiously do so. i do not expect anybody to do it who cannot conscientiously do so. but that story ought to appeal to the judgment and to the heart of every person who can conscientiously vote to help the cotton farmer. and who is engaged in passing upon this great program. which is fraught with such tremendous results in the cotton belt. i desire to call the senates attention to a graph on the wall. which was prepared by the bureau of economics in the department of agriculture. which shows the number of bales of cotton harvested each year. and the average price per pound paid to the farmer each year. beginning with 1890 and coming down to 1931. the red line represents the volume of the production. the blue line represents the average farm price. i wish to call attention to the fluctuations in those two lines. from which will be noted that. with practical uniformity. as production increases the price to the farmer decreases. and as production decreases at the same time and in the same way the price to the farmer increases. this line [indicating] indicates the production. this line [indicating] represents the price. as production goes down the price goes up. the two move along practically in opposite directions all the way across the graph. now i come to the war period. this sector of the lines represents conditions in 1915. then. of course. there was an abnormal demand for cotton in foreign countries for use for explosives and other purposes. which ran up the price at that time. during the years 1916. 1917. 1918. and in 1919. following the war. to abnormal points. the price went up then to 36 cents a pound. production. as will be seen from the graph [indicating]. had gone down and the price went up. production went down because of the absence of man power engaged in the world war. and. therefore. with a limited supply of cotton and with a small surplus carried from time to time. the price of cotton continued to rise. now we come to the year 1920. which irs known as the year of the deflation . when all commodity prices. and particularly agricultural commodity prices. went to the bottom. the price of cotton dropped in 1 year from 36 cents a pound to 14 cents a pound. fortunately. just at that time the bollweevil made its appearance in the south. and the production of cotton went down to 8.000.000 bales. when the production went down. it will be noticed that the price began to move back up. here [indicating] in 1923 production reached 10.000.000 bales in round numbersto be exact. 10.140.000 balesand the price that same year moved up to 31 cents a pound. with that rise in price the acreage planted to cotton was increased all over the cotton belt. the farmers began to get better control over the bollweevil situation. the crops began to increase. and did rapidly increase in size. as a result production started up. and as it went up the price. as will be noted. crossed it and went down. in 1926 we produced the largest crop of cotton ever produced in any one year in america. we produced 18.000.000 bales of cotton. and the price went down to slightly under 11 cents a pound. to this point [indicating on the graph] as a result of that large crop. then production went down and the price went up. in 1931 we produced next to the largest crop. 17.000.000 bales. and the price went down around 5 cents a pound. now let me give senators the figures which resulted from those fluctuations. please bear in mind that the years to which i am now referring. the years from 1923 to 1927. we will say. represent a period in the business affairs of this country and of the world which was recognized everywhere as constituting the high tide in the flow of business not only nationally but internationally. there was strong buying power. there was unusual consumption. there was every element that should have held the price of cotton on an even keel. but it will be noticed that during the 5 or 6 years to which i am referring. while general business was flourishing. the price of cotton was not preserved at its proper place in the normal price structure. take 1923. in which there was produced a 10.000.000bale crop. what did the farmers get for it? they got 31 cents a pound. there moved into the farmers hands $1.571.000.000 for a 10.000.000bale cotton crop. next year. 1924. the bollweevil was under better control. the high price was attractive. and the crop was increased by three and a half million bales. up to 13.600.000 bales. the price dropped to 221/2 cents. and the total amount received by the farmers was $1.540.000.000. very nearly the same as in the previous year. but it took thirteen and a half million bales of cotton that year to bring the farmer what 10.000.000 bales brought to him the previous year. take 1925. the crop went up to 16.000.000 bales. the price dropped to 18.2 cents. the total amount received by the farmers was $1.464.000.000. almost the same amount as in 1923. but it took 16.000.000 bales of cotton to bring the same amount of money to the farmers that 10.000.000 bales brought in 1923 and that thirteen and a half million bales brought in 1924. now we come to 1926. which was the year of the big crop. 18.000.000 bales. the price dropped to 10.9 cents. the total amount of money received by the farmers was $982.000.000. in short. for 8.000.000 bales more of cotton than were produced in 1923 the farmers received $600.000.000 less money. bear in mind. mr. president. that in 1926 business was at a point that is recognized as representing almost ideal conditions. general commodity prices for that year are recognized as being on a level to which we should now. if we can. raise general prices. but in that year. that almost perfect business year. with a most desirable price level. the price of cotton dropped far. far below the cost of production. why? i ask. for one reason. and one reason alone. there was no depression. there was. if anything. an increase in consumption. purchasing power was constant and strong. the price of cotton dropped for one reason. and for one reason alone. and that was the size of the crop. the production of so much more cotton than there was an effective demand for purposes of consumption. let us take 1927. the 2 years 1926 and 1927 are almost identical. the size of the crop dropped 5.000.000 bales. going down to about 13.000.000 bales as against 18.000.000 bales. the price jumped up to 19.6 cents. the volume of money realized by the farmers was $1.286.000.000. take the 2 years 1926 and 1927. with 5.000.000 bales less of cotton. the farmers received $350.000.000 more in money. i ask any thoughtful student what would be the effect if we could draw a straight line across that wildly fluctuating red line of production? i ask any fairminded man if at the same time there would not be drawn a straight blue line indicating a stabilization of the price of cotton at a point where it properly belongs in the price structure and in the uses of cotton in the world? these figures show a most terrible economic waste. they show a most destructive loss of purchasing and consuming power not only on the part of our own cottonsection people but on the part of people in our industrial section. resulting in the loss of so much foreign money which the cotton crop would bring to this country if we could secure for it a reasonable and fair price. nobody wants cotton at an artificially high price. mr. president. i am not going to take any more of the time of the senate. as i stated in the beginning. this bill comes before the senate with the support of the cotton farmers. a questionnaire sent out showed that 95 percent of the cotton farmers answering favored the bill. they know their situation. they know they cannot get a fair price until there can be brought about a reduction in their carryover. nearly every cotton farmer is willing to reduce production if he only knows that the other producers are also going to reduce their cotton production. all they want to know. any of them. is that all will act alike. for they know that production has got to come down. they want to bring it down. but while bringing it down they want to know that the man here is not going to reduce his production while the fellow across the creek or somewhere else is maintaining or increasing his production. so the congress has been asked to give them this bill. i cannot imagine why senators or congressmen should be reluctant about it. consider the vote at the other end of the capitol. of the representatives. who are in direct touch with the people. a new program? yes. one that required them naturally to know the views of their constituents. one involving a limitation. if we may so call it. upon the individualistic views heretofore followed. naturally they would be reluctant there. with the elections coming on. to go counter to the wishes of these toilers in the field. over there the vote was 251 to 114. with only five members from the cotton belt. from california to virginia. voting against the program.\n730121244|mr. president. may i ask the senator from alabama a question?\n730121245|does the senator from alabama yield to the senator from michigan?\n730121246|i shall be glad to answer the senators question if i can.\n730121247|i heard one congressman from the south quoted as saying that if he did not vote for the bill this year he could not be elected in 1934. but if he voted for it and was elected in 1934. he could not be reelected in 1936. this is a facetious observation. but it leads me to inquire of the senator whether the cotton planters will not rebel against the restriction when they meet it in fact. although they contemplate it with some equanimity in prospect. does the senator think it will work to that effect?\n730121248|i am willing to stake my political destiny on its working. i think it that strongly.\n730121249|the senator believed that the plowingunder campaign would succeed last year?\n730121250|it did succeed tremendously. it saved our people from ruin. they did not go far enough. i begged them to plow under 50 percent.\n730121251|it succeeded. but they ran into human nature. plus four times as much fertilizer as they ever ran into before. according to the experience of the southern railway as recently reported in time magazine.\n730121252|mr. president-\n730121253|does the senator from alabama yield to the senator from south carolina?\n730121254|i yield.\n730121255|may i correct the senator from michigan ? he is under the impression that last year there was an excess of fertilizer used. that is not correct. for the reason that the plowup did not take place until the cotton in some instances was open. the cotton farmers had no knowledge that the plan would be put into operation. and therefore it did not affect the purchase of fertilizer at all or the acreage that was left in cotton. the majority of it was plowed up after part of it had matured. so the question of fertilizer did not enter into it at all.\n730121256|this is the point: we discovered there was a back door or side door to the voluntary -scheme. if there had not been a back door the bill of the senator from alabama would not be here today. he would not be seeking to substitute compulsion for voluntary action. what i want to know is whether there is any way the farmers similarly could avoid. by any detour whatever. compliance with the effective purposes of this new bill.\n730121257|i hope the senator will help to close every possible loophole in the bill and make it as tight and effective as it is possible to make it.\n730121258|will the senator allow me a moment further?\n730121259|i yield.\n730121260|i do not like the implication to go out that anybody used any back door or any subterfuge to increase the crop last year. i call attention to the fact that in 1929 we planted 43.000.000 acres of cotton and made 14.000.000 bales. in 1931 we planted 38.000.000 acres and made 17.000.000 bales. cotton is the most sensitive plant to season that i know of in agriculture. the question last year was not an excess use of fertilizer but it was what is known as a cotton year. every now and then we have an ideal season. the yield per acre last year. as has occurred perhaps four or five times in the last 25 or 30 years. was abundant. the season hit it exactly. it was not on account of the farmer trying to sidestep or use any subterfuge. i stand here today to say that i believe the agricultural department and the public who understand the situation never saw a more unanimous effort and a more fixed determination and a more enthusiastic entrance into a plan than the farmers in the plowup business to carry out their part of it honestly and meticulously.\n730121261|mr. president. just one further question. if the senator from alabama will yield?\n730121262|certainly.\n730121263|in seeking to close the back doors and the side doors. if there be anylet me put it that waydoes the senator from alabama think that the tax proposed in the bill will be effective. or will there be sales in spite of the tax?\n730121264|i am going to offer an amendment to increase the amount of the tax. and i hope the senator will help me make it more effective.\n730121265|so that if possible there will be no sales as a result?\n730121266|that is what i seek.\n730121267|mr. president. will the senator from alabama yield?\n730121268|does the senator from alabama yield to the senator from louisiana?\n730121269|i yield.\n730121270|the senator stated a moment ago that he intends to offer an amendment to increase the tax. may i say that i have received quite a number of telegrams from louisiana suggesting that the tax should be increased in order to effectuate the purpose of the bill. i am very glad the senator is going to offer that kind of an amendment.\n730121271|i have a committee amendment on that point. we have all agreed to it. we are going to make the bill effective if we can possibly do so. we have an amendment increasing the tax to 75 percent. mr. president. if there is no one else who wants to speak at this time. i wish to offer the amendment which i send to the desk.\n730121272|the senator from alabama proposes an amendment which will be read.\n730121273|the senator from alabama proposes an amendment. on page 2. line 15. to strike out section 2 and insert in lieu thereof the following: sec. 2. the provisions of this act shall be effective with respect to the crop years 193435 and 193536. and any crop year thereafter when the president finds that the economic emergency in cotton production and marketing will continue or is likely to continue to exist so that the application of this act with respect to a crop year is necessary in the public interest in order to carry out the policy declared in section 1. he shall so proclaim. and this act shall be effective with respect to that crop year. if at any time the president finds that the economic emergency in cotton production and marketing has ceased to exist. he shall so proclaim. and no tax under this act shall be levied with respect to lint cotton during that crop year after the effective date of said proclamation.\n730121274|the question is on agreeing to the amendment submitted by the senator from alabama.\n730121275|mr. president. i do not intend to occupy very much time. though i desire to say a few words upon the proposal now pending. i have a great deal of sympathy with the theory that in order to assure a higher price level for farm products the price will have to be determined very largely by supply and demand. in other words. that the price is not going to be determined by what congress says. but rather by the operation of normal. economic law. which must be determined on the basis either of ability to buy or ability to reduce an oversupply. of course the normal way to bring about the desired result would be to increase the demand. if we knew how to do it. if that may not be done. then quite naturally we would think the next step would be to reduce the supply. but i have stated. as it has been stated many times before i ever made the statement. that an attempt to solve the problem on the basis of reduction of the supply is dangerous. if the product of the farm were not a food product or a necessary of life. the question would not be so serious. but the farm produces the necessaries of life. and we are proceeding to limit the supply of something we must have that is largely under the control of the elements. over which neither man nor his expressions through legislation can have any influence. the question has been in my mind several times since this debate started: if by action of the government we should command a reduction in the production of these necessaries. and then. through the operation of elements that we cannot control. there should be a shortage. and suffering incident to that shortage. what responsibility would the government have. its action being the cause of the shortage? i think we must consider that probability. when we have a smaller acreage under good conditions producing a greater crop than a larger acreage under bad conditions. we will not be faced with that difficulty. but if we should have. under the restriction of production. a bad year. and through that suffer. it seems to me that the government would have some responsibility to the sufferers. and that responsibility would be without limit. that is cne element that must be considered here. furthermore. while i admit that reduction might be desirable if it could be accomplished by cooperation. i have great fear of going to the extent of bringing it about by compulsion. cooperation to bring about reduction all of us could approve. but reduction by law is something that i hesitate very seriously to embark upon. for there is so much involved in it. there is another point that we must not overlook in our consideration of this proposal: i think the strongest passion in the human breast is that which involves the rights of ownership. i believe there is nothing in our makeup more dominating than the feeling that a man is monarch of what he owns. that is expressed in many ways. and certainly is being expressed in a great body of correspondence that is reaching washington at this time. i have just received a letter written in longhand by a farmer. examination of the penmanship indicates that it is from an average hardworking man who does not engage very much in letter writing. but it seems to me that what he says is the ordinary. commonsense view of the average citizen. he writes as follows: our daily paper tells of the bankhead cotton control bill passing the house. and the way it is represented in our papers leads me to believe that all agriculture is soon to be regulated in the same way. i am one of the temporary county cornhog reduction committee chosen by the state officials. and i have been elected permanently to represent our part of the county in the county organization. now. if this bankhead bill uses as its base for regulation statutes procured in the cottonreduction plan last year. it is logical for me to believe that our cornhog figure will be used in a like manner. i would be very much opposed to making anything of this sort permanent. we hear much about rugged individualism cussed in all directions now. but it seems to be forgotten that rugged individualism is exactly what wrested this country from the indian and made it the most desirable country of all the world in which to live. will you please advise if i am right in my surmise of the cotton situation. and the likelihood of a cornhogcontrol bill being passed with provisions like the bankhead bill about cotton? if so. the socalled reduction payments  are a sugarcoated pill that robs us of our most prized possessionfreedom to do as we please on the land that is deeded to us. without restriction by this same government. please answer. and the writer signs his name as a farmer from ohio. mr. president. i am of the opinion that that letter pretty well expresses the feeling of the average farmer throughout the united states. i have reached the conclusion that such is his view not only because of the numerous letters i have receivedand they come from all sections of the countrybut because what is proposed here appeals to me as an interference with what the average man regards as one of his rights. i think he naturally feels that any interference of this kind is without justice. and it certainly will be resisted with an intensity that we never yet have fully realized. the present presiding officer will remember what a terrific reaction there was when we undertook to put into force the cornborer legislation. all of us considered that that legislation was in the interest of agriculture. everyone must admit that when there is such a danger as that. it would be the height of foolishness for us not to meet it on the threshold. that is why i never have hesitated to vote to eradicate a pest whose depredations were obvious. such as the bollweevil and the various forms of scale that attacked our fruits. and other pests which were making invasions upon our productive ability. for that reason i did not hesitate. although under considerable protest from various sections. to authorize federal authority to go on the farm and state that if the farmer himself did not take the precautions and do what was necessary to prevent the further invasion of the corn borer. the federal government would do it for him. everyone will recall with what terrific opposition that interference with the farmer. even when it was on his own behalf. met from the farmer himself. it was largely due. i know. to the manner in which the law was being enforced. some little whippersnapper sent out by federal authority goes to a farm and tells the farmer that if he does not do a certain thing within a certain time it will be done for him. that stirs the average farmer to the point where he almost wishes to commit murder. that is because of his feeling that the farm is his. and he does not want somebody who knows nothing about it to come to him and tell him what to do. i am afraid if this measure shall become a law. if it can in any form be justified in its application to cotton. that similar legislation will be demanded from certain sections on the part of other farmers. perhaps as to wheat and corn. perhaps as to every commodity which is produced in great quantities. we are entering now upon a new course. i am saying nothing about its constitutionality. i am not speaking of whether it is an emergency measure or a permanent one. i assume that it will be permanent if it shall prove to have any merit at all. i am afraid. however. that under the stress of an emergency we are entering on a course that is to become permanent not only in this case but in the. broad field of agriculture. i think it never can become permanent generally. because i think that the revulsion of sentiment is going to be so terrific that nobody would feel free to undertake to extend the federal authority over the farmer in the various states. mr. president. a step toward denying to the individual citizen the control of his own business goes further than any step we have ever yet taken. it seems somewhat dangerous when we do it in connection with voluntary cooperation. and yet when it can be done in such cases. i cannot see any legitimate objection to it. there might be an objection where the government pays for doing it voluntarilyi think there is objection to thatbut that is neither here nor there. that is water over the wheel. however. here is a proposal which goes far beyond anything we have heretofore undertaken. if i do not mistake. it is going to create such a combined opposition. coming from every section of the country. that it will arouse a class feeling for action in accordance with what they seem to think is their best interest. which will come up from the landed people. who are. after all. what is left in the united states of independence. as i have previously stated. i know of no passion that is stronger than the feeling that leads one to say. this is mine. it is not only mine to hold but it is mine to convey if i want to. without any interference with that right. not only that the property is mine to do as i want to do with but that it is mine to sow when i want to. and with what i want to. and to the extent i desire. without having to come to washington for permission before i do it. if we shall embark on a policy which will ultimately reach the point where a farmer cannot put a plow in a field or turn a single furrow before he comes to washington and gets permission. we will create a feeling which will be unlike anything that has ever been known in the united states. then in 2 or 3 months. after he has the permission. the farmer will have some government inspector coming to his farm and going over the planting to ascertain whether the regulations of the federal government are being respected. can anybody fully appreciate the reaction of the farmer who will thus be put under the eye of the inspector? senators who are moving in this direction certainly ought to know where they are going. i am saying nothing about the impracticability of the plan. i am saying nothing about the impossibility of enforcing the proposed law. mr. president. the present presiding officer and i stood together in the attempt to enforce the prohibition law. and all will admit the terrific revulsion of public sentiment. which was the most surprising reaction i have ever known. which put out of existence by a flood of opinion not only the statute which was written in pursuance of constitutional sanction but also the constitutional sanction was put out of existence in a way that was more surprising than anything that has occurred in my political experience. that was largely due to the inability to make the enforcement effective. yet here is a proposal to place every farmer under the eye of the government. because i have a right to assume that if this is a good thing for the cotton farmer it will be extended to every one of the 6.000.000 farmers in the united states. who will be placed under the regulation of the federal statute. if we could not enforce prohibition. how can we enforce this particular plan. which would interfere with the individual right of the owner of every foot of land in the united states? senators ought to realize the direction in which they are going. i am not concerned about the length of the step. i am more concerned about the direction of the step. it seems to me that we ought to proceed cautiously when we are proceeding along lines which interfere with such rights. mr. president. there came to me yesterday a publication known as hoards dairyman . a journal devoted to dairy farming. in it i find the following:\n730121276|is there objection? the chair hears none. and it is so ordered.\n730121277|mr. president. i read further from this magazine. the verdict of 4.909 farm families in a nationwide poll from the following questions and answers is as follows: in your opinion. will the government plan for the control of production of all farm products be helpful to agriculture as a whole? one thousand three hundred and sixtysix answered yes. one thousand seven hundred and twentynine aswered no. one thousand three hundred and forty answered it might be. has the cottonallotment plan helped you? yes . 228. no . 2.424. ten times as many answered no as answered yes.","mr. president. before the quorum call i was about to discuss some of the hazards and hardships with which these young men have to contend. i hardly think it is necessary to emphasize the fact that the value of the youth to the country is recognized by all. and i do not think i shall take the time of the senate to read from numerous documents i have here concerning the value of the youth of the country. notwithstanding the disparagement placed upon them by the senator from south carolina . i do wish. however. to quote from a memorandum prepared by the childrens bureau of the department of labor. as follows: boys accustomed to decent standards of living find themselves going for days at a time without taking off their clothes to sleep at night. becoming dirty. unkempt. a host of vermin. they may go for days with nothing to eat but coffee. bread. and beans. in winter they suffer from exposure. last winter in one western city 35 young men and boys were removed from box cars seriously ill. some in advanced stages of pneumonia. yet. mr. president. for the maintenance of the aristocracy of the army these boys must not annoy them. continuing to quote: freight yards are policed. hence trains must be boarded outside the yard limits while the train is in motion. one railroad alone reported more than 50 young men and boys killed and more than 100 crippled in this way last winter. it is no longer possible to pick up odd jobs here and there. and yet. mr. president. the senator from south carolina and the senator from arkansas say that we are not reaching the ills of the situation. why this constant opposition to doing something that will relieve distress while we are attempting to find a mythical way of expanding currency and doing other things to get at the fundamentals? every time some one approaches a problem of this kind the protestants get up and talk about not attacking \"fundamentals.\" well. mr. president. i have heard the words \"fundamentals\" and \" sound policies \" and \" economy.\" and so on. until i am sick and tired. and the whole united states ought to be sick and tired of the constant repetition of the words \" fundamentals.\" \" economy.\" \" sound money.\" and all that sort of crazy talk while millions and millions of our people are in distress. we must not. mr. president. do anything that will disturb \"rugged individualism \"! we must not do anything that in any manner. shape. or form will affect the dignity of the youth of the land. we must enable them to retain their selfrespect. we must not offer them something for nothing. we must stand here and see them traveling in the slough of despond. in misery. in distress. and sickness. afflicted with venereal and other diseases. and at the same time stand by and preach \" fundamentals\" and \"economy.\" and we must do this in spite of the fact that on one railroad alone 50 young men were killed and 100 crippled while traveling across the country in search of jobs. which the senator from south carolina says they should have. instead of receiving some assistance from their government. thousands more are being killed and crippled while the senator from south carolina says we are not dealing with \"fundamentals.\" we must hold up measures of this kind and see these youths demoralized. while the senator from south carolina deals with \" fundamentals.\" while he talks hazily about some method for providing new currency and some kind of credit expansion. we must first get all those questions settled while in the meantime the youths of the nation are going through an experience to which no human being should be subjected. continuing to read from the memorandum of the department of labor: it is no longer possible to pick up odd jobs here and there. communities jealously reserve even the occasional shorttime job for local residents. therefore the unwelcome nonresident boysi emphasize the word \"unwelcome.\" can senators who have sons and grandsons sit here and realize with complacency that there are 300.000 boys traveling over this country who are \"unwelcome \"? the nonresident boy is told everywhere he goes \"move on. move on. we will give you some coffee and beans tonight and a shack to live in. but tomorrow move on. move on.\" and yet we stand here and appropriate millions of dollars to maintain credit. to none of the measures making such appropriations have i expressed any opposition. and all i ask is that the same consideration and cooperation be given to these homeless boys by the beneficiaries under previous acts of congress. therefore the unwelcome nonresident boy must either depend on the bread line or soup kitchen. or he must beg or steal. in the box cars. in the \" jungles.\" as the camping sites adjacent to the railroad yards are called. or even in the municipal shelters. he will meet men whose entire influence is destructivecriminals. fugitives from justice planning new \"jobs\"referring to criminal \"jobs \"and looking for clever new recruits--degenerates and perverts eager to initiate new boys into evil habits and teach them how they can pick up a few odd dollars in any big city. such men are in the great minority. but one or two can do ai incalculable amount of damage. worst of all. perhaps. because it is so contagious. is the workless philosophy. the \"getting by\" attitude everywhere encountered and very easily acquired on the open road. to this species of demoralization the \" keep them moving \" policy universally in vogue not only offers no opposition but in fact contributes. mr. president. the senator from arkansas and the senator from south carolina say we must not have the sacred i army of the united states demoralized by requesting them to take care of 88.000 destitute. vigorous. energetic boys who are unable to get work. what method of reasoning do these gentlemen employ? what is the philosophy of those who take this position? mr. president. not onetenth of the energy has been devoted by congress to the care of the human side as has been devoted to taking care of the financial side. call that demagoguery. if you desire. but if it be demagoguery. i am willing to accept the challenge. i recognize the desirability and the advantages of keeping commerce as free as possible through the maintenance of the ordinary channels of business. i recognize that we must do everything that is proper to permit depositors in banks to withdraw their money so as to enable them to pay their help. to pay their bills. and to live. i am and have been willing to do that up to date. but i am now in doubt how much further we can go. i have been willing that the taxpayers credit should be used to maintain the railroads inordinate capitalization. because there are some 60.000.000 life policyholders in the united states whose equity in their policies i was unwilling to destroy. i have stood by and seen hundreds of millions of dollars appropriated for the aid and maintenance of the farmers. and have cheerfully contributed to support such measures. but now. mr. president. the senator from south carolina and the senator from arkansas and some others from the southa section which has been the greatest beneficiary under the appropriations of congress to ameliorate flood and drought conditions. and to provide seed for farmers--stand up here and say that was perfectly all right because we got back 87 per cent in gold. mr. president. i submit that what we will get back if we shall adequately take care of these youths will be worth more than 87 per cent in gold. during the nearly 11 years that i have been a member of the senate i have seen almost every kind of legislation go through in the interest of business. i have not opposed those measures. i am not against the railroads or other business. i want to see their integrity maintained. but. mr. president. i also want to see maintained the integrity of the youth of the land and i want to see them preserved. i am unable to understand men with sons and with grandchildren standing here and saying. \" this scheme is impracticable because it will disturb the army.\" what is there sacred about the army or the navy that they can not contribute their assistance to relieve a condition which everyone admits is intolerable and should not be permitted to continue? the senator from pennsylvania was kind enough to have his clerk submit to me a memorandum of the reasons for the adverse report made on this bill by the committee on military affairs. the first iswhile the army has neither barracks nor tentage which could house as many as 100.000 men. senator couzens estimates the number of applicants at about 300.000. many members of the committee felt that the number would be far greater than this. i do not criticize the committee for making that statement. for there was admittedly nothing in the bill which limited the number. but i had no information as to the capacity of the army facilities. i did expect. however. that the committee on military affairs would be sympathetic enough with the principle involved to go into the matter and rewrite the bill or insert amendments which would have shown some interest on their part and have taken care of the number of youths. who could have been taken care of by the war department without extending its facilities beyond their existind capacity. their second reason is: the army has no supply of clothing which could be issued to these young men. the war department in their letter to the senator from pennsylvania did not make any such statement as that. they said that whatever equipment or clothing was used for this purpose would have to be replenished. of course i understand that and i understand appropriations will have to be made for replenishing the clothing which the army will have to use in order to clothe these young boys. 3. the army appropriation for subsistence is barely sufficient to feed the present regular army of 118.750 enlisted men. to feed 300.000 additional men would require a further appropriation of. two and a half times as much as our present appropriation for this purpose. i expected that the military affairs committee. to which this bill was referred and which later referred it to a subcommittee. would amend the bill introduced to take care of the situation. but they never changed a word in the bill. mr. president. they made no recommendations. the chairman of the subcommittee was the junior senator from iowa . with whom i spoke about holding hearings. they not only did not hold any hearings. they not only did not ask me to come before the committee and discuss the matter with them. but they just coldbloodedly referred the matter to the committee on military affairs without a hearing. without any consideration from persons who had familiarity with the subject. and referred it to the full committee on military affairs. who. in turn. coldbloodedly kicked it out on the calendar with an adverse report. 4. discipline of this group of young men would be next to impossible. since they would not be enlisted and would be beyond the armys authority to punish for infractions of rules. they could not even be required to keep their own quarters clean. and the army has no funds with which it could employ civilian labor for this purpose. mr. president. i submit that with the intelligence of the chairman of the military affairs committee. with his familiarity with war department affairs. with the attention of the whole committee devoted to military affairs. the committee could have amended the bill so that these boys would have been required to keep their own quarters clean. they could have inserted in the bill a provision giving absolute authority to the commanders to discipline or dismiss boys who were taken in under their *jurisdiction. but not one word did they change. mr. president. not one thing did they do. in other words. the whole proposal was received in a most unsympathetic manner and referred back with an adverse report. mr. president. days and days. weeks. and months have been given at this session of congress by the committee on banking and currency. the committee on agriculture and forestry. and other committees to devising ways and means to protect the credit structure of the country. to protect the railroads. to protect industry. hours have been devoted to amending bills that were submitted. the senator from delaware has spent hours of his brilliant. intellectual mind on laws to devise ways and means for taking people out of bankruptcy. but. mr. president. the military affairs committee never spent one minute to take out of moral bankruptcy these boys who are in it. why this great distinction between taking care of human beings and taking care of dollars? why are dollars so much more precious than 100.000 boys tramping the country. looking for jobs? why is that more important? oh. mr. president. this is \"demagoguery.\" this. perhaps. is what sergeant at arms barry meant when he said there was demagoguery in the senate. that is what is always alleged when anyone gets up here to defend the underprivileged boys. girls. and men of this country. to fight for them. to do anything to save them from the ills of the economic depression. is demagoguery. to get up here and plead for billions to maintain the credit structure. and the income from bonds. is statesmanship. mr. president. i have no desire to be called a statesman. i am glad to be called a demagogue if standing up here for hours in defense of these 300.000 boys is demagoguery. the fifth objection submitted is as follows: the presence of a body of unenlisted boarders of indefinite number at each military post would greatly impede the performance of the regular duties of the army. mr. president. that is the weakest of them all! there was some foundation for the other excuses offered by the committee. but that is the weakest of all. \"unenlisted boarders \"i one hundred thousand or 88.000 of the best of the youth of the nation designated as \"unenlisted \"boarders.\" \"unenlisted boarders \"! taken in because of economic conditions which they played no part in bringing about. they are called \"unenlisted boarders \". and they. forsooth. mr. president. would \"greatly impede the performance of the regular duties of the army \"i pray. mr. president. what are those \"regular duties\" which are so much more important than looking after 88.000 of the best flower of the country? oh. it is true that they are not the sons of any members of this body. they do not belong to any fathers here. nor do they belong to the fathers who are members of the house of representatives. they belong to other fathers. who are just as fond of them as we in this body are fond of our children. and they are only \"unenlisted boarders \"i","mr. chairman. ladies. and gentlemen. yesterday memorial services were conducted for 19 members of the house and senate who have made their last pilgrimage to that eternal resting place from whose bourne no traveler ever returns. they are outward bound on a steamer called mystery. flying no flag. having no crew. no compass. but almighty god as their pilot. each of these souls had contributed his all .upon the altar of patriotic service to our republic. some dayand i hope it may be in the long distant futurethe genial. gracious. and lovable chairman of the committee on banking and currency. the hon. henry steagall. will make that journey. when his book of life will be opened and therein read the things that he has accomplished in behalf of the people whom he served. i know that no greater commendation could be given to him than having performed what in my opinion is the greatest service to our fellow citizens of this republic in having sponsored this economic and humanitarian bill \" to amend the national banking act and the federal reserve act. and to provide a guaranty fund for depositors in banks.\" this bill guaranteeing bank deposits would bring security to the mothers and fathers of our homes. establish confidence in business. commerce. and industry. release money from the hoarding places in which it is now being kept. and help thaw out the frozen confidence found everywhere throughout the united states against those who run the banking system of our country. what is the commodity in which banks deal? it is money. money is the medium of exchange. it bears the same relationship to society in the material world that blood does to the human body. it lives through circulation. money represents the frozen labor of the past. the liquid flow of the present. .and the only thing we look forward to in our old age for protection and help. to protect it we place it in banks. there are two kinds of banks: federal banks. supervised by the national government. and state banks. controlled by the state authorities. there are 20.000 banks in the united states. the greatest number of these are state banks. for the years 1921 to the year 1931. 7.800 banks failed with deposits of over $2.000.000.000. according to the annual report of the comptroller of the currency for 1931. the average amount of recovery to depositors through liquidation was 88.4 per cent. the american bankers association journal of february. 1931. shows 90 per cent of this amount was recovered to depositors. while the bankers monthly of february. 1932. shows 88.4 per cent returned to depositors. if we had had a guaranty of bank deposits during the last 10 years. no home would have been impaired. no business would have been destroyed. no runs on banks would have taken place. and no hoarding. in which billions of dollars have been taken from circulation in our country. would have occurred. confidence in our banks would have remained. business would have been stabilized. and the causes that are responsible for our economic depression would have been sought for in order to prevent their future recurrence. mr. chairman. ladies. and gentlemen. we have life insurance. accident insurance. health insurance. burglary insurance. fire insurance. why not bank insurance? is it safer to say to the people of the united states that we can insure everything in our country. but we can not insure banks? why. for four years i was president of a large national bank in new york city. and learned that every dollar that is placed in most of our banks by the government. by the state. and by the city or municipality has to be protected by securing to these groups collateral securities in the form of bonds. federal reserve notes. and other big board securities. if the government. the state. and the city insist upon a guaranty of their deposits in our banks. and seek preferential consideration for themselves. why should we not secure protection for the depositor? this bill will be instrumental in protecting and developing the small banks throughout our country. it will compel the government and state banks to observe more rigidly the conduct of bankers. and see that only those who are wellqualified by training. education. and culture in banking shall be permitted to run the banks of our country. instead of allowing the irresponsible and indiscreet people who are not conversant with banking to engage in that profession. out of 8.000 banks that failed. five out of six were state banks. that shows that national banks give greater security and protection to their depositors than do state banks. that is due chiefly to the fact that there are 48 different kinds of laws in the various states of our union. state banks have wider latitude in loans they are permitted to give. politics enters more in the extension of credit in state banks than in national banks. if i had my way. there would be only one banking system. and that is a national banking system. to which all banks could belong and in which all laws would be uniform. and the scales of justice would balance fairly and squarely to all those who were members of this system. the passage of this bill. therefore. would be instrumental in encouraging the organization and development of banks by making investments in banking stock more attractive. it would provide a stricter method of examination. better management. and. above all. protect every dollar of every depositor in every bank throughout the united states. in order to remove the great loss of confidence that has spread like wildfire throughout the united states against the banking system of our republic. this fear could easily be removed by guaranteeing to every depositor that his money would be safeguarded. that his home would be protected. and that his lifes savings would be conserved. and that business would not have to worry. when engaged in commerce. industry. or agriculture. that its money would be dissipated through the indiscretion of those who have been controlling our funds in the banks of the united states. let us therefore restore business. agriculture. commerce. and public confidence by passing the steagall bank guaranty bill. which. in my opinion. is one of the most constructive. liberal.- and progressive measures that has ever been brought before the congress of the united states.","we return to the discussion of the interpellations. m. margaine has the floor. in order to develop his interpellation. m. margaine. my colleagues will be kind enough to permit me. in the interests of clarity. to which i am particularly attached. to define in the most precise manner possible the position which i wish to take in this debate. i will not examine the basis of the proposal of mr. hoover. just as mr. hoover can do nothing without his congress. so the french government. since the young plan is the result of a law. can do nothing without parliament. i will. then. wait for the proposed legal bill in order to discuss the basis. what i should like to examine today is the entirely novel situation resulting from the abrupt intervention of mr. hoover. there are. to begin with. surrounding that intervention. particular circumstances. certain obscurities. which i hope the government in time will be so good as to undertake to elucidate. the ambassador of the united states called tuesday evening to state to the president of the council that there had been no discussion preliminary to the intervention of mr. hoover. if the heads of states have sometimes a language which is somewhat brutal. diplomats. on the other hand. have a language which is particularly flexible. for. indeed. there are certain facts which one can not do otherwise than to underline and which do not completely harmonize with such a declaration. mr. mellon disembarked in england on the 16th. the following morning he took care to make a declaration in which he stated that he was making a purely private journey. his only object being to pass some days with his son. a student at the university of cambridge. nevertheless. that same day the official newspaperi may well call it that--of the labor government. the daily herald. explained that the american minister had come to europe because mr. hoover was convinced that it was necessary to do something in regard to what concerned the war debts if one wished to avert a collapse disastrous for american financial interests. the paper added that mr. hoover had in mind the idea of a suspension for two years of all payments of reparations and war debts. as this subject had been abundantly treated at chequers between the english and the german ministers. it seems to me impossible that there had not been. between chequers and the departure of mr. mellon. negotiations. comunications. between the american government and the english government. the least that one could say is that the facts show that the newspaper. the daily herald. was particularly well informed. on the other side. mr. mills. assistant secretary of the treasury of the united states. saw the ambassador from england to the united states on the morning of june 20. it was after this visit that he returned to see mr. hoover and that the communication was made. i have difficulty in believing that the ambassador from england was summoned at that moment in order to be advised of a matter of which he knew not the first word. after the communications whose certitude i have just made manifest. consequently. for my part. until proof of the contraryand i will presently return to itthere were. in regard to the facts which have surprised us. conversations covering 20 days or so between the english and american governments. contrary to what evilintentioned characters have claimed. mr. hoover is far from being an impulsive person. he is a man whose character is well known. he studies much. he reflects much. all his past is the proof of it. if he has placed france before an accomplished fact. it is because he was told that it would be necessary for him so to act in order to succeed quickly and well. but mr. hoover has done much more than that. and he has certainly not done it lightly: he has broken with the traditional policy of the united states. permit me to emphasize the importance of such an attitude on the part of the president of the united states. the american. the man in the street. does not trouble himself with questions of external policy. for him europe is a small continent in which little nations. so numerous that one can not remember all their names. engage in rivalry. are jealous of one another. and fight. instead of bringing themselves into agreement as the states of the great republic of the united states have done. the man in the street is satisfied. so far as external policy is concerned. to know that his government is remaining faithful to certain doctrines which i will summarily recall: the monroe doctrine. the doctrine of washington. the doctrine of john hay. quite recently the government of the united states. with a certain solemnity. on several occasions. declared that it would not concern itself in european affairs. permit me to recall some of the circumstances in which this affirmation has been made. when the europeans asked the government of the united states to have itself represented at the genoa conference. the american government officially replied that it did not wish to take cogni-. zance of the affairs of europe. in 1922. when lord balfour sent the wellknown note in which he proposed the annulment of war debts. the american government replied that the affairs of europe did not concern it. that the states of europe had. to america. certain debts of an exclusively commercial character and that it would discuss them with each of the countries separately. i can not admit that the executive power of a country which is attached to such an extent to traditiona! doctrines could have overturned all its traditions simply because mr. mellon. making a pleasure journey. had a conversation. by accident. with mr. macdonald. no. there islet us say it and let us know how to see itsomething quite different. besides the man in the street of whom i have been speaking. there are american business men who have dealings with europe and. above all. with germany. and who. since a very short time ago. have had serious reasons for disquietude. in the united states itself there have been some characteristic occurrences. with which the press has concerned itself and of which i shall permit myself to cite some examples showing that in that country there is an internal evolution which is not without a certain gravity. all these events. of which i shall cite some. have been set forth by the democratic press. recently in the pittsburgh basin at westland a thousand striking miners fought with mounted police. a policeman was beaten. his comrades fired. two miners were wounded. at ellsworth a veritable battle took place between the miners and the police of the coal companies. the women and children fought with particular fury. in kentucky. at evarts. miners and mine police had a pitched battle. there were killed on one side and on the other. in the state of west virginia 1.500 miners came to charles town and marched through the streets. demanding bread for their children. the democratic press has seized upon these facts. it denounces the activities of the magnates of the industry. and since his name is spread throughout its columns. i may well remark that at their head it inscribes mr. mellon. it was necessary for the united states that this situation should not grow worse. and it would have grown worse if in germany events had entered upon an acute phase. it is at bottom the german situation which is the origin of everything. i shall not return to the explanations given in this very place at the end of 1929. before the government left for the. hague. when we put it on its guard against the constitution of a germanamerican industrial bloc. which was beginning to take on a certain solidity. . germany. thanks to the formation of this bloc. made important appeals to american capital. the statistics show us that from 1926 to 1930 the public emissions of germany abroadalmost all in americaattained the sum of six milliards and a half of reichsmarks. and this sum does not include the direct investments of americans in german industry. i find. in the same statistics. that in 1928 the total of foreign capital invested in that manner in germany was four milliards two hundred and fifty millions of relchsmarks. in 1929 two milliards seven hundred and fifty millions. certain american financiers some months ago began to be alarmed by this constant outflow. their apprehensions are revealed in the fact that in 1930 the capital funds thus placed in germany barely attained the sum of half a milliard. on the other hand. germany has made a great deal of noise about her budgetary difficulties. one saw m. hilferding give way to m. moldenhauer. then m. moldenhauer give way to m. dietrich. always because of the impossibility of establishing a budget. all this in the space of eight months. in spite of all these changes the budget could not be established save by making use of article 48 of the constitution of weimar. there was a legal decree on the 1st of august. 1930. another on the 1st of december. 1930. and a third quite recently. all these facts have powerfully shaken the confidence of the americans. just at the moment in which mr. mellon arrived in england the reichsbank proceeded to enormous sales of gold and of exchanges. it sold in the first fortnight of june one milliard fifty millions of reichsmarks. keeping only one milliard six hundred millions. the legal reserve of the reichsbank was very close to being reached. during these same days in berlin panic reigned. in the banks one sold. not banknotes--they had no more of thembut promises of banknotes to be delivered in a fortnight. all this caused superficial observers to believe that germany was struggling in the midst of grave budgetary difficulties. i say \"superficial observers.\" for if the americans had given themselves the trouble to read over the reports of their compatriot. mr. parker gilbert. notably the last. which is of may. 1930. they would there have seen the affirmation. many times repeated. that the germans will put order into their budget when they wish. [very good! very good!] but they do not wish it yet. because in order to make an end of the payments of the war debts it is necessary that their budget should remain in disorder.

[various movements.] consider. on the other hand. building workers. at all times in germany these workers have never worked in the winter. even on the interior of houses. and their salaries have always been calcu-","this is a conservation measure. and when i say conservation. it is in the best sense that the term implies. the purpose of this legislation is to protect and preserve as far as possible in their natural state. the lakes and streams in a territory lying between the north shore of lake superior and the canadian border. this territory is largely a wilderness. one of the last great wildernesses left in this country. and the only one in the north central states. within this area is the superior national forest. where the forest service. through proper forest management. is slowly bringing back the pine forests that have been depleted by mans wasteful methods and the ravages of the elements. this bill does not in any way change our forest laws. except in so far as it regulates the cutting of trees along the shores of lakes and streams within this area. no one can overdstimate the economic value of a wise policy of reforestation. to destroy our forests and make no provision for their restoration is not only stupid but indefensible in a civilized nation. the forest resources of this section are not its only assets. however. the many beautiful lakes and streams within this area have a scenic and recreational value that i believe should bd conserved for the use of the public. and that is the reason for this legislation. north of the border in canada is a similar territory that has been set aside as the quetico provincial park. it is hoped that in the near future these two areas by international- agreement will be combined as a great recreational center for both nations. the american legion and the canadian legion in their national conventions have expressed themselves as strongly in favor of this plan and have urged that it be in the nature of a memorial to the world war veterans of both nations. this legislation is necessary before any steps can be taken to carry out this plan. this legislation sets up a policy so far as this region is concerned that will protect it against hasty or unnecessary alleged industrial development. it does not close the area against any future development of this kind. but leaves it to the wisdom of future congresses to determine whether or not the policy herein established shall be changed. the northern border between minnesota and ontario is formed by a chain of lakes unsurpassed in their beauty. with wooded shore lines. and containing thousands of wooded islands. there is nothing on the continent comparable with these border waters. the reason why there is an emergency that makes the passage of this bill necessary at this time is due to a pending application to dam these lakes for the benefit of one concern. this application was made to the canadian government and is now before the international joint commission. if the project should go through. these lakes will be ruined so far as the scenic beauty is concerned. the shore lines and islands will be submerged. and an irreparable damage will be done to these beautiful waterways without any compensating benefit to the public. it is the purpose of this bill. therefore. to protect these lakes aifd their tributaries against further wasteful exploitation. these lakes consist of two main groupsthose that flow west to rainy lake and those that flow east and south to lake superior. they are intimately connected in one great network of canoe routes. which have been used since time immemorial as a link between the great lakes and the canadian northwest. they lie in a wild. wooded. glacial region unsuitable for agriculture and too rugged for settlement. in later years they have become the mecca for a rising tide of tourists from all parts of the country. and are now recognized as one of the supreme recreational attractions of the continent. tile bill would keep inviolate a margin of timber along the shores of federal lands and would guard the wooded shores. islands. beaches. waterfalls. and rapids which give the region its charm against the flooding caused by power development. it seeks to protect not the border lakes onlynot a mere thoroughfarebut the tributaries as wellan entire lakelandfor the health and enjoyment of all our people. in order to protect these lakes it is necessary to reserve and protect the federal lands that lie around them. many of the lakes lie within the boundaries of the present superior national forest created more than 20 years ago by president roosevelt. many of the most beautiful lakes lie outside these boundaries. it was necessary. therefore. to withdraw the remaining federal lands that lie scattered about through the entire lakeland. these are in small parcels and amount to only 26.800 acres. as compared to some 850.000 acres of federal lands already within superior national forest. for purposes of description in withdrawing these federal lands in our bill. to make it as simple and intelligible as possible. an arbitrary line was drawn straight across cook. lake. and st. louis counties. in which the main lakes are located. it was placed at the north boundary of section 60. just far enough south to include all the main lakes and their tributaries. north of this line. by section 1 of our bill. all federal lands are withdrawn from entry or appropriation and have. in fact. been so withdrawn for more than two years by executive order in aid of the pending legislation. all federal lands. including the superior national forest. comprise less than onethird of the lands north of this line in these three counties. the rest are private or state lands. mostly private. many of them tax delinquent. though the provisions of our bill apply only to federal lands. there has undoubtedly been some sincere alarm among private landowners lest the bill in some unexplained way restrict or harm their own holdings. these fears. we are convinced. are without foundation. nevertheless. if they can be allayed without harm to the bill. it is highly desirable to do so. it is for this reason that sponsors of the bill have consented to a change in the original arbitrary line that was drawn to mark the area. in which federal lands are to be reserved. by agreement with the congressman from the district it is proposed to substitute a more elaborate line for the present simple one. thus conforming more closely to the outlines of the lakeland itself. the new line remains the same in cook and lake counties but leaves out some 36 townships in st. louis county. in so doing. sponsors of the bill feel that we are sacrificing none of its original scope or effectiveness. the townships omitted contain no federal lands and practically no lakes. the only two lakes of importancevermilion and burntsideare specifically protected by the wording of the agreement. thus. one objection that has been raised against the bill can no longer be raised and. happily. the result is without damage to the purposes of the bill. i make this explanation for the sake of those who may have had any sincere fears lest the bill harm their private property and for those who are even more concerned that nothing le done to impair the effectiveness of the protection granted to these wonderful lakes. i should also like to explain very briefly one other feature of the bill. there is an amendment to the bill exempting from its provisions any proposed power development for which an application was pending under terms of the federal water power act on or before january 1. 1928. there is9 only one such application of recordone by the minnesota power &amp; light co. for a permit to store water in gabbro and bald eagle lakes. these lakes lie inside of superior national forest and are one of its main smaller resources in beauty and recreational value. the power compalny is a public utility of duluth. the proposed project is exactly the sort of development that the bill is intended to prevent. the company. however. already has had two small dams on these lakes for the last six years. dams. by the way. built without authority of the federal power commission. the state of minnesota. which likewise has state lands flooded by the same project. has protested vigorously. similar trespasses have occurred in the region previously. only such legislation as now proposed can prevent their recurrence and the final ruin of the whole lakeland. sponsors of the bill are in determined opposition to the granting of any further rights to the power company on these lakes. the company. however. in 1926. two years subsequent to the building of the present dams. applied to the federal power colnission for permission not only to maintain the present structures but to extend them and raise the water 14 feet farther. this application had been pending for two years at the time the present bill was first introduced in congress. eminent jurists are of the opinion that the application must be regarded in the same light as an application to file upon a piece of federal land. unless an exelption is made. the proposed legislation might therefore be regarded as retroactive. it is for that reason solely that the amendment has been accepted. in so doing the sponsors wish to make clear that they are admitting no rights of the company. setting no precedents. and making no exceptions to the principles of the bill. and it is their understanding that this is clearly the purpose of the committee on the public lands in recommending the bill as amended. the fact that this amendment is in the bill does not prevent those who are opposed to this project prosecuting the case against the company. the bill is a declaration of public policy in recognition of the national recreational value of the lakes and streams lying in the area of superior national forest. with the idea of preserving these natural waterways it lays down two simple principlesfirst. that there shall be no connercial cutting of timber on lands of the united states within a margin of 400 feet along lakes and streams. and second. that there shall be no further alteration of water levels affecting lands of the united states except by specific authority of congress. the bill does not enlarge or change the boundaries of superior national forest. though it is true that it protects shore lines of lakes and streams in a somewhat larger area. it does not apply to private or state lands. all such lands lying in the area remain as before. it does not restrict the use or occupancy of private or state lands. whether for agriculture. mining. recreation. or other developments. or in any way alter their present status or their availability for taxation. it does not provide for the acquisition of any more lands. that matter is already covered by the menaryclarke law. it does not seek to create a new national park or to curtail the systematic managelent of nationalforest lands for economic uses. it carries no appropriation. at present the burden of proof for safeguarding the region is upon the public. it is assumed that. if commercial development is feasible. it should be permitted and encouraged. from the public point of view. however. the value of the social uses of the area and particularly of the wooded shores and other natural features of the lakes and streams far outweighs the value of their strictly commercial uses. this higher social value is immeasurable but none the less fundamentally economic. its loss would be irreparable. the bill is urgently needed (1) to guard the lake land against further damaging power developments. and (2) as a formulation of policy to reinforce the forest service in maintaining a proper balance between the larger national uses of the forest for recreation and private demands for commercial utilization. the intention is to place the burden of proof for changes where it belongs. on those who would exploit what remains. and to do so immediately before further harmful encroachments can occur.","mr. speaker and gentlemen of the house. on lost friday. the 17th. a distinguished colleague called attention to the recent hospital catastrophe at cleveland. ohio. in which 125 lives were lost. and suggested that it had some connection with gas warfare. he deplored the fact that our government refused to approve the geneva protocol outlawing the use of gas in war and intimated that this course was influenced by the american legion. and that the american legion lacked understanding and comprehension. i want this house and the people of the country to know that the american legion has studied this question for years and understands it too well to permit without protest the hamstringing of our army. the crippling of our national defense. the members of the american legion realize better than any other body of our citizens the horrors of war. they are opposed to war. all kinds of war. not only war by gas but war by all the frightful weapons that kill. tear. rend. maim. and mutilate. but give us security that any such agreement as the geneva protocol will be observed by foreign nations. give us the assurance that the american people will not court punishment for the folly of putting naive faith in what experience should teach us that others. under stress. may regard but as a \" scrap of paper.\" and there will be nothing but cooperation. we challenge the proponents of the geneva protocol to furnish a safeguard to the american people. a people who refuse to make treaties than can not be enforced nor kept. the following resolution relative to the chemical warfare service was unanimously adopted at the omaha convention in 1925 of the american legion: the american legion expresses its continued interest in the proper development of our chemical warfare service as a necessary and essential part of our national defense program and deprecates any movement to interfere with or handicap its present work and usefulness to our country. it was about this time there was some discussion in the senate on chemical warfare and the geneva protocol. which was given very careful consideration at the philadelphia convention in 1926. where the following resolution was adopted and at which convention. i wish to call your attention. ham71ton fish was in attendance: whereas a conference of the representatives of various nations was held at geneva. switzerland. during the summer of 1925 for the purpose of discussing and arriving at some definite understanding be-. tween nations on international trade in arms and ammunition. at which conference the american representative. mr. burton. produced a separate memorandum providing for the elimination of chemical warfare in its entirety. resulting in a protocol doing away with chemical warfare by all countries which would ratify the protocol. although the use of chemical warfare in time of war was wholly outside the agenda for the conference. and whereas the american legion in national convention assembled at omaha. nebr.. in october. 1925. took cognizance of this geneva protocol and adopted resolutions opposing its ratification by the united states senate. these resolutions were forwarded to the senate committee on foreign relations. which had the protocol under consideration. the\" foreign relations committee. however. favorably reported the protocol to the senate on june 9. 1926. the legion then immediately addressed a letter to each united states senator opposing ratification of the protocol and requesting the senators to vote against it. on july 1. 1926. the protocol was brought up and debated in the senate in executive session. the senate neither ratified nor rejected the protocol. but reached an agreement to defer action on it until the session of congress which convenes on december 6. 1926. and whereas the american legion believes firmly that the acceptance of this protocol by the united states would constitute a distinct backward step in our national defense. especially in view of the refusal of the congress to grant sufficient appropriations to maintain our treaty navy and to maintain our army at the strength contemplated by the national defense act of 1920. under which circumstances the legion can not help but view with alarm any further inroads upon our ability to defend ourselves in time of national peril: now. therefore. be it resolved. that the american legion in national convention assembled at philadelphia october 14. 1926. ratifies the attitude of the omaha convention upon this vital subject and approves the measures taken by the national legislative committee in opposition to the ratification of the geneva protocol. those who fought in the world war know only too well the great handicap our soldiers would be under if. in the event of another war. we would not be allowed the use of gas in offensive and defensive combat. while our enemies. on the contrary. would be either allowed to use it freely or might make use of it regardless of conventions entered into on the subject. as far back as 1899 germany. france. great britain. austriahungary. russia. and japan entered into a solemn agreement at the hague \"to abstain from the use of projectiles the sole object of which is the diffusion of asphyxiating or deleterious gases.\" again in 1907. at the same place. these same powers entered into a contract forbidding the employment of \" poison or poisonous arms.\" regardless of these conventions poison gas was used in the world war and. in the opinion of the american legion. will be used in any major future war regardless of articles to the contrary. this opinion is backed up by the fact that a number of the great powers declined to sign the geneva gas protocol. the issue seems to the american legion to be whether the united states shall agree to surrender an effective arm which might well promise victory against an antagonist. when past experience shows that the antagonist would probably employ this arm with deadly effect against us. experience has demonstrated that when a nation determines on war. or is forced to accept war by the aggression of another. it may use every means and every arm available to achieve victory. even if all other great powers had already ratified this protocol. the american legion is aware that past experience demonstrates that it would be a hazardous undertaking for the united states also to ratify it. but where a number of the great powers are not even considering the ratification of the protocol. the sheer folly of affirmative action on this question by the united states senate should be apparent to all. and be it further resolved. that the american legion exert its full strength to prevent ratification of the protocol by the senate at the coming session of congress. and that the national legislative committee be hereby instructed to take vigorous action in accordance with this resolution. and forward a copy of this resolution to each member of the united states senate. . contrary to the statement made.. the legion has continued very much its interest in this subject. and at the paris conven- tion (1927) unanimously adopted the following resolution: resolved. that the american legion reaffirms the action taken at its omaha and philadelphia conventions in urging support of the chemical warfare service and in opposing the adoption of the geneva gas protocol. and at the san antonio convention (1928) the following resolution was unanimously adopted: resolved. that we urge the continued support of the chemical warfare service and reiterate our position in opposition to the geneva gas protocol. a parallel was drawn between the awful explosion at cleveland which struck down so many of our citizens and the use of gas in war. i wish to correct the errors which were made and to combat the national hysteria aroused against gas by saying that the cleveland disaster can in no way be connected with gas warfare. let me first reconstruct for you the accident as it took place at cleveland. so far as it is possible to do so from the facts at hand. it is an established fact that nitrocellulose film in a confined space where there is an insufficient supply of oxygen will generate upon heating large amounts of highly combustible gases. these gases are probably for the most part carbon monoxide. hydrogen. and nitrogen oxides. in the xray laboratory of a busy and important clinic there will be stored large quantities of xray filn. both exposed and unexposed. exposed film is presumably kept in file cases. probably of rugged steel construction. there will be many of these films. for they represent records of many years work. it is not difficult to see how combustion started in the first place. nitrate filn ignites at a very low temperatureso much so that it has been recommended that steam or hot water coils should not be permitted within the vaults used for the storage of filn unless very great care is given to keeping all film from direct contact with the coils and taking precautions against overheating the room. overheating of the file cases in which the film was stored might have been caused by a broken steampipe. the spark from a loose electrical fixture or from some other means might have started the trouble.. it is not necessary. however. to devote any time to how the fire started. as soon as some of the filn gets going. the heat generated is considerable and it is not long before the great mass of film is burning. gas is generated at once. the xray room is soon filled with a mixture of gas so that sooner or later an explosive mixture results. the flame or heat causes the explosion. great volumes of the gas pour out of the room and into the building through ventilators. up stairways. out into the main rotunda. and another explosion may readily occur. these gases which are rapidly filling the building are extremely poisonous. the poisonous effect of.carbon monoxide is now well knowfi even to the layman. the poisonous effect of nitrogen peroxide. the brownishyellow gas which is definitely a product of the incomplete combustion of nitrocellulose film. has been recognized for many years. it is this brownishyellow coloration which seems to have characterized the cleveland disaster. the deaths may have occurred from carbon monoxide or from nitrogen peroxide. or both. either one is sufficiently deadly. nitrogen peroxide. according to mellor (modern inorganic chemistry. longmans. green &amp; co.. 1927) is a poisonous gas. and soon produces headache and sickness if but a little is present in the atmosphere. it is not combustible. but it is an energetic oxidizing agent. now the conditions that were favorable in this case for a large number of deaths from nitrogen peroxide and carbon monoxide poisoning are conditions that could not possibly be realized in war time. the fact that carbon monoxide and nitrogen peroxide are not useful as war gases bears out this statement. in the cleveland disaster you have large volumes of gas being generated in a closed space. this could not be duplicated in war time except by accident. as a matter of fact. if one must draw a parallel between the cleveland clinic disaster and war. it is necessary to make the comparison with poisoning by the well sanctioned and highly respected high explosive since conditions in this case are identical: nitrate fihn is very similar in composition to smokeless powder and guncotton. it was the gases--carbon monoxide and nitrogen peroxideresulting from explosions from bombs and shells in the confined spaces of the belgian forts. which caused the deaths of many not injured by concussions and fragments. many a death occurred in dugouts from carbon monoxide gas. and on shipboard. and in coast defenses where the heavy longrange guns are fired. there are frequent cases of gas poisoning when proper ventilation does not carry off the deadly monoxide and nitrogen oxide fumes.","mr. chairman and members of the committee. i wish to call the attention of the members to a national and inlternationally wellknown policy of this government. namely: that the government shall always refrain from engaging in competitive business. to pursue such policy and attitude toward private business as shall not discourage. imt shall encourage it to seek investment in all lines of legitimate business. this policy of the government has always induced capital to be and continue active in all channels of legitimate enterprises both small and large. our statesmen and the press have taught these ideals and policies of government. the schools of our country have taught young men and women the science of economic business management. qualifying them to be selfreliant. aggressive business citizens. along with the equal liberties. opportunities. franchises. privileges. and immunities which are guaranteed by the government to its citizens to make them a proud-. patriotic. sovereign people in being active in governmental affairs are equal ecouragements. immunities. and assurances concerning business affairs. in fact. mr. chairman. the genius of our government lies in the interest it has shown for the making of a good citizenryan independent. selfreliant. resourceful. sagacious. and keenminded people. now. shall we be unappreciative of the great document. the constitiltion. and the purposes of our people in the operation of the government under it in such way as to virtually destroy its greatest worth. to rue the course which the nation has pursued toward private industry and enterprise. by our action in putting the government in business. shall we end a most enviable and exemplary career for our people and government? shall we take the first long stride toward communism? shall this government. merely because there exists within its territorial boundaries a site for a great power dam. and much capital is required to construct the dam. break away from our historical and most successful national policy and build this dam and operate the power project connected therewith? this government enterprise would only be a beginning of the government in business. there are many other attractive waterpower sites in the united states. the \" pork barrel\" nnd other lobbying methods by which this proposition may be put over can and will be adopted to put over similar enterprises throughout the united states. and when we once begin and complete the first and largest of all of these projects. five or seven states will have pledged their support to similar enterprises to especially benefit other sections of the country. when a number of them have been completed and put into operation by the government. more bureaus and their nefarious powers will have been added to the governments burdens. when the government thus gets well started into competitive industrial activities. private capital will retreat. then the government will have to continue in business. and we will have at least modilied communism with all of its unamericanism. i believe it was president harding who especially emphasized our national policy of staying out of business by saying. \"there should be more business in government and less government in business.\" this policy has up to the present time been stressed and followed by president coolidge. whether he will continue to adhere to it remains to be seen. the colorado river admittedly has never been and never will be a navigable stream in the sense that commerce by means of boats and ships will be conducted on it. no one seriously contends such a thing for it. so that there is no reason. no justice. no fairness. no truth in the assertion in the bill that the legislation is for improving the river for navigation. such statements are deceptive and misrepresentative. two other purposes for the legislation are set forth in the bill. one is to improve irrigation and reclamation. by many it is claimed that no greater number of acres will be irrigated should the plans of the bll be carried out. if that be true. the expenditure of millions of money merely to build a canal within the borders of the united states. making the water from the same river available in united states instead of in mexico to irrigate the same lands. would be money wasted. on the other hand. should it be desired to put under irrigation and cultivation additional lands. at a time when the farmers markets are destroyed by overproduction . at a time when the federal governnent has been endeavoring to discover a legislative method for securing the farmers a living market for their produce. then and in that event the legislation is ill advised and unwarranted. because surely everyone would say that the government shouldnot ttix its people to produce more farm produce when the farmers are already suffering from overproduction. there would be no common sense. no business economy in such a movement. another declared purpose of this legislation is flood control. it is estimated that the maximum appraised value of all the agricultural lands susceptible to injury from floods in the imperial valley is only $36.000.000. like everybody else who have purchased lands and moved upon them. the people who own and live upon the lands in the imperial valley are certainly not deserving of any more attention than other people throughout the united states who live upon lands threatened with flood daniage. does the government of the united states owe to the people of the imperial valley any greater obligation to protect them against floods than it does to people similarly situated in other parts of the country? we certainly think not. what are the facts concerning the flood peril to the inhabitants of the imperial valley? it is said there has been one overflow or flood inundation within time past 2i years. this one flood occurring in 1916. 12 years ago. while a few lives were lost. all were lost through their own individual carelessness. within the past four years the damage in money to the people in my district in the state of kansas has been fully as much if not more than the total value of the lands and property along the colorado river in the imperial valley. damages perhaps equally extensive have been done by floods in many different places throughout the united states within very recent years. and yet the congress is not undertaking to prevent the recurrence of such damages to the respective localities in the different parts of the united states. while it has recently enacted legislation to protect the flooded area along the lower mississippi river. a really and in truth navigable stream. over which the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction. yet in no case has the federal government undertaken to protect the lands and property in such a small area in any other part of the country. so that it can be truthfully said that the government is not proposing to enact the socalled boulder dam bill merely to protect the property and lands in the imperial valley against floods. the government surely would not be so unfair as to deny many other imperiled sections and people equal protection with those living in the imperial valley. so that we may truthfully say the purposes of this bill are not to improve navigation. are not for reclamation or irrigation purposes. and are not primarily for flood protection. but. on the other hand. the government has been especially superinduced by very objectionable lobbying to enact national legislation for special and local interests. specifically. the purposes are to provide a guaranty to southern california cities that they shall have an unlimited amount of water for municipal purposes and also to supply them incidentally with what would be termed \"cheap power.\" although this is probably merely imaginary. because it is extremely doubtful that cheaper power can be furnished without great loss to the government. it is a pertinent question. mr. chairman. to the american people. to ask how much this great venture will cost the people. we may say from all expert opinions which have been advanced that the completion of the structure. together with power plants. will cost between one hundred and twentyfive and two hundred and fifty millions of dollars. the plan provides that guaranties in the way of bonds or contracts shall be put up by and frein the five or six states guaranteeing to the government the purchase of water or power in sufficient quantities and at sufficient prices to insure the return to the governmen4 of the cost price of the enterprise plus 4 per cent interest thereon within 50 years. in many parts of the country money is worth 8 per cent interest. yet. the people throughout the country indirectly loan these hundreds of millions of money to the government that it virtually gives to four or five states for their special benefit. can it be shown to the people who really pay these taxes how it will benefit them? it will be a great detriment to them. it is a great detriment to the government. the fact that there is a great dam site possibly available to the government and the further fact that the government is able to build the dam though the government does not need it are certainly not good reasons for the passage of the bill. i do not believe. mr. chairman. that any sufficient and enforceable contracts can be made by either or all of the states or the municipalities within the states especially interested to assure the repayment of the money involved with 4 per cent interest. if this proposition were submitted to the respective taxpayers throughout the united states for their approval. with the understanding that they would begin respectively paying their proportionate share of this $200.000.000 with the first payment by the government on the project. realizing that the money to be advanced by them would be returned at the end of 50 years. with 4 per cent interest thereon. not 5 per cent of the people of the united states would indorse the project. and yet. how lightly we as members of congress look upon this mammoth venture. it seems to me that we should think of where these hundreds of millions of dollars are to come from. of just what class of people are to furnish all of this money to the government. mr. chairman. it comes from the farmers. every one of them. it comes from the miners. the mill workers. the railroad laborers. the organized and unorganized labor. it comes from every citizen who purchases food. clothing. or anything else required by him or her in their everyday life. these are the people who through labor. sacrifices. and denials contribute to these huindreds of millions which the congress in unbridled prodigality gives away to private and semiprivate purposes and uses. to sections of the country and to people in certain localities. to whom tie government is under no obligation whatsoever. the government is under no obligation to furnish \"a particular city with a supply of water. such a thing has never been done so far as we know. and so we are taking the peoples money by the millions and giving it to prosperous. growing cities. and communities. one objection to the government getting into the waterpower business is that labor in coal mines. in producing coal to be used in producing electric power in cities. will be displaced and the labor in the coal mines will be out of employment by the use of water power. the miner. therefore. who would have a share of these millions of taxes to pay would be robbed by the government of employment and business in which to get the money to pay his share of the tax burden. if this bill is not unconstitutional it surely ought to be. while the government is thinking of making a nice present in the form of hundreds of millions of dollars to people the government is under no obligation to. should not we think of the resulting hardships that we are imposing upon the people who have it to pay? is there anything just. is there anything equitable. is there anything fair done by this bill to those who have this money to pay? no. on the other hand. it is miscarried justice and equity. one of the representatives from the city of los angeles. in support of this bill. says that los angeles is prepared to raise a hundred million of dollars to promote its interest for more water. if that be true. why not allow the state of california. or nevada. or wyoming. or utah. or colorado. or new mexico. or arizona. or collectively or any other way they choose to raise the necessary money to build and operate this dam. instead of involving the federal government in the enterprise? if this tremendous dam. more than 650 high. should by earthquake or imperfect construction give way turning the great body of water loose. who would be responsible for all the terrible damages produced from such a calamity? why. the federal government. of course. then. instead of our having protected somebody against floods we would have brought the floods upon them. the federal government would be liable. in all probability. especially if through any negligence and carelessness the dam should break and the damages follow. oh. mr. chairman. there is nothing in this bill but demerit. injustice. unfairness. unconstitutionality. a violation of our national policy of keeping the government out of business. great damage to industry and the people of the country. but. ultimately. when the taxpayers money has been wasted. they will never get even the interest back. much less the principal. and when the time comes that the people rebel against the government being in business this dam will be given away or sold for a song. it is the most illadvised venture upon which the government has ever ventured. it will either lead us into a communistic government or else we will give it away and sustain its entire loss. and the latter would be preferable to the former.","by request of the committee. i give below a fuller statement of a few of the more important agricultural conditions and activities as i found them in europe. i hope i have discussed the principal points desired further explained by the committee. denmark bound up with the tariff. commercial treaties. and high cost of living. the problem of agriculture in europe represents an enigma by no means easy to understand. the most ejcient american organizations aiding me to unravel and to understand this question are the officers of the american commercial attachds representing the united states department of commerce. their trade commissioners follow the situation closely and are able to render a very high order of service to the american student of agricultural marketing. the farmers of denmark. as i have said. are especially well organized and are in control of their own business. the government merely acquiescing in the activities of the marketing associations. the development which during and since the last quarter of the nineteenth century has taken place in danish agriculture has been due primarily. not to say entirely. to the efforts and resourcefulness of the danish farmer himself. and only to a very limited extent to. direct assistance given to agriculture by the national government. government assistance to danish agriculture during the early years of the modern development took the form chiefly of an acquiescent and willing attitude. the government. when necessary. acted to remove existing barriers to the organization and development of cooperative agricultural associations for production and sales purposes. and provided freedom from taxation and other liberties and privileges for these organizations. of direct aid in the form of subsidies. valorization. or marketing assistance. practically nothing was done or has since been done. among the few contributions of this type are the following: 1. appropriations for agricultural attachss abroad. 2. an export subsidy of 5.000.000 crowns. available in the form of export guaranties and export loans. 3. reduction of railway freight rates on certain agricultural products destined for export. the first item mentionedestablishment of agricultural attaches abroadis of rather old standing. there being. however. but a few of these posts in existence. the total expenditures in this connection. it appears from the budget. is about 225.000 crowns ($60.000). the second item. export credits in the form of government guaranties against loss on export shipments and extension of government credits to the extent of 5.000.000 crowns. is of comparatively recent origin. having come into force about a year ago. this system was organized with export to russia in view. but has apparently not proved of very great value to the danish farming community. as indicated by the fact that only a small fraction of the sum made available has been used. the third mentioned form of direct government assistance to agriculture. reduction of railway freight rates on agricultural products destined for export. has been in vogue for some time. it is. however. in effect more an agreement between a large shipperagricultureand a large transportation organizationthe state railwaysthan a form of government assistance to agriculture. besides the three abovementioned forms of direct \"marketing assistance.\" the presentday government aid to danish agriculture takes the

practically all of it for agricultural education in production. agriculture. as is generally known. occuies a dominating position in the danish economic scheme of things and the agrarian party. the left. has fora long period been the largest single political party in the danish parliament. this party. out of consideration for the export interests of agriculture. has always supported the freetrade principle and domestic tariff rates have therefore never played any important part in the development of danish agriculture. norway . norwegian agriculture. owing to the unfavorable geographic and climatic conditions. has always labored under a handicap. especially. as far as grain raising is concerned. this fact. together with a natural desire to further national selfsufficiency and independence of foreign sources. has had a strong influence upon the norwegian governments attitude toward agriculture in the past as well as at present. and has led to the enactment of various laws intended to encourage domestic grain raising and agriculture in general. the most important example of government assistance to norwegian agriculture is found in the socalled \" grain monopoly \" enacted largely as a war measure in 1914. but kept in force until the present time more or less as a direct subsidy to norwegian grain growers. what the monopoly has done and still does is in effect this: it encourages domestic grain growers by paying to the farmer a price for his grain corresponding to the world market level for imported grain. a price which the domestic grain. because of its rather inferior quality. due to adverse climatic conditions. could not otherwise obtain. the monopoly after having been in operation for about 12 years is now to be replaced by another arrangement authorized by law of june 16. 1926. this law. which will go into effect before july. 1927. provides that the import and sale of grain and flour (except oats. of which 15.000 tons must be purchased each year by the government) shall be free to all who secure authority for such importation and sale from the appropriate government department and who have fulfilled the requirements regarding purchase of a fixed ratio of domestic grain. the law further provides that the state shall purchase all norwegian grain fit for human consumption at prices which correspond to the price of imported grain f. o. b. norwegian port. without duty. imported grain shall pay a duty of 4 ocre per kilo and the state shall further pay to each farmer a \" trygd \" (subsidy) of 4 ocre per kilo for homegrown grainup to 200 kilos per year per personground by the farmer for his own use. of other provisions of the new law the following are of chief interest. 1. domestic grain bought by the state is accepted at the same price at all centers designated by the state and for freight from outlying districts to these points the state shall pay a certain compensation. 2. the \"corn trygd\" of 4 oere per kilo used in own household is payable to the farmer upon presentation of receipt from millers showing amount of grain ground for the farmer. 3. importers of grain must buy domestic grain or flour in a certain ratio to the imported amounts. the norwegian food administration. which now has charge of the temporary import monopoly of grain and flour. was organized under the authority of a government decree of august 4. 1914. which authorized the establishment of a government foodstuffs commission. the foundation of the foodstuffs commission was in the decree defined as follows 1. to regulate the countrys supply of grain. flour. and other articles of necessity. among which coal and coke. 2. to regulate the distribution to the various districts of the country and the prices on the various articles. the government foodstuffs commission was abolished in september. 1916. and it was decided that the matters which had been taken care of by the commission were to be transferred to a temporary government food administration. the difficulties which were involved in supplying sufficient food for the countrys needs at that time (during the war blockade) necessitated the rationing of the most important foodstuffs. under these conditions a decree was published making the import of grains. flour. and sugar a government monopoly. after the close of the war all commodities. with the exception of grains. the importation of which had been controlled by the government during the difficult war years. were released as soon as conditions permitted. the sugar monopoly being abolished in the government food administration is therefore now only in charge of the importation of grains and flour. which still continues as a government monopoly. and the present activities and functions of the food administration are therefore confined solely to this monopoly. the functions of the monopoly: during the war years. and as long as it was difficult to secure the necessary supplies of foodstuffs. the most important function of the monopoly was to take care of the countrys supply and maintain as large reserve stocks as necessary. next in order came the consideration of the domestic production of grain and the state effort for the promotion of agriculture. when there no longer existed any danger of shortage of foodstuffs it became the most important duties of the monopoly to extend the cultivation of grain in norway. maintain reserve stocks of grain. and to care for the purchase and importation of the quantities required by the country. according to the decision of the storthing the monopoly must purchase all rye. wheat. and barley of good quality offered by domestic producers at prices corresponding to those at which foreign grain can be delivered to the producers. the difference thus arising between the prices paid for norwegian grains and that paid for imported grains has declined considerably. and now only amounts to 2.75 kronen per 100 kilos. the purchases of the monopoly. as it appears from the foregoing. does not include oats. this article. however. as products thereof. is subject to an import embargo. and dispensation for import of this article is not granted. in so far as norwegian oats can be obtained at prices which in comparison with prices on foreign oats can be considered reasonable. as there are more than enough mills within the country to satisfy the demand for rolled oats the importation of that product is also generally prohibited. the proposal for a permanent grain monopoly which is now before the norwegian storthing provides that prices on grains of domestic production bought by the monopoly must be the same as the monopolys selling price of whole grain. import of foreign grains and flour: the purchases of the food administration takes place along ordinary business lines. the purchases are effected at a moment when the market is considered most favorable. and the grains are purchased frop the market offering the most attractive terms. thus alternatedly from the united states. canada. argentine. and now also from russia. likewise purchases have been made occasionally also from australia and india. the rye imports have for a nimber of years taken place from the united states and partly from canada. of late purchases have also been made from russia. which country has delivered rye of a very satisfactory quality at competitive prices. barley has been purchased from the united states as well as fromn european countries. wheat flour has chiefly been taken from the united states and canada. of late a very considerable portion of the norwegian wheat and wheat flour purchases has been made in canada. due to tihe ability of that country to offer the most attractive terms. from the foregoing it will be seen that it is only strictly economic and businesslike considerations which determine the government purchases of grains and flour. grinding and sales: the grains imported by the government. as well as the grain raised within the country purchased by the -state monopoly. is placed in the hands of the mills for storing. grinding. and sale. the state has closed contract with all the mills in the country. these mills grind exclusively grains delivered by the monopoly. when the imported grain reaches the country it is generally delivered direct to the mills. which. against a certain compensation. receive the grain from the ship. transport it to the mill. keep it stored. and do the grinding. selling. and shipping at their own risk. the mills pay for the grains they receive and colect the money for the sales themselves. the resale prices are stipulated by the government (food director). in the same manner imported flour is left in the hands of the association of grain and flour dealers. which distribute the flour to the cooperative selling societies. district food commissions. and some wholesale dealers not members ofthe above association. the business in flour done by the district food commissions is very small. and most of them have now discontinued doing business. for the wholesale distribution of flour a fixed compensation per 100 kilos is given. prices: the selling prices for grains and products thereof are fixed by the food director after conference with the minister of agriculture. all grain products for human consumption are sold at the same price over the entire country. the government bearing all transportation costs. in fixing prices the greatest possible stability is sought. the prices thus are not changed according to the daily fluctuations of the market quotations and exchange rates. but an effort is made to regulate the prices in accordance with any large movements in the world mar. ket. and as far as it is possible the prices are kept at a level not higher than the world market prices. the government changes its prices whenever important movements take place in the world market. and likewise whenever changes are deemed practical and desirable. this price policy will naturally result in that the monopolys prices in a rising market will be on a lower level than the world market prices and vice versa. finally the principle is followed that the state is to have no profit in operating the grain monopoly. but. on the other hand. is not to have any losses. because of this it therefore depends entirely upon the purchase dispositions made by the monopoly whether prices can be kept in conformity with world market prices. our problem is overproduction. in norway it is underproduction and overconsumption. there are at present several proposals under discussion in the norwegian parliament aiming to solve the grain question. whether it will be solved by monopoly or in some other way it is impossible to say at the present moment. the question is under debate by the agricultural committee of the norwegian parliament.","i thank the gentleman for his friendly expression of interest. the engineers who have given a lifetime study to this problem have recommended this solution to the congress. the secretary of the interior has indorsed their recommendation. secretary hoover. who was appointed by president harding to make a special study of the problem and to act as the federal representative on the colorado commission. has given it his backing. and president coolidge himself. after going into the matter thoroughly. has recommended its enactment. the committee on irrigation and reclamation has considered it carefully. and i have reason to believe that the committee early in the next session will report the bill favorably for action by the house. but the point i am trying to make. and the impression i want to leave with you. is that the river has given us a warninga timely warning. i hopeand we should act in this matter while there is time to act in an orderly and businesslike way. instead of waiting until the catastrophe is upon us and then rush helterskelter and in a haphazard manner spend many times the amount of money we neea to accomplish the thing we want done. if we are going to act at all. let us act before great damage is done. before millions of property have been destroyed. before live$ have been lost. perhaps. and before great communities have been wiped out of existence. the people who live in the lower basin appeal to congress as the only agency that can solve this problem. because it involves an international question.. because it involves an interstate question. because it involves the federal problem of flood control and the federal problem of reclamation. in the name of these 100.000 peoplegood. honest. american citizensin the name of these people who have labored and created thriving american communities. i appeal to you to act. to act while there is yet time to save them and their homes. and if we act wisely and promptly we may prevent a great catastrophe being charged up to our indifference. our.neglect. find our delay.","i agree with the senator from alabama that it is absolutely necessary for us to maintain all the security we can. it was certainly most unfortunate that we came so near getting out of explosives during our recent world war experience. we ought to guard against everything of that kind in the future in every possible way. but it does not seem to me to be wise to turn over that plant. which we have constructed at such great expense. and for 50 years tie our hands in reference to a plant of that kind. which is. a. the senator from alabama has correctly stated. absolutely essential to our national defense. it is not at all improbable that scientific research. which has made such wonderful strides during the last half century. will make great advances upon the cyanamide and haber processes. which are provided in nitrate plants 1 and 2. if we must adopt the underwood bill. then surely provision should be made for changes to meet changing conditions that may arise. i insist upon that. if we adopt this bill. we certainly should safeguard it so as to have some authority authorized to make chafiges as the changing conditions of the science may justify. those changes ought to be made either by the war department. or the lessee should be required to make them. so as to keep the plant right up to date all the time. moreover. the underwood bill operates. either through a lessee or through the government corporation. a great producer of fertilizer. who will come into active competition. at least in the vicinity of muscle shoals. with all private producers of fertilizers. thereby interfering materially with legitimate private business. the norris bill contemplates the complete development of the power and navigation resources of the tennessee river and their utilization in such way as greatly to benefit tha nation at large by cheapening the methods of making fertilizers. by the wide dissemination of electric power at reasonable prices. by perfecting the navigation of one of our largest rivers. and by regulating the flood waters of one of the most dangerous rivers in the union. it will cost many million dollars to complete the works on the tennessee. as contemplated in the norris bill. they are of immense value. they are too important and too expensive for any private person. corporation. or state to undertake. they are worthy of the best endeavors of the nation as a whole. and the resultant benefits amply justify the expense involved. it is entirely feasible so to construct reservoir dams on the headwaters of the tennessee and its tributaries as to give continuous flow in the main stream during the lowwater periods. thereby enhancing the primary power of the dams and deepening the river for navigation. at the same time. and without very heavy cost. these dams can be sufficiently raised to hold back dangerous floods and permit them to run out gradually under proper regulations. no river in the union presents a better opportunity for the federal government to combine so many benefits as the tennesseecheap fertilizers. lowpriced electricity. good boating. and control of floods. a wonderful start has already been made by the government in the work on dam no. 2 and that contemplated at dam no. 3. together with the advanced work of the army engineers toward a complete survey of the river. this work should not be halted. but should be carried forward with speedy pace to completion. thereby demonstrating what a great government like ours can do for its people in such essentials as fertilizer. power. transportation. and protection from overflow. . if this development shall be carried out logically and thoroughly on the tennessee river. i am firmly convinced that similar works will gradually be placed on the principal rivers of the ohio valley. such as the cumberland. the allegheny. the great kanawha. and others. with the result that the present devastating floods in the valleys of these streams and in the mississippi valley will be so lessened and regulated as no longer to endanger life and property. this is no idle dream. but entirely practical. and no feature of the norris bill gives gteater promise to my mind than that which provides for the complete development of the tennessee in order to secure cheap fertilizers. cheap power. cheap transportation. and effective flood control. it would be ideal for the government to undertake this work at once and complete it quickly. but that may be too much to expect. as a practical proposition. we will probably have to be satisfied with prosecution of the general survey under an appropriation for its rapid completion. and a liberal appropriation to begin work on dam no. 3. in the meantime. the federal power commission should look with favor upon applications for leases for reservoirs and dams on the tennessee. safeguarding to the fullest degreb the interests of navigation and flood control. if the survey shows that navigation and flood control can be materially aided at a given point by structures so expensive that the power interests will not erect them unaided. then the government should undertake these works or contribute pro rata toward them. under no circumstances should permits be issued by the federal power commission for power dams on our navigable waters and their tributaries without adequate provisions for navigation and flood control. in order that full information may be available on these subjects. i introduced last may a bill authorizing the federal power commission to prepare \"a comprehensive plan of development of the water resources of the united states. for the purpose of providing electric power for farms. rural communities. cities and industries. of promoting navigation. of controlling floods. and of securing other beneficial uses of such resources.\" this measure is still pending. and i shall urge its prompt adoption. the spirit of the norris bill requires the secretary of agriculture to conduct elaborate scientific researches with a view to discovering better and cheaper methods of making fixed nitrogen. in substance. lie is told to convert nitrate plant no. 1 into a great chemical laboratory with every available facility. for delving into natures secrets by scientists from his department and all other investigators. having always in mind the manufacture of cheap fertilizer for agriculture. his polestar is cheap feftilizer. and he is armed with every weapon that science can suggest and liberal funds supply in his efforts to secure it. his plan will attract the best scientists of the world. and promise fine results. while these experiments are being carried on the secretary of agriculture will also manufacture a reasonable amount of fertilizer from year to year. and will sell it to farmers and to the trade as cheap as possible. but not in a way to come in absolute conflict with the legitimate fertilizer business. as is provided in the underwood bill. both measures attempt to safeguard the fertilizer business and to cheapen it. but the norris bill is far more comprehensive in its terms. does infinitely more to aid scientific investigations. and does much less to interfere with legitimate private business. a very important difference between these two bills is that the underwood measure would tie our hands for 50 years and deprive us of making any other disposal of the property if future developments show it to be desired. whereas the norris bill. keeping the whole plant in the hands of the government. would leave us free at any time to make changes from time to time. if so desired. it is true that under the norris bill blocks of electric power would be sold to states. municipalities. and others. but only certain limited portions of power. not the entire plant. moreover. this bill especially provides that in selling power the lease must be for as short a time as possible. not longer than for a period of 25 years. i have never believed as a general proposition that the government should engage in any kind of business that can be as well done by private persons or corporations. but there are exceptions to all rules. the government operation of the post office department has proved both satisfactory to the citizens and successful as a business proposition. it is also true that the ownership and operation of waterworks by cities of the union. large and small. has been extremely satisfactory. indeed. much better. i believe. than the private ownership and operation of waterworks would have been. government ownership and operation of the panama canal is all right. these are a few of the exceptions which prove the general rule. but certainly in nine cases out of ten it isbest for private initiative and enterprise to handle business of various kinds. we had a sad experience during the recent world war with! federal operation of railroads. and very few of our thoughtful men would consent for these great transportation systems to be acquired and operated by the government. the public is served much better by privately operated railroads. with reasonable and just regulation thereof by the interstate commerce commission and state commissions. the government operation of railroads is enormously expensive and unsatisfactory in europe. especially in germany. austria. and italy. the service there is much more costly than here. and its efficiency does not compare with that furnished by american railroads. an exceedingly interesting article on the subject was recently contributed to the press by hon. edward n. hurley. former president of the united states shipping board. this article is entitled \"what public ownership really means--weve heard for years how it works in europe. but the europeans have learned that it doesnt.\" it is published on page 17 of colliers weekly for october 25. 1924. i ask leave to print it as an appendix to my remarks. and deem it worthy of very careful perusal.","mr. speaker. it is my desire to discuss briefly the matter of immigration. owing to the pending bill h. r. 7995. immigration is not it new thing. it is as old as the human race. races. tribes. and families have left their ancestral homes and nmade new nations. blotting out old cultures. and absorbing or being absorbed by other peoples. history is repeatlog itself in this land of ours. the pressing question before us is. shall the result be the absorption of immigration by this nation or shall this nation be absorbed by the immigrant? this question is very fundamental to our national life and national existence. for three centuries old europe has been depopulating herself in response to the urge of greater economic opportunity. america has been the pot of gold at the foot of the rainbow of promlise. for two and a half centuries these seekers of better conditions came almost exclusively from the north and west of europe. from races of nordic stock. the british isles. the scandinavian lands. and germany. about 1890 the tide turned to the people of southern europe. middle europe. and the near east. by 1914 the predominant immigration was from those lands. so that today of the 33.000.000 persons in this country of foreign birtih or with one or both parents of foreign birth the great majority are of italian or slavic stock. the attitude of america toward the question of immigration ill the past has been one largely of complacency and toleration. we took great pride in calling our land \" the great melting pot\" of the world. we called our nation the haven of refuge for the oppressed and distressed of all races and nations of the earth. the early years called for settlers in the great free lands of the everextending west. we wanted settlers and took no particular thought of whence they came. that was true up to early in 1895. then our industries began to expand rapidly. we wanted men for our mines. our mills. our factories. for 20 years this development was most rapid and the demand for artisans. as well as unskilled laborers. by the captains of industry called for wideopen doors for the immigrant. they were not content to let the flow of immigration. however. as in the early years. be dependent upon those who sought our shores because of their desire to have our land their land. our faith their faith. our ideals their ideals. but through organized agencies sought to stimulate immigration beyond the normal. it was a policy shaped by large contractors and large industrial corporations and steamship companies. the tide became a flood. a deluge. a devastation. still we went on expanding. enlarging. bringing in more and more of contract labor heedless of a day of reckoning. here and there a voice was raised as of a prophet crying in the wilderness. but except for the protest of organized labor no insistent warning voice was raised. that protest was only against contract labor and had no relation to the finer aspect of the perpetuity of the traditions and institutions of the nation. in 191.4 the only limit was the capacity of the steamship companies and the aid that could be extended by the immigrant already here to his friends and relatives back in the old land. not until 1917 did we pass any real restrictive legislation. that was the illiteracy test. then came the world war and the conditions arising from it. these conditions brought to a sharp focus the problem that confronted us in this question of immigration. a problem that had given every thoughtful american alarm for half a century. the certainty was that the immigrants of the immediate future at least would be the hordes of eastern and southern europe. with miscellaneous asiatics. fleeing from the ruin and devastation of the war. that meant the turning over of the nation and its destinies to a helpless heterogeneous mass. with our national ideals and institutions thrown into discord. prompt. decisive action was called for. and the new policy of america in the matter of immigration was enacted. history will record it as one of he greatest achievements of the domestic policies of the republican administration under the leadership of president harding. the question now today before us is. shall we continue in that wise policy. even to the further strengthening of the policy. or shall we modify the law by lifting some of its provisions? for one. i desire to be recorded as an advocate of not only defending the present policy. but. indeed. of urging still greater restrictions. early migration involved a certain degree of ambition. independence. courage. energy. and forethought. all those characteristics which are required in the individual who forsakes the known for the unknown. but all this is a thing of the past. to a host of them the change is no greater than to go to the next village in their native land. perhaps less so. for as likely as not as many of their friends and relatives are awaiting them in the new country as are lamenting them in the old. neither is tie voyage. bad as it is. beset with the uncertainties. hardships. and perils which used to characterize it. the way is cleared for the travelers at every step. never in the history of our country has artificially stimulated immigration formed so large a part of the whole as now. there is nothing in the modern conditions of immigration which serves as a guaranty of high quality in the immigrant. i repeat that the present conditions give us no guaranty of desirable qualities of the incoming immigrant whom we are asked to take into our national life. may i quote. as my definition for \" desirable.\" marcus ell ravage. who writes: \"what america means hy desirable is no question of superiority. the word does not mean anything. the definition of a desirable -immigrant is: a person who can with the least expenditure of time and trouble be made into an american.\" a law restricting immigration to meet labor conditions is necessary. the proposed legislation offered by the committee on immigration aims to do this. the early distinction between the republican and democratic parties was their attitude toward labor. the republicans favored free labor. the democrats slave labor. the first was high priced. the latter cheap. since the civil war public opinion has continued to favor wellpaid labor. a policy of unrestricted immigration would flood the country with cheap labor. it would encourage an attitude of considering manual labor as menial labor. this attitude is all too prevalent. as evidenced by the preference for whitecollar jobs. the demand on the part of certain great lines of industry that the restriction be removed in order that they may have an abundance of cheap labor is a shortsighted policy. what is the thought? simply immediate profits. and if so. is the theory correct? can cheap labor have the purchasing power of adequately paid labor? is cheap labor as productive edness. their racial character. and their racial habits. hero as skilled labor? it is the age of machinery skillfully ban- they speak their own tongue. read their own newspapers. maindied. rather than brawn without brains. but. after all. shall tain their separate educational system. ir. gino speranza not our industrial leaders think of posterity and the perpetuity gives us the following statistics: of the nation? i believe they do and will continue to do so even more intently. the preservation of this great republic of in 1920. out of a white population of about 95.000.000. nearly our.14.000.000 were

house will consider this legislttion ill a nollsectional \"tind nonpartisan wany. and pass it 15s soon as possible. it is the policy of the government to appropriate money to protect crops from insects and diseases. also cattle and forests. so that the people may have food. clothing. and shelter. with the movement from the farins to the cities we are already threatened with limited production. certainly legislation of this sort. which would protect millions of acres of our most fertile land from recurring floods. is in the interest of all our people. take for instance the cotton crop. every pound of t is needed to clothe our people. and yet every time we have a flood. millions of acres of the most fertile cotton land in the world is flooded and the crop lost. we also have the moral responsibility of the federal government to assist in the safeguarding of life from these floods. in planning work of the magnitude required to control the mississippi river and its tributaries during flood stages we must look ahead. the money which this bill authorizes will not be available until july. 1924. however. if this bill should fail to become a law before adjournment. march 4. it would be nothing short of a disaster for the lower mississippi valley. on the other hand. if the bill becomes a law this session. the levee boards can go ahead with their plans. and also the mississippi river commission. i am glad. indeed. to see a change in sentiment in congress on this vital question. some who were not in favor of such appropriation years ago because it did not directly affect them now understand that it is a big american problem which must be met and solved if the entire country is to develop and prosper. we had no such desperate and critical flood problems years ago. such floods as came then would spread out more gradually or were controlled by levees that the local people could afford to maintain at their own expense. but today. my friends. these floods come so suddenly upon us. because of the destruction of forests and better drainage above. that they are absolutely beyond our control. the united states has spent considerable money on reclamation. reclanmation is the conversion of waste land. such as deserts. swamps. and cutover lands. by human labor and artificial means. into productive areas. we have done splendid work in that line and we should encourage it. at the same time we must bear in mind that the main purpose of efforts to control the mississippi river and its tributaries is the preservation of vast productive areas. great cities and farms already existing. against the everincreasing floods poured down upon them in everswelling volume as a result of the improvement of agricultural lands above. this is not reclamation. it is national conservation of immense establishmed values. certainly we can not permit these vast values. fruitful acres. and large cities to be given over to destruction.- the conversion of waste places to human use. the development of new values. the conservation of existing values constitute one of the highest and truest functions of government. let us rise above partisanship and sections and pass this bill today. with the hope that the senate will do likewise and that the president will sign it before march 4.","mi. president. i move to strike out the numerals 12 \" in line 3. after the word \" acid.\" and insert in lieu thereof the numeral \" 6.\" so that it will read pyrogallic acid. 6 cents per pound. i wish to occupy but a brief time on this amendment. the house bill provides 25 per cent ad valorem and the senate coinmittee bill 12 cents a pound specific rate. the paynealdrich law provided 25 per cent ad valoremu and the underwoodsimmons law 12 cents per pound specific. the reasons which might have justified the rate in the underwoodsininious law or in any other preceding measure do not now exist. it was shown during the discussion of gallic acid that pyrogallic was gerirane to that acid. it is produced by the heating of gallic acid. tie survey states that it is tile oldest ilhotograplic developer and is probably used more than airy other. that it is employed in medicine and for the dyeing of fur and hair. and in the manufacture of dyes: and that it is an important reagent in the chemical laboratory as an absorbent for oxygen gas in gas anl yses. it will be observed that this product. as well as niany others in tile chemical schedule. constitutes a basis for other industries and is employed in manufacturing plants nd in industrial developments. the reason why this chenical schedule is so important arises from the fact that practically all of the commodities found therein enter into the composition of coinmodities developed iii the various ianufacturing industries of the united states. of course. if we raise the prices of these primary products. they must be carried to intermediates or finished products. and pyraurded as they are carried on until finally the ultimate consumer must bear the entire burden. when a tariff is added to one of the fundamentals employed in tile manufacturing business of the united states. as stated. that is \"added to tire cost of the first product of which it forms a component part. that product. finding refuge ill some other schedule iii the bill. looks for a tariff and profits. and tile first tarilf which wvas attached to the fundamlental or primary product is carried into that manufactured product. and that product perhalps becomes the basis of some other enterprise or some other commodity in a niore highly finished state. and that tariff is carried into that product and hll turn passes on to tile ultimate consumer. in this way these small items in the aggregate constitute an enormous burden placed upon the people. complaints may be made that we are attacking small items. the distinguished senator fromn north dakota complained because we criticized the tariff upon a number of medicines. because they are consumed ili small quantities by individuals he felt that the people should bear with equanimity the burdens which were thus iniposed upon them. it is the small additions and accretions incident to tile sustenance of tile foinilies of the people. mr. president. which in tile end place upon them such oppressive burdens. we are pleading for reasonable prices for primary and basic products. because in so doing we are ministering to tile welfare of the great mass of the people and are stimulating home illdustries and larger production. as we stimulate production we inrease the demands for labor and augment the prices which are paid to laboring nien. it seels to me as plain .s the light. which shines upon us through the beautiful skylights above that as we burden the primary product we are burdening the .development of the industrial life of the people. when we throw bowhlers into die stream they constitute innpedlinients to the moving waters. if they are huge bowiders they may. if we cast a sufficient nunber into the stream. divert tile waters which pass beyond the banks and carry danger alld destruction to life and property. we want a free currentand by that i ami not speaking of free trade. we want. so far as )ossible. to have an unobstructed current for the development of the industries of this great land. we can dominate the world in manufactured products and can sweep the nations with a great flood of commodities produced iii our own land. and send by sail and by steani and railroads our commodities to bless tire world and to benefit the people of the united states. now. mr. president. here is a product not in itself of great imiportance and still it is one of the essentials iii tile industries of the land. yet we ire to put a tariff upon it. during tire first nine nionths of 1921 we imported 22 pounds. i have no doubt under tle construction of the embargo act the importation has been somewhat interfered with. let rie repeat what i said once before. that the embargo act was a fraud. it was a deception upon the senate as well as upon the american people. under the construction placed upon it there are thousands of comodities which are embargoed. seeking to help the dye monopoly. we have aided tire chenical industry by giving them a monopoly upon hundreds and hundreds of articles which are denominated synthetic chemnical products. in 1920 we imported 888 pounds of pyrogallic acid. the foreign unit value of this product for last year was $2.05. that is. this product is being sold abroad at $2.05 wholesale. the price in the united states on the 24th of april. as i get the figures from tile publications relating to drugs and oredicines. was $1.20 to $1.35 per poundthat is. for the crystalsand tile resublimate was $1.60 to $1.75 per pound. we are producing it and selling it in the domestic. markets at less than it is being produced and sold for in the foreign market. as stated. the foreign price during the first nine months of 1921 wvas $2.05 and iii the united states from $1.20 to $1.75. dependent upon the grade. what reason is there for a tariff on this commodity? there is only one reason. it is to increase the price for the domestic producer. it is manufactured by the mallinckdrodt chemical works. to which i have referred heretofore. by powers. weightnian &amp; rosengarten. and by tile eastman kodak co.. and by zinsser &amp; co. let me say that tire latter corporation sent a. representative. as i recall. wio. if lie did not testify. filed a brief in which lie asked that the tariff be 40 cents per pound. the brief of zinsser &amp; co. is found on page 66 of the house hearings.. forty cents per pound was asked as a tariff duty. mr. president. i think the rate which i have suggested is more than aiple for protection. if protection is needed. and if revenue is desired that rate will afford some little revenue.","mr. speaker. within the time allotted to me i shall address myself. not alone to the resolution. the passage of which by congress. and with the approval of which by the president would have th6 effect of ending the war with the germans. but also to certain. cognate questions which i regard as of equal if not of paramount concern to the government and its people. in november last. after nearly eight years of democratic rule. the american electorate. according to the forms of an ordered and free government. decided by a strongly preponderating majority that democratic rule should end. and as a corollary that the republican party should again be restored to power. thereby investing the latter party with. plenary authority as to all matters of national legislation. and federal administration. coupled with that authority were certain instructions. binding in character. delivered. with great emphasis. for it. was the voice of millions of men and women. recording. their sentiments at the polls. who. by an overwhelming majority. proclaimed warren g. harding as president of the united states. what were those instructions? one was that the covenant of the league should be cast aside. thrown into the discards.. that has been done. but i may add that. as one of 435 members of congress. i shall. with not a little degree of anxiety. observe. as well as i may from this great distance. \"every little movement \" of the extra. \"full crew\" men who. by our presidenti have been appointed as american representatives on: the reparation and other like european war commissions. we wish for these gentlemen godspeed. which term comprehends a safe and especially an early return to this country. another instruction was to the effect that peace with germany should. be restored. as it is now. the nations that were associated with us in the war have concluded treaties of peace. but we. in theory of the law but not in point of fact.. are. at war with germany. this ambiguous condition ought to be changed. the situation is. as anomalous and absurd as it is expensive. inconvenient. and unjust to the american people. by the enactment into law of the measure before us. the majority party will have fulfilled its promise as regards the establishment of peace. mr. speaker. while we are on the subject of foreign affairs. and particularly of the war. it is pertinent for me to observe that the foreign governments that stand debtor to us to the extent of $10.000.000.000 are not manifesting a very great amount of concernin fact. i presume no concernas regards the discharge of the great obligations they are underin fact. they have not even paid the interest on the debt. the money advanced to such governments came from the pockets of our people as the proceeds of liberty bonds and victory notes. the peopin who bought the bonds are borne down under a very heavy burden of annual interest. necessary for us to pay on that debt. consequently it seems to me as. entirely just that our government should immediately take steps to enforce the collection of these vast loans. now standing as mere open ac counts. but nevertheless obligations of the most solemn character. onthe books of the treasurer of the united states. as germane to this subject. may i direct your attention to the proposition that the government should by a refunding arrangement or other method. restore the par value of the bonds? assurance was made by those. especially the fourminute men. who harangued the people to buy the bonds that they were good. but we know very well that they are now selling far below par. one cause of the constantly falling price of government bonds is due to the action of the international bankers who for certain commissions .are floodinr this country with foreign securities. only the other day an issue of $100.000.000 of french bonds was dumped on the new york market at an interest yield of 8 per cent. i am told that the agents of six- other nations havebeen. and- perhaps are now.. in. new york negotiat ing for the flotation of further great issues. our government should take cognizance of the situation and maintain the position that no foreign bonds shall be sold in this country at a rate of interest higher than 6 per centi doubt if they should be allowed sale at allin order to prevent our people from gambling in securities of very questionable value. and to pro6 tect the integrity of the bonds of our own government. and of other domestic securities as well. to what extent foreign nations may feel grateful for american assistance i do not know. that we have donated vast sumsprobably three billionsto their charities and have:made large private loans in. addition to the government loans. i do know. and i therefore feel that it is now high time for foreign peoples to go to work and no longer to consider america as being solely an almshouse or one vast eleemosynary insti tution. operated for their exclusive benefit.. we. have obligar tions to our own people. charity must begin at home. the first duty of. a nation. no less than that of the father of the family. is to provide for its own children. that we should do. and that we will do. in view of the fact that vast numbers of our most deserving workingmen. are without employment and fundamental business enterprisesagriculture. commerce. manufacture. mining. and seafaring. allin america are now. almost stagnant. it may take the world 50 years to recover from the. ravages of the war: in the meanwhile the most rigid economy in government. state and nation. also in private life. should- be practiced.. we. republicans promised the people to relieve: them of heavy taxation. will we do it? we must admit that we have a difficult task to perform and we have made slow progress. we have not. so: far as my knowledge goes. abolished a single board or bureau or commissiom we have. i believe. added some new onesfor example. the one. regulating the packers. over in the senate one or two members are agitating the passage- of a bill to regulate coal. and incidentally to provide some more good! jobs. such regulation would undoubtedly add to the cost of the article. before the war an unfailing supply of cheap coal flowed steadily from the mines to the consumers bins. but with war regulation all has been changed. thus far this year the mines have been run at low ebb because consumers have listened: to the siren voice of demagoguesthose who promise the passage of regulatory laws which will cheapen its price. coal can be bought at the mines on a. very close margin of profit. in some cases it is sold below cost of mining. but the real cost to the consumer lies in the transportation charge. coal from my district. traveling over one of the three railroads to norfolk and by boat from there to boston and distributed from the latter port to the surrounding region. must bear a rate ranging around $7 per ton. the interstate commerce commission. regulates the rate. in the old days the railroad managers charged \"all the traffic would bear.\" but they were too smart. too good business. men to charge more than the traffic would bear. artificial laws and regulations. if persisted. in. will ultimately destroy not alone the great coal industry but likewise great commercial and manufacturing enterprises and communities. such as exist in new england and elsewhere as well. in this united states. in the meanwhile i shall trust to the honor. wisdom. and ability of the republican party. constituted of its members in congresssenators and representativesand of the administration. headed by our excellent president. warren g. harding. to guide amid all vicissitudes the good old ship of state to a good and safe harbor. as was done by that party under the matchless and wonderful leadership of other menstars of the first magnitudelincoln. grant. gafield. harrison. mckinley. roosevelt. and othersthe great dynasty of rpublican presidents.","i do not think the government can do that. but we can reduce the government expenses. i want to take from the back of the farmer every .burden that he ought not to bear. this congress can do. i want to give him some help in respect to his health. this. too. congress can do. the first appropriation ever given for the specific purpose of rural sanitation i was instrumental in having placed in the sundry civil bill. i got the committee to give $50.000 for this purpose. then. in the next bill. after a hard fight. i got the committee to give for this service $150.000. the war came on and the money was all used around camps and cantonments to protect the health of the soldiers. now. if the gentleman wants to help the farmer. i ask him to help me increase the item of $50.000- now n this bill to $150.000. this sum can be spent to assist every farmer in making his premises healthy. oh. you say we must economize. yes. we must. but. for gods sake. do not begin with the very people who feed and clothe the nation. yout vote millions on top of millions to care for the health of the army and navy and begrudgingly vote only $50.000 for the millions of farmers. i would also help him by building roads. i would take some of the millions that you spend for other purposes and build good roads. you give manymillions now for purposes less important than this. now. let us act with wisdom and make farm life more attractive and less burdensome than it is now by giving the farmer good roads. nothing will so quickly develop country life. i would extend the floodcontrol law now upon our statute books and straighten out our streams so as to help drain millions of acres of good land now subject to overflow. .these are some of the many practical things we can do for the farmer. so as to give him a share in government expenditures. the governlnene has millions invested in road machinery and heavy trucks purchased for war purposes. i would turn these over to our states and counties to be used in building roads and not let them be idle and go to rust. these things we can do. will the gentleman join me? his party is now in power. and if they are really interested in the farmer. why not help him now in this way? it- will- notc6st the government a cent. but will relieve our states and counties of the burden of buying this road machinery. there is another thing that the great business men of our great cities could do.\" they could have the great inventive geniuses of this country to- devote some of their time to inventions that would improve the means of the cultivation of the soil. develop these. and put them on the market in easy reach of the farmer and at reasonable prices. develop water systems within reach of the farmer in price. so that he can have water works for his home and for his barn. in other words. help thus to make country life attractive. you can not expect the boys to live in the country unless that is done. not only that. but i want the psychology of this people changed. i want boys and girls to be reared and educated in the fundamental doctrine that a life of real service to mankind is the best life of all. that to so live that you can make the world better by having lived in it is the happiest life. i would teach them that to labor and strive for money algne does not bring happiness. that when this is the chief aim of any life such life is not only a failure but often a real curse to mankind. even though its object is attained and riches are obtained. we are taught in the sacred scriptures that \" the love of money is the root of all evil.\" this one expression has in it so much truth and is so broad and comprehensive that it alone is enough to convince me that the scriptures are inspired. itis the love of money.the desire for riches and wealth. that is causing the people of this country to lose sight of the fundamental principles of truth and virtue. and to strive not for the good of others but to gratify a growing and increasing avarice. and is causing men not to respect and honor the man who actually labors in the field. because here he can not find great riches. oh. you can not expect to reap any other harvest than that of discontent when the people worship at the shrine of mammon and not at the altar of the living god who teaches us in his sacred word that \" the love of money is the root of all evil.\" you can not as a people loug violate gods laws without paying the penalty. i am going in a moment to show why the boys are leaving the farm.","the democratic party in the house and senate was so strong in their position on the question. and the question was so strong. that we passed it over. that veto and put it on the statute books. although .your party. which had been in power for 40 years. had never dared to toiich it. why? because the big iron and steel corporation and other big manufacturing corporations that wanted to employ this cheap foreign labor instead of american laborto dlisplace the american employeeopposedany restriction of immigration of foreign labor. it remained for the democratic party in the house and the democratic party in the senate to override the demands and the protests of the big tarifffiittened corporations. and pass a fair immigration act to protect american labor against this cheap. freelist pauper labor that had been. inder the republican control. flooding the american labor market for 40 years. now. to the pending amendments. the gentleman from ohio raised a very important qiestion when lie asked the gentleman from michigan [mr. fononex-] if the american iron and steel companies were not protesting against the prohibitive rates in the bill and in the committee amendments. the united states steel corporation is not protesting. because it is able topay to the niagnesite producers here any tariff you put omn. this does not hurt them. they can pay $15 or $25 a ton. but it is the little independent steel and iron companies throughout tle united states that have to compete with the united states steel corporation.which are protesting against this unjust. prohibitive tariff. the gentleman front ohio asked if the american coipanies did not prefer to buy the austrian product. because it was a better and more suitable product than the american product. the gentleman from michigan said. \" oh. no . ours is better than any other on earth.\" and the republicans applauded. gentlemen. here is the report on that question fron the tariff commission. listen now. mr. cooper is right. the independent iron and steel producers are willing to stand a protective tariff. and my amendment gives a high protective tariff. at least twice as high as it ought to be. but it is not prohibitive like that of the committee.. they do not want a prohibitive tariff to pmevent them from getting the material that is more adaptable aid better suited to their business. iere is what the tariff coinmission says: on the other had. there is - dcthded preference

provisions are being made to the end that our soldiers in france and in different parts of the united statesmay exercise their sovereign power 6f voting upon any and all the issues before the american people in our elections this fall. if. within the sound of the battle. the soldier may pause for the purpose of casting his ballot and expressing his voice upon any great national question. i certainly think it most appropriate that members of congress. upon whom is imposed the duty of conducting the government and guiding the nation through this war. may well pause for a moment and consider some of the issues which will be involved in our next election. k mr. president. we often hear and read the statement. \"politics is adjourned during this war.\" that statement is not and can not be wholly true. under our form of government legitimate politics can never be adjourned. whether we would desire it or not. our federal constitution compels us to elect every member of the house of representatives and onethird of the members of the senate on the 5th day of november. 1918. and our state laws make those elections partisan. we can not adjourn those elections or take from them their political character. those state laws provide for primary elections to present political candidates for the november general election. under state statutes each candidate must elect before the primary. whether he seeks the office of united states senator or representative as a republican or a democrat or other party adherent. and the several states require their voters to register as repfiblicans. democrats. or other party adherents. and. further. compels each voter in the primary election to vote only for a candidate of his own party. not only this. but our federal law and our state laws each and all recognize political organizations and provide 1..w. to govern the conduct of those political organizations in elections. what nonsense. then. mr. president. is this talk of laying aside partisan politics in any campaign? you might with just as much reason talk .about omitting the next november election. the constitution compels you to hold that election. the state laws compel you to conduct and holda partisan election. in the matter of war. of course there can be no party question. because there can be no two policies. he who is not with his country in the prosecution of this war is the enemy of his country. it is the one thing on which the patriotic members of all parties must agree. and ought. therefore. never to be a party or partisan question. but. mr. president. there are a vast number of questions most vital in their nature which. while secondary in importance. are ]not less valuable and lose none of their virtues because of a state of war. while grant was battling his way through the wilderness in 1864 and sherman and thomas were forcing the offensive all along the line. lincoln became a candidate for reelection as a republican. and gen. george b. mcclellan. a union general. was the democratic candidate for president. questions other than that of the war were discussed and entered into the respective party platforms. so in this coming campaign there will be party issues on important questions outside of the prosecution of this war. but. mr. president. while we can not eliminate or adjourn legitimate politics we can and ought to eliminate illegitimate politics. i wish i could truthfully say that this kind of politics had really been adjourned. i mean by \"illegitimate\" politics. first. the enactment of laws demanded neither by justice nor the general welfare. intended to influence. or tfie natural consequence of which will be to influence. votes in any election. second. the use by any official of a power conferred by law to meet war exigencies. for the purpose of influencing or controlling votes. third. reckless extravagances in expending the huge sums of money raised for war purposes. with a view of securing the political support of the beneficiaries of these extravagances. and. i might add. so manipulating the vast powers necessarily created by our war legislation to crush or reward. and thereby stifle criticism or shield wrong. i wish i could satisfy my mind that the incomparable waste and extravagance under the \" costplus\" system. adopted in our contracts for war needs. the disclosures of the squandering of nearly a billion dollars for airplanes without any visible return. the awful imposition on the taxburdened public. present and future. who. i believe. are paying for war preparations from two to three times what would be imposed upon them under efficient managementi wish i could satisfy my mind that this could all be attributed to chance or inefficiency. and that in no instance political or personal interest intervened. but i shall not allow even a persistent suspicion to assume the form of a charge. i hope i am entirely mistaken. i hope the enormous increase in wages to all railway employees. ordered by the director general of railways. on taking over the great railway systems of the country. the great increases allowed in wages by the post office department on taking posaession of the telegraph lines of the country. the ordering of private. concerns producing for the government to add to their cost in wages. in many instances far beyond what was demanded by employees. the compelling in many instances of laborers to associate themselves with unions before they could receive government employmenti hope all these acts were done with the single purpose of securing equal justice to all producers. lvi70s laborers. including those engaged in employments not touched by this magic wand of governmental power. but my own investigation convinces me that the drastic disregard of the law of supply and demand and the substitution of class or industrial favoritism has so unsettled the reasonably fair balance heretofore obtaining that gross inequalities and hardships have been inflicted on very many patriotic people and our industrial efficiency enormously impaired. to the great detriment of the country. but my purpose today is to consider some features of legitimate politics which can not and should not ever be adjourned and which especially demand attention today. as i have stated. whether we will it or not. an election is to be held in november. the candidates are seeking election as republicans and as democrats. as a republican i shall attempt to declare what should be the republican policy on the allabsorbing question of the day and on only one other question demanding solution while this war is in progress and before its termination. mr. president. far above all other issues and questions. so far superior that all others must be circumscribed within it and conduce to its success. is the issue of this war. the republican party is intensely patriotic. it has always been with the country. never against it. it recognizes the everlasting justice of our cause. and its statesmen fully comprehend what a disaster to the world would be a defeat or any conclusion short of a most decisive victory. as. from the very beginning of this war. the republican party has advocated placing on the battle front an army of not less than 5.000.000 fighting men. and placing them there in the quickest possible time. so today it is still urging the speeding up of this mighty army. speeding up in ship construction to transport and maintain that army. speeding up of munitions and ordnance to enable it. in conjunction with our bleeding allies. who have been fighting an unequal battle for more than four years. to finally crush this giant ogre of militarism. whose arrogance. greed. and lust for world domination have made every land a charnel house and filled the earth with misery and horrors beyond description. and that party would be untrue to itself and unfaithful to the country if it failed to condemn and constructively criticize any inefficiency or irregularity which has hampered or delayed us in putting forth the full strength of our war power. the republicanl party stands squarely on the declaration that there shall never be any patchedup peace. any temporary hll in this great world cause which will enable a defeate(i militarism to again prepare. probably with weapons more insidious and deadly than their liquid fires. their poisonous gases. or their u boats. to destroy the weaker nations and subjugate and dominate the world. that we should have peace is important. that we should have such a peace as will make it impossible to inflict upon the world another such war is a thousandfold more important. i assert that it can be truthfully said that in all matters concerning the prosecution of this war both branches of congress and both political parties in congress have adjourned partisan politics and stand united in patriotic zeal and determination to carry this war to a full and complete victory. had those intrusted with the production of war equipment and material exercised a degree of economy or demonstrated an efficiency comparable with congressional zeal and alacrity in furnishing them with the billions of dollars to achieve such result. we would have been many months ahead of what we are today in our war program. president wilson. in his capacity of commander in chief of the american army and navy. is neither democrat nor republican. and he should have back of him at all times not a partisan support but a united national support. unstinted and unlimited. that support he has received from the republicans of both houses every day since we entered this conflict. we have gone further. and often against our own judgment as to their necessity. have conferred autocratic powers in matters not directly connected with this warpowvers so broad and comprehensive as to threaten and endanger our ancient safeguards of human rights anl liberties. we have gone to the limit. if we have not overstepped the limit. of safety in our endeavor to withhold no power that might possibly assist in the prosecution of the war. as there is no party division in matters pertaining to the prosecution of this war. i feel safe in declaring that there is and will be no .party division on the principles for which we entered the conflict or the conditions of a just. honorable. and lasting peacea peace that can mean nothing less than restitution. reparation. and future guaranty. but if it be contended that full reparation for wanton destruction of property. for vessels sunk and property destroyed in a manner not recognized by the laws and rules of civilized warfare. for tribute exacted. for enslavement and murder does not clearly fall within those 14 conditions for peace. then the republican party records itself in favor of demanding this full reparation. in addition to the 14 articles promulgated as peace conditions. and to assure this reparation. the republican party stands and demands as a first condition the unconditional surrender of the armies and navies of our enemies. while individuals may differ on details. the republican party .can and will stand squarely with the president for the great doctrines enunciated by him on the 8th day of january. 1918. as the foundation upon which to build the structure of a lasting peace. mr. president. while we shall claim no higher conception of duty or patriotism than that which actuates every loyal member of every other party. we would be untrue to our convictions and false to our history if we did not believe we could assure an acceleration of speed. efficiency. effectiveness. and economy far .beyond what has been achieved and thereby shorten this war many months. saving the lives of many thousands of our soldiers and many billions of dollars. so much. mr. president. for the war issue. which is a world issue and not a merely domestic one. i wish now to discuss a domestic question. one of the most important elements in our national life and concerning which there has always been a dif. ference of policy between the two great political parties. i refer to our agricultural industry. in two ways can the republican party give very substantial support to the agricultural interests of the country. and both should be put into force and effect before the close of this war if we are to save that industry from a most serious reverse. the first is the reinstatement of the old policy of protection. the second. a new and advanced step which changed industrial conditions and especially the increasing dependence on the home market makes necessary. as all state and foreign commerce is under the control of congress. so tile financial and commercial welfare of the american people is peculiarly a matter of federal concern. it is the clear and unquestioned duty of.the federal government. which alone has the power. to so adjust our commercial relations with other countries as to assure the greatest prosperity to all our people. as individuals compete with each other in all their internal trade and business. and are ever alert to increase their volume of commerce and meet their competitors. so nations in their internationalrelations are strong competitors for world markets. and so they direct their energies. usually first to the protection of their home markets. and second to secuing the greatest possible foreign market for their surplus. alert to meet these duties. the republican party has stood. first. for the protection of the home market. knowing that in the certainty and stability of that market is the greatest assurance of prosperity. while this war is on there is little need for this protection. the countries of the old world can not seriously invade our markets. all their energies must be directed toward the production of war materials. but the moment this slaughter ceases and the. -tide turns back to the normal. then more than ever before shall we need the old republican doctrine of protection. and wily? because these people. impoverished by war. can not wait to regain their lost manufacturing trade which would take years. so they will seize upon that which will bring the quickest returns. in from 6 to 16 weeks all agricultural products can be matured and ready for market. their first attention will. therefore. be given to agricultural production. again. those people. who during these years of carnage have accustomed themselves to rigid economy in food consumption. will be slow to return to the old and greater extravagances. that means that the foreign demand for our cereals will be diminished enormously at the close of the war. and we will be more than ever dependent upon our home markets. with our foreign markets enormously decreased or destroyed we shall more than ever need the republican policy of protection of our home markets against invasion. i am aware of the fact that it is often contended that if we are exporting cereals or flour therefrom. no protection can be given in the shape of duties on imports. no person. however. who understands the grain situation and the enormous size of this country would ever make such a statement. during a protective period of more than 20 years our spring wheat sections obtained a price averaging more than 10 cents per bushel above what such price would have been without the protection. our barley showed ah average of 25 cents per bushel over canadian barley. during a great proportion of the year 1910 minneapolis and liverpool quoted about the same figures. had we at that time had free trade with canada we should have been swamped with canadian grain and our prices driven down to the exporting price. which would have meant a loss of from 16 to 20.cents per bushel. a very important percentage when the price of wheat was only about $1 per bushel. so the republican party assures the american farmer the reinstatement of its policy of protection at the close of this great world conflict. in what other way can the government assist in placing agrlculture on a more prosperous basis? mr. president. the day of small independent businesses is rap. idly passing. economy to the highest possible degree is the watchword of success. while individual production may bo continued in some lines and. in agriculture. must be so carried on. distribution of the product demands combined or cooperative effort. as the period when the farmer traded his firkin of butter for a bolt of calico. his bushel of onions for a gallon of molasses was succeeded by the present period of intermediate commission men. so today the irresistible pressure of rapidly advancing economic conditions demands a rearrangement. if not a total abolition. of the present extravagant system of distribution of farm products. just as the growth of commerce made necessary the great bank clearance system of the country. so the vastness and complexity of commerce in food products demands today a cooperative system cf marketing. not only to stabilize the market for any product. but also to assure a fair return for the sale of every food product. the dumping of many carloads of peaches into the chicago river a few years ago because there was no wholesale demand. while hundreds of thousands of mouths in that city were watering for this luscious fruit. the selling at auction of hundreds of carloads of farm products to pay the charges for their transportation. condemn the present system. and a charge to the washington consumer of $1.50 for a melon for which the georgia producer was paid 5 cents demands the abara.donment of such an unjust and obsolete system and the construction of a new one that will bring together the producer who has a food article which he wishes to sell for a fair price and the consumer who needs that article and is willing to pay a just price for it. the form and scope of this new system is already foresbadowed in the many cooperative organizations of grain elevators. creameries. fruit growers. and so forth. which. while now scattered and unrelated. point the possibilities of a great. harmonious system governed and supported by a general law. and answering the needs of each of the hundreds of divers agricultural industries. how would i inaugurate this new system? first. i would enact a general federal law which would authorize and provide for the organization of one great central federal fooddistributing corporation. i would provide in that law for state or district suborganizations. the latter to be made up of groups of producers associated together under a coopeiative plan to market their products. i would bring them all under one uniform pl\"i. i would not make this corporation a government owned or government operated institution. that would mean to bureaucratize it to death. that would mean to load it down with government officials. that would mean to subject it to political influence. that would mean the usual government extravagance and inefficiency. i would simply have this corporation organized under federal laws. and as its operation would necessarily be interstate. for its protection against adverse state or municipal regulation. i would have it under general federal supervision. then i would have the federal government assist. as far as government can assist by law. in promulgating the purpose of this association. which purpose would be to assure the producer a market for his farm products at a fair and just price and to protect the consumer from extortionate or robber charges. the california fruit growers association. whose usefulness has been marvelous. points the benefits of such cooperation and affofds suggestions for a general law covering the marketing of all agricultural products. mr. president. about 35.000.000 people in this country are dependent upon the products of the soil for a living. whether that living be meager or good depends upon three principal factors--climatic conditions. insects and other pests. and markets. the first two are beyond the control of humanity or the government. for that reason agriculture must always be more or less uncertain. the agriculturist can never anticipate with any degree of accuracy the value of his years labor. unlike the laborer or the mechanic. who can compute with certainty just what his services will produce in a given the. the farmer must always be governed by chance. he must wage war against all the hundreds of destructive agencies and accept whatever th chances of victory or defeat may yield him. hail and winds. !111190 heat and cold. drought and deluge. hessian fly and cllinch bug. potato bug and cattle tick. boll weevil and fruit scab. cholera and blackleg. wild mustard and wild oats. french weed and canadian thistle. russian cactus and quack grass. and a hundred other pestiferous weeds and evils make his vocation not only one of constant warfare. but one of uncertain return. but. notwithstanding all these discouragements and uncertainties. humanity with natural affection still clings to the soil. and. mr. president. it is well for the country that this is so. for were the vocation of every man governed solely by its profits farming in this country would long since have been abandoned. to whatever extent the production of other articles may vary. national safety demands that the food production as a whole must be stable and sure. the wearing apparel. however threadbare. can still be worn for another month. if necessary. but the stomach can not remain empty a day without dire results. so if there be any one industry in the whole country that ought to be encouraged. that ought to have extended to it the sympathetic and assisting hand of congress. it is that of agriculture. and the only way to encourage it is to assure to it a degree of prosperity commensurate with other lines of business. people abandon farms because there is more drudgery and less profit than in other vocations. make farming just as profitable and the tide will immediately flow back to the land. mr. president. i speak of this proposed government assistance in marketing the food products of the country within our own domains and in every city of tie union as an advauced republican policy. because it is in conformity with the republican idea of governmental assistance to every industry. and is contrary to the democratic idea of permitting every business to take its chance in [le competitive world. as applied to farming. and especially to grain and stock raising. the democratic idea is that if this farmer or stock raiser is able to eke out a mere existence on his farm. is able to earn enough to satisfy his hunger and cheaply clothe himself and family. lie is receiving all he is entitled to. that. if through storm or flood or drought lie loses a crop. the general governinent might .properly dole him out sufficient means to tide him over the disastrous year. or. failing to do that. open some pork barrel of public appropriations in his vicinity. into which lie may thrust his hand for hisproportionate share. the republican policy is that agriculture as a business should enjoy a prosperity sufficient to enable the farmer to live as well as those engaged in other vocations. to have equal comiforts and opportunities to pay wages and salaries. whether to members of his family or others. equal to tie wages and salaries paid for like services in other employments. and still be able to lay aside a reasonable surplus to ameet the lean years and to care for himself and those dependent upon him when the feeble hands of age cami no longer wield the working tools of life. the one party satisfies itself with alis appropriations. the other seeks to insure a prosperity that will place the business above all alms taking. the one party by its policies and principles says. \"let us take from the rich and give to the poor anlolg us.\" the other says. \"let us have no paupers among us.\" imr. president. we need in this country today a campaign of education. we not only want to bring the food producer and food consumer face to frce in a commercial sense. \"in the sale and purchase of farm products. but we want to bring them face to face to tie end that each can understand the just and equitable rights of tile other. we who speak for [lie farmer ask this of the consumer of his products: are you willing to pay him such a price for his prodnets as will enable him to earn as nuch in .eight hours of labor as you earn in an equal number of hours of labor? are you willing to sell your services to him. either directly or when coined into manufactured articles. on tie same basis that you purchase his labor coined into food products? we ask tie business man. tie merchant: are you willing to allow the farmer such a price for his products as will enable him to pay his wife and his children. who perform work on the farm. just wvhat lie would be required to pay others to do the same work? in other words. do the sale as you do when you employ meiibers of your family in your store or in your bank? this. then. is the republican policy toward agriculture. namely. to assist in every way to place it on a paying basis. to nake it a business for profit and not merely a means of existence. we should educate tie american people. [ile aiierican consumer. to a cleat and definite understanding of tlie equitable rights of the producer. tie right to receive a price for his products that will eiable him to have and enjoy the same comforts and luxumies that are enjoyed by those conducting tie ordinamy business avocations in our cities. the right to exchange his labor on a plane of equality with other like labor in our great cities. the right to a reasonable interest on his investment in land and equipment. in addition to salaries allowed to each and every member of his family performing services. and in addition to all other expenses and depreciation charges connected with the operation of his farming business the right to lay aside a reasonable surplus to meet the exigencies incident to all farming operations and the necessities of the advancing years. toward that end the republican party should stand ever pledged. cbmpare this with the attitude of the democratic party. an attitude that most\" naturally follows its policy of neglect. i would scarcely be warranted inasserting a prejudice or a premeditated hostility on the part of that party toward the northern farmer. but i would be clearly within the facts in declaring that this party continually subjects the northern farmer to wrongs and injustices for the benefit of those following other vocations. and with a heartlessness that ought to challenge the resentment of every tiller of the soil. i need go no further back than the treatment accorded by officials of the present administration to demonstrate this hostility. our democratic friends have always preached that the government could do nothingto assist the wheat raiser. that he should be let alone to secure the best price a world market would give him . but the moment the world market gave him a good price. a price determined by the law of supply and demand. they did not let him alone. on the contrary. they immediately forced him to accept $2.20 a bushel at the terminal markets when the world demand and the american demand were giving him $3 to $3.07 at such terminal markets. in its price fixing the farmers wheat was the only important product that was reduced in price. and that was reduced in the face of an increase in price of everything the farner must purchase. an increase ranging from 100 to 400 per cent. the government sen6 out its circulars and bid for country labor against the farmers until in my state farmers were compelled to either pay 80 cents an hour to labor to thrash their crops or allow them to rot in the field. the government took possession of the railways and telegraph lines of the country. and. though employees of the former had already been granted a 25 per cent increase in. 1916. their wages were again enormously increased in 1917 and 1918. this increase compelled the raising of freight rates. and these increased rates were charged back against the farmer whose earnings had just been reduced. by reducing the price of wheat s0 cents per bushel. on the agricultural department basis of the 1918 crop. the wheat raisers lost about $800.000.000. it is safe to say that by reasoln of the increase in freight rates. necessitated by the increase of salaries and wages to railway employees. the wheat raisers lost another $200.000.000. or about $1.000.000.000 altogether. and. mr. president. while the government forced the price of wheat down 80 cents per bushel. how did it treat other industries? how did it treat the millers who grind and sell the farmers wheat. and the packers who buy and distribute the farmers cattle? mr. president. it allowed them to increase their earnings above prewar earnings from 200 to 500 per cent. i take tho figures here quoted from the report of the federal trade commission. for four years ending june 30. 1916. the average annual profit of the american millers per barrel of flour was 131 cents. the average price received by such millers on the allowances made by the food and fuel commissions was 52 cents per barrel. an increase of 400 per cent. some aills made a profit as high as $2 per barrel. swift. morris. and cudahy made a combined average profit for the years 1912. 1913. and 191.4 of about $19.000.000 per year. then this food commission. which cut down the farmers grain 80 cents per bushel. or 26i per cent. and which also fixed the selling price of the meat packers. allowed them to make a profit in one year of about .$87.000.000. an increase of 350 per cent. while this commission cut down the farmers wheat price 26.j per cent it allowed the leather manufacturers. who purchase the hides of the farmers cattle. to increase their earnings about 500 per cent. the government also fixed the price of steel products. this same federal trade conmission finds that this administration. which forced the wheat raisers to accept a loss of $800.000.000. allowed certain important steel companies. whose net earnings were $46.500.000 in 1914. to increase those earnings in a single year to $294.000.000. an increase of more than 500 per cent. i might carry this on to cover hundreds of other industries. surely i am justified in asserting that if the democratic party has earned the gratitude of all those to whon its administration has allowed increased salaries to such an enormous extent. it i has certainly earned the condemnation of every american farmer whose interests have been sacrificed for the benefit of these other classes. mr. president. i can not close this argument in defense of our farming population without replying to and refuting the charge often made against the farmers of the northwest. and especially those of my own state. who have sought to redress their grievances by becoming members of the nonpartisan league. the charge of disloyalty to the country. such a charge is worse than a slander. whether uttered in political campaigns or through the medium of the press. there are no more patriotic people in the united states than the farmers of the nbrthwest. i shall not discuss the political theories of those who are at the head of this organization. their beliefs may be wholly socialistic or paternalistic. but the membership of the organization is made up of farmers of every shade of political belief and theory. you will find anmng them the most radical re_publicans and the most obstinate democrats. you will find the socialist. pure and simple. and those who never departed from the idea of individual ownership. you can no more charge that the members of this organization as a whole are socialists than you can declare that all those who believe in government ownership and operation of railvays and other public utilities are socialists. what we ought to do is to try to ascertain what is at the bottom of this movement and what caused the movement. the rapid development of this organization ought to convince any thoughtful man that there must have been a condition of discontent and dissatisfaction with the present order of things and we should direct our attention to its cause. i have fully realized the situation and during every year of my official life i have put forth my utmost endeavors to make the congress and the country realize it. i have again and again presented the con.ditions which discriminated against the farmer. and i have again and again prophesied just what has happened. that these people would some day organize and make their power felt in an effort to remedy injustice and inequalities. all complaints of the farmers can find their basis in this neglectful attitude. which is the political theory of the democratic party. and these complaints. in my opinion. have not received the full consideration that should have been given by the republican party. i shall not say that we have given too much consideration to the interests of our great city populations but that we have given too little consideration to the comparative interests of our country populations. as a result of this neglect of country interests our cities have become so abnormally wealthy as compared with the country. the earnings so incomparably greater than in the country. that the people of the cities have lived on a plane of luxury. extravagance. and comfort far beyond the possibilities of country life. the everincreasing cost in the price of labor and in manufacturers and retailers prices to maintain this higher standard of city life las found no fair counterpart in farm life. taking my own state as an illustration. 95 per cent of its products must be shipped and sold outside its own borders. our state laws therefore couhl not protect the farmers in the matter of distribution and sale of their products. timey were at the mercy of trade organizations built up and conducted for their own financial benefit in every great city of the country. it was inevitable that the farmers should get the worst of it under such a system. they should have been helped to free themselves from the clutches of that system. failing to secur.) that. help from the national government. they sought through this organization to help themselves. t do not think anyone can call me a socialist. i am so far from it that i never believe in the government attempting to do that which the individual citizen can do as well or better. i have never known a government enterprise that was not vastly nore expensive and far less efficient than it would have been if operated by individuals. when the government enters into any line of business enterprise it must recoup its losses and meet its extravagances by taxing the very people who may be in competition with it. a manifestly -unfair thing to do. but it must be remembered that in our state there is but one businessagriculture. therefore that state can lend its assistance to that industry in many ways without injustice to any other industry. it can not be said that by rendering this assistance to agriculture you are levying a tax on the miner or the manufacturer. for we have no miner and no manufacturer. every dollar expended by the citizens of our state must first come out of our own state soil. if the farmer does not get that dollar. no one gets it. we should. therefore. be most liberal in assisting this farmer to increase his dollars. his increased prosperity will add just that much to the prosperity of all our people. the patriotism of our north dakota farmer. whether within this league or out of it. can not be justly questioned. by my standard of measurement that patriotism is of the veryhighest quality. because. notwithstanding the fact that the government grossly discriminated against him. notwithstanding the fact that the government forced down the price of his product far below the market price and at the same time grossly boosted upward--doubled and trebledthe price of everything he must pur.chase. he has nevertheless met every libertybond call to the full limit of his ability. and if that is not a test of fidelity and patriotism. then i know of no true standard. i cahi only say to the farmers of the country that the republican party today stands for the advancement of the agricultural interests of this country until it reaches a plane of prosperity equal to other great industries. until the american farmer and his family can have and enjoy all the comforts and luxuries enjoyed by other prosperous vocations throughout the land. and it will proceed to enact legislation to accomplish that purpose.","mr. speaker. the old. 6ld argumnent that has been made by gentleien opposed to this bill every time a veto has been considered is. \".y6u must stand by the president.\" whether that veto stands for the people 6r not. i am not going to criticize tile president. i believe that lie is a great president and a great man. but the alpeal that gentlemen have made ought liot to swerve men who on their oaths are responsible to the people that sefit them here. the president himself. in his veto message two years ago. referring to the illiteracy test. said: has any political party ever avowed a policy of restriction in this fundamlintal manner. gone to the country on it. and been commissioned to control its legislation?. mr. speaker. that message as well as this message shows that the pregident has not had the opportunity to give the subject the careful and thorough investigation that the representatives of the people. who are responsible to the people. have done. before that time both the republican party and the democratic paity had made platform declarations on the subject. the republican party in its platform of 1896 had declared specifically for the test and went to the people and was commissioned by them to control legislation. tile democratic party as far back as 1896 declared in its national platform in favor of the exclusion of all pauper labor. the president refers in his message of last monday to the lack of educational opportunity of illiterate aliens. mr. speaker. in these days lack of opportunity among the most illiterate people who come here does not exist. they come principally from southern italy. and of the north italians not more than 5 per cent are illiterate. and yet they. the north and south italians. live under the same king. the same parliament. the same compulsory education laws. and while the north italian does embrace the opportunity he has had. the. south italian. does not. we get literates from south italy. which shows that men can make their own opportunity if they want to. in so far as an elementary educhtion is concerned. mr. speaker. the president also gives another reason for the veto. he gives as his second reason. which reason i se6 my distinguished friend. the gentleman from illinois .. has not discussed. that the exemption from the test of persons fleeing -solely to escape religious persecution. imposes an invidious function on our- immigration officials.-. he says .he disapproves the provision that was put in at the instance of the gentleman from illinois himself. and now the gentlemans support of the veto of the president puts him in the attitude of votingto disown hisown child. in the goodness of their hearts the members of our committee and of this congress have said thhtthose who are fleeing froi religioui persecution shoild be admitted. whether that persecution was manifested by law. by overt acts. or by governmental regulations. the president gives as his reason that that provision allows an administrative officer to pass upon the laws and regulations of other countries. as has been said in this debate by the gentleman from massachusetts [mr. g aduafa]. we have had a law for many years which provides. that persons who have been convicted of. or. who admit the commission of. a felony or other crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude are to be excluded. and in the same section it says: nothing in this act shall exclude. if otherwise admissible. persons convicted of an offense purely political. not involving moral turpitude. that provision involves the same kind of function as the one the president gives as his second reason for vetoing the bill. yet. no such trouble as the president fears has ever arisen from such function. we should not lose sight of the fact that the bill contains much other needed legislation which the president says he favors. and in this connection i wish to read the following article from the editorial page of the new york*times of last monday. it was written by prof. robert de c. ward. of harvard university. prof. ward says: in your editorial article in the times for january 20 entitled \"the labor exclusion bill.\" you say: \" the new bill is against the entry of. desirables. it is not in the interest of public morality or public health.\" may i take the liberty of differing with you most emphatically in this view? i hold no brief at this time for the reading test. it seems to me. however. that most of those who attack this provision have not read the immigration bill at all and do not realize that this bill covers about sixty pages. of which perhaps one or two pages concern this muchdiscussed reading test. with the many exceptions which are made in its application. this provision seems to me a rather unimportant part of the bill as a whole. it certainly is not worth all the fuss that is being made over it. it is in regard to the rest of the billthe 58 or 59 pages of it not concerned with the reading testthat i wish here to speak. the new bill. in my judgment. is distinctly not \" against the entry of desirables.\" and as certainly is \" in the interest of public morality and public health.\" the bill is the result of years of careful study of our present law and of its workings. its provisions. as the commissioner general of immigration says in his annual report (june 30. 1915). \" contain the result of experience and investigationof the experience of administrative officers. extending over nearly a quarter of a century. in. the enforcement of various statutes regulating immigration. and of the investigations conducted variously but in particular by the immigration commission. created under the act of 1907. the report of which. comprising 42 volumes. was submitted to congress in december. 1910.\" the provisions of this bill \" have been drawn with great care and thoughtfulness. * * * by them the law is made certain in its definitions and clear in its terms throughoutimrovements badly needed in the existlug statute.\" the bill aims to protect the united states against the incoming of mentally and physically and of otherwise unfit and undesirable aliens. it also embodies several provisions which would insure more humane treatment to the aliens themselves and would to a large extent do away with the hardships involved in the deportation of aliens who are excluded at our ports by preventing their original embarkation. to the excluded classes the bill adds persons of constitutional psychopathic inferiority and persons with chronic alcoholism. that many persons not properly certified as insane but who would. in many cases. become insane soon after arrival. could be kept out under the former provision has long been the opinion of the physicians. the alienists. and the immigration officials who have made a special study of this suhect. and who have for years strongly urged the inclusion of this new provision in our immigration law. chronic alcoholics who are surely undesirable members of our community. are often discovered by our examining surgeons. but as the law does not now state specifically that they shall be excluded they must in most cases be allowed to land. the new bill excludes vagrants. and persons afflicted with tuberculosis in any form. it also aims. to prevent the embarkation of aliens afflicted with idiocy. insanity. imbecility. feeblemindedness. epilepsy. constitutional psychopathic inferiority. chronic alcoholism. tuberculosis in any form. or a loathsome or dangerous contagious disease. by imposing upon steamship companies who bring such aliens a fine of $200 plus the amount paid by the excluded alien from his initial point of departure. provided the secretary bf labor is satisfied that the defects could have been detected by a competent medical examination before embarkation. this is an excellent and humane provision. and wofild go far toward making these companies more careful in the sale of pasage tickets and would save many unfortunate aliens the disappointment and hardship of being deported after arrival at our ports. the present fine of $100. has been shown to he too small to be really effective. and does not cover as many cases as are above enumerated. a new fine of $25. plus the aliens transportation expenses. is established in cases of certain other less serious mental defects and of physical defects which may affect- an aliens ability to earn his living. the new bill provides for a very much more thorough medical examination of arriving aliens. especially with reference to the detection of mental diseases. gives the medical ins pectors the services of interpreters and suitable facilities for the detention and examination of the aliens. this amendment has been strongly urged by the united action of the most important scientific bodies in the united states which deal with the prevention and treatment of mental disease. by state medical associations. and by individual physicians all over the country. that our medical inspection. has been hopelessly inadequate has long been known: to the experts.. we have not had enough medical inspectors- and those on duty have not had adequate facilities for their work. thus it has come about that. in spite of our law prohibiting the admission of insane andi mentally defective aliens. our institutions have.been filling.up with just these people. the new bill extends from three to five years the period during which allens.may. be deported.who at the time of entry belonged to one or more- of the excluded classes. who have become public charges from causes existing prior to landing.. knd of some other groups. this extension of the deportation period has been urged. year in and year out. by heads of institutions who have had to do with dependent. defective. and delinquent aliens. by organized charitable societies. and. perhaps most strongly. by the former commissioner of immigration at the port of new york. the [en. william williams. whose thorough. sane and illuminating study of the whole immigration problem has contributed greatly to our understanding of the subject. it is the conviction of all the unprejudiced experts who have studied this problem that a fiveyear deportation period would relieve our penal and charitable institutions. of an enormous financial burden. reaching into the millions of dollars. and would rid our communities of large numbers of defectives who otherwise would remain here. many of them a burden upon state or city. and many of them starting long lines of defective and delinquent children. the new bill strengthens the provisions of existing law regarding the \"whiteslave \" traffic. makes the inspection of steerage .quarters more thorough. compels steamship companies. when deporting aliens. to give such aliens as good quarters as those for which they paid on the voyage to this country. makes possible the expulsion from the country of alien anarchists and criminals. even when they have become such after entry. and in many other ways provides for the welfare of the alien as well as for the welfare of the united states. gentlemen have talked here about the south wanting this legislation. as if the south alone wanted it. mr. speaker. the pressure for this bill comes more strongly from the workingmen of the north. where they feel the effect of pauper competition. three millions of the american federation of labor. 1.000.000 farmers in the national grangei hav e their resolution here--a million or two of farmers in the farmers congress. thousands of members of patriotic organizations. and others. they are begging members today to stand by their people. to stand by their convictions. there is no sectionalism in this bill. the president is just one branch of this government. three hundred and seven. against eightyseven. members of this house said last march that the people of the country wanted this legislation. are we. now. by appeals to stand by the presidentand that is all they have--to be diverted from what our people want and what is right in order that 307 may bow to the will of one man? mr. speaker. i want. as briefly as possible. to give an analysis of the most important new legislation in this bill. as i am sure that it will soon become a law. the head tax is increased from $4 to $8 for admission of aliens. however. we exempt from this tax children under 16 years of age who accompany their father or mother. the present law exacts this tax of all aliens. including even babes in the arms of the mother. the exception referred to in favor of children under 16 years of age will prevent this tax bringing in quite double the revenue now derived from that source. but the fact that in the new law it is exacted of allen seamen and some others now exempted will bring it up to almost double what we now receive. in section 3 we add to the excluded classes many who are either mentally or physically afflicted not now excluded. also persons who advocate or teach the unlawful destruction of property. this will keep out the militant suffragettes of england and other persons advocating like principles. while i am not an advocate of womans suffrage. yet be it said to the credit of nearly all the good women of america who favor equal suffrage that they are trying to get that legislation by sane and peaceful m~thods. even those who are trying to exploit themselves by picketing the white house grounds get no sympathy from. the great majority of the women who are from principle advocating womans suffrage. and the three members of the immigration committee from equalsuffrage states were among the strongest advocates of this provision of the bill. the law excluding contract laborers and those in any way assisted. induced. or solicited to come to this country. and against those who induce. assist. or solicit them to come has been greatly strengthened. asiatics excluded by the geographical boundary in section 3 of the bill embrace hindus and several hundred millions of other people on the continent of asia and islands adjacent thereto. these people are beginning to come to the pacific coast in large numbers. and but for this exclusion law would soon become a serious menace to our country. the chineseexclusion law is not interfered with except to be greatly strengthened. and we now have a gentlemans agreement with japan by which passports are refused the coolies of that empire. who are thus kept out. a provision is placed in this law by which no alien can be admitted who is now in any way excluded from or prevented from enter:ing the united states. should japan at any time violate or abrogate this agreement. eo instanti this provision would keep them out. the storm center of this bill is and ias ever been the illiteracy test. this excludes all aliens over 16 years of age who are unable to read at least 30 ordinary words of english or some other language or dialect. including hebrew or yiddish. however. any admissible alien. or any alien heretofore admitted is permitted to send for or bring in ris father or grandfatherover 65 years of age. his wife. mother. grandmother. or his unmarried or widowed daughter without regard to the illiteracy test. if they are otherwise admissible. these exceptions are made so as not to keep out dependent relatives on account of their being unable to read. in order that our country may continue. as it has always been. the haven for those oppressed on account of religious belief. we except from the reading test.all aliens seeking admission to avoid religious persecution. whether such persecution is evidenced by overt acts or by laws or governmental regulations that discriminate against the alien or the race to which he belongs because of his religious faith. this exception will effect not only many russian jews. but many protestants and catholics from armenia and other countries. the literacytest provision has for many years been the subject of earnest and sometimes bitter controversy. in 1897 a somewhat similar provision was vetoed by president cleveland. the house promptly passed it over his veto by a large margin. but. as it only reached the senate for actl6n on the veto on the 4th of march in the closing hours of that congress and of mr. clevelands administration. it was not acted on by that body. there was some excuse for the veto of president cleveland. for at that time the tremendous alien immigration from southern europe to this country had not set in. during the year 1897 the total foreign immigration to this country was only 230.832. while for the year ending june 30. 1914. it was 1.218.480. the south italians alone coming in during the last fiscal year before the war in europe were 251.612. or 20.000 more than came in from all cointries during the year of president clevelands veto. so it will be. seen that no such necessity for the law existed then as now. of course. with tile war raging in europe. the number of arrivals has greatly decreased. but when the war is over huffdlreds of thousands of the denizens of the slums of european and of asiatic cities will rush to our shores unless they are kept out by this law. in 1913 president taft vetoed the bil and the senate passed it over his veto bya vote of 4 to 1. but it failed of passage over his veto in the house by only a few votes.in 1915 president wilson vetoed the bill and it failed of passage over the veto by only eight votes. last march the bill passed this house by a vote of 307 to 87. and a few weeks ago it passed the senate by 64 to 7. unless many representatives and senators go back on this recent vote. it will nov be passed over the presidents veto in both houses by a large majority. twelve years ago. at my own request. i was assigned to the committee on immigration and began the study of this important question. during that session the senate passed a bill containing the illiteracy test. but that provision was stricken out by the house. and in conference an agreement was reached providing for a commission to investigate the subject of immigration both in tie united states and foreign countries and to report its conclusions to congress. i was appointed as a member of that commission. and with five others visited europe. where we made extensive investigations. several of us went to sicily. and to me the conditions there seemed worse than i had ever dreamed of. we visited many other countries in europe and made extensive investigations both in that country and our own. when we began our investigations only three or four of us believed that the reading test was the best plan for restricting immigration. but after three years of earnest. careful investigation all the nine joined in the following statements and recoinmendations: the investigations of the commission show an oversupply of unskilled. labor in basic industries to an extent which indicates an oversupply of unskilled labor in the industries of the country as a whole. and therefore demand legislation which will at the present time restrict the further admission of such unskilled labor. * * * as far as possible the aiiens excluded should be those who. by reason of their personal qualities. would least readily be assimilated or would make the least desirable citizens. the commission as a whole recommends restriction as demanded by economic. moral. and social considerations. furnishes in its report reasons for such restrictions. and points out methods by which congress can attain the desired result it its judgment coincides with that of the commission. eight out of the nine. after citing various methods of restriction. concurred in the following: a majority of the commission favor the reading and writing test as the most feasible single method of restricting undesirable immigration. it is certainly interesting. and we believe iniportant. to know some of the reasons which led the commission up to these conchisiobs. and we will make.a few extracts from the \" brief statemeat of conclusions and recommendations of the commission.\" on page 25 of this statdment they say: the proportion of the mere serious crimes of homicide. blackmail. and robbery. as well as the least serious offenses is greater among the foreign born. the disproportion in this regard is due principally to the t evalence of homicides and other crimes of personal violence among telians and to the violation of city ordinances previously mentioned. on pages 29 and 30 they say: it is certain that southern and eastern european immigrants have almost completely monopolized unskilled labor activities in many of the more important industries. this phase of the industrial situation was made the most important and exhaustive feature of the commissions investigation and the results show that while the competition of these immigrants has had little. if any. effect on the highly skilled trades. nevertheless. through lack of industrial progress and by reason of large and constant reenforcement from abroad. it has kept conditions in the semiskilled and unskilled occupations from advancing. several elemedts peculiar to the new immigrants contributed to this iesult. they came from countries where low economic conditions prevailed and where conditions of labor were bad. they were content to .accept wages and conditions which the native american and immigrants of the older class had come to regard as unsatisfactory. they were not. as a rule. engaged at lower wages than had been paid to the older workmen for the same class of labor. but their presence in constantly increasing numbers prevented progress among the older wageearning class. and as a result that class of employees was gradually replaced. an instance of this displacement is shown in the experience in the bituminous coal mines of western pennsylvania. this section of the bituminous field was the one first entered by the new immigrants. and the displacement of the old workers was soon under way. some of them entered other occupations and many of them migrated to the coal fields of the middle west. later these fields were also invaded by the new immigrants. and large numbers of the old workers again migrated to the mines of the southwest. where they still predominate. the effect of the new immigration is celearly shown in the western pennsylvania fields. where the average wage of the bituminous coal worker is 42 cents a day below the average wage in the middle west and southwest. incidentally. hours of labor are longer and general working conditions poorer in the pennsylvania mines than elsewhere. the recent report of the committee on industrial relations on their investigations at youngstown. ohio. shows that conditions there are even more horrible than those which our commission found in pennsylvania. i will read only the following short extract from -that report: babies of the workers die -at an appalling rate. fortyone per cent of ill deaths in youngstown during 1913. according to united states census figures. were of children under 5 years of age. the average head ofa family among foreignborn steel workers. who constitute over 70 per cent -of the entire force. earns less than $500 a year. the workers and their families live in squalid. overcrowded houses. -a trachoma epidemic at east youngstown grew so menacing that the youngstown sheet &amp; tube co.. whose armed guards on january 7 killed 3 strikers and wounded 25. had to take drastic measures to save the human part of its equipment. sanitary conditions in youngstown in the districts where the steel workers live are frightful. the administration of the health. laws is lax. and open garbage boxes and dry privies abound. for years. until the present demand for unskilled labor gave them a choice of jobs. the steel workers have been forced to accept whatever the steel corporation and its followers cared to give them or to starve. this condition of helplessness and economic slavery was forced on them by a policy that kept. with the aid of charity. two men for every job and that ruthlessly crushed any attempt of the employees to organize. the youngstown strike was a sign to the owners and managers of the american steel industry that the end will come. that they can not forever adhere to their present policy of depressing wages below a decent standard by maintaining a vast horde of helpless immigrants in a condition of economic subserviency. throwing them on charity during times of depression. paying less than a living wage during times of prosperity. and during all times brutalizing them either by imposing excessive hours of employment orby imposing the enforced leisure that breeds fear and pauperization. even around birmingham and gadsden. ala.. the honest american laborer is being forced into competition with that low class of illiterate immigrants from southern europe who are brought here to beat down the price of the workingmans sweat and toil and thus take the bread from the mouths of his wife and children. a few years.ago i asked a large mine operator in alabama who were his poorest laborers. he replied: \"the south italians.\" i asked if they were poorer than the negro. he said: \"infinitely poorer.\" i asked: \"why. then. do you employ them?\" *he answered : \"to keep down the price of wages.\" gentlemen. that is true. and that is why the big industries all over the country have spent thousands of dollars during the last 10 years to delay this bill. it has teeth in it and they know it. my republican brother and i may differ honestly as to whether a protective tariff is best for the workingman. but i can not see how any friend of the man who toils can want to keep out the foreign goods that compete with those he makes here and yet want to open the floodgates to those who beat down his wages and erect standards of living repulsive to any man who loves his home and those whom god has given him to protect and support. the distifiguished gentleman from illinois says the bill does not keep out the blackhand assassin. because he can read and write. the illiteracy test. it is true. does not keep out that class. but as is shown by mr. ward in the article just quoted. there are other sections of the bill that do debar him. but the illiteracy test keeps out the illiterate and vicious alien who is the easy tool in the hands of his blackhand leader. in the i. w. w. strike. at lawrence. mass.. a few years ago the educated blackhander led the long procession and stirred them to frenzy and to crime. but behind him was the horde of illiterates with a bomb in one handand a banner in the other on which was inscribed \"no god. no law. no master.\" but you ask. whom will it keep out? it will keep out 40 per cent of the south italians. the portuguese. the turks. and the syrians. about 30 per cent of the .greeks. the poles. the magyars. and other races in southern europe. and about 80 per cent of the mexicans. it will not keep out onehalf of 1 per cent of the english. irish. scotch. germans. bohemians. swiss. french. scandinavians and the other peoples of northwestern europe. that is. it will not keep out five in a thousand of those who come to become american citizens and to make their homes among us. for instance. during the fiscal year ending june 30. 1914. 33.898 irish came in. and of these only 359 over 14 years of age could not read and write. and nearly all of these were of the classes exempted from the illiteracy test. as to the. jews. very few adult males are unable to read their yiddish or hebrew prayer book. and most of the jews who can not read yiddish or hebrew are wives. mothers. or daughters. who are excepted. and nearly all are fleeing from religious persecution. so you will see that neither the jews nor the northwestern europeans are excluded scarcely at all. i have gone pretty fuliy into the purpose and effect of the illiteracy test because of the fact that it has been grossly misunderstood and misrepresented. a -few years ago as learned .a man as cardinal gibbons wrote a letter. which was printed in the papers of the country. stating that an alien fairly well educated in his own language would be debarred under this bill if he could not read english. this showed that his eminence had never even read the bill. many others have heralded such statements abroad and aroused the antagonism of thousands of foreigners. the people of whose countries are in no wise affected by the bill. mr. speaker. in passing this bill over the veto of the president. we are responding to the demand of millions of people who tire working on the farms. in the factories. in the stores. and thousands of others who do not want to see american civilization undermined. and who do not want to see american standards of moral and economic life subverted. in the south the farmers union with two millions of members has repeatedly indorsed it. is this not the propitious time to put up the bars-? your votes today will show which side you are on. if the steamship companies and the great industries are your masters. sarve them. if you owe your allegiance to america and your people. say so this day.","i will say to you thatt i am a ]epublican protectionist. a real protectionist. i am not only for at tariff. but i am in favor of protecting american industry and american labor. in this connection i would like any gentlenin who will follow me to explain this away and clear us all before tile amnerican workingmen. whose votes we all seek and whomn we all promise before we are elected what we are going to do for thein. i .would like to ask any american protectionist what protection it is to unskilled labor to have all the mountainhigh tariff laws you can erect if you qre going to allow this free flow of a million and a quarter of foreigners to come here and compete with that labor? my friends. it is possibleand we subscribe to it cheerfullyfor this government to take away all out- property. tax it nwny. this government can come and. as some one here said. draft us. as was incorporated in a bill the other day. and not only take our possessions. but take us to protect the country. ]now. if we are willing that that shoulh be doneand we surely arethen it is the duty of this governent to protect her citizens. and that is not done when a million and a quarter of foreigners are allowed to come here to compete with american labor and prostitate and degrade the dignity and lower the standard of living of our workingmen. now. in proof. mr. chairman. that a condition most horrible exists in this country in that respect let me read a letter written by a minister living in vermont. he tells us what the american workingman must compete against. and this is what he says about the tariff we read so much about and about which we speak so mnuch here: why can not congress see the fundamental relation of the whole matter of protection and immigration? certainly tm great hordes of alen and women who face low european wages after the war ceases will not remain in europe if they can coie here. some time ago we made a survey of our town. we found within a stones throw of the main street that rnns by our church three houses remade from small stables. such as one has when lie keeps a horse and cow. with place for a buggy and a hayloft. in these three houses there were 47 1olalcks. made up of 9 families (9 men and 9 women). 17 children. and 12 boarders. these mien can and do undercut american wages. for americans can not and will not live as these people live. i am for americans first. last. :-nd always. in labor. in preparedness. and everything else. one gets a. little different view of such things when one gets away from an agricultural district into a region where american industry should thrive. in the discussion of foreign inmigration the nativity of our own ancestors is natually suggested. voltaire said great and good luen do not need to stand on wlt ancestors did or did not do. a young man in ili]iladelplhia spent a great sul of money having the genealogy of his family run out. only to be told after soei considerable time that lie was merely an adopted son. an irish lady whein asked where her ancestors sprang front replied. \"my ancestors (lid not spring from anywhere . they nlays sprung at el.\" when \" uncle joe\" cannon was asked as to his nationality. his response was that lie was part english. part irish. part hungarian. and quite some american. but that it made little difference as to his forbears. for. after all. the llongrel pup often made tile best trick dog. of course it is only human nature to be proud of great and good ancestors and to say little about aind try to forget those who were not. the question with us nov is not one of ancestors and ]low we got here. but it is a question of vital importance and interest to deteinine where ve are going and ]low we will get there. carrying as we do this excess baggage in tile shape of 1.200.000 illiterate foreigners added to the republics load each year. in any ailgument we amy offer we will not nndertake to justify our gronnd by presenting or attempting to present comparisons with the past. for there is no country and no past that is great enougi nii broad enolgh and comprehensive enough ill any division of govermnent or econoniy to be in any sense a guiding lamp for this the mightiest nation and only successful confederated democracy the word has ever seen. being without counterpart. the future of this nation must be therefore uncharted. ant tile hope of its perpetuation must necessarily rest upon the sheet anchor of christianity. patriotism and intelligence. we find in goldwin sniths book the interesting story of ou early colonization. but there is nothing even there that could act as a guide or precedent in measuring up to the requirements of the present crisis. for me i care little about lislory or tradition in connection with this immigration business. . i would much prefer to stand omn the ground held by that great philosopher and republican statesman. thomas b. reed. who once said lie catred not so much for time pedantic maxims and theories of the bookmen. nor so inuch as to ]how a proposal might soulld or look . what lie wanted to know as influencing ills decision and conclusion in the last analyst.. was. how does it work? it is too often tile tendency in public discussion for scholars to point to rome and greece and endeavor to frame a comparison ofl contlitions with then and now. it is all pointed out with splendid ilmgination wily and how these once great states rotted lnl fell into decay. many thousands have accepted as accurate the conclusions of these scholars. but there are others who a ie skeptical as to whheter these governments of rome and igreece ever were as great and potential as the historians record. but even if correct. ]ionme. in her highest glory under augustus cesar. batd but 54.000.000 population. and it is said that loore than (0 l)er cent counted within her dominions were slaves and barbarians. when the great battle of marathon was fought the population of greece is estimated to have beenbut three and onehalf jiillions.. there is certainly nothing bewildering albout this. and surely these governments could not possibly have been called upon to solve the uniny complex conoric questions which the great american peol)le have stecessfully negotiated . and no main vill contend that we could not in a single day raise more and better fighting troop3 right in pennsylvania than. ever fought under the standards of greece at any one. time. these countries may have fallen ad their glory departed because of corruption. but that corruption was due to the fact that those countries were pagan and not christian. this nation will live because it is christian. although this question of immigration is more vital than the trust issue and the tariff question and has direct bearing on both. it relates in no way to your ancestors and mine. but does have much to do with the future of our children. it is a question to be determined whether americans or foreigners are to govern and control the united states. let us accept tom reeds method of holding the scales and arriving at results. and not be misled and swayed by momentary impulses because our ancestors cane from somewhere some time ago. or be blinded by the sentiment of the hour when the country stands. in such imminent peril. there is nothing analogous in the causes which caused rome and greece to fall with the perils which beset this country. and there is no relationship or analogy with the kind of people who came here 100 or 200 years ago and those who are coming here n1ow. * even of the kind coming here now we might assimilate a few. but if the onrushing horde continues in unabated numbers the dominance of the anglosaxon is doomed on this continent. with me it is a question of number and kind. and therein rests my opposition to unrestricted immigration. your ancestors and mine perhaps came from the north 6f europe. emigrating from the fair valleys of the palatinate. they were people whose ancestors were first heard of as emerging from the baltic sea section. and were referred to by tacitus and cmsar. they swept everything before them. beating back the best soldiers of the cmsars. until the gates of the eternal city were battered down. or your ancestors may have been among the good dutch or swedes. or those scotchirish who depopulated ulster county to come here and become nation builders. or they may have come as natives from the emerald isle to become nation rulers. for the irish are said to rule every country excepting ireland. but when these pioneers.came they came to stay. they came for religious and political liberty. they came to make a country. they cut away the wooded hills and cultivated the plains. and when their flag was assailed or even endangered they quickly laid aside the implements of peaceful industry and took up the sword. and for their homes and their country countless thousands on many battle fields gave up their lives. but what about a vagt majority of those coming here now? a misfit picture has often been painted of the incoming immigrant and has excited the sympathy of many unfary and unthinking. it is this: the great ocean liner appears off sandy hook. she is slowly piloted through the narrows. and as the mists rise from the inner bay the statue of liberty. the immigrants beacon light of hope. is beheld. then as he passes up broadway he observes the statue of nathan hale. in park place. which patriotically inspires him as he reads the inscription on the monument. \"the only regret i have is that i have but one life to give to my country.\" then the immigrant is further inspired as he beholds the statuesof lafayette.. lincoln. sumner. george washington. daniel webster. and simon bolivqr as he passes along the great thoroughfare and through central park. le crosses new jersey and in every direction he sees points closely associated with the conflicts of the revolution. then. upon arriving in philadelphia. he walks in the shadow of indepenidence hall and is within 20 miles of valley forge where the snows were reddened with the blood of continental patriots. but this picture is all moonshine so .far as the immigrant of today is concerned. the men who come here today. or most of them. have no comprehension of what all this meansthese glorious heritages. these memories of a divine struggle. this test. and successful test. of mans ability to operate a representative government. and it seems that many. at least. do not wish to know. for- the commissioners report shows that more than 40 per cent of those who do come go back and annually take with them $350.000.000 of our good gold. which is gone forever. the kind of immigrants we want now are the sort who will .become producers. those who will produce the things which sustain human life. while they consume little. yet what they do consume helps raise the price of what you and i must have to maintain an existence and suppoirt our government. the colonization of many of these immigrants in our great cities is the bane of our land. assimilation is our only hope. but too many come for that. and there must be restriction. .certainly. if a foreigner is not sufficiently anxious to come to be stimulated to the trouble of learning to write.is own name. then lie should not be allowed to enter. and if he is mentally incapable of learning. then he is an undesirable and unfit to enjoy the protection of a government even as paternal as this one in some of the southern states before a colored man is allowed to vote he must not only be able to read the constitution but to explain it. in addition to this. in some cases he must pay from $1.75 to. $2.50 poll tax to enable him to be registered. some of my colleagues propose to be much more liberal with these newcoming foreigners than the southerners are with real americans. although of african descent. when i say we want producers. i assert that very few of those who are coming now engage in agriculture. of 1.030.000 from southern europe landed here in recent years but 10.000 are engaged in farming. therefore to this horde of unproducing foreigners may in some measure be attributed the present high cost of living. we have the report of the commission which investigated this whole subject. that commission gave to the world most astounding information. revealing a condition of avarice and degradation never before dreamed of. not only the whiteslave traffic. which horrified all men and women of clean morals. but the industry of the foreign steamship trust in advertising and even canvassing every european village for immigrants was a shock to the american people who have been sitting supinely by while the country has been flooded with the ignorance of europe. i do not protest against the coming of the healthy. intelligent. upright immigrant who wishes to make the united states his home. who comes here to become a part of the republic and follow and aid in working out its destiny. i believe in freedom and free men and a free country. and i believe intelligent men are capable of selfgovernment. but ignorant men can only add vexation and complication to the many hard problems of state now confronting the government. my answer to all the arguments against this literacy testand that is all the act requiresis written in the laws passed by the states of minnesota. wisconsin. massachusetts. new york. and pennsylvania. these great states found it necessary to enact laws providing for the deportation of aliens quartered upon these commonwealths. as chairman of a committee appointed by the senate of pennsylvania. i personally visited every public institution in the state. and my report shows that at that time there were quartered upon the commonwealth 20.000 aliens. who. cost approximately $2.000.000 annually of state.funds to sustain. if this be relatively true in other states of the union. then the burden imposed upon the country by these aliens must mount into tens of millions. and while these enormous sums are being spent in a public way to take care of the indigent of other countries. thousands upon thousands oftrue americans stand in need of better pay that they may properly provide for their own families. in opening my remarks i stated that immigration bore relationship to the tariff. and so it does. the protective tariff theory conceived by hamilton and advocated by every public man of broad conception since his day. was that competition between american industries should bring about unhampered and unhindered the operation of the law. of supply and demand. and at the same time protect our market and our labor. but the result in recent years has seen competition strangled. and in many instances pricefixing trusts developed and become almost impregnably entrenched. the democratic theory is to smash the trusts and monopolies by sending our money abroad for the purchase of foreign goods. and then in case of a deficit to raise revenue by means of an income tax. the democratic policy of free trade will unquestionably very speedily. destroy the trusts and monopolies. but it will at the samp time destroy everything and everybody else. my theory is to enact and maintain a sane and sensible tariff. the tariff originally designed to raise revenue and protect industry and labor has been a success in accomplishing the former. but so far as the laboring man is concerned. in the presence of 1.200.000 unskilled laboring immigrants coming in each year. it is a farce and a joke. immigration as conducted today puts unskilled american labor on the free list. and with 10 workingmen to 1 in the professions or in business. what chance has the republic to live on if the american laboring man is not given wage enough to sustain himself. support his family. and send his children to school. and who must compete for his wage with a foreigner who can and does often live on 10 cents per day? we do not hear much said against immigration in public speech or the public press. if anything is said. it is usually a protest. and sometimes the pretest is a gentle hint. but more frequently a violent assault. against those whose attitude like my own is assumed from purely patriotic motives and through a desire to save the workingmen oc the land from the penury. degradation. and competition with the foreigner of lowstandard living. and which condition must speedily grow worse unless mairc 24. this bill offers relief. in the same newspapers which oppose the bill may be noticed many clothing store advertisements and in some displayed steamship announcements. the absence of outspoken interest for this bill might be because lawyers are afraid of their clients. members of the legislature and state senate tremble in the presence of a few recently naturalized foreigners. and in some instance because congressmen residing in centers of population where there is a congestion of foreigners and a large foreign vote do not wish to commit political suicide. and so it is left to those of us who (1o not have many foreigners in our districts to speak out in meeting and speak the truth and what we think and what others think. as well. we have accepted tile responsibility of supporting and sustaiing this republic. tile foreigner of today. in many instances. does not do this. he accepts one thing only. and that is tle .pportnity to come here. live on husks. horde his gold. then leave the country poorer for his having been here. but himself enriched. i hope tills measure may be effective in keeping out a vast number of foreigners. and that the (lay may come when there will be t distinct and recognizable type of american citizenship. that is not the case today. and is less so than 50 years ago. let us check the inflow until we have assimilated the more recent invoices. and until they have learned to know what that flaa stands for. and not only what it symbolizes. but the cost of life and treasure it has taken to sustain its integrity. let us close the gates. in part at least. for a time and teach these ailiens already here that the flag stands for liberty but not license. that it will protect the weak and unfortunate but aboninates and despises the vicious and criminal. and that intelligence is ihe rock of our constitution and the hope of the future. patriotism purified anid sanctified by the blood of countless thousands of men and the suffering and tears of women. scattered the stars on that field of blue which typifies the expanse of gods own sky. it is the purest emblem ever uinfurled in the mighty tide of time. let all men who enjoy its protection love and revere it. but first know its cost and what it represents.","mr. speaker. i shall vote to pass this bill over the veto of the president. when it passed the house last year i gave it my support. and i see no reason why it should not still become a law. i heartily join in every word of praise that has been accorded to our american citizens of foreign birth. there is evidence oil every side to establish the fact that our government and institutions have the power to remold and recast the lives and character of people from every civilized nation. we are therefore justified in the belief that the principles upon which our goverment is founded and which should control its administration affect the fundamental elements of human character. the record of achievement which has been made in the assimilation of immigrant peoples into our american. life well challeinges the admiration of the world. every door of opportunity has been kept wide open to the foreigner who has sought our shores. he and his have been accorded every advantage given to those of our own nation. while the immigrant has laid upon us many obligations. lie has been given many privileges. those who oppose this legislation assert that they are controlled in their judgment by humanitarian motives. it is stated that we are closing the doors of opportunity to the deserving people of other nations. that we are darkening the sky of hope to the distressed aud downtrodden of other countries. that we are refusing to extend a helping hand to those who are seeking our aid. we can not divorce the principles of humanity and justice in considering this legislation. we must deal justly with our owl people and our own interests as well as with the desire of those who may seek our shores. we should act upon this question in the light of presentday conditions. is restriction of imigration desirable? will it relieve an overburdened labor market? will it improve the living conditions of the toilers who are now among us and who must remain citizens of this country? will it in any way reduce the burden of taxation and build up american institutions? i believe this legislation wili.. contribute to these ends. the european war has arrested business operations in this country. how soon these operations will become normal no one can say. for the past six months there has been a great congestion in our large centers of population of those out of employment. and yet it is proposed to make no effort to stem the tide of foreign immigration that will undoubtedly seek our shores as soon as the war now raging is brought to an end. the opponents of the bill claim that there will be so much activity ill the resumption of maiufacturing. in the building up of devastated cities.. anti also in the development of agriculture. that there will b3 little. if any. immigration to this country. i do not share this belief. our great country which has enjoyed the blessings of peace will prove more attractive than ever to the residents of other lands. the impetus to seek new environment and to cast their fortunes in this favored land will be stronger than ever. those who have been driven from their homes and who have seen their fields laid waste will dreadthe task of rebuilding new homes upon the ruins of the oldand amid the devastation that has occurred. just as we seek new environment when old associations become burdensome andunattractive. so will many thousands of those who may be- left after the war has ended seek our favored land to repair their shattered fortunes. this bill is not harsh in its terms. our doors would still be wide open to those who possess even the.minimumn of intelligence and who thereby indicate to some degree the existence of mental activity. the great need of our country today is for a more intelligent and patriotic citizenship. we do well to support and maintain our great institutions of learning and to accord every possible support to our great publicschool system and to require that every- american child shall be an educated child. if we ever lose any of our national ideals or our governmental power shall in any .way become weakened. it will be due to our failure to enforce .these obligations. this )ill recognizes this fundamental element of our national character in requiring the immigrant to pass what is known as the literacy test. i am surprised that this provision of the bill has aroused such bitter opposition and do not understand why it should not receive the support of every loyal american. i can well understand why the great industrial corporations are opposed to this measure. they. have recruited their ranks of workers from the immigrant class. it has been a most profitable source of supply. men who lack intelligence and power to acquire knowledge of american independence and opportunity become ready victims to corporate greed. and avarice. conditions in mine. mill. and large manufacturing centers where our foreign population has largely. gathered prove conclusively that many of the great trusts of the country have been built up by the exacting toll which they. have levied upon foreign and ignorant workingmen. a better day is near at hand. our society demands that human beings shall no longer be exploited for private gain. there wilf always be dangerous and unhealthy empl6yment. but publie: sentiment. as expressed through legislation. will require that these shall be reduced to the lowest possible minimum. we have much to do along this line. and these problems and many. others relating to them should be worked out under the most favorable conditions. it will be the part of wisdom for us to settle and determine many problems arising from the large foreign population we now have without intensifying them and adding to their complications through a continuance of an increasing tide of immigration. the congestion of laborers in our cities should be relieved by some proper system of distribution. agricultural life should be made attractive to the foreigner. there are vast areas of public domain that should be settled and developed. when we have found the remedy for these conditions and when we have put into operation propei means of assimilation and distribution. we can then open the flood gates and allow the stream of foreign immigration to flow in. would it not be well. in view. of these facts. to work out the necessary remedies? these can and will be found. the pr6blem is worthy the best endeavor of our statesmei and leaders of public thought. the flow of. immigration should be temporarily reduced until we are better: prepared to take care of those who will come to us. this\" legislation can be justified. in my opinion. on the highest hu-. manitarian grounds. we are doing little for the immigrant to permit him to come to us and lose himself in the congested tenement population of the city. if we can discover some adequate way through which we can immediately avail ourselves of his productive power. we will be doing him the highest service. and he will become a most valuable asset. he has been such an asset in thepast. but there is fear that he ia becoming a liability. it will be bestboth for him and us to - \"t !","mr. president. the senator from california saysand that has been repeated here beforethat the tariff law has resulted in putting thousands of laborers out of employment. and yet i have not found a man. when the matter was discussed in the houseand this phase of the matter was debated there. and it has been debated in the pressi have not found a man who was ready to say that there has been a reduction of the wages of labor in any part of this country. in any industry in this country. during the last three mont!ts. of course there may have been isolated cases where wages in that period of time have been decreased. as there have been like cases of increase. but. taking the level. it seems to be conceded by everybody. as i have abundant testimony here. which i shall ask to incorporate in the liecoua. from representatives of various interests throughout the country. that there has been no reduction of wages in the industries of this country since the passage of the tariff law. in another body one of the leading opponents of the tarifg law adnitted the fact that there had been no reduction in wages in the factories. and i have here. and will put them in the rtecoat. statements from others in a position to know. to the effect that there has. been no reduction in wages. i take it that it is an admitted fact:. therefore. that there has been no reduction of wages in any one of the industries of this country. i want to put this proposition. mr. president: when there is a steady maintenance of the rate of wagesaccording to all tlseories of economicsis not that a conclusive proof that there are not two men seeking one job. that there is work for every man who wants work? you will not make the american people believe that an unusual number of men are unemployed in this country because of the reduction of tariff duties unless you can convince them that the rate of wages has fallen. because they know that the minute tie supply of labor exceeds the demand there will be a reduction in wages in response to the universal law of supply and demand. of course. mr. president. there have been a large number of unemployed in the great cities during the wintertime. there always are a great many more. unemployed during the wintertime than at other seasons of the year. but in every season of the year in the big cities of this country. and in the big cities of every other country. there are under all conditions and any conditions a large number of unemployed peoplepeople who do not want to work. who are unemployed. but who. though unemployed. do not come to the surface until the hard stress and necessities of winter. the pinch of cold and hunger. force them to apply for charity. in my own state. mr. president. i know there is a great lack of labor. i am satisfied in the industries and upon the farms of my own state that tomorrow 30.000 ablebodied men could secure employment at good wages. mr. president. i want to put into the record a clipping. which i think is from the washington post. or it may be from the star. of november 28. the name of the paper is not on the clipping i have. it is as follows: ses no labor c1isisconrfinence on unemployment calls connifions noimal. new yoru:.-fcbruery 27. 191. . the country is not facing an unusual crisis in its numbers of uncnployed. this was the consensus of opinion expressed at the national conference on unemployment. which began a two days session in new york today. many women. representing different states and foreign countries. afttended the session. 41i1 mayor mitchel. who opened the conference. declared that this year presented almost unprecedented conditions. three hundred thousand. he said. might be an exaggerated estimate of the number of unemployed in new york. but the number was at least the largest that had ever flooded the city.","mr. speaker. as one of the longtime friends of william av. wedemeyen and one of his companions upon the trip to panama. i wish at this time to briefly express my affection for him as a friend. my appreciation for him. as a man of extraordinary ability and promise. and my admiration for his selfsacrificing heroism. no one who had the good fortune to know mr. w.delemlep intimately could fail to recognize in his friendship a peculiar. quality of loyalty and wholehearted devotion which ignored the existence of selfinterest or political or other barriers. le valued men for their intrinsic worth. if they measured up to his standard of character and devotion -to -duty. he took them into his great heart without reserve. such friends he found in ill parts of the state of michigan. and such friends he found among his colleagues -of -the sixtysecond congress. who uniformnly reciprocated his sentiment and now mourn his untimely decease with a deep sense of personal loss. it is not my purpose to dwell upon the extraordinary mental equipment of ir. i wiemeyer or time success of his .brief but honorable career. which gave promise of greater victories to come. i shall confine my remarks to a single phase of his character. which was brought out in the strongest colors during the last days of his life. those of you who knew him merely as a conscientious worker in this house could hardly have realized the existence of the qualities to which i refer. intimate friends who were not with him at the last could not have fully understood and appreciated then. within a few days the whole civilized world has been shocked at the nevs of the death of capt. scott. the great english antarctic explorer. and his brave companions. no narrow line of nationality prevents the free expression of sympathy for these martyrs to the cause of science and admiration for their courage and endurance. the newspapers tell us that capt. lawrence e. g. oates. whose invincible bravery in the doer war obtained for him the title of \"no surrender oates.\" a member of this band of explorers. performed anact of heroism never surpassed in the annals of history. with hands and feet badly frozen he believed that he had become a drag upon his companions and a menace to their escape. leaving the little hut in which the party had taken shelter. with that simplicity which is characteristic of true greatness. he remarked. \"i am going outside and may be gone some time\". and so he walked forth into the night and into the storm. never to return. such acts of selfsacrifice are not limited to any age or country. they are an honor to human nature. they glorifymankind. those who were.with mr. wedem.neyeu during his last -days know that one department of his mind was the victim of serious disease. they know that just as a wounded soldier may sit and contemplate and freely discuss the chance of saving a mutilated member of his body. so .did our friend endeavor to diagnose his own mental derangement. they know that he was folly convinced that recovery was impossible and that the future held for him no prospect of happiness for himself or of atding to the happiness of others. more than that. they know that -by his own process of reasoning. which no argument could overcome. he was convinced that from that time forth his physical existence would be an everincreasig burden to those he loved best. deploring 4ts we must the possible error of his reasoning no one doubts its sincerity. if relief for capt. scott and his party had without their knowledge been within easy access. it would in no way have detracted from the heroism of capt. oates. the allimportant point is his belief. we can never know the tortuous processes of reasoning which passed through the mind of our colleagle. but from what he said to me on the last day of ]is life and from what he said to other members of our party. as well as myself. during the days previous. i shall never have any doubt that an intention to sacrifice himself for what he believed to be the gqbd of others inspired him. and that the impulses of a great and generous heart were substituted for the control of a brain which no one realized more clenly than himself to be diseased. sensitive. conscientious. modest. and unassuming to the point of selfdepreciation. he would be the last one to chinii credit for what he did. and if he had spoken a final word it would have been like him to simply say. \" i am going outside. and may be gone some time.\" mr. surp. mr. speaker. three weeks ago today. with the sky overhead as beautiful and as clear as reigns outside of this chamber at this noonday hour. there was gathered in unliversity hall at ann arbor a notable gathering of mourners. four thousand of that college towns people. augmented by many men of prominence from all over the state of michigan and the national capital. had come to do reverence and express their sorrow at the loss of a distinguished citizen. in that great assemblage were men high in the states and nations public life. and instuctors of the university of national reputation. on the platform near the center -and about whom were gathered those who were to participate in the memorial ceremonies sat the venerable dr. angell. for a generation the president of one of americas greatest institutions of learnhlg. with that clm dignity and serenity of countenance. the outward manifestation of the spirit and nobilily of character within. the presence of this grand old uail of learning would in itself have sufficiently attested tile regard and high esteem in which lie whose death we here mourn wvas held among his own people. at the side of the venerable dr. angell sat president hutchins. the virile head of that great university. on either side of him were seated distinguished men of michigan who had come to express their sorrow and in one common voice sound the praises of the one for whom they mourned. in front of them sat with bowed heads. first and nearest to the platform. the closer friends of the deceased. and then the townspeople. filling every chair in the pit and galleries of that great auditoriumthe scene on many occasions for a half century of rare educational. musical. and festal events. begiiniug the ceremonies early in the afternoon. as one speaker after another reviewed the life and character of our departed friend and colleague. the setting sun pouring through the western windows had flooded the chamber of mourning with its mellow light before the exercises were concluded. of the speakers. some who had known him as friend and fellow townsman. spoke of his early struggle in life to secure the means by which he might pursue his studies through the university. others. whose acquaintance began with him in his early manhood. spoke in feeling terms of appreciation of his sterling qualities as a lawyer. while others who had been his coworkers in civic and political life referred in terms of highest praise to his achievements in that broader field of activity. such. my colleagues. were the scenes attending the memorial ceremonies of the late william w. wredemeyer. in his home town of ann arbor on that sabbath afternoon in counterpart to like ceremonies which we are attending today. though the cruel waves of a tropical sea. in a most fateful manner. had robbed these ceremonies of his poor body. yet to those -who knew him he was just as much present in spirit as though his living person was again among them. and the memory of what he was will dwell with them as long as they shall live. it was president ghrfield who said of mark hopkins. the president of williams college. where lie attended. that to have been merely acquainted amid associated with him was in itself a liberal education. with how much more truth may it be said of the advantages. both as to the moral and mental training of one whose whole life has been spent in the atmosphere and environment of the great men who have since its beginning guided the destinies of such an institution as the university of michigan. it has been said that poets and anthors have in many instances won their inspiration from the scenes surrounding their childhood days. and we know that this must b)e true to some extent with men of lesser fame. who shall say that that love of knowledge. those qualities of sterling character. and that desire to be useful to his fellow men did not spring from the inspiration of that institution quite as much indeed as from the knowledge of books which william wedemeyer imbibed from his studies at ann arbor? may we not see in these attributes a reflection of the influence of example which came from association with those gifted men. and may we notand i speak as an alumnus myself of that grand old universityalso find an explanation for them in no small degree. not alone in the very environment of a town upon which nature has herself lavished so many charms in its hills. dales. and charming sylvan retreats on the banks of the huron. but also from the daily contact with the townspeople so enlightened and alive to the importance of according to their students a most kindly and sympathetic welcome? william wedemeyeir would have indeed been recreant to his duty and false to his whole training had he been anything else than the splendid example of amercan manhood by which we knew him. others of his colleagues who have been fortunate in knowing him for a longer time than i have today justly spoken in praise of his services as a member of this body. irom my acquaintance with him. i think it not unwarranted to say for him that had the fate which governs human affairs held in store for him more kindly things and given to him a longer span of life his abilities aind sincerity of purpose would have placed him in the front rank in the delegation which so ably represents his native state. my first impression of him as he appeared in earnest debate upon this floor never changed. indeed. that impression settled into a firm conviction that he was destined to play an important part in the legislation of congress if his constituents had the wisdom to see in him the promise which all of his colleagues could see. while we mourn his loss today. my colleagues. not only to the state and the nation. but as deeply personal to ourselves. yet may we not be comforted in the thought that though that great mind.-full of potential cipacitythat temple of reasonwas tottering to a fall. yet his last act was. afterall. one of heroic purpose. and as he lived so lie died. his last thought one of devotion aind one of conscientious duty as husband and father. as the reninant of that clouded intellect saw it to be. to those lie so dearly loved?","mr. president. for weeks past the public press has been filled with the horrors of the unparalleled overflow diaster in the mississippi valley. and. without desiring to delay a vote upon this bill. i wish briefly to advert to the conditions there and to the provisions of this bill which deal with the mississippi river from cape girardeau to the head of passes. known as the lower mississippi. before doing so. mr. president. i want to say that congress has responded to every appeal made to it from that stricken section. an appropriation of $650.000 has been made for emergency work on the levees. and a million and a quarter dollars. in round numbers. have been appropriated for feeding the flood sufferers. whatever the representatives from the mississippi valley have said that the people there. needed congress has been swift to give. in a spirit of unexampled generosity. there has been no opposition. no division of party nor of section. and. representing in part the people of that stricken section. i want to express their recognition of the burden of gratitude imposed upon them by the treatment which congress has seen fit to accord to them in. this the hour of their greatest trouble. yet. mr. president. the generosity of - the response to these appeals can not disguise the fact that for weeks a proud and a selfreliant people. inhabiting one of the most fertile countries of the world. have been knocking at the doors of congress like mendicants seeking for charity. and the response made discloses the fact that congress. by the magnitude of the disaster which has come to that section of the country. has been compelled to embark upon what has been always an unsafe and dangerous governmental policythat of extending charitya policy which has no boundary save the boundary fixed upon the efforts of human sympathy to relieve human suffering and human woe. the question which insistently presents itself for answer is whether this disaster could have been averted. and. still more. whether the recurrence of it can be avoided or the chances of it recurring minimized. and if so. in what way? when this great flood first began to come down the mississippi river some weeks ago the people of the valley felt no alarm. no apprehensions were aroused by the coming flood. they had. behind the levees. enjoyed 9 years of complete protection from overflow15 years of almost total protection. the last overflow having occurred in 1903. which was limited in area. and the one before that in 1897. during that time they had seen. millions of dollars expended in building up a levee system which they had come to regard as impregnable. the total expenditures on the levees aggregated the enormous amount of $82.000.000 up to june. 1910. of which the federal government had contributed $24.000.000. and the various levee organizations. by submitting to the most onerous system of taxation to which a people ever voluntarily submitted. contributed $58.000.000. railroad systems had threaded the entire valley. forests had been felled. villages had sprung up. the population had doubled. the agricultural products had dbubled within 15 years. but the one factor that more than anything else gave to the people of the valley a feeling of confidence and security in their levee system was that the federal government was aiding in the maintenance of that system. the great mass of the people did not stop to scrutinize the extent of that aid or whether it meant safety. but they felt that the government had taken hold of it and had dealt with it in such a fashion as would afford adequate protection from the floods of the river. but this year. for the first time since 1844. the flood waters of the three rivers came out in conjunction. unusual as the statement may seem. it is absolutely correct. for the first time since 3844 the upper mississippi. the ohio. and the missouri came out in conjoint flood. the course of the river has been that the ohio and the upper mississippi ran off their floods before being joined by the missouri. but with these three rivers coming out at flood stage the water crept higher and higher until the feeling of security was changed to dismay and discouragement. and as every record of high water one after the other was broken. the levees for 1.600 miles were manned by anxious workers who strove to raise these frail barriers high enough to prevent inundation. they fought desperately to save their homes. their very lives. congress helped with an emergency appropriation of $650.000. the various levee boards. by anticipating their revenues. by issuing certificates of indebtedness. by issuing bonds. by bankrupting their treasuries. contributed $2.000.000 to the emergency fight within a few weeks. then came the crevasses. and the great rver poured its yellow torrent over fertile fields. inundated villages. swept away homes. took everywhere its toll of human life. for many men and women in the open fields and in the lonesome woods struggled. gasped. gurgled. and died in the embrace of the yellow flood. . eight railroad systems were paralyzed. millions of dollars worth of property destroyed. and at last. instead of fertile fields there is a yellow lake 10.000 square miles in area. greater in area than the states of rhode island. delaware. and connecticut added togetheras great as the states of rhode island. delaware. and new jerseya section of the country producing in cotton alone more than $50.000.000 worth annually. the damage. without reference to the crops of this year. it is estimated. will reach $50.000.000. the cotton crop alone of this year in the submerged area which can not now be made will add $60.000.000 to that sum. in dollars and cents this flood has cost an amount almost twice as much as it would take to build a complete levee system from cairo to the gulf on both sides of the river. up to the government standard and requirement. if there was not a single foot of levee in existence. on this lake. covering that vast area. is borne the wreckage of homes and the saving of years. and today 150.000 people are being fed on government rations at 10 cents pier day per head. disheartened. discouraged. dismayed. these people are today surrounded with jobs comforters. who have brought from the limbo of forgotten things every discarded fallacy and every discredited theqry. telling them that \"your levee system has been a failure. the bed of the river has been raised. you have to resort to outlets or to reservoirs.\" i would say to the people of that valley and to the united states senate that there is not a single disaster which has come from this unparalleled flood which serves to discredit in any way the efficiency of a levee system. that the government engineers in charge of the river have reported the cause of each and every break which has occurred in the levees. and not one break has occorred. either in the overflow of 1912 or in any other which has preceded it. where the levee was up to the government standard in height and in dimensions. the flood has shown what every engineer. whether government engineer or a levee board engineer. well knew. that the levees. as constructed. were not sufficient to carry off any such flood as this. the dealing with the river by a system of levees was not entered upon hastily. nor has it not been prosecuted without proper scientific research and information in regard to it. in 1861 abbott and humphreys. most eminent surveyors. wrote a treatise on the mississippi river. which is today a standard work on that subject. and they came to the conclusion then that the floods of the mississippi river could be dealt with by levees and by levees alone. following the flood of 1874 congress created a commission of five government engineers. and instructed them to investigate and report upon the floods of the mississippi river and the best method of controlling such floods. and that commission reported that the levee system was feasible and was the only system that could be. adopted for dealing with the question. following the flood of 1897 the senate designated a subconmittee of the commerce committee to again investigate the question of how best the river could be dealt with. the distinguished chairman of the commerce committee today was chairman of that subcommittee. and in passing i will say that he and the senator from new hampshire are the only two living members of that commission. that commnission made a .personal inspection of conditions. and in addition to that took the testimony of every surveyor who was familiar with the conditions on the river. whether they were government surveyors belonging to the army corps or civilians. and their report on this subject is the most luminous statement now extant on the mississippi river. in most unequivocal terms they stated that the levee system was the only method of handling the floods of the river. that the outlet system could in the nature of things afford no relief. because no outlet could be made above red river. that the reservoir system could not be successfully used because no place for reservoirs could be found adapted to control the floods of the river along the ohio river. in 1879 congress created the mississippi river commission. composed of members of the army corps. the geodetic coast survey. and civilians selected because of their high character and farniliarity with this great subject. and from that time up to today that commission has been dealing with the mississippi river. investigating the changing conditions of it and making recommendations for the treatment of it as called upon by congress.","it is true that the fundamental reason assigned for -the legislation has been shifted. the real reason behind the legislation has .not shifted at all. that gives us an idea of the path upon which we are taking -the first step if we pass -this bill today. start in on the policy of extravagant expenditure. nid once well started no floodgates are strong enough to withhold the torrents which will press upon us. there is no feature in our legislation that has been so noticeable in recent years as the increase in our federal appropriations. there is nothing which so strongly impresses itself upon a member of the house or of the senate as the ill will and the obloquy that rest -upon a man when he urges economy in expenditure. but. mr. president. so far :as its -rests within -my power. i desire to stand for the average veryday citizen. -the ordinary taxpayer of the united tates. -against the extravagant and exorbitant demands which are made upon congress. this bill is -ne of them. this is the -one which. in the precedent it creates. in my judgment. is the -worst of all. it not merely means forest reserves. it means. -s i have said. -the -much more commendable public object of protection against the erosion of streams going into rivers. and other matters which .should be undertaken by the localities inmediately interested. again. it fixes a precedent for disregard of constitutional limitations. the dangerous effect of which no .man can measure. mr. president. what is -the rational way to solve this forest problem? in the first place we must consider the difficulties of scientific forestation. in this country where we seek to make money rapidly. growing timber is less profitable as an investment than almost any other line of endeavor. one of the great latin orators said. \"a husbindman plants the tree. the fruit -of which he may never behold.\" in our own country the man who plants a grove of trees is not sure that he mill ever live to reap its profits.. accdrdingly. that kind of an enterprise is not as attractive as most business or other undertakings are. another difficulty is that the :states impose burdensone taxes upon forest lands. they tax both the land and the :growing timber. and the rates are in many cases so high that they absorb a considerable -share of the increased value. in view of the especial quality of forests there should be exceptional rules relating to their taxation. if -states care enough -about the promotion of forests to foster them and to encourage persons in growing them. they can by tax regulations solve many of the difficulties. another obstacle in the way of the development :of our forests is the frequent and destructive fires to -which they are subjected. it is within the power of the respectife states to control all of these things by maintaining a sufficient fire patrol. reenforced -by education from the federal government. and by a reasonable exemption from taxation. so that the people may grow them with profit. of course there are some parts of the country where the value of land for agricultural purposes is such that tracts will not be set aside for timber purposes. once started. there is no place where you can stop. i will concede a certain exceptional demand for forest property. but at least. with this vast area of federal forest reservations. is not the -government doing its part in the promotion of forests. and may it not call upon the states as well to do their part in the settlement of this great problem? i want to call attention right here to an erroneous impression -that forest lands have diminished in new hampshire. i fancy that the senator from new hampshire will agree with me on that. i note that the majority report of the committee on agriculture of the other house in speaking of this question said: the testimony before the committee is abundant and convincing to the effect that the destruction of forests in the :southern appalachians and white .mountains is going on at an alarming rate. the new hampshire forestry commission. a body organized in 1ss1. reported as follows to the legislature of that state in 19034: we (the forestry commission) have remarked that a greater percentage of our area was doubtless now under forest cover than at any time during the half century. this conclusion is emphasized in our experience. where two generations ago were hillside farms of arable land and pasturage are now great spaces of second growth. some sufficiently matured to :attract lumbermen. with stone walls of former fields and pastures curiously out of place among the heavy growth. .the following is from the new hampshire forestry report. 19054:: the white mountain region includes about \"3.500.000 acres. or 57 per cent -of the entire state. the present forest consists entirely of second growth. chiefly in small lots. but occupying about twothirds of -the total area. the forest area has been greatly extended by the abandonment of improved farm land. in -rapid progress since 1880. a factor in transforming the past forest into that of the present has been the reversion of cleared land to forest. according to the reports of the united states census. about 1.000.000 acres of n.proved farm land has been abandoned in new hampshire since 1880. now. letus look again for a minute at the policy of this state. for here is the basis of this whole difficulty. the states have been careless and profligate in handling their forests. if -you pass this bill. you virtually say that other states may also be careless without suffering the consequences. october 17. 1867. the state conveyed by deed to orrin m. chase for $500 the land lying within a circular area of 1 miles in diameter. six miles in diameter. i take it. would include about eighteen thousand acres. this is less than 3 cents an acre. october 17. 1867. the state conveyed to william h1. smith for $20.500 70.000 acres in coos county. reserving not to exceed 200 acres. that transfer was made at a price of a little less than 30 cents an acre. november 5. 1867. the .state conveyed to william h. smith and noah -woods aill the lands in the counties of coos. grafton. and carroll to which the state -had -any rightfor :$4.000. said land being estimated at 100.000 acres. reserving only lands for arsenal lots and gunhouse lots owned by the state in these counties.this land was sold for about 4 cents an acre. a most disastrous bargain. after squandering their natural resources in this way the state now turns to the federal government with a request for the restoration of its natural endowment. i do not want to criticize these people for lack of wisdom or for advocating this measure. for they are a sturdy race. but it is clear that the strongest argument for this bill is far removed from any relation to navigation. it relates rather tothe summer resort business. in the same report the forestry commission of new hampshire says: as a summer resort new hampshire is growing in importance from year to year. a special report issued by the state bureau of labor in 1899 points out the magnitude of the business: general summary of the sumner resort bulsiness of 1899. capital invested in summer property -------------------$10. 442. 352 number of guests remaining one week or longer --------- 58. 222 number of transient guests remaining less than one week- 95. 706 total number of guests and those occupying cottages .... 174. 280 total number of .help employed ----------------------- 12. 354 increase of guests in 1899 over 189 ----------- 093 increase in cash received at hotels and farmhouses in 1899 over 1898 ----------------------------------- $402. 341 total volume of summer business and investment for 189. $6. 609.364 by this time the business has no doubt increased to an amount well beyond ten millions a year. now. suppose this forest upon the mountain sides is reserved. what will these people next request? that it be created into parks for that great army of sumniner visitors. amounting in 1899 to 174.000. i must submit. mr. resident. that the state itself should take care of this problem and not call upon the united states to assist them in providing attractions for summer tourists. i have carefully examined this bill with reference to another proposition. where is there anything in the bill to compensate the government for the use of the water power? under its provisions the government could proceed to buy hundreds of thousands of acres. avowedly to improve water power. who will use this water power? not the government of the united states. certainly it can not engage in a business of that kind. where is there any provision in this bill regulating the leasing of that water power and providing payment for it? of course. those interested in power- companies would rather this land. which abuts upon the flowing streams where electricity can be generated. should belong to the government than to private owners. they can make a very much more favorable bargain with the federal government. indeed. if they now own it themselves. it would be to their advantage to sell it to the government and then utilize it apparetly for nothing. here is one other point which shows the wide scope of reason and imagination in this projectthe expectation that the government. will construct water reservoirs in addition to. purchasing the forests. as a result of the hearings before the committee on agriculture it was said in the discussion upon this matter: it is apparent that after the government has reserved the watersheds the owner of water power will expect the government to build . storage reservoirs. i find some reference to that on page. 17 of the report of the department of agriculture: considering this condition. it is of interest to note what can be done by means of a storage system on this riverthat is. the savannahtopographic surveys have located 14 reservoir sites. which. if developed. would have a capacity equal to the annual runoff of 1.670 square miles of drainage area. or 23 per cent of the drainage area above augusta. with these reservoirs developed and filled. the amount of water which. could be stored would be sufficient to maintain an added depth of 9 feet at augusta for a period of 118 days. or practically four months. as i have already spoken of the desirability that the state take up this matter of forest preservation and development. i want now to discuss the most importallt argument. in favor of leaving this duty with the states. the states have. police powe:s under which they can prevent the wanton destruction or even the cutting of timber when held by private owners. mr. president. i wish to impress upon the senate the distinction between the. power of the states and that of the federal govermient. no such power is vested in the federal government. in the state of maine a bill was introduced to the effect that.no tree under 12 inches in diameter in certain forests could be cut off. the state of louisiana.. i believe. has passed. a similar law. in the exercise of its power to prevent the impairment ofits resources. a state can pass such regulations and. enforce them. but. as i have said. the federal government has no such police powers. the government can. of. course. adopt such a policy on its own private forests. but in order to maintain the forests of the country it is necessary that there be some power to enforce such regulations. otherwise what do we say? that \"we will wait until all the forests have been cut off and then we will buy them. we will waive all opportunity to restrict cutting while the trees are standing on the soil. but when these tracts have been denuded. then we will buy \"-which is like locking the stable door after the traditional horse has disappeared.","mr. chairnman. this bill. because of its unjust discrimination against the cotton grower. ought not to pass. not only are the railroads trying to put the farmer out of business. but thousands of the best men in the south were shocked and stunned when the wires flashed the horrible news that the great cotton \"bears \" of this country had enlisted the powerfuil influence of the legal department of this government in their behalf in their efforts to depress the price of the greatest product of the south land. for years past these gamblers in cotton. many of them never having seen a stalk of cotton grow. were able to get together and depress the price of cotton during the fall months when. because of the poverty and ignorance of the southern planter. he was forced to sell approximately 75 per cent of his crop. has any attorneygeneral of the united states ever had them arraigned for conspiracy? you know they have not. but now. when these great. big \"baby bears\" have been caught selling that which they did not haveyea. when they have been caught selling that which they could not getthey come with tears in their eyes. in a dastardly and contemptible way. to a weak attorneygeneral and beg him. for \" gods sake.\" to protect them. in years past they have robbed the south of many billions of dollars. and now they are begging the help of this great department of the government to save them from the loss of a few millions. mr. chairman. the \"bulls\" are not responsible for the present high prices of cotton. the almighty. when he withheld for months the rain from large sections of our country and then sent the storms and the floods to wash away and destroy the crop in other sections. and. above that. allowed the boll weevil and other pests to get in their most effective work. reduced the cotton crop of 1009 to that point where the spinners of the world were forced to pay a fair price for this cotton. if these speculators have been caught wrong. they should take their medicine like men. mr. chairman. the price of cotton is not too high when compared with other things in this country. think of the prices of wheat. meats. mules. fertilizers. labor. and many other things. and you will see how much more it costs the planter to grow cotton now than it formerly did. mr. chairman. in the opinion of many of us. there is something more behind this than appears on the surface. could it be possible that this administration intends to take up the cudgels for the great american tobacco company and stop all efforts of the tobacco growers to secure fair prices for their tobacco? could it be possible that this administration means to start first in new york and finally lend its powerful influence to the enemies of the cotton grower in thwarting his feeble efforts to secure fair prices for his cotton? if that be their purpose. i warn you now the millions of american farmers will. in their just wrath and indignation at this most unjust and damnable treatment. sweep from place and power any party responsible for this action.","now. i do not know. because i am not a chemist. whether benzoate of soda is a dangerous preservative or not. i know that the chief of the bureau of chemistry says it is a dangerous substance. i know that the great food experts of the world are almost unanimous in the opinion that it is a dangerous preservative. i know that the great chemists of the world and the medical profession say that it is harmful. i know that the great preponderance of the evidence is against its use. and that is sufficient reason for my objecting to its use. i know that the state food and dairy commission in their convention have protested strongly against its use. that the convention of canners held at louisville. ky.. only a few days ago. 3.000 strong. unanimously adopted resolutions against its use and commendatory of doctor wileys great work. i know that my mail for the past week has been literally flooded with letters. resolutions. newspaper articles. and petitions sustaining my position and urging me in the interest of the consuming millions to continue the fight for the integrity of the pure food and drugs act and its enforcement in the spirit of its enactment. i say i do not know that benzoate of soda is a dangerous preservative. i believe that it is. but whether it is or not. i do not wish to take the chance of permitting it in the foods of this country in the face of the opinions of so many great experts who firmly believe in its deleteriousness. this is the situation: your child is lying sick. a half dozen physicians are called in. five of them say that the use of a certain drug can do the child no good. but at the same time can do it no harm. the one says that to administer this drug may bring fatal results. these men are of equal ability and standing in their profession. life and death hang upon the decision. shall the drug which can do no good but may do harm in the opinions of the five be administered. when the one positively declares that its use may be fatal? prudence and common sense would forbid the use of the drug. and this is the exact situation with respect to the use of preservatives in foods. no one claims them to have any food value. the very fact that they are used to preserve foods from decomposing shows conclusively that they can not aid digestion. for digestion is a process of decomposing food and not preserving it. if benzoate of soda as a preservative may be harmful and is pronounced by those who should know best to be harmful. if it has no food value. if it is not necessary in the manufacture of foods from wholesome firstclass materials. if it works no good and may work so much harm. what justification is there for its use? why does a certain class of manufacturers insist upon its use? there is but one answerthey desire to palm off upon an unsuspecting public cheap and inferior goods. they desire to fatten their purses at the risk of the lives and health of their customers. it is cheaper to use cores. peelings. and refuse. cheaper to employ insanitary methods in manufacture. cheaper to employ cheap labor. than it is to use firstclass raw material. firstclass sanitary methods. and firstclass. wellpaid labor. it is the old fight of dividends over again. no one denies that these preservatives can be. and in many cases are. used to cover up the methods i have mentioned to put upon the market food frauds. and it is against these practices. against these nethods. that the strong arm of the law was raised. and when it was about to be brought down upon the heads of conscienceless manufacturers by the chief of the bureau of chemistry. these concerns rushed to cover behind this new creationthe referee board. my amendnient proposes to leave the enforcement of the law where the law put it. and my whole desire is to maintain the integrity of this act. which is a part of our law. because the consuming public demanded protection against the intolerable methods of food manufacturers. if the law needs amendment. let it be amended in the proper way. but i protest against these insidious plans to nullify its provisions and to lay down the gap for the return of the methods in vogue before its passage. [loud applause.] under the leave given me to print certain statements. letters. and other documents. i insert the following. this is an advertisement of one of the largest and most reputable manufacturers in the country:","now. a word further. what is this $500.000 asked for? it is asked by the chief forester upon the estimate of the department. because he has to have a working capital to carry on the business that he is engaged inthe necessary business incident to the administration of the forests. originally he could take the proceeds of the pastures he rented and of the timber which he sold and use them to pay the current expenses as a substitute for capital stock for the transaction of this business. but very properly. i think. congress now requires every dollar that he takes in to be covered directly into the treasury. and. therefore. without this appropriation he would be without means to take any steps toward caring for or protecting these vast property interests. i do not believe for a moment that any senator will leave the government of the united states in a position of being charged with the responsibility of nearly 200.000.000 acres of these valuable lands without an adequate appropriation to enable the department of agriculture to take care of them and to protect them with at least a partial care. it requires a good deal of money to take care of them economically. these lands are scattered far and wide. in the nature of the case only a few rangers can be placed upon them. if fires break out. it is important that there should be means of instantaneous communication from one part of the reserve to another. so that the rangers may gather their forces and all appear at the place of danger. that can be provided for only by an elaborate system of telephone wires and poles throughout the forest domain. there must be places for the rangers to live. they can very cheaply construct houses in the forests for their homes. or. at least. for their headquarters. there must be bridges. often a fire will occur miles away from the place where the rangers hut is. if he could have a direct route to it. he would be possibly within a mile. but by reason of the canyons. the unfordable streams. and the impassable marshes in the v interim between his position and the place of the fire. it becomes impossible for the ranger to reach it. so that the economical administration of the forest requires roadways. it requires oftentimes bridges. it requires the removal of obstructions in footpaths that follow through the mountains. it is for these reasons that this money is absolutely necessary. i would a good deal rather a man would stand up and say \"this forest policy is unnecessary. i am against it. it is a wrong policy.\" than to leave the forester without means to take care of these vast interests after the united states has taken them under its protection. i am not one of those disposed to criticise the chief forester. i know him with only a very limited acquaintance. but i have taken a little opportunity to study some of his history and his biography. i regard him as a providential man for the united states. we maintain a good many schools and colleges here. but it was not until he came on the scene that we produced anybody that was willing to turn aside from the emoluments of the great professions and from the opportunities of business in all departments of life to take up an obscure and misunderstood scientific pursuit and stick by it until he arrived at a position to be of service to the whole community of the united states. i confess i rather like the biography of that man. and i am not without a certain sense of irritation when he is referred to as a man calculated to encourage the actions of foresters which have been complained of here. on the contrary. unless i have altogether mistaken his character. if senators would take the same pains to bring to his attention or to the attention of the secretary of agriculture the offensive actions which have caused irritation in the minds of so many of our colleagues here. i think they would get them corrected without the slightest difficulty in the world. for. if i have not misunderstood this man. he is a typical american gentleman. a man who would not encourage or tolerate on the part of the employees under him conduct unbecoming to an official of the united states. and if i have not misunderstood altogether that fine old scotchman who presides over the department of agriculture. you could not present to him a case of hardship arising in the matter of a homestead settler such as was referred to by my friend from idaho without at once arousing an indignation in his mind that would result in more reforms than are likely to be produced by these speeches in the senate. so that to my mind these are incidental matters that can be corrected without noise or clamor or vituperative criticism of any sort. and i do not believe they have any place in this debate. i think the question is greater than all this. i know of no question with which we of our generation have to do greater than this questionthe question of preserving the natural resources for the use of the people. not only for the present. but for future generations. i am not alarmed as some are about the ruin of the forests. being likely to destroy the building material of the united states. i inherited a very comfortable theology. the general central principle of which is. that god made this world that we are living in and made it well and administers it in a general way. and i. for one. do not believe that he ever made a permanent world with a temporary supply of fuel or light or building material or any other necessity of human life. on the contrary. when an estimate was made not so many years ago by an american scientist that within one hundred and fifty years the coal supply of the whole world would be destroyed. the most famous english student of practical natural science answered that within one hundred and fifty years the use of coal will be unknown in the world because it will be superseded by other means of power and heat and light. i feel the same way about the timber supply of the united states. i think that scientists are now at work that have already written the doom of the american lumber yard. i believe the time is within sight when the use of lumber in the construction of houses to dwell in or in the construction of the great buildings that constitute the pride of our mighty cities. will be practically unknown. in the capital of my state the most costly residences are now being builded without the use of lumber at all. granolithic cement. which is a wstinct step of progress in building construction in our time. is gradually abolishing the use of lumber even for the ordinary outbuildings that surround the american farm. already our lumber sidewalks are gone. and in five yedrg our lumber barns and outbuildings on farms will be gone. and every one of us is likely to live to see the total disappearance of the use of lumber in the domestic architecture of the people of the united states. therefore i am not one of those interested in preserving the forests from destruction for this reason alone. but my reading leads me to believe that this world is somewhat on an equilibrium. you can not destroy the forests of the country without interfering with its climate and with its other natural forces. i have lived in a country that since it was plowed. since the sloughs were drained. and since the surface vegetation has been converted to the uses of agriculture has seen a gradual drying up of its rivers. the city of pittsburg is every spring overfiowed by a river that in the summier time is practically without water. although once a great highway of american commerce. and there is not a practical student of the question that does not understand that it arises from the destruction of the forests in the mountains of west virginia. those mighty water supplies that for generations and for centuries and millenniums have been the divine method of carrying down the floods to those rivers. today the rains fall. the floods descend. our cities are buried. and our commerce is interrupted. and we are at the very beginning of these perils in the valley of the ohio riier. i do not want to see the same thing done in the valley of the mississippi river. i was glad to hear the senator from minsota say that. in cooperation with the national governmient. the state of minnesota is protecting by modern scientific methods the headwaters of the mississippi river. i have visited the headwaters of the missouri river. an d i want to see preserved the forests that.were put there for the purpose of safeguarding the sources of that great river. i went by slow stages three summers ago down the.valley of the sacramento river. in california. i found lumbermen huddled around the base of mount shasta with contracts to cut hundreds of millions of feet of those mighty forests that god himself put there to guard the source of the sacramento river. and i said to myself and to everybody that i talked with out there. \"unless the people take more interest in their children and in the future of their community than they do in their sawmills. that mighty country. now prosperous and hopeful for the future. will become a desert within three generations.\" and yet we have men introducing the forest ranger with his bad manners. the sheep herder with his desire to get in among these trees for nothing. the cattleman unaccustomed to pay for what he gets on the public domain. and a dozen other trifling circumstances to prejudice and even to put a stop to the policy which..in my humble judgment. lies at the basis of any intelligent foresight for the future of the great populations that are to live in the intermountain and coast country of the united states. i stand for this bill. i wish the appropriation was larger. if a motionis made to make it larger. i shall have no hesitation in voting for it. but i ask the senate not to make it less. because it certainly is bad business as well as questionable patriotisln to require the department of agriculture to care for and protect 200.000.000 acres of forest land. and then take away from it the money that is necessary even to enter upon an intelligent discharge of the duties which the law imposes upon it.","the senator has asked that that be incorporated in the document. and i have consented. so that it will come whenever it is printed. i vas pointing out. however. that in summing up. the solicitor himiself had given his conception of those facts. and his interpretation of the law applicable to them. and that in rendering his oi)inion lie has declared that the action of watson did not come within the prohibition of contract labor. and that watsons action. which was south carolinas action. was perfectly legitimate. and that under that decision we of the south have been led to understand that with this interpretation of the imimigration laws as they now are an opportunity is offered for the southern states to utilize the great flood of foreigners who ate trying to get to these shores. in order to bring to the south the most desirable class of those foreignels. there are some of them. i confess. i would just as lief would stay in new york or chicago. or anywhere else. amid if i had my way i would insist. and put it into this proposed law. the provision--and never pass a law until we got it inwhich the senate passed last spring. that the educational test should be one of the things which we should demand and enforce. or have nothing. the senate conftrees have surrendered. i suppose the house was set. and they could not elp themselves. they had -to take what they could get or take nothing. everyone .supposed that the immigration bill was dead anyway. that it was deadlocked il conference and would never see the light of day again. lo atnd behold. an exigency has arisen oil the pacific coast. strenuotus individuals are at work to accomplish certain ends. the alle mal who presides over the state department drafts an amendment to a bill passed by the senate last may. and last june by the house. aind which has been in conference ever since. the conferees take a distinguished gentleman into their confidence. orl he takes them into his confidence. and the senate is notifled that this bill nmst go through. why? speaking in plain terms. to keep the japs out of california. therefore there is a twofold object involved in the urgency with which this bill has been pressed and is )eing pressed to atdoptioln. the first of those objects is. as i- said. to keel) jalanese laborers from coming into this counitry. ..he conferees. in furtherance of a policy which looks to sectional advantage. have incorporated provisions which chmige the law in regard to contract labor. which provide for a closlng of the little dribble of immigrants who have started to go southward. and the two linked together are to be driven through congressthe souths interest. as usual. ignored. the pacific coist. of course. taken care of. they both involve- the race question. the object of preventing undesirable japanese from coning into this country is one with which every southerner sympathizes far more keenly than any man on the other side possibly can who does not live in the west. but when we in south carolina. where we have 235.000 more negroes than whites. with our industries struggling. some of them languishing for want of laborall kinds of labor. agricultural as well as manufacturingseek to obtain some little assistance toward equalizing the races. getting something which may promise relieft from what i believe to be an impending race conflict there. actuated by selfish greed certain people of certain states step to the front. hugging to their bosoms the popular issue of the welfare of labor. clamoring for the right of the workingaman to be protected from the importation of contract labor. saying to us of the south: \"you shall not have the opportunity to get a few thousand white people to help stem the tide of negro ignorance and barbarism with which we engulfed you forty years ago.\" mr. president. lest some think i speak too harshly. i desire to call attention to the fact that this must be in pursuance of a settled policy. that there is something more involved than the mere settlement of this question as to the admission of the japanese and the exclusion of contract laborers. i hold in my hand two resolutions which.were introduced in the house of representatives. on february 2. mr. gardner of massachusetts submitted the following resolution: presolved. that the secretary of the department of commerce and labor be. and he is hereby. respectfully requested. if not incompatible with the public interests. to send to the house of representatives any information in his possession relative to the introduction of foreign laborers into the state of south carolina by one e. j. watson. on the 5th the same mr. gardner of massachusetts submitted the following resolution: rcsolved. that the secretary of the department of commerce and labor be. and he is hereby. respectfully requested. if not incompatible with the public interests. to send to the house of representatives any information in his possession relative to the introduction of foreign laborers into the state of south carolina by one e. j. watson. together with a copy of his solicitors legal opinion. if any be on file in said department. as to whether said laborers were lawfully admitted to the united states. and a copy of any documents in his possession furnishing the grounds for said opinion. so it seems that a massachusetts programme is being carried outi desire to say that if there is any man in the senate who is opposed to the importation of contract labor. i am that man. the senator from massachusetts will not go any further than i will along that line. my state is next to his in the number of cotton spindles and looms. we have avery large manufacturing population. composed at this time alnost entirely of people born and bred in south carolina. people as good as we have. but unfortunately they are poor. i would do nothing to jeopardize the interest of that class of people. i would not have the manufacturing interests of south carolina given the opportunity to go to europe and make contracts with anyone they might see fit. regardless of their fitness as citizens. and bring over a horde of ignorant and debased foreigners to reduce the wages of my own people by bringing into competition with them these contract laborers from europe. but if the state needs more white peopleand who will deny it?-if by reason of the poverty of the soil. impoverisied by a century and a half of improvident agriculture. naturally poor to begin with. it is an unpropitious field for new people to come to settle. if the condition thereof the excess of negroes who will compete in the labor market with these foreignersmakes it wellnigh impossible to attract white people there. white people from the north or white people from eurtpei ask the senate whether if. under existing law. that state is permitted through organized efforts to bring in a good class of white men and women to help us develop our resources and to increase the white race there. we shall. because the japanese are trying to get in on the pacific coast. say to the south carolinians. \" we shut the door of hope. so far as white immigrants are concerned. in your faces to keep them out. while we shut the japanese out from the pacific coast to keep them from competing with white people upon terms that are dangerous.\" the two questions are cognate.","the provision for a dam and locks at gatun was severely contested by the conflicting opinions of the european engineers and some -of the american engineers. they have expended much tine anl labor in looking into the question as -to the stability of such a dam. as to the stability of a dam properly constructed at gainboa. and that it. in connection with a sealevel channel -across the isthmus. will control the flood waters and the normal waters of the chagres river. there is no contest. no man has raised his voice to deny that. the proposition is true that a dam built there will control the entire situation. mr. president. i might stop my argument on this question right here. and i do not know but that i had better do so. because the evidence in this case shows the consensus of opinion without interruption in favor of the proposition that there is a way to control the floods of the chagres river. that way is to build a dam at gamnboa upon solid rocktough. hard basalt. i believe it isand to dig the sealevel canal past that location. and with proper regulating works to control the waters impounded behind the dam at gamboa. and in the highest floods. or the greatest possible coming of successive floods. that water will enter the canal so that it will be harmless. it can run either way to the sea. and there is no probability that the canal thus draining the waters of this great lake at -gamboa. created by this dam. will ever be in such a state of flood or agitation as to disturb the navigation of that canal. this question is therefore narrowed down to this proposition: is the certainty and safety. which none deny. of controlling the chagres river through a sealevel canal. with a dam at gamboa and a sea gate and tidal lock at miraflores. to be abandoned for any known cause in -favor of the disputed and more uncertain plan of accomplishing such control of the chagres river by means of an earth dam at gatun with a hea.l of 85 feet of water. and with three double locks in a flight. each with a lift of more than 28 feet? senators who cast their eyes up to that reporters gallery and -notice the steps that come down. three of them. one below the other. will have a fair idea of three locks in flight. if you make the elevation 85 feet above sea level and divide that by 3. 28 feet about. you will have an idea of what it vould look like. and you will have perhaps a better idea of what it will actually be than by. any words that i could use to express it.","mr. speaker. it is with pleasure i embrace this opportunity to add my humble tribute to the memory of senator quay. every phase of his character and every item that contributed to his greatness as a public servant or his amiable qualities as a man have been sufficiently dwelt upon by others in both ends of the capitol. i shall therefore confine myself principally to his extraordinary prowess as a political leader. in this particular i believe he has never had a peer in this country. and that he was the most resourceful and altogether masterful political general that america has thus far produced. for nearly a generation he was as supreme in pennsylvania as it is possible for one man to be in a great commonwealth. his influence and power were the results not only of the sterling qualities of manhood which he possessed. but a thorough comprehension of political and social conditions and of an intimate acquaintance with men. his genius for political management was largely the genius of labor. he knew every man in every town and township in the state who took an interest in political affairs. and could measure accurately his value as an ally or his strength as an opponent. this knowledge was the result of prodigious pains and infinite application to detail. from his library at beaver he could direct a political campaign as intelligently and effectively as though he were present in every comnunity. his complete and systematic methods and his familiarity with every phase of the contest rendered him practically ubiquitous. but senator quays power in politics. like that of napoleons in way. was the result of an idea. that idea. materialized by genius. made napoleon the greatest soldier of all time. the application of the same idea to politics by a great and energetic mind made matthew stanley quay invincible. napoleon. during his first campaign in italy. narrowly escaped being taken prisoner. this suggested to him the value of a peirsonal guard of picked men. upon whose valor and devotion he might always rely. that idea was the germ from which grew the imperial guard. the most magnificent fighting machine of ancient or modern times. immediately upon assuming the office of first consul napoleon began the organization of his guard. which was to be an ideal regiment. culled with care from the flower of the chivalry of france. the qualifications of a candidate for the guard were that he should be able to read and write. that he must have made at least four campaigns. obtained rewards for deeds of valor or noble conduct. or been wounded. above all. he must have maintained an irreproachable character. he gave his personal attention to the discipline and training of these soldiers. looked after their comfort and their conduct. shared their hardships. wept with them. and rejoiced with them. this body of soldiers. augmented and perfected. became the famous imperial guard. which conquered europe and enshrined its creator in the most brilliant halo of glory that ever encircled the brow of man. it never recoiled before a human foe. and with the single exception of waterloo never failed to retrieve the most desperate situation. even on that fatal day it was true to its tradition. \"the old guard diesit never surrenders.\" when the eagles of the old guard were seen advancing through the smoke of battle the result was no longer in doubt. the force it possessed over otherssays the historiai headleywas as muchmoral as physical. beaten troops rallied at its approach. despair gave way to confidence. and the cry of terror was changed into the shout of victory. the enemy. on the other hand. when they saw the -deep and missive columns of the guard approach. were already half beaten. the prestige of victory that went with the eagles paralyzed their arms. and they struggled against hope. so perfect was their discipline that their tread was unlike that of other regiments. while the consciousness of their power gave a graudeur to their movements no other body of troops in the world has ever possessed. napoleon loved them devotedly and called them his children. and well did they deserve his love. for him they knew no weariness or pain. and for his welfare they would move steadily on death. whether or not senator quay got his idea of a political organization from napoleon. certain it was that he worked on that same plan in pennsylvania. and the results were analogous. the most influential. loyal. and uncompromising republicans and the most successful party workers were won over to his standard by the magnetism of his personality and served him .with a loyalty and devotion quite as unswerving as the old guard of napoleon served their general and emperor. when a political contest was to be won. all senator quay needed t6 do was to give the word and there were no questions asked. it was enough that \"the old man.\" as he was affectionately styled by his adherents. wished it so. it was said of the old guard of napoleon that it never made a charge that did not give an impulse to liberty. that every time it broke the ranks of the despots of europe it wrenched a fetter from the hum.an mind. that its heavy footsteps sounded the death knell of tyranny in all europe. and that its iron columns shattered feudalism into a thousand fragments. of senator quays political organization in pennsylvania it may be said tmat it always stood a \" column of granite\" for the principles of the republican party. it never charged the enemy unless to rescue its general from beneath the hoofs of malice and detraction that it did not lessen the burdens of the people. take a long step in the direction of progress or put to rout the enemies of protection. fierce factional strife was often engendered. when all the batteries of villification were let loose and all aimed at their leader. but they never faltered in their allegiance. only a man of extraordinary qualities of head and heart .could have retained his adherdnts under such circumstances. senator quay won men to him by acts of kindness. by his gentle. modest. unassuming manners. by the warmth of his sympathies and the unerring wisdom of his counsels. he held them by a religious adherence to his promises and by the exhibition of a lively sense of gratitude for services rendered. during his numerous contests for political supremacy in pennsylvania he had many opportunities to test the loyalty of his friends. and in no instance did they fail him. the devotion of senator quays followers was the greatest source of his satisfaction and pride. he joyed in their good fortunes. and at their sorrows bowed his head in grief. to illustrate: during the memorable struggle of the quay and antiquay factions for supremacy in 1899. when practically all of the leading state officials. a large majority of the daily newspapers. the republican organizations of philadelphia and pittsburg. and many of his former allies in the rural districts had deserted him. and senator quay was fighting for political life. he was conducting his campaign for state chairinan at his headquarters in philadelphia. he was sitting at a table one day surrounded by a number of his faithful friends and coworkers when a messenger entered and laid a package of letters before him. he had been exerting every energy and drawing upon every resource of his power in what appeared to be a desperate. almost hopeless contest. every one of his old guard had been called upon to aid in the struggle. and senator quay had written many appeals for succor with his own hand. when these letters were laid before him he opened and read the first one. and his eyes were immediately flooded with tears. one of his friends who sat near. noticing his agitation. and thinking the letter contained some unwelcome news from home. asked if there was anything serious the matter. senator quay attempted to reply. but choked with emotion and walked hastily into an adjoining room in order to conceal his perturbation. his friend picked up the letter. which had been left lying on the table. in order to ascertain what it was that had so wrought upon the senators feelings. it was in the handwriting of a girl. and simply said: \"dear mr. quay: father is dead. but mother and the boys are for you.\" . the devotion of napoleon to his old guard was never more beautifuly illustrated than that. senator quays genius for political organization was also utilized to good effect in national politics. and on several notable occasions proved to be of vast importance to the republican party. bit the \"silent man of beaver\" possessed greater qualities than a genius for political organization and leadership: he was a gallant soldier during the civil war. having rose to the rank of colonel. \"he was a scholar. and a ripe and good one.\" it would have been difficult to find a man anywhere whose familiarity with the classics and whose knowledge of history. ancient and modern. were greater than his. he was the post sessor of one of the finest private libraries in pennsylvania. and it was his special delight to be alone with his books. to commune with the great souls of other centuries. he was a statesman. but in this regard \" his praise is hymned by loftier harps than mine.! he was not only admired. but loved. by the greatest of his colleagues in the senate. the late senator vest. of -missouri. said of him: \"of all the public men with whom it was my pleasure to associate in washington i admired senator quay most and loved him best.\" other great men of that body were equally devoted to him. and the present occupant of the white house was his sincere friend. the admiration was reciprocal. for senator quay regarded president roosevelt as the ablest. most courageous. and altogether wholesome man of affairs of this generation. senator quay was not an orator in the commonly accepted meaning of the word. he did not affect the graces of declamation. he preferred deeds to words. men speak but little when vanity does not induce them to speak. and as vain men are generally shallow. and shallowness is always noisy. loquacity is oftener an evidence of littleness than of greatness. senator quay spoke only when he had a message to deliver. and then always in behalf of othersnever for mere ostentation or vainglory. but he was the master of a clear and forceful literary style. and when it became necessary to make hipnself heard. he expressed himself in language that was classic in its purity. pregnant with thought. and bristling with logic and power. senator quay was a lover of nature. he loved the mountains. the woods. the ocean. the flowing rivers. and the rippling brooks. he was kind. genial. companionable. sympathetic. distress never appealed to him in vain. to the voice of sorrow he gave a willing ear. and took up the burdens of others as cheerfully as if they were his own. he loved his friends and forgave a contrite enemy. with cordial magnanimity. in spite of misrepresentation and detraction. born of rivalry and the rancor of faction. it may yet be truthfully affirmed that of all the great characters that have impressed their individualities upon the imperial commonwealth of pennsylvania. none will be cherished with a more ardent and enduring affection by its people than matthew stanley quay.","the gentleman will never have spent two hours better. mr. speaker. the gentleman from massachusetts has called my attention to an omission. for which i apologize to the house. i have said that the democratic party has always been the force which contributed permanent features to- the development of our constitution and defeated every dangerous proposal which republican politicians or their predecessors had attempted to inject into our political system. i should have added that there is one other mission which the democratic party has been frequently called upon to perform. and that is to rescue the country from the industrial depression which has never failed to follow any extended period of republican ascendency. the gentleman must recall two great panics. one in 1873 and one in 1893. they both proceeded from the same causes and both were cured by exactly the same remedy. they both were the result of republican profligacy. the same republican profligacy which has brought over this country now the shadow of a disaster that disturbs the confidence of republican leaders and endangers the volume of contributions by republican financiers.the gravest danger thatcan threaten the prospects of that party. the panic of 1873 was caused through the extravagance and profligacy of republican administration here in washington. the panic of 1898 proceeded from precisely the same cause. and just as long as republican administrations scatter the contents of the treasury with lavish handthat is to say. just as often as republican presidents occupy the white house and republican majorities control congressevery period of republican ascendency will be followed by violent panics and long periods of depression. mr. speaker. gentlemen on the other side seem to think that there is a different law governing the property and prosperity of a nation from that which governs the property and prosperity of individuals. but no state can waste its resources and escape distress any more than an individual can dissipate his capital and escape bankruptcy. i do not care how rich a man may be. if he spends more than his income hb must either retrench or collapse. if he has a million dollars a year and he spends a million and a half. one of two things must happen. he may continue his extravagance and become hopelessly bankrupt. or he may stop his extravagance and begin to retrench. if he begins to retrench in time. the restoration of his solvency is certain. but the period of retrenchment will be very unpleasant. what is true of an individual is equally true of a nation. under republican administrations this government has nearly always lived beyond its revenues. from final and irreparable disaster the country has always been delivered by democratic reformers. because republicanism has been profligate it has maintained an appearance of splendor. which the unthinking often mistake for prosperity. while the democratic party. which is essentially frugal. suffers from a certain unpopularity which stern economy always provokes. from the close of the war to 1873 the republican party was in absolute control of the government in all its branches. and as a consequence the treasury was wide open. one patriot after anotherhelped himself to its contents. they finally began to quarrel over a distribution of the spoils. and through their disputes the extent of the corruption became public. the cr6dit mobilier scandal made plain a political demoralization so widespread that it affected even the congress of the united states. while a financial panic of great severity produced widespread distress. and the people awoke to a conception of their condition. they sent down a democratic majority to this house which reduced the cost of government decisively. while by exposing fraud and driving the perpetrators from public life it created a wholesome public sentiment which checked for many years any revival of extravagance. after five years of very strict economy the country. which had been plunged in industrial prostration. rose once more to its feet and entered quite naturally upon a period of prosperity. and of this the republicans stole the credit. [applause on the democratic side and laughter on the republican side.]the panic of 1893 presents the same story in the causes that produced it and the patriotic service which remedied it. in 1889 a democratic administration left office. it had accumulated a surplus in the treasury of over one hundred millions. the question which perplexed the people was how they should dispose of their treasure. the prosperity was enormous and growing every hour. as genuine prosperity always must grow. in 1888 the protected industries. whose right to levy taxes on the people had been challenged by a democratic executive. were able to purchase an election. the democratic candidate was defeated. and within two years that treasury. which had been full to overflowing. was a gaping void. through profligate expenditures and a ruinously restrictive tariff the revenues which had been yielding a surplus sank below expenditures until at the end of the harrison administration the secretary of the treasury was on the point of issuing bonds to obtain sufficient funds for the support of government. by a vicious financial system a delusive appearance of prosperity was still maintained. financiers gambled on wall street and appeared to be making enormous gains. speculators were buying yachts and projecting the erection of palaces. but wages had no increase. the inevitable congequence of that fictitious prosperity followed. a growing deficit in the treasury made the advent of a panic certain. the democracy came into power at the very hour that republican profligacy culminatedin disaster. the dark cloud of industrial distress appeared in the financial sky. not from the wilson bill. but before a word of it was written. it settled down over the length and breadth of this country like a pal]. wrapping in its sinister folds countless thousands of homes. while the gaunt specter of starvation was seen once more stalking through american highways and knocking at the doors that sheltered american labor. there is danger. sir. to fear a reappearance of the same specter. now that the prosperity which democrats restored after 1893 is again endangered by the iniquities of the republican party. the depression which followed the crash of 1893. prpduced by republican profligacy. was relieved by democratic frugality and honesty just as prosperity was restored after the crash of 1873. today. sir. we see many reasons to apprehend the collapse which always follows republican ascendency. mr. speaker. i will ask the gentleman from massachusetts . who interrupted me. to tell the house why it is that business has decreased so seriously during the last year by the confession of everyone? some may doubt whether we are on the verge of a panic. but nobody will deny that business has declined. why has it declined. i ask you gentlemen who insist that republican ascendency is all that is necessary to insure prosperity? you say that mr. roosevelt is as good as reelected. you say that republicans are secure in the control of government for the next four years. why. then. is prosperity disappearing when all the conditions of prosperity. according to the republican evangel. are here? has there been any failure of crops? have floods broken loose and overflowed. the banks of our rivers. submerging farms and wrecking houses? are our mines any less rich in treasure? are our fields less fertile? are men less industrious or less moral? is there any cloud of war on our horizon? no one will pretend that any of these disasters has befallen us. and. mr. speaker. if providence has not withdrawn his favor from us. there can be no other cause for the decline in our prosperity than the folly or corruption of man. it maybe said here. sir. as it has often been said before. that industrial depression always follows industrial prosperity. according to some mysterious law which none but republican politicians has been able to discover. sir. there is no such law. if this had been a genuine prosperity. every day that it lasted would have insured a morrow of wider production. if prosperity means abundant production. every day of prosperity must result in swelling the amount of capital available to reenforce the hands of the workingman. to make his product larger and therefore his wages higher than ever before. but this prosperity. sir. must be a prosperity coming from production. if it be a prosperity coming from plunder. it is evasive. delusive. temporary. always followed by exhaustion of the plundered and demoralization of the plunderers. the serious restriction of industry. the prolonged stagnation of all commerce. why. mr. speaker. i ask again. has prosperity declined in this country? iwill tell you. prosperity has declined and is declining because it is not built wholly on production. blt largely on plunder. because the business of the country in large measure is either carried on at a loss or on false pretensesat a loss if tariff protection be necessary to make it profitable for its promoters. on false pretenses if it would be selfsustaining without any assistance from the government. at the same time the necessity for disposing of the enormous revenues produced by high protection has led to extravagant appropriations. profligate expenditures. demoralization of our entire system. political. social. and industrial. here. sir. are abundant reasons for the decline of our prosperity and for the recurrence of that depression and stagnation which eonfront us. sir. what is the remedy? it is simply to reform. cease extravagance. end the system that breeds it. encourage every man to engage in industry by preventing anyone from profiting through the spoliation of his neighbors. when all men are secure in the enjoyment of everything produced by their labor. there is no limit to the number of human beings that this soil can support. for then every man. being employed profitably. will produce more than he can consume. and then every increase of the population will be a fountain of additional wealth to the community. sir. we read in the scriptures that when the children of israel were famishing from thirst in the desert.moses.by striking the rock with his rod. brought forth abundant streams of water by which they were refreshed and saved from destruction. democrats believe that as the rod in the hands of the prophet brought forth abundant streams of water from the rock the spade in the hands of labor can bring commodities in measureless abundance from the bosom of the earth. in concluding this speech. extended much longer than necessary by reason of the many interruptions with which i have been favored. i repeat. sir. that the distinction between the two parties can be reduced to an exceedingly narrow compass. republicans believe that prosperity can be created by legislation. we believe that if it be genuine it must be created by labor. you believe that success in manufacture should depend on the favor of government. we believe it should depend solely upon the excellence of the product. you believe that part of the people should be paid for engaging in unprofitable occupations from the profits of selfsustaining industries. we believe that every member of the population should be employed in profitable industry and left to support himself and enrich himself by his own labor and nothing else. the whole democratic faith is embraced in one principle. which can be formulated in a single sentence. if i had my way i would make it the whole democratic platform. for it embodies every principle of government which democrats believe essential to the welfare and peace of a nation. it is the principle that government has no right to do anything for one man that it can not do and does not do for all men. that democratic principle of equal rights for all is the true principle of security. of glory. and of prosperity. build your laws upon it and the foundation of your government will be so firn that no convulsion can ever disturb it. and your flag will acquire a brighter glory than has ever entwined it. make it the basis of your industrial system. and your prosperity will not be delusive or temporary. interrupted by recurring panics and long periods of industrial stagnation. but it will be permanent. uninterrupted. and real. for its source will not be the ever narrowing fountain of plunder. but the ever widening fountain of production. and its tide will be abundant. measureless. deepening. growing forever and forever. [loud and longcontinued applause.]","does the senator from rhode island yield to the senator from minnesota?\n570099241|i should be glad to know whether the provision relating to anthracite coal in the tariff bill was inserted in this body or in the other house?\n570099242|in this body. the provision was inserted at the instance of a senator from the pacific coast.\n570099243|will the senator permit me?\n570099244|certainly.\n570099245|i simply want to make a remark in answer to the senator from minnesota . the wilson tariff law. which was passed in 1894. put a duty of 40 cents a ton upon soft coal and placed hard coalanthracite coalupon the free list. the dingley bill in 1897 came from the house to the senate with the same provisions as those contained in the wilson law. after the bill came to the senate. the majority of the finance committee instructed the senior senator from iowa to move an amendment in the senate increasing the 40 cents per ton duty on soft coal to 67 cents. and then inserting these words:  upon all other coal having less than.92 per cent of fixed carbon. 97 cents per ton. a debate followed. which covered seven pages of the congressional record. in that debate it was admitted on both sides. as the record will show. that the words less than 92 per cent fixed carbon included anthracite coal. i have before me now the vote taken in the senate on the amendment offered by the senator from iowa. there were 31 votes. all republican but one. in the affirmative and 24 votes. democrats and populists. in the negative. i assert here now that. in my opinion. every senator who voted upon that question knew he was voting for or against a duty on anthracite coal of 67 cents per ton. it has so been construed ever since. and the debate in 1897 proceeded on that assumption. that is the true history of the present duty upon anthracite coal. the leaders of the republican party have remained silent under the chargethe appropriate chargemade by the secretary of the navy that the duty upon anthracite coal was put into the dingley bill in a cowardly and sneaking manner. i am not thrusting myself into this debate between these distinguished gentlemen. who are far more capable than i am to defend themselves. i simply allude to this fact to show that the standpat policy has overridden everything else. and the republican leaders leave that statement of a member of the cabinet unanswered rather than permit an assault upon a single provision of the dingley bill.\n570099246|i now ask that the resolution may go over without prejudice.\n570099247|the senator from rhode island asks that the resolution go over until tomorrow. retaining its present position as a resolution offered on a previous day.\n570099248|if the senator from rhode island or any other senator wants to discuss the resolution. i have no objection. but i do not expect to be in the senate tomorrow. and i should like to have a vote upon his motion.\n570099249|mr. president. the resolution can go over until some time in the future convenient to the senator from missouri. when he can be here. i am not anxious about it coming up tomorrow. but i think the senator will recognize the fact that. in view of the last statement he has made.. it will certainly meet a denial on this side of the chamber.\n570099250|very good.\n570099251|we can not discuss it at the present moment.\n570099252|very well. let the resolution go over until tomorrow. with the understanding that it shall then come up and be voted upon.\n570099253|there can be no

that the bill i named a little while ago be laid before the senate. i do not ask that it be read.\n570099261|the chair lays before the senate the bill referred to by the senator from massachusetts. the title of which will be stated.\n570099262|a bill for the regulation of trusts or corporations engaged in international or interstate commerce.\n570099263|mr. president. i suppose that nearly all thoughtful men in this country are agreed that some legislation. state or national. ought to be had for the regulation and control of what are called trusts. and of large masses of capital. whether that term  trust  may be properly applicable to them or not. accumulated by corporations or artificial persons holding property and conducting business without individual liability. i suppose. in general. when men speak of trusts they mean a combination of such corporations. commonly with each other. although sometimes with natural persons. for the purpose of controlling some manufacture or some carrying trade or commerce. and of driving competitors out of the field. it is possible that this may be accomplished. however. by a single individual or a single corporation. so the remedy. if one be needed. to be wholly effectual must to a considerable extent be applicable to trusts. technically so called. to single corporations. and in some few cases to private copartnerships or individuals. there is no doubt that there is a general feeling of insecurity and alarm about this matter. the great political parties have promised a remedy in their platforms. candidates for office have discussed it all over the country. the president has called attention to it in his message and in his speeches. the attorneygeneral of the united states has lately made to the public a careful statement. in which he told the people of his attempts. which have met certainly with gratifying success. to put down great combinations. one was a combination to control the price of a prime article of food. another was a combination to control the carrying trade in a food product in a great section of the country. another still was to contrdl the general carryingtrade of another large section of the country. by a combination of great railroads. as yet. mr. president. there has been only alarm and apprehension. without serious injury. with the very serious and important exception of the recent coal strike. the country has not suffered from this evil in any way to affect the general prosperity. our manufacturi ng and producing and exporting power has increased of late as never before. our foreign commerce is 1.382 millions. as against 1.363 millions of great britain. 1.113 millions of germany. and 804 millions of france. our domestic commerce is said to be more than twenty times as great as that with foreign nations. our national wealth has grown nearly onehalf in the last ten years. we have a larger national revenue than any other country in the world. except two. our export of manufactured articles. which is still behind that of great britain and germany. has increased in ten years 155 per cent. while the exports of great britain of manufactured articles have increased less than 18 per cent. those of germany less than 30 per cent. and those of france less than 10 per cent. we are foremost among the nations of the world now in the three great elements of national prosperityagriculture. manufacture. and commerce. we now produce more for our own consumption than any other nation. we are now the best customer to other countries. and. if there be no interruption to our progress. shall soon be the largest seller to foreign nations on the face of the earth. there is no doubt. also. that in general the condition of our workmen everywhere is on the whole better not only than that of other countries. but better. too. than our own at any previous period of our history. so it is for the future more than for the present that the wisdom of our legislators is called upon to take thought. and. mr. president. the condition of that country is unhappy whose legislator does not take thought for the future even more than for the present. happy is the people whose statesmen foresee and prevent grievances. instead of waiting to experience them to cure them. in dealing with this trust problem and the danger of vast accumulations of wealth in single private hands we are seeking to lay down beforehand the law of a healthy life and not to grope after a cure for a deadly sickness. yet i wish to submit to the judgment of the senate that we are dealing with a real peril and not with a fancied or imaginary danger. mr. webster predicted in 1820 that the law in france that provided for the division of lands among all the children. instead of primogeniture. would overthrow the french monarchy. he lived to congratulate himself that he had seen the prediction fulfilled. now. if the accumulation of large real estates in single hands under primogeniture were the fortress and bulwark of monarchy and aristocracy and the division of lands among all the children were sure to bring with it republican liberty. is it not equally true that the accumulation of vast fortunes in individual hands. that the holding of great landed estates. or the subjecting of great masses of wealth and great industries to individual control by means of corporate power will have a corresponding effect to destroy. or overthrow. or at least to limit and impair. republican liberty? i have been told. i have no doubt truly. that there is one individual in this country whose private fortune amounted. some years ago. to a thousand million dollars. there are others who are said to reckon their fortunes by the hundred million. i do not wish to speak of individuals. but i will say that i have been told that these gentlemen. who are supposed to reckon their property by the hundred millions. are believedi am sure trulyto be postessed of great private virtues. they arenearly all of themmen of public spirit. of sagacity. of patriotism. and of large civic wisdom. their neighbors and their countrymen respect them. and i believe they are worthy of that respect. i do not speak of them as public dangers in themselves. but i refer to them only as examples of .what may be possible in the future. beside these vast accumulations. undoubtedly. each of these gentlemen controls a large aggregate of capital. with which he is connected. to an amount nearly or quite equal to. sometimes far exceeding. that which he possesses himself. now. mir. president. suppose it be true that the fortunes to which i have referred have. as i believe. been accumulated almost wholly within a period of thirty years. suppose they happen to pass to a single heir. is there anything to render it unlikely that if one of these vast fortunes has grown from a hundred thousand to a hundred million or a thousand million in thirty years that if the country grow as we expect. still more. if it grow as we all think possible. that in the hands of the next possessor in another thirty or fifty years the hundred million may become a hundred thousand million. or the thousand million a thousand thousand million? is there- anything to stop the accumulation of these snowballs? can not the same power and business ability that can control one or two branches of commerce or trade or manufacture. or one product of the earth. control others? can not the capital that can control all the petroleum in the country by and by control all the coal? can it not control the railroad and the ocean carrying trade? can it not buy up and hold in one mans grasp the agricultural and grazing lands of new and great states. and the coal mines and silver mines and copper mines? but. mr. president. the natural man dies. he can not control his property. except for a life or lives in being and a little time thereafter. his estate is quickly scattered. it must be brought. commonly. into the light of day. it must be distributed by law. inventoried. and accounted for. and the public exact such a share of it by way of succession tax as may be thought reasonable. once in twentyfive years the whole individual wealth of the country goes through the probate court. there are few great estates that survive. where there is no primogeniture. for more than two or three generations. but the corporation is an artificial being. a corporation that engages in commerce with foreign countries or among the several states is the creature of another power than that of congress. the law of its being is given to it by another power than ours. it is regulated and controlled by another power than ours. it never dies. it is never wound up. it is not like a partnership. which must be settled when the individual dies. or grows old. or wants to go out of business. it never goes through the probate court. its internal transactions are kept secret. it is not zealous for its own honor or reputation. except so far as its honor or reputation is essential to its getting money. it has no soul and no conscience. in general. the men who are most powerful in its management can. if they see fit. avoid responsibility to public opinion. they always expect to avoid personal liability for obligations. now. as i have said. these powers may be in good hands now. in general. but suppose they happen to be in bad hands? the military power of the united states in our times of trial. happily for us. was in the hands of washington and grant. but suppose some napoleon had got control of it. suppose some napoleon of 51.8 finance and business happen to get a thousand million dollars. is not that possibility a real and terrible public danger? i shall be told that the american people will be left. and will be able to take care of themselves. that is true. i am talking to the american people about a way to take care of themselves. i think the best way to take care of ourselves is to prevent the danger. and not to encounter it in its full strength. i have no doubt the american people will be competent to overthrow any tyrant or despot that may get possession of the powers of our government. but i think it a better way to arrange matters so that no tyrant or despot will ever get hold of them. why. mr. president. think of this money power which i have so imperfectly described. is there another power likely to be so dangerous politically? you will not trust the best man in the united states to be president more than four years. or to be governor of a state more than one or two or three years without submitting himself to a reelection. you will not let a member of the house of representatives keep his seat beyond two years. or a member of the senate more than six years. an unwritten law has provided. and so far it has been executed. that no president of the united states. if he were another washington or another lincoln. shall hold office. even by reelection. more than twice. yet this power that i have spoken of may last for a lifetime. if the genius and capacity continue in the same family. as the genius of politics has continued in some of our families in this country and in england. it may last. growing and enlarging and accumulating for generations. or even for centuries. can not one of these colossal fortunes. as i said just now. buy up every railroad in the country? can it not control every line of transportation by sea or lake? can it not control the coal fields and the gold mines and the silver mines? can it not get possession of the lands in the new states? can it not buy up legislatures and nominating conventions and electorates? can it not make great parties dependent on it for success in great elections? such a power as i have just described is greater than the power of many states. it is greater than the power of any nation. except ours. on this continent. it can make wars or it can prevent wars. as was said of the rothschilds. it can threaten a community with a coal famine or a wheat famine and it can execute its threat. thirty years ago. or more. when these things were in their infancy. an eloquent orator saidand it was hardly an exaggeration when he said itthat tom scott traveled across the continent from san francisco to new york. and with every sweep of his garment knocked down a legislature. the chief evils of the trust are: 1. destruction of competition. 2. the management of local industries by absentees in the interest of absentee capital. 3. destruction of local public spirit. 4. fraudulent capitalization. 5. secrecy. 6. management fof the private benefit of the officials. 7. the power to corrupt elections. and in some cases to corrupt the courts. 8. the want of personal responsibility to public sentiment. 9. the absence of personal liability for contracts or wrongdoing. 10. the holding of vast properties in mortmainin the dead hand. if we may use the ancient phrase of the english law. but it has life enough for all purposes of power to serve the will that wields it. it is dead only to the influence of any nerve which comes from the brain or heart of the people. every senator can find in his own experience plenty of illustration of what i am saying. i hope i have learned something from my own. i chose for my abode in my youth a little city of less than 15.000 people. when i went there there were but two rich men in it. as we now count wealth. there was. i believe. but one man who kept a span of horses and a carriage for the service of his household. but it was a marvelous example of american genius. growing and expanding in the air of american liberty. it was the very center and home of invention. within 12 miles of the spot where i live was born eli whitney. the inventor of the cotton gin. who doubled the value of every acre of land in this country on which cotton can grow. six miles in another direction was born erastus bigelow. the inventor of the carpet machine. six miles in another direction lived blanchard. the inventor of the machine for turning irregular forms. perhaps the most important single mechanical invention that had been made in the country down to his time. eight miles another way was born whittemore. inventor of the card clothing machine. that marvelous mechanism which. when it makes a mistake. rings a bell and calls for help. twelve miles another way was born and lived elias howe. the inventor of the sewing machine. when the war broke out mr. howe enlisted as a private. when in its embarrassment in the summer of 1861 the government could not pay its soldiers. this private soldier drew his check for all the arrears due his regiment of a thousand men for some months. in the town itself lived the inventor of the envelope machine. and the two men who. in the beginning rivals and competitors. brought the loom to its perfection. in that town also the modern plow was brought from a rude instrument. a mere knife to cut the soil. to its present condition of unrivaled excellence. there also the great wire industry. which. begun by pulling the heated iron through a hole in a bit of steel with a pair of pinchers by hand power. in a blacksmiths shop. has grown until one establishment employed 7.000 workmen. supporting 35.000 people. and was the largest and most profitable wire manufactory in the world. all around me there are homesteads. some bordering my own. owned by inventors. foremen. and skilled workmen. who have acquired fortunes in this honorable service. so beneficent to mankind and so honorable to their country. there was no water power there. no fertile prairie. no seaport. no mine. they bring their material from across the continent to work it up into their products. and send it back again across the continent to be sold in the very market from which their material came. it was not water power or steam power or electricity. it was man power. it was brain power. that wrought this miracle. not only americans of mechanical genius have gathered there. but men who seek honorable employment come from across the sea. the irishman within little more than a generation has come there in large numbers to learn the lesson of american citizenship. he has sent home his wages to father and mother and brother and wife and child. affording an example of generosity and of rapid growth in the best elements of character unexampled. i venture to say. in human history. the scandinavian and the norwegian have come there to contribute an element to our citizenship not surpassed in the sterling qualities of integrity. good sense. of industry. and of love for the republic by any other class of men. native or. adopted. the frenchman also has brought his industry. his thrift. his charming nature to temper the general being with his delightful quality. the little town has grown to be a mighty city. it has grown to a city of 130.000 people. it is the very home and paradise of wellpaid labor. i have in mind one instance. a neighbor. a friend of mine. belonging to that scandinavian race. of which my friend from minnesota is so admirable a representative. he was one of the best workers of iron in his class in norway. he used to get $4 a week in his native land. when he got to worcester he spent the first night in an empty freight car. he had no money to pay for his lodging. he could not speak a word of english. he went up street in the morning. and met a countryman who took him to the shop where he himself was employed. he was instantly hired at $1.50 a day. which was more than twice as much as he got at home. in a few weeks his wages were raised. in a year or two he became foreman of a room where 40 or 50 men were employed. before he died he was himself at the head of an establishment of his own. his name was known throughout the country. having. i believe. seven or eight hundred men in his employ. now. mr. president. these men were interested in worcester. they took a pride in her noble history. they saw her grow. they helped her grow. they were the leading men in the churches and the schools and the organizations of charity. her houses and schools and colleges and shops were the pride of her people. they were as jealous of her honor as of their own. they were the managers and directors of every institution of education or charity. they subscribed to her libraries and her colleges and her polytechnic school. the wealth which had come down upon them like the dew or the rain of heaven they gave back to the city of their love in streams of charity large as seas. when the war came they gave their lives. or their sons gave their lives. to save the country. they knew the great american secret. the secret of local public spirit. they knew that the man who loves his city and his town best loves also his state and his country best. now. mr. president. what is to happen to these american communities. of which the one to which i have alluded is but a single example among thousands? if the presenttendency keeps on. the industries of worcester and every like community are to be owned and controlled by absentee capital. whether an enterprise shall be undertaken in portland or bridgeport or new haven is to depend on the opinion. in the end. of somebody in new york or chicago or st. louis. not only local competition. but individual competition is gone. the skilled workman who is conscious that he can do his work better than anybody else can not offer himself to two or twenty or one hundred competitors. each seeking the advantage of his skill. there is one central power alone with which he must deal and one dominant will to which he must submit. there may be a little help for him by joining a labor union. where he gets the advantage of associated strength on his side. but the labor union knows no difference between excellence and the reverse. the inefficient man and the lazy man and the dull man must stand on one dead level with the brightest and keenest and. most ingenious of his comrades. what would have become of all the inventors to whom i have alluded if they could have offered their inventions. to whatever branch of manufacture they related. to but one single customer and had been compelled to accept his terms? what is to become of our local communities. of our local public spirit. of our local charities. of our local institutions of religion or education? must we depend on a man in san francisco oy albany. n. y.. or new york city if a church in worcester be in need. or if a widow of an honored citizen come to poverty in her old age? mr. president. there are other evils in these great combinations of capital. some of them will be more than counterbalanced by the corresponding advantage. i confess i like to see pierpont morgan buying up great lines of ocean steamships. i like to hear of foreign potentates and principalities and powers bowing down when he visits the continent of europe. i do not object if the knees of the old lady of threadneedle street tremble and strike together when he visits london. we need great strength. we need great individual power if we are to rival foreign nations in the great matters which they also control by individual power. we must. if we can. look out in protecting ourselves not to destroy them or to cramp them. we can give them a law which will not impair their strength and not check their natural and rightful growth. and that. i hope. is all we mean to do. but it will be a bad bargain if we buy the dominion of the continent or the empire of the sea at the cost of american local public spirit. we are to have a close wrestle with the back hug with foreign countries for the commerce. the manufacture. and the carrying trade of the world. we mean to try to have the accounts of mankind some time settled in new york or chicago. as they are settled now in london. . we mean to get the superiority of the carrying trade by sea. which we had before 1860 in the day of the clipper ship and the packet. you. mr. president . though a young man. can remember. i think. that in those days. when john bull came in with a ship freighted with the crop of the season to a port in asia or the mediterranean. lie found uncle sam on the wharf smoking his pipe. with his feet dangling over the water. with his cargo all sold. and the money in his pocket. i like. as i just said. to see the great american financiers buying up foreign lines of steamships.. i like to hear of american engineers building foreign railroads and of american architects putting american iron or steel girders into great buildings in foreign capitals. for this great capital and great combinations are essential. i do not grudge the men that do it either their wealth or their power. it is said that the tariff fosters these trusts. and that one way to check them is to put every article manufactured by a trust upon the free list. that. i do not think. would help matters much. certainly it would not reach carxiers or dealers in the natural product of the country. like the standard oil company. or the dealers in cotton or wheat. or the owners of mines. the railroad and the steamboat companies would thrive by bringing in the foreign products. beside. as was well said the other day. i think by my colleague. if you put the product of the trust on the free listunless the trust have an absolute monopoly of the articleyou will kill out all of its weaker competitors and give it the whole domestic field. and you give an advantage to the foreign trust over the individual domestic manufacturer. there may be some weight and value to the suggestion. and the remedy may be worth thinking of. if there be any case where any article is wholly controlled and monopolized by a trust. i can easily understand the impatience and indignation of the gentlemen who have made this proposition when they think of an artificial being. with an artificial capital and an artificial stock. crushing out all domestic competition by an adroit and illegal artifice and getting control of the home market. so i do not wonder that that remedy has occurred to some good men. but i do not believe it will bear examination. at any rate. i think i can find a better one and. as i believe. that will not destroy the policy by which this country has gained its present prosperity. i spoke just now of these great corporate powers. whether exercised in combination or by single corporations. as compared with the frequent return to the people of all powers of government. state and national. mr. president. mr. calhoun. i think it was. said that when the patronage of this government should have so increased that the party in power could appoint and control a hundred thousand officials it could never be dislodged. they would be. as he thought. too strong for the people. he overrated. undoubtedly. the strength of the officeholder. - he underrated the strength of the men out of power who desire to become officeholders. and he underrated the wisdoih and patriotism of the american people and its capacity to take care of itself in time. we have protected ourselves against that danger in part by our civilservice laws. just as we will protect ourselves sooner or later against the danger from aggregate wealth without a revolution. and. i hope. without social disorder or the overthrow of our institutions or interfering with our form of government. just consider how comparatively trifling is the power of an administration so far as it depends. or ever depended. upon its officeholders compared with that of a great aggregate of corporations or great accumulatioja of wealth such as i have described. you will elect your governor only for one or two or three years. and your president for four. and your senator for six. and your representative for two. all your executive officers are removable. and most of the important officials. state and national. go out of power with the party with whom they came in. they have moderate salaries. the senator gets less salary. and the representative gets less salary. not only than the mayors of important cities. but less than fashionable tailors pay their cutters. now. these great corporations can appoint their agents for life. or as long as they do the bidding of the central will. in every town or village where there is a shop or an agency or a depot the corporation has one of the most skillful or influential men in the community for its life officer. it can bid successfully against the government when it wants the great lawyer for judge of the supreme court of the united states or attorneygeneral. it can pay for a single fee not only more than a public officer can save for his old age. but more than the aggregate compensation of his life. i had two friends and intimate companions in my youth at the law school. one of them died lately. in the great office of judge of the supreme court of the united states. known and honored as one of the great judges of the world. leaving behind him a simple and modest competence (i suppose he had gainedthat before he went upon the bench) after his nearly forty years of illustrious service. the other. also dead. is said by his biographer to have received one single fee of a million dollars. not only this. mr. president. but these great powers can put their hand on a village or a town or a city and it will grow and flourish or it will dwindle and wither. according to the edict of an outside and irresistible will. the great railroad or the great manufacturing establishment holds in its hands the fate of cities and of states. if massachusetts undertake to curb or regulate a corporation at lowell or fall river. and the president in new york does not like it he can move it to indianapolis or chicago. the state undertakes to pass its laws regulating the hours of labor. or the sanitary conditions. or the employment of children in the factory in massachusetts. what has happened? the trust moves its factory to rhode islandthat is all. now. what is the consequence? the workmen must combine for selfdefense. they also catch the spirit of monopoly and unlawful combination. the edict of their boss must be obeyed also. the workman who does not submit his individual will to the edict of the trade union can neither work himself nor teach his children to work. the whole manufacture of the country in any branch on one side and the whole labor of the country in that manufacture on the other are to be controlled by two great corporations. by which. as between the upper and the nether millstone. the liberty of the individual. which has made alike the glory and the strength of the republic. is gone. but the owner says. have i not a right to do what i will with mine own?  you have not the right to do what you will with your own when you get wealth in such masses that it becomes a menace to the state. you have not that right when you are a corporation deriving all your powers from the state or nation. while you are an artificial being. created by the state or nation. into whom the state or nation has put the breath of life and given the law to its being. you are absolutely subject to the state or nation. the state or nation has the right toimpose a law upon yourbeing which shall make you healthful and not hurtful to the community. the state created you. it gave you your immunity from personal responsibility for debts. it commits to you. if you are a railroad or if you are a manufacturing corporation using water power. its own great right of eminent domain. congress has the right to say that no such artificial being shall engage in interstate commerce except on certain conditions. one of those conditions will be the personal liability of your individual members for contracts and for wrongs. unless you comply with its commands. you have got your power from the public. your property would be valueless but for the agencies and powers which have been committed to you by the state. the state has delegated to you its power of eminent domain. the right to take private lands. and to cross highways and navigable waters. and to lay your track in some cases along the highways. the state has as much right to compel you so to use your powers that you shall not be an injury to the individual engaged in lawful comnierce as it has to require you so to manage your locomotive that you shall not be a danger to men lawfully traveling on the highway or to the passenger whom you carry. now. mr. president. do not let me be misunderstood. i am sounding no note of despair. i am not even sounding a note of alarm. i am not afraid. the american people are not afraid. the spirit of american liberty. and the strength of american law. the power of the american congress. the power of the american people in its legislatures. state and national. the firmness and justice and strength of the american courts. will be our safety against this danger. as they have been our safety against others. nobody is afraid. we can capture this fortress easily enough. but the engineers must understand precisely its situation and its strength. the imperial power of the republic which can call a halt to the whole world in arms. against whose impenetrable shield no knight. no king. no emperor is hardy enough to launch his spear. is not be frightened from its propriety by a few manufacturing or railroad corporations. or a few men. however rich or however powerful. i am only pointing out what they can do if we do not stop them in time. there is not the least fear that we can not or that we shall not stop them in time. mr. president. let me not for a moment be understood as denouncing. or reproaching. or harshly judging men who hold the great fortunes in this country today. they have. with few exceptions. i believe. acquired these fortunes by lawful and by honest means. they have been men who have been. in general. examples of private virtue. they have owed their success to the great american qualities of enterprise. sagacity. and industry. they are. in general. men of a large public spirit and a lofty patriotism. one of them. perhaps the most famous of all. has declared that he holds it a disgrace to any man to die rich. and is distributing his vast wealth wisely and generously to the abundant blessing of the country he has adopted and of the noble country of his origin. another. to whom i have already alluded. i am told. quietly and without ostentation. is also distributing his large benefactions for the advantage of his countrymen. i can truly say more than that. in the acquiring of these great fortunes their owners have been large public benefactors. large industries have been created which. but for them. would not have existed. the employment they have given to many workmen. skilled or unskilled. but for them never would have been given to anybody. to the great corporations they have created have been due the prosperity of great towns and cities and also the comfort and content of many an american home. . still further. i believe of the men to whom i have alluded that many of them are now themselves busy with the great problem which we have to take up. of protecting the people from the danger of great corporate wealth. we are to owe. i think. to their farsighted humanity and patriotic feeling valuable help and counsel in this direction. i see already. within a few days. that the great american steel company is considering the question of taking its workmen into its partnership everywhere and making the thousands and hundreds of thousands of their workmen joint 6wners with them. thereby accomplishing what we all hope to accomplishthe longedfor marriage between labor and capital. so that there may no longer be enmity or rivalry between the two great wealthproducing elements of the state. there are men in the senate today who themselves are reputed to have gained great fortunes in the development of great industries. to whom the american people look confidently for counsel. that we may deal wisely with this momentous question. that expectation. i think. is not to be disappointed. indeed. it has. to some extent. been fulfilled already. it will be found. i am sure. whatever individual examples there may be to the contrryand such examples will be found under all forms of governmentit will be found true that there is no class of men in the republic to whom. as a class. the welfare of the republic is not dearer than any personal or selfish desire. in settling future relations between labor and capital. or between capital and the state. or between labor and the state. the capitalist and the laborer are to be. i hope and believe. our best advisers dnd leaders. i am opposed to the government ownership of great laboremploying industries. 1 am opposed to the government ownership of coal mines or of railroads. i do not see why. if the government is to prevent a famine or scarcity of fuel by ownership. it should not own the sources of food supply. that it might prevent scarcity of food. or the woolen or cotton factories. that it might prevent a scarcity of clothing. if the government is to be the great employer. the wages of labor must be fixed by law. wages can not be fixed by law. except on a scale which shall apply equally to every workman. the energetic and the slothful and the intelligent and the dull. the man of enterprise and of inventive genius and the man whose fingers are all thumbs must stand on the same dead level. besides. if wages are to be fixed by the lawmaking power. then the question of wages becomes a question of politics. the two parties must compete with one another by outbidding each other for the votes. and paying for the votes in increased wages. no government but a despotism can control and supply the great necessaries of life. i am talking today of trusts. and of the abuse of corporate power. as it may be engaged in commerce with foreign nations or among the several states. and of vast and dangerous accumulations of wealth. you can not separate either of these things from the other. the trusts make use of corporate powers to accomplish their lawful purposes. or their unlawful purposes. so far as their purposes be unlawful. these purposes are accomplished in order that the men who manage the corporations and control the trusts may. if they be so minded. get for themselves these vast private accumulations. we are dealing with a trinity. and we can not reach one without the others. when you try todeal with the evil which threatens us. you have to protect yourself not only against those combinations which are popularly called trusts. but against the abuse of power by large aggregations of capital wielded by single hands or single corporations. your legislation must control both. there has not been. so far as i know. any correct definition of the word trust. which has of late comeinto a common although a new use. but we know very well in general what we mean by it. we mean. i suppose. a combination or aggregation of individual manufacturers. or of separate corporations. formed for the purpose of breaking down all competition by unlawful or improper means. and of monopolizing manufacture or other forms of production or trade in cases where competition is healthy and desirable for the public. when we speak of these things as unlawful. we do not necessarily mean that.they are criminal or prohibited by express statute. there are many things held by the courts to be contrary to public policy. so that contracts to do them will not be enforced. and combinations to do them will be held to be punishable as conspiracies. where the act itself could not be reached by criminal process. and sometimes. perhaps. where it can not be reached by the civil remedy of injunction. these things may be lone bya combination of corporations to do them. theymay be done by a single corporation. so they may be done by a powerful individual. the bill i have prepared does not undertake to prohibit them when done by an individual. it may be well to do that separately. but the individual power is limited by the life or wealth of one man. it can only be exercised by such power as one man can wield. itis restrained bythe personal liability. civil and criminal. to which one man must be subjected. so if we can strike down these evil practices so far as they are due to corporate strength and wealth. we have made a great advance toward curing the evil and protecting the people. i have no sympathy with any attack on wealth honorably acquired and lawfully used. i have no dislike for great corporate powers. i think. in general. it is better that they be wielded by private and individual combination than by the government. they are necessary to national greatness. we can not maintain our equality among the nations of the earth and we can not achieve the supremacy now easily within our grasp without them. we may as well be jealous of gunpowder. or dynamite. or of steam. or of electricity. or of the power of gravitation. or the current of niagara. so long as these are our servants and we are their masters we are safe and healthy and great. but it is service and not mastery that aladdin expects of the magician. let the great railroad corporation span the continent and girdle the earth in the service of the american people. but it must never forget that it is the slave of the ring and that the american people is the aladdin. let the steel company. if it will. light up every valley and mountain side of the continent with the light of its furnace fires. let the american steamboat company do the carrying for the world. but it must be content to be to the american people in the relation of slave of the lamp and not of master. what is called socialism. mr. president. will never cure or prevent the evil i have described. that. also. will be destructive of the great principle of emulation and individual excellence. it will be quite as bad. in my judgment. as the power of great corporations. the latter can be curbed. and it will in some way be broken when it becomes too dangerous. but a general reducing of mankind to a deadlevel. such as must happen when the state manages and owns the great industries and wages are fixed by vote at the elections. would. if it were possible to succeed. be destructive of everything which makes life worth living or manhood worth respecting. but there is no permanent danger. i think. from socialism. the socialist. whether he be a dreamer in some college hall or some idle and restless agitator. fails to take into account one important and essential thing in making his calculation. that is. human nature. socialism may do for china or for turkey. but it will never be a yankee remedy. i do not think the remedy of the socialist will help us. i have no belief in the government ownership of lands. or of wheat fields. or of railroads. or of factories. save as a last and desperate resort. to which i am sure the american people never need to come. if the government is to own the coal. it must by the same reasoning. when the times are hard. take possession of the manufacture of shoes. of woolen cloth. and of cotton. and on the same principle it must take possession of other manufacture and trade on which men are depending for any necessary of life. the men who ask for wages will have the same desire and the same right to an increase of their wages and to better their condition. but then the difficulty will be that in every election the question of wages and of hours and of convenient conditions will become political questions. and the men who aspire to political power will seek to win the support of the wageearner on the issue of fixing their wages. under government control no distinction could be made between skill and enterprise and intelligence and sluggishness or slackness. ambition and emulation. from which everything valuable in achievement comes. will be gone. the socialist. when he proposes his social schemes. fails. as i just said. to take into account one essential consideration. that is human nature. the socialists remedy preserves the worst evil of the abuse of which we complain. and that is the destruction of individual ambition and emulation. it is well known to students of history that the english people at a very early day were compelled to limit with great strictness the power of holding lands in mortmain and in trust or upon uses. or for the use of other than their legal owners. one great evil. of course. was a monopoly of the lands of the realm in a few hands. a monopoly which primogeniture also tended largely to foster. but the evil of holding lands in mortmain by incorporated persons was not merely the aggregation of great estates in single hands. but also that these estates were never. in the course of law. brought under public authority for settlement. as in the case of inheritance. or of the personal property of ordinary subjects. this latter evil and danger exists here today in the case of every powerful and wealthy corporation. the corporation does not die. its business is not settled and wound up whenever one partner dies or goes out of business or is unwilling. except so far- as the state may see fit. to regulate them. and there are many corporations too powerful to be regulated by the states that create them.. their transactions. although they control so largely the business of the countryeven the necessaries of lifeare conducted in secrecy and without control by state or national authority. there is no power in this country strong enough to deal with them. save the national power alone. we have many such corporations more powerful than many single states. and more powerful than many countries now existing. their powers are imperial within their own domain. and their domain is imperial also. we. and we alone. can subject them to imperial restraints. sowe must remember that we are dealing with the most important question that has come up for legislation for a long time. or is likely to come up for a long time to come. we are to deal not only with foreign commerce. but with that compared with.which our foreign commerce and the foreign commerce of the world are but a drop in the bucketthe domestic commerce of the united states. no statistics can measure it. no imagination can grasp it. no human intelligence can comprehend it. i have no doubt it is greater than any other commerce on earth. i incline to believe that it is greater than that of all the domestic commerce of the world put together. that commerce is conducted largely by these artificial beings called corporations and joint stock companies. it can not be conducted with convenience or safety in any other way. it must necessarily be conducted as all great business is conducted. by large aggregations of capital. we can not help it if we would. we would not help it if we could. the public can not get along without them. unless we would turn the united states into another siberia. i remember very well. ir. president. when the railroad that extends from albany to buffalo was owned by seven different corporations. each having its own separate mechanism. and each having no connection with the others. if there came a great snow storm one road would clear its track in a day. but those on each side of it might take a week. the passenger got his ticket for each road. and the shipper dealt with seven separate. different carriers. now the railroad is under one management and crosses the continent from one ocean to the other. and it will soon cross the continent under the same ownership. so we must. in devising our remedy. go cautiously and slowly. we must calmly bear the ills we have rather than fly to those we know not of. our engineering must be conducted like that wonder of the engineers art which some of us remember to have witnessed when the foundation of the washington monument. originally designed to support a structure 80 or 100 feet high. was removed from under it by a great engineer. and another substituted to support the structure of 555 feetinheight. and there was not a crack. or a leaning. or a sinking by a hairs breadth in the whole operation. we can do the same thing in protecting our commerce and our country from the danger i have described if we will approach our task in the spirit of statesmanship. and not in the spirit of party. and will settle these questions with our judgment and brains. and not with our angers and prejudices. we have taken already two steps wisely and carefully to protect the people against these great combinations of capital. one has been by the establishment of the interstate commerce commission. conferring on it large. though limited. powers. that has been due largely to the sagacity of my honorable friend from illinois. lately chairman of the committee on interstate commerce. i understand that he thinks it desirable to clothe that commission with further power. and especially to enable it to enforce its own decrees as far as. constitutionally. may be done without recourse to the courts. i hope the senate will follow his lead in that matter. the other step is one with which i had more to do personally. that was the statute of 1890. commonly called the sherman antitrust law. it was so called. i suppose. lucus a non lucendo. because mr. sherman had nothing to do with it whatever. it was the singular fortune of that eminent statesman that two important laws should be called by his name. the antitrust law and the sherman silver law. to one of which he certainly was very much opposed. and by the other we adopted a remedy for the existing evil totally different from that he had thought of or proposed. the law of 1890 has accomplished more. i believe. than was expected of it when it was passed. we undertook by law to clothe the courts with the power and impose on them and the department of justice the duty of preventing all combinations in restraint of trade. it was believed that the phrase in restraint of trade had a technical and wellunderstood meaning in the law. it was not thought that it included every restraint of trade. whether healthy or injurious. it was not expected that two men could not go into partnership. each of whom should be restrained by contract from conducting the business in which the partnership was engaged on his private account or from conducting it in any manner contrary to the articles of partnership. it was not expected that two rival carriers could not agree not to do business in competition with each other or that a business man or corporation could not sell out his or its good will and agree not to carry on business in a particular locality. it was not expected either that it would wholly or even largely remedy the existing evil. still less that it would be an absolute security against all threatened dangers. the committee on the judiciary of the senate when they reported it. and the two houses when they enacted it. were well aware of the gravity of the matter with which they were dealing. and that they should not do anything to cripple or break down the business of the country. they expected that there would grow up under it a body of decisions in which the court should expound it reasonably. and when these decisions were promulgated that other and additional remedies would be provided by law. we were disappointed in one particular. the court by one majority. and against the very earnest and emphatic dissent of some of its great lawyers. declined to give a technical meaning to the phrase in restraint of trade. and held in one important case that if trade were restrained by an agreement it was no matter whether it were injuriously restrained or no. we did not put into our bill the words unlawfully and improperly restrained. because we were afraid it would be objected that we were giving the court a legislative power to declare what was improper. we supposed the court would interpret the law. and that these things which had been by the established and recognized law held to be contrary to public policy. like oppressive agreements. agreements clearly wicked. though not prohibited by existing law. agreements which were to destroy the purposes for which the aggregate powers had been created. would be held to be within its prohibition. we supposed that that phrase would be construed by the court in a manner like that in which the analogous term conspiracy had been construed. a conspiracy is not held to be every agreement or combining together. but conspiracy is held to be the combining together of two or more persons to do an unlawful act by lawful means. or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. but the unlawful act and the unlawful means are everywhere held to include such acts and such means sonly as are contrary to settled public policy. whether prohibited by express law or no. so we supposed that a contract of partnerrship. though it restrained the persons from trade beyond the slimits of a partnership. would be held perfectly lawful: and that in a contract where two corporations. who were both ruining sthemselves by undertaking to do business for too large a terri)tory for their resources. agreed to divide the territory between * them. the agreement would be held to be perfectly lawful. while a conspiracy to get a monopoly of the market by tricks or devices * of subterfuge would be held unlawful. this whole distinction and the whole doctrine on which the committee j roceeded is simply and well summed up in bouviers law dictionary. certainly a high authority in all matters of local phraseology and definition. restraint of trade.-contracts operating for the restraint of trade are presumptively illegal and void on the ground of the policy of the law favoring freedom of trade. but the presumption of illegality may be rehutted by the occasion and circumstances (2 pars. contr.. 870. see 7 c. c. app.. 15). thus in agreements for the sale of the good will of a firm. or the formation or the dissolution of a partnership provisions operating in restraint of trade are frequently inserted. their vaidity depends upon whether the restraint is such only as to afford a fair protection to the interests of the party in whose favor it is imposed (leake. contr.. 63: 49 n.j. eq.. 217). whatever restraint is larger than is necessary for the protection of this arty is void. therefore the retraint must be limited in regard to space (5 m. &amp; v .. 562. l. r15 eq 59). an agreement reasonable in regard to space maybe unlimited in regard to the duration of time provided for. but whtre the question is as to whether the space is unlimited. the duration of the restraint in point of time may become an important matter (leake. contr.. 634. 2 i. &amp; g.. 20). it has been said generally that where a covenant in restraint of trade is generalthat is. without qualificationsit is bad. as being unreasonable and contrary to public policy. where it is partialthat is. subject to some qualification either as to time or spacethen the question is whether it is reasonable. and if reasonable it is good in law (1892.3 ch.. 447). there are cases where an unlimited restraint is justified. e. g.. the sale of a secret process of manufacture of an article in general demand. which it is agreed shall be communicated for the exclusive benefit of the buyer. (see l. r.. 9 eq.. 45. 131 u. s.. 88.) so of the sale of a patent right. the restraint may be unlimited while the patent continues (1 h. and n.. 189). but. mr. president. in spite of that disappointment. the measure has. in my opinion. accomplished all. and more. than its friends expected. the attorneygenerals speech at pittsburg. with which all senators are familiar. and to which i have already referred. shows a part only of what has been achieved. attorneygeneral knox well says in his late speech at pittsburg: if congress under its power to regulate interstate commerce may utterly destroy a combination and forfeit its property in interstate transit. as the sherman act provides. it seems reasonable to say that it can in the exercise of the same power deny to a combination whose life it can not reach the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce excent upon such terms as congress may prescribe to protect that commerce from restraint. such a regulation would operate directly upon commerce and only indirectly upon the instrumentalities and operations of production. i am glad that the opinion i have long entertained. as to the way to reach this evil. seems to be fortified by so high an authority. i desire to say in this connection that the attorneygeneral. while he states so clearly and correctly the limitations and defects of the existing law. has already been able to accomplish more. i think. than its framers expected with the limited and imperfect means at his command. he tells us what the government has already accomplished: it has destroyed the combination known as the addystone pipe combination. upon the ground that it was a conspiracy among independent producers of pipe to restrain its sale and distribution among the states. he has also broken up a combination of the six largest meatpacking concerns in this country. known as the beef trust. who were in combination with each other and with many great railway lines. whereby they secured large secret concessions in rates for the transportation of their products. which enabled them practically to monopolize the fresh and cured meat industry of the united states. he has brought 14 suits in equity against a combination of railroads. and got injunctions which are still in force. restraining them from making any rebate or granting any preference whatever to any shipper. he has also broken up a pooling arrangement between the southern railroads which denied the right of the persons interested in the cotton product of the souththe shippersto prescribe the route over which their goods should pass. and put an end to that illegal proceeding. he also brought a suit in equity for preventing the operation of a proposed merger of sundry transcontinental railroads as competing lines. which had been effected by a combination and accompanied by a large inflation of the stock. so he has gone far already under the existing law to break up a monopoly which affected the whole freight and passenger traffic of the northwest. another affecting the cotton traffic of the south. and another the price of beef. a prime article of food. in the course of this litigation already important decisions have been made by the courts. which throw very much light upon the whole subject. and are important guides. as well for future legislation as for future executive action. the power of congress to pass the present bill depends upon the principle i have just stated in the language i have just quoted from the attorneygenerals speech. i laid down the same proposition as well as i could in a speech made in boston early in the late campaign. the bill i have drawn is an exceedingly imperfect one. it is but one step further. i adhere to the opinion i entertained when the present law was drawnthat we should go very slowly and carefully. taking one step in legislation at a time. and then waiting for the exposition of the courts. and until some practical trial has taught the law officers of the government what is practicable and what is needful. it was with that expectation that the law. commonly called the sherman antitrust law. was fashioned. our late friend and colleague. mr. sherman. had the singular good fortune of having named for him two measures. with neither of which. as they took their final shape. he had anything to do. and to both of which he was exceedingly averse. these measures are what were known as the sherman silver law and the sherman antitrust law. the present bill. as i have said. goes but a little way. it is tentative and experimental. i think it is entirely safe. of course new views on some of its provisions. or all of them. may present themselves. it will undoubtedly require modification and improvement. but it is all i have to offer today. it depends for its constitutionality and its accomplishment upon one simple consideration. which i think enables it to. steer clear of the constitutional difficulties and perplexities which have surrounded other attempts to deal with this subject. natural persons have their constitutional rights. with which we can not interfere. if we would. there is a boundary for commerce. although not always capable of the most exact definition. between the jurisdiction of the stateand thatof the nation. the courts have held that the fact that an article is manufactured with the expectation that it will be sold from one state to another. or be transported from one state to another. or that it is sold -in a state to be sold again from one state to another does not make the manufacture or the sale a part of interstate commerce and so subject it to the jurisdiction of congress. but i suppose it is well settled that every state or country may prescribe the conditions on which the artificial beings called corporations or joint stock companies. who ordinarily carry on business without personal liability of their stockholders for their debts. may engage in business within their jurisdiction. the corporation created by one state holds property or carries on commerce in another state merely by comity. no state in general can prescribe conditions on a citizen of another state which it does not impose on its own. but it may require of that foreign corporation any reasonable condition that it may think fit. it may require it to have an agency which shall accept service in the state courts. to make returns to the state treasurer.and todeposit attachablepropertywhere it canbe reached by state process. for security. i suppose there can be no reasonable doubt that congress can impose upon a corporation created by any state such obligations as it shall think fit and reasonable as a condition for its being permitted to engage in commerce with foreign nations and among the several states at all. that is the theory upon which this proposed legislation is based. congress can refuse to permit any corporation whatever to engage in interstate or international commerce. it may reserve the power to create such corporations to itself exclusively. it can not regulate commerce unless it can regulate and control the instrumentalities of commerce. this bill. i believe. only exercises powers for such regulation as are familiar in the legislation of all wellordered statesrequiring proper returns. showing the strength and condition of the corporation. requiring the prohibition of watered stock. requiring that the stock shall be paid in in full in cash: the prohibition of oppression of citizenship or rivals. the subjection of officers and of members to personal liability absolutely. or on prescribed conditions. axe familiar examples of legislative action. no man can charge this proposed legislation with being oppressive or unreasonable. as i conceive. without setting himself against the legislative precedents in every state in the american union. if this bill shall become a law and prove effective. no corporation engaging in the commer6e which is within the jurisdiction of congress can keep its condition a secret. no such corporation can do business on fictitious capital or watered stock. no corporation can oppress any rival. whether corporate or individual. by any unlawful practices. if it do. it will be on the condition that every one of its managers become personally liable for its debts. and its torts. and will be liable also to heavy criminal liability. this bill depends for its validity on the constitutional power of congress to regulate international and interstate commerce. it exercises that power by prohibiting artificial beings. created by a power other than its own. from engaging or continuing in such commerce except on certain strict conditions. these conditions are: first. publicity in the conduct of their business and the constitution of their organization. second. the power to stop their business altogether if they violate the laws enacted by congress. third. strict penalties on them and their officers for such violations. fourth. personal liability for all debts. obligations. and wrongdoings of the directors. officers. and agents unless the laws be fully complied with. this liability is secured by requiring the personal consent to the provisions of this bill and acceptance of all its obligations by such officers. directors. and agents before they enter upon office. if this bill shall not prove effectual. it will be easy to extend its operation by imposing a like personal liability on every stockholder. that will destroy the power of selling such stocks in the market. and will deter every owner of capital from embarking his property in such undertaking. it is quite likely that this bill may be improved in its passage through congress. it is quite likely that it will be found defective. a trial in court. conducted by such counsel as represent the government and as are likely to represent great corporations in danger of punishment for great offenses. is a great sharpener of the wits. the people will get an education within the next few years. in the benefit of which we and our successors will have a large share. it is better. i think. to go carefully. one step at a time. to repair and strengthen our edifice rather than to undertake any rash measure which might bring the whole temple down upon our heads. during the delivery of mr. hoars speech.","mr. president. contemporaneously with the declaration of war against spain congress passed what has come to be known as the \"teller resolution.\" the fourth section of the resolution. which refers exclusively to cuba. is in the following words: that the united states hereby disclaims any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty. jurisdiction. or control over said island except for the pacification thereof. and asserts its determination. when that is accomplished. to leave the government and control of the island to its people. later and contemporaneously with the ratification of the treaty of peace known as the \"treaty of paris.\" by which we acquired title to the philippine islands. the senate passed what has come to be kmown as the \"mcenery resolution.\" this resolution is in the following words: that by the ratification of the treaty of peace with spain it is not intended to incorporate the inhabitants of the philippine islands into citizenship of the united states. nor is it intended to permanently annex said islands as an integral part of the territory of the united states. hut it is the intention of the united states to establish on said islands a government suitable to the wants and conditions of the inhabitants of said islands to prepare them for local selfgoverment.. and in due time to make such disposition of said islands as will best promote the interests of the citizens of the united states and the inhabitants of said islands. the teller resolution. i have no doubt. expressed the purpose of congress and the country as to cuba. there has been no change of our purpose as expressed in this resolution toward that island. and we are informed by the press of the country that in a very short time our army of occupation is to be withdrawn and the island turned over to the government of its own people. although it has been doubted. i assume that at the time of its passage by the senate the mcenery resolution in like manner expressed the purpose. not only of the senate. but of the people of this country toward the phillippines. on the 24th day of february. in this year. when the bill temporarily to provide revenue for the philippine islands. and for other purposes. was before the senate. the junior senator from missouri offered as an amendment to that bill the mcenery resolution. and upon a yeaandnay vote that amendment was defeated by a vote of 24 to 43. the division of the senate upon the amendment was upon party lines. the republicans. with the exception of the senator from maryland . voting against the amendment and the democrats voting for it. on the same day the senior senator from colorado offered as an amendment to the philippine tariff bill a certain amendment. of which i read one section: that itis not intniided by the government of the united states to permanently annex the philippine islands as an integral part of the united states. but it is the deternination of the united states to establish. with the consent and assistance of the inhabitants thereof. a government or governments suitable to their vants and condition. and that shall give to the inhabitants the control aud administration of their local affairs. such as the raising of revenue and thie disposition thereof. the maintenance of peace and order in the several eommunitie of said islands that have been or that may be organized by the people thereof. and eventually to give them their indepiendence. upon a yeaandnay vote this amendment was defeated by a vote of 20 to 44. the democrats voting for and the republicans against the amendment. the position of the republican party in the last presidential campaign upon the subject of filipino independence. the discussion of the subject by the representatives of that party on the hustings and in the press. the general course and policy of the administration since the election. and the debate which preceded these votes of the senate. all indicated a change of purpose. as that purpose was expressed in the mcenery resolution. on the part of the dominant party toward these islands. before these votes there might have been some possible grounds for doubt as to the ultimate purpose of the dominant party in regard to the philippines. now. there is no longer room for doubt. the vote of the republican party upon these amendments is capable of but one interpretation. and that is that it has become the fixed purpose of that party. as far as it can control the matter. to hold these islands for all time as a possession of this country. i have no disposition. mr. president. to discuss the motives or reasons which have led the dominant party to settle upon one line of policy toward cuba and a wholly different line of policy toward the philippines. that would. i apprehend. be unprofitable. but i do wish to say that there is. in my judgment. no justification for this differentiation. either in morals. public policy. or national obligation. nor yet in the physical or political conditions of these two countries or of their people. at the close of the war with spain both of these countries were absolutely in our power. we chose to give independence to one. to deny it to the other. upon what grounds can we defend this discrimination? it can not be excused or defended upon the ground that the filipino is less capable. or less prepared. or less ready for selfgovernment than the cuban. i have not been able to give this feature of the subject close study. but from the study i have been able to give it i am satisfied that the filipino is just as well prepared and just as ready for selfgovernment as the cuban. the native uneducated filipino is just as intelligent. just as bright. xxxv298 as the native uneducated cuban. there is an educated class in both islands. but if there is any difference between them it is very slight and not material. there is also a foreign element in both the islands. but with reference to this foreign element there is this important distinctionthat it is in closer touch and sympathy with the native filipino than it is with the native cuban. neither can this distinction in treatment be justified upon the ground that we promised independence to the people of one of these countries and did not promise it to the other. or to any difference in aspiration of these people in this regard. both of these people. when we interfered in their affairs. were similarly situated with reference to spain. both of them were in insurrection against her authority. both of them were fighting for independence. and neither of them was considering any terms of surrender. or settlement. or reconciliation short of independence. the insurrectionary armies of both of these countries joined with our forces in overthrowing the power of spain.. and in both instances with the understanding. either expressed or implied. that if success attended our joint efforts they were to have independence. i am glad we have kept faith with cuba. i am glad that in her case we have been strong enough to resist the thirst of empire and the lust of power. i had hoped that we would pursue the same course with reference to the filipinos. and after helping them to establish a stable government we would turn that goverinent over to the people of the islands and safeguard it as we have done in the capse of cuba against the encroachments of any predatory nation. there are many things involved in the filipino situation about which i have had doubts and about which i still have doubts. but there is one proposition in connection with it about which there is not now and neverhas been any doubt in mymind. that proposition is this: that considering our own interest. present as well as future. this government ought to relinquish possession of these islands and withdraw from the archipelago just as soon as it can do so consistently with honor and our national obligations to those people. this far i feel certain. .beyond this. i confess i have doubts. i know it is the settled purpose of the republican party. as now constituted. to permanently retain these islands. but i am not so sure that such is the purpose of a majority of thepeople of this country. i do not believe they have yet passed upon that question. i do not believe the result of the last election meant that. that question was discussed in the campaign which preceded that election. it is true. and it may have had something to do with the result. but the people of this country were not then in possession of sufficient information about the question to enable them to properly render a judicial and final decision upon the issue raised. we know more about the filipino situation now than we did then. but even now we know but little. and much of the information that we have is admittedly unsatisfactory and unreliable. and much of it contradictory. no question of such momentous importance. involving the welfare of 70.000.000 people here and 10.000.000 there. can be safely decided upon such meager and unreliable information as we then had. or even as we now have. with reference to these people. their character. theft capacity. their aspirations. and their disposition toward us. but if it is the fixed and settled policy of this government. or if it shall hereafter become the fixed and settled policy of this government. to permanently retain these islands. and ve are confronted with the question as to how we shall govern them. whether as dependencies or under the constitution. whatever may be the views of others. as between these two alternatives. i confess i should. if compelled to choose. make the choice with grave misgivings. we can not govern them as colonies without trampling under foot there the fundamental principles of our constitution. and we can not sanction an outrage upon these principles there without endangering them at home. we can not with safety link freedom in government with absolutism. on the other hand. we can not admit these people. many of them only half civilized and only a part of them with any just comprehension of the principles of selfgovernment. as citizens of the republic without degrading the citizenship of the nation and inviting countless dangers. i do not doubt that these people are capable of establishing. and. with our assistance. that they would establish. a government satisfactory to themselves and suitable to their condition. but i am satisfied that at present they are. with very slight exceptions. utterly incapable of understanding or applying the principles of free republican government according to american standard and ideal. more than that. i am satisfied that they are by heredity incapable of understanding or applying these principles. it has taken ages to develop from the best possible material a people entirely fit for constitutional freedom. many enlightened nations are still unequal to that condition. it is the high privilege of america to incuilcate the doctrine of mans capability for selfgovernment. but we recognize the limitations and conditions that could render it expedient to establish a republican form of government among people not prepared for it. mr. president. we have had some experience in this country in trying to train by education an inferior race. a race which has never shown any initiative in selfgovernment. in the practices and principles of our constitutional system. for thirty years the negro has been not only a member of a selfgoverning community. but a participant in that government. during that time millions of dollars have been spent to educate him and to fit him for the duties and responsibilities of american citizenship. those who are most familiar with the result know that he is today but little better prepared for an intelligent and responsible discharge of those duties than he was in the beginning. if he has made any improvement or progress in that regard it has been exceedingly slight. the duties of suffrage and of citizenship under our constitutional system seem to be a thing beyond the capacity of his understanding. the defect in his case is not to be overcome. as the experience of the last thirty years shows. by education or by training. and the reason is obvious. it is a defect of heredity. the system of laws which the taft commission has promulgated and is attempting to enforce in the christian and pacified provinces of the philippine archipelago was framed in recognition of the present incapacity of those people and. of their inherent lack of those qualities and virtues without which successful selfgovernment is not possible. governor taft and the commission frankly admit this. their hope and theory is that these defects may be overcome by training and practical education through object lessons in civil government. in my judgment there is nothing to justify this hope. either in our own experience or in history. and the result will be disappointment and failure. i do not desire to enter into an) harsh criticism of the commission or of the government that they have established there. but i do want to say. with reference to the government that they have established there. the unamerican. the unrepublican. the despotic. the arbitrary. the tyrannical system of government that they have established there. and which i assume they have established not from choice but because. from their knowledge of that country and its people. they were satisfied they could not be governed with safety except by arbitrary methods. is strong evidence. and to my mind conclusive evidence. that those are not a people to be taken into the body of our citizenship. it is somewhat of a digression from my purpose. but i want to say in this connectionbecause it seems to be the fit place in which to say itthat i have no disposition and have not had any disposition to criticise our army of occupation in the philippines. i have wanted to believe well of our army. i have wanted to believe that they were conducting the war there according to the usages and laws of civilized warfare. early in this session. when i heard these charges of cruelty. of barbarity. of devastation. and of inhumanity against our army there. i confess frankly i was not disposed to believe them. and in private conversation i rereatedly expressed the opinion that. the american people would not believe such charges against our army unless they were es-. tablished by the most indubitable proof. i even felt resentful. but. mr. president. the developments of the last few months have dispelled any doubts about this matter and constrained and coerced me to believe those charges. at first there was a disposition to deny the horrible practice known as the water cure. now nobody any longer denies that it was practiced. not sporadically and in individual instances. but systematically and by authority. there is not now any disposition to deny the charge of unnecessary burning of villages and towns. there is no denial of the charge of reconcentration of helpless women and children. probably not quite as bad as the reconeentrado of the bloody and cruel weyler. but still in a most cruel and objectionable form. but. mr. president. if there were any doubts about these charges of cruelty. and barbarity. and inhumanity on the part of our army they have all been dispelled by an order issued by one in authority. by one who. until recently. has stood high ill the army and in the estimation of the country. by one who had a right to issue orders. by one who had a right to demand obedience to his orders. and obedience to whose orders has been held a sufficient justification for murder by an american cofirtmartial. that order. mr. president. was a military order. a military command. to go into the island of samar and there murder and killfor it can not be called by any other name--every person capable of bearing arms. beginning almost at the cradle. at the age of 10. and going almost to the grave. there is no other order recorded. mr. president. in all history which parallels this order. except that of herod the king. when he directed that all the children who were in bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from 2 years and under should be slain. in order that he might compass the death of him of whom it was said he came to be king of the jews. the christ and saviour of mankind. mr. president. we have not long been in the colonial business. but we have made very rapid progress during the short time that we have been in it. i challenge senators on the other side to cite a single instance in the annals of englislh or spanish colonialism whose details are more horrible and shocking than that of this order to our army in samar. in the presence of these cruelties and barbarities. this uncivilized and unchristian warfare. one who loves his country feels that the only thing he can do is to bow his head in shame. there it but one other thing. mr. president. i feel like doing. and that is to appeal to the brave. honorable. and humane man who now occupies the white house to probe these things to the bottom. and bring the men. however high in office and position. who have perpetrated them or are responsible for their perpetration. to condign punishment. we can at least by fitting the punishment. if there be any law adequate to that. to the crime. make the offense odious. but. mr. president. i have digressed from the subject. i was discussing the government the taft commission had promulgated for the archipelago. i have examined with considerable care the civil codes promnulgated by the commission. considered as simple rules for the regulation of the conduct of the citizens. most of these laws seem to be just and fair. in fact. many of them are almost identical with the laws which obtain in this country for the government of our towns. cities. and counties. but. in order to adjust them to the prejudices. the traditions. and nature of these oriental people. there is interwoven in them. as their dominant element. the principle of spanish absolutism. the body of these codes is american. but the great animating principles of american government are omitted. mr. president. in corroboration of this statement. i think it will be profitable to enumerate some of the more striking and essential features of the american constitutional system which the commission has. from necessity. i assume. omitted from these codes. under the american system. and under every system entitled to be called republican. the right of the people to select their governors and lawmakers is fundamental. under the taft code the people of the archipelago are permitted to do neither. under certain limitations and restrictions they may pass certain town ordinances. provincial regulations. and elect certain minor officers. but in the exercise of all these functions they are subject to the supervision and control of the central power which owes its life and authority. not to the people of the island. but to the president of the united states under the laws of congress. the commission is the supreme power in the island. it appoints all the chief provincial officers. both judicial and executive. and they are subject to removal at its will. it is a fundamental principle of jurisprudence in this country that the legislative. judicial. and executive departments shall be forever kept separate and distinct. there is hardly a state in the union whose constitution does not contain this express provision. under the system which we have established in the philippines the commission is at once the legislative and the executive department of the government. it makes the laws and executes them. or appoints agents to execute them. which is the same thing. indeed. a part of the salary of the commission is paid to them for the performance of their legislative duties and a part for the performance of their executive duties. they not only make the laws and enforce the laws. but appoint the judges who are to interpret and expound them. in this country and in every government entitled to be called free it is a fundamental principle that there shall be no taxation without representation. under the system which we have established in these islands the people have no voice in levying the general tax for the support of the government or in disbursing the proceeds when collected. in every free government trial by jury is regarded as the palladium of the liberty of the citizen. indispensable to the protection of life. liberty. and property. under the system of government we have established in the philippines trial by jury is unknown. the judges both find the facts and determine the law. in every free government the right of petition to redress grievances and the freedom of the press and of individual speech is regarded as sacred. and is either safeguarded in the constitution or in customs having the force of constitutional authority. under our control in these islands it is a crime to petition and to remonstrate. two newspaper editorsboth friendly to american occupationhave recently been arrested there by order of the taft commission and incarcerated for presuming to publish. with approving comments. an article criticising the commission which had already appeared in an american journal. when the editor of freedom. one of these papers. was arraigned for trial the other day in manila a very remarkable scene occurred. in this country we demand that the judiciary shall be free and independent and shall take orders from no one. being our national obligations. neither can we give up the moro provamenable only to conscience and the law of the land. when inces without

mr. president. we do not need any more territory. we have no need for more lands. we have enough already. england may have needed more. for she is but a pentup utica. so. in a less degree. with france. germany. and the other colonizing nations of europe. but we have a domain. the most magnificent in area that the sun ever shone upon. stretching from ocean to ocean and from the lakes to the gulf. much of its forests and minerals undeveloped. especially is this true of the section from which i come. that great empire stretching southward from the potomac. with its rich and boundless ores. forests. coal measures. and oil fields scarcely touched. and much of its land yet in its virgin condition. it alone can furnish homes for hundreds of millions of people and give profitable employment to many billions of capital. in that section of our common country alone there are undeveloped resources sufficient to afford profitable investment for all of our unemployed capital for generations to come. its development has only fairly begun. the south was. until recent years. distinctively an agricultural country. and yet. after all these years. its agriculture is still in its youth. but little more than half of its agricultural lands have been cleared. by reason of its sparse population. not more than twothirds of that which has been cleared is cultivated. and because of its inefficient system of labor and lack of capital. that which is cultivated does not yield much more than a half of what it is capable of producing. and yet. even under these adverse conditions. its agricultural products during the last twenty years have enormously increased. the cotton crop of the south for the year 1880 was 5.000.000 bales. in 1890. 7.000.000 bales. in 1899. 11.275.000 bales. it is difficult to estimate the extent of the tobacco land of the south. only a part of the land adapted to the growth of tobacco is cultivted in that way. in my own state in the last fifteen years the tobacco area has been more than doubled. the same thing may be said of the truck industry and of various other agricultural products. manufacturing and mining in the south are in their infancy. they are capable of indefinite development. the record of the last twenty years is a history of marvelous growth. and yet it is only an earnest of what can be accomplished and will be accomplished in the future whenever the needed capital shall be employed in securing development. let me give a few of the figures showing what has already been done in manufacturing in this section that was formerly so exclusively agricultural. in 1880 the number of manufacturing establishments in the south wasi only give round numbers43.000. in 1800. 53.000. in 1900. 92.000. capital invested in manufacturing in the south in 1880 amounted to $251.000.000. in 1890. $630.000.000. in 1900. $1.111.000.000. value of products of southern factories in 1880. $455.000.000. in 1890. $878.000.000. in 1900. $1.419.000.000. lumber and timber products in 1880. $39.930.000. in 1890. $90.738.000. in 1900. $188.144.000. manufacture of sugar for louisiana in 1880. $l.480.000. in 1890. $12.603.000. in 1900. $47.891.000. in north carolina. my own state. the number of manufacturing establishments in 1890 were 3.667. in 1900. 7.226. an increase of 92 per cent. capital invested in manufacturing in north carolina in 1890. $32.745.000. in 1900. $76.503.000. an increase of 133 per cent. value of property employed in manufacturing in 1890. $43.375.000. in 1900. $144.919.000. an increase in ten years of 135 per cent. as wonderful as this record is. the growth of manufacturing at the south. as i said before. has been retarded by the want of capital. the increase of these twenty years is but a fraction of what will be the increase of the next twenty years if the capital which we expect will find investment there is not unfortunately diverted from us for the purposes of exploitation in distant parts of the world. certainly no other part of the world today offers more profitable investment than the south. what is true of the south is also relatively true of a large area in the western part of our country. if the money which we have spent in the philippines since the close of the spanish war had been invested in the reclamation of the arid lands of the west millions of acres of valuable land would today be open to settlers. and in the next generation would have yielded a trade more profitable than any we can hope to get from the philippines for generations to come. i assert with entire confidence. mr. president. that the same amount of money expended in the south and in certain sections of the west in the development of our resources there would create many times the trade. many times the demand for the products of our mines and factories. that the same amount of money expended in the philippines would create. mr. president. every consideration should leadus to build up our country and trade here at home before seeking doubtful and hazardous enterprises abroad. in considering the value to us of the philippines for the purpose of trade. we must also consider the cost of subduing them and governing them while we are creating this trade. we have already spent $330.000.000 in attempting to subdue these islands. and our army there is now costing us not less than $73.000.000 a year. it will be necessary for us to maintain an army there of from 20.000 to 30.000 soldiers for an indefinite period of time. in view of the statements of the military officers in the islands i think i can safely make this statement. many of the provinces are said to have been pacified. but everybody knows that they are pacified only in the sense that they have been subjugated. withdraw the army and there will be widespread insurrection throughout the islands in less than a week. if we are to control them we must keep a large army there for at least a generation to come. we can not hope to reduce the cost of our. naval and military establishments there below thirty or forty million dollars a year. counting the millions we have spent there up to this time as lost. the annual profits on our trade. even under best conditions. will not in generations equal our annual expenditures. in order to earn an annual profit equal to our expenditures in maintaining our control of the country. we must create a trade at least ten times that which those islands have ever had. even should we control the whole of it instead of only a fraction of it. when will we accomplish that? perhaps the answer can. in part. be found in spains experiences with these islands. did spain find them profitable? of what advantage have they been to her in the past. and what possible hope of advantage do they promise us in the future? considered in this connection. a distinction is to be noted between colonial dependencies. where people are enlightenedlike the colonies of great britain. in canada and australiaand foreign possessions. where the inhabitants are less intelligent and less advanced in civilization. australia exported to the united kingdom in 1899 $355.000.000 and imported from the united kingdom over $300.000.000 of goods. but the original inhabitants of australia contributed nothing to this trade. it was created by european colonists carrying into a virgin region their enterprise and intelligence. the 10.000.000 people who inhabit the philippines never brought to spain any trade commensurate with the expense of governing them. and merely by substituting our flag for that of spain we can not alter the conditions inherent in their situation and convert those people into a thriving. busy. productive community. the leopards spots do not thus change. in a speech delivered by my colleague in this chamber on february 22. in this year. in his efforts to show that the philippines have already become an important market for the products of the south. especially the products of the cotton nills of that section. and that their purchases of southern products during the past fiscal year give promise of great extension in our trade there in the near future. he said: for the first time since the american occupation of the philippines the united states in the month of may last headed the list of nations sending merchandise to the philippines. the exports into manila during the month of may were valued at .450.421. while i nave not had an opportunity to examine the report with the view of ascertaining the character of the exports which we sent to that country. i am satisfied that a majority of the items represent southern products. manifestly. the statement made in this speech to the effect that the united states exported to manila during may. 1901. products valued at $2.460.431 is a clerical mistake. for our total exports to the islands for the eleven months ending may 30. 1901. including gold and silver. were only $2.752.045. but. mr. president. we did export to manila during the month of may. 1901. products to the value of $560.432. and it is true that that was more than any other nation exported to that country during that month. great britain was the next largest exporter in that month. the amount exported by her being $451.471. but the exports of great britain to the philippines during the eleven months ending with may. 1901. more than doubled ours. our exports to the philippines for the month of may were evidently abnormal. and are accounted for by the needs at that time of our army. as one of the itemsnore than onethird of the whole amountwas $178.000 of gold coin. if my colleague had examined the abstracts of exports for the month following. he would have seen that our exports to the islands during the month of may did not sustain his argument. and that the proportions to which they attained in that month were abnormal. for our exports for the month of june only amounted to $282.610. being less than onehalf of those for the month of may. while those of great britain increased. if lie had followed up the abstract of our exports for may. he would have found that no considerable part of them came from the south. he would also have found that in that month the united states only exported to the philippines $6.107 worth of raw cotton. not as much as some farmers in north carolina annually produce. he would have found that the whole united states exported there during that month only $8.918 worth of manufactures of cotton. not enough to keep many of the small cotton factories in north carolina running a month. - he would also have found that the whole united states exported to these islands during the eleven months ending may 30. 1901. only $27.000 worth of raw cotton and $03.147 worth of the manufactures of cotton. and he would have found that a large part of our exports to these islands. both for may and the fiscal year 1901. cobsisted of liquors. beeran american. and not a philippine beverage. when the fact that during this time we had quartered in manila an army of over 50.000 american soldiers. spending something like $5.000.000 per month. is considered and that the entire amount of american cotton goods exported was less than $100.000. it really seems astonishing that anyone co uld conclude that the amount of our exports during this period furnished evidence of a gratifying growth of trade between the south or between this country and the philippines. for myself. i find in it anything except cause of satisfaction. my colleague. in another part of his speech which i have just read. comments upon the importance to our southern cotton manufacturers of the markets of china. and attributes the growth in our trade with this country to republican policies. in other parts of this speech he lays stress upon the effect of our ownership of the philippines upon this trade. my colleague. in the conclusions he draws in this behalf. deceives himself. this argument is frequently heard in the south. where it is addressed especially to the cotton manufacturers. they are told that the extension of our territory in the acquisition of the philippines has unlocked the ports of china to us and given us that ancient empire as a market for our cotton manufactures. these statements are misleading. the chinesejapanese war. though it resulted in her defeat. was in many respects a blessing to china. it was a great object lesson to her. it paved the way for the introduction of western ideas and methods and appliances. it led to the construction of railroads and factories. and these in their turn have made china something more of a foreign trader and purchaser of foreign goods. the boxer movement was in some degree a protest of the more conservative element against this innovation. the result has been a great increase in her trade with the outside world. and the united states has come in for a share of this increase. not a full share. but a share. the spanish war has had nothing to do with the development and growth in this trade. it began long before that war and its increase is the result of changed conditions in china. and neither its origin nor development has been influenced by that war. in 1895 we exported to china $3.603.840 worth of merchandise. in 1896 we exported there $6.921.933. in 1897. $11.924.433. in 1899. $14.493.440. and in 1900. $15.258.748. the ratio of increase before the spanish war was. therefore. greater than it has been since. the same is true with reference to our trade with japan. in 1895 our exports to japan were $4.634.717. in 1896. $7.689.685. in 1897. $13.255.478. in 1898. $20.385.544. in 1899. $17.264.680. in 1900. $29.087r642. the spanish war certainly does not account for our increased trade with japan. nor yetwith europe. and yet the growth of our exports to these countries is much more remarkable than its growth in china. our exports to europe in 1896 were $773.000.000 in round numbers. in 1897. $813.000.000. in 1898. $973.000.000. and in 1900. $1.040.000.000. these facts. this remarkable development of our trade with europe. show that territorial expansion is not necessary for extensive trade relations. i rejoice at any growth in the trade of our manufactured cotton goods. considering the vast quantity of our cotton productions. our exports in this branch of american industry is surprisingly small. it is to be hoped that our trade in cotton cloth will grow and expand not only in china. but elsewhere. it will grow and expand there and elsewhere with improved transportation and when our mill owners have learned to prepare their products to suit the taste and fancy of their oriental customers. but its growth can not be made to depend upon territorial expansion. the agricultural possibilities of these islands are. i have no doubt. capable of great development. the lands are generally fertile. some of their valleys are annually inundated and. as in the case of the nile. these floods leave a rich deposit. even thelands not thus enriched do not for many years after being cleared require artificial fertilization. they are adapted to the growth of tobacco. rice. sugar. and. i have reason to believe. to the growth of cotton. these are all staple crops of the south. it is true the archipelago does not now raise enough rice to supply the home demand. but before spain\" began its policy of discouraging this crop in the interest of tobacco. in which the government had up to 1882 a monopoly. the philippines exported a considerable quantity of rice. they now export considerable quantities of sugar. hon. saaluel m. robertson. of louisiana. member of the ways and means committee of the house. speaking of the sugar production of these islands. said. in a speech delivered in the house of represe.utatives december 17. 1901: in 1532. in addition to the amount of sugar consumed in the philippine islands. they eaported 53000.00 pounds. there are no statistics as to the amount of sugar consumed. but it maybe estimated that a large quantity of it was ued to supplythe demands of the people in the islands. from these figures it can casily e seen that under the most adverse circumstances surrounding the production of sugarwith crude instruments and the crudest machinerythe philippine islands produced more sugar in that year than was produced by the hawaiian~ islands in 1.800 under free trade with the united states and most improved machinery and appalances. think. then. of the won derf l possibilities of prodction there even under unfavorable circumstances. in 1200 there was exported into this country for consumption 4.018.080.530 pounds of sugar. the domestic production was .500.040.450 pounds. from cane and beet. making the total consumed in the united states in 1900 4.518.132.9i0 pounds. these figures are taken from the statistical abstract. 28d number. 1900. again. mjr. president. even uder the present unfavorable conditions the islands are exporters of tobacco. i can not say with confidence to what extent cotton would be grown in the archipelago. but i am satisfied that all the natural conditions for its successful cultre exist there. a reliable young gentleman of my state. a graduate of the university of the state. iwho spent two years in the philippines in the army. who was born and reared in one of the largest cottongrowing counties in the state. a cotton expert. and who has recently. i have been told. been appointed to a position as cotton expert in the philippmnes. in a conversation a few weeks ago expressed to me the unqualified opinion thaat the undulating and hill lands of the whole island of luzon vere especially adapted to the growth of cotton. for many years long staple cotton has been successfully grown in the island of flocos. and there are some small factories in this island. m r. foreman. in his work on the philippines. on page 861. says: the cotton tree (gossip inm tehebceass) is found growin g in an uncultivated state in many islands of thle archipelgo. long staple cotton was formerly extensively cultivated in the province of flees norte. whence many years ago large quantities of good cotton stuffs were exported. this industry still exists. the culliration of this staple was. however. discouraged by the local governors in order to urgo the planting of tobacco for the government supplies it has since become difficult to revive the cotton production. although an essay. in pamphlet form (for which a prize was awarded in madrid). was gratuitously distributed over the coteny in li88 with that object. neovertheless. cotton spinning and weaving is still carried on a reduced scale in the 0cs provinces (luzon. west coast). wild cotton is practically useless for spinning. as the staple is extremely short. but perhaps by hybridization and careful attention its cultre might become valuable to the colony. the pod is elliptical. and the cotton which bursts from it at maturity is snowwhite. it is used for stuffing pillows and mattresses. it is a common thing to see (wild) cotton trees planted along the high road to serve as telegraph pests. by the time the seed is fully ripe every lea f lies falien. and nothing hut the hussting pods remain hanging t he branches. now. mr. president. wherever the cotton tree grows indigenously it may be safely assumed longstaple cotton can be grown. have no doubt this great southern product can be grown not only in ilocos. but in many other parts of the islands. whatever crops can be grown in these islands can be grown abundantly and cheaply. the fact that these islands are not today exporting sugar. rice. and tobacco in quantities sufficiently large to affect the price of these articles in the markets of the world is due to the conditions of agriculture there. to meager clearings. to inefficient labor. to the crudity of the tools and machinery used. and to the political disturbances and disorders which have for years prevailed there. under our occupation most of these adverse conditions may disappear. again. if we retain the islands. whether we retain them as dependencies or as domestic territory. the tariff barriers. which ha te in a measure closed our marikets to these products. will be. if not removed. at least greatly relaxed. and the effect upon production will be the sam e her as it has been in the hawaiian islands. \"in less than ten years.\" says mr. roiheoto in the speech from which i have quoted. \"after the adoption of the reciprocity treaties with these islands (hawaiian) the amount of sugar imported into this country from them had increased 1.300 per cent. the government reports show that in 1875. the year before the treaty. the hawaiian islands imported to this contry only 25.000.000 pounds of sugar. valued at $1.210.000 in round numbers. in 1899 they imported to this country .545.370.587 pounds. valued at $21..898.000. if the effect of american thrift and enterprise and the relaxation of tariff restrictions shall have the same effect in stimulating the production and exportation of the staple agricultural crops of the philippines as it has ad on the growth and exportation of sugar in the hawaiian islands. will not the producers of rice. sugar. and tobacco. and perhaps cotton. in this country find in these islands a dangerous competitor? our sugar and tobacco planters are alarmed over competition of cuban sugar and tobacco. and are vigorously protesting against the proposition of a 20 per cent cut on the duty of sugar from this island. the philippines are many times larger than cuba. and can produce sugar and tobacco cheaper than cuba can produce thlm. these staple products can not only be raised in abundance in the philippines. but they will be raised more cheaply than they can be raised in america. not only because of cheaper manual labor. but cheaper beast. mr. foreman. in . his valuable work on the philippines. from which i have before quoted. tells us that the native laborer of the philippines can live in luxury upon 20 cents a day. in america farm labor costs from 50 to 75 cents a day. the farm animal of the philippines is the water buffalo. ho costs never more than $30. and generally only from $15 to $20. while the farm mule and farm horse in this country costs from $100 to $200. it is said that the islands can never be developed with philippine labor because it is lazy and thriftless. perhaps that is true. it certainly is true unless. under the stimulus of american thrift and the influence of an opportunity to labor for better wages. the filipino shall become a more effective farm hand. but that these islands will be agriculturally developed if we retain them. i have no doubt. if not developed by the employment of native labor. then with what sort of labor? certainly we can not develop them with caucasian labor. for the white man can not work under that tropical sun. if we can not develop them with native or caucasian labor. i ask again with what labor will we develop them? without hesitation i answer. chinese labor. already a considerable proportion of the best population of luzon is said to be of chinese extraction. i know it is said by some that we will exclude the chinaman from the archipelago. as we have excluded him from this country. i do not believe that. that law we have recently passed to that effect will not be permanent. i know there is a prejudice in this country against the chinaman as a laborer in our mines and on our railroads and in our factories just as there is a prejudice against the negro laborer in these industries. but i do not believe that prejudices exist against the chinaman as a farm laborer in this country any more than it does against the negro as a farm laborer. however that may be. if we keep the islands we may be absolutely certain of one thingthey will be exploited. and by whom? they will be exploited by those great syndicates and land corporations that are already organized and being organized for that purpose. and in whose interest much of the pending bill is manifestly framed. it contains about 100 pages. and at least 60 of them are devoted to devising and putting into statute law a scheme by which the land. and the timber. and the coal. and the oil. and the minerals in those islands may fall into the hands of these corporations and syndicates at a nominal price. there is one most significant provision in the bill. it is with reference to leasing the land. it says that an individual may acquire 160 acres. but a corporation may acquire as much as 5.000 acres. it is perfectly manifest that the bill was prepared and is to be passed here in the interest of these very syndicates and land grabbers that are now organizing and that stand like hungry wolves upon the border ready to enter and to take these lands and to exploit them. we asked the committee to tell us what they ultimately proposed with regard to these islands and these people. they decline to answer. but. mr. president. we are going forward as rapidly as we can to seize and appropriate everything upon the islands that is valuable. it reminds me of the case of a man who has acquired title to a tract of land that may be technically good. like our title to the lands of those islands. but that has no foundation in morals or in justice. when he is asked to surrender his legal title because of its lack of morality he says. \"wait. after a while i will give you an answer.\" and he proceeds to cut the timber. and to mine the ore and the coal and the oil. and when lie has stripped it of timber and ore and oil and everything that is valuable says. i am ready now to surrender you back your title.\" mr. president. i can not contemplate without some feeling of alarm the prospect of building up in the archipelago this powerful competition. based upon chinese labor or cheap native labor. to the great staple products of the south. if we retain these islands and develop them. our manufacturers may. in the course of time. find there a market for some of their products. but they will not realize their full expectation even in this regard. for when the american goes there he will carry his machinery with himhis refinery. his looms. and his spindles. he will find much. if not all. of his raw material there. with the possible exception of cotton. and even that may be raised on the ground. but if not. lie can get it from nearby india. and with cheap and imitative native or chinese labor. pelnuanently establish his hold on the oriental markets we expect to gain. and even invade others we now have. it will be remembered that japan. whose industries are the wonderful creation of a single generation. is now competing with america in the sale of cotton goods. japan exported to china and other asiatic countries in 1899 $1.6.551.250 of cotton manufactures. while america exported only $10.600.000 to these countries in that year. but. mr. president. if no factories are established there. if a^ new japan shall not arise there to interfere with our trade ill cotton goods. if the archipelago shall continue a purely agricultural country and is developed to the fullost and becomes a valuable market for the sale of our manufactures. it will be dearly purchased trade if the farmers of this country find the markets they already have abridged for the sale of their surplus products or find those markets less profitable by reason of increased supply resulting from filipino overproduction. mr. president. we hear much these days about the increase in our foreign trade and the new markets we have found abroad for our products. especially for our manufactures. for there has been but little increase in our agricultural exports. it is true the growth in recent years of our foreign trade in manufactures has been so phenomenal as to have attracted the attention of the world. but to what are we indebted for these new markets? through what agency have they been secured? i answer. we got them because we had to have them. because we needed them and sought them with the intelligence and zeal which the american trader always displays under the spur of necessity. for a long time our industrial expansion had been rapid. but there was a ready market at home for all that our mills and factories could make. no other market was sought. not only because there was a ready customer at hand. but because. by the exclusion of outside competition. he was a more profitable customer than could be found anywhere else. new factories continued to spring up and multiply. until -in the course of time home production grew more rapidly than home consumption and finally greatly exceeded it. in these circumstances. our manufacturers were suddenly confronted with the always troublesome problem of a surplus. the question was what should they do with the surplus. what could they do about it. there were two alternatives. they had either to find outside markets or stop building new factories and curtail the production of those already built. in this exigency the decision was what might have been expected of american pluck. energy. and resource. it was in favor of trade expansion. in pursuance of that decision. other markets were sought. the means necessary to secure them were employed and they were found. as they might have been and would have been found years before if they had been sought with the same degree of intelligence and determination. that our manufacturers have found themselves in a position to successfully compete in the markets of the world with the manufacturers of other nations is a subject for patriotic rejoicing. i do not myself altogether sympathize with the criticism now current against some of our manufacturers who are selling their products in foreign markets at from 25 to 35 per cent less than they are selling them to our home people. although i condemn their extortion against their home patrons. and i condemn the methods and devices to which they resort for the purposes of stifling home competition-","that is a rule of our committee. adopted as one means of protection to the committee. but when senators and members of the house of representatives come to us as they do with the most urgent importunities. i will say to the senator that we have been compelled in some instances to violate that rule. and we will undoubtedly violate it in the future. i will not. however. dwell on that point. what i want to emphasize. mr. president. is that. in my judgment. the 3.000 and more bills that will come to the committee on pensions of the senate in the present congress will be doubled in the next congress and probably trebled in the congress that will succeed the next unless something is done to check the evil. there is a movement on foot all over the country to flood congress with requests for pension legislation. and the soldiers are being led to believe that it is not only a proper thing to do. but that it is the easy way for them to get their pensions allowed and increased. my purpose in offering this resolution is to meet officially with the chairmen of the two committees on pensions of the house of representatives for the purpose of conferring and seeing if we can not reach some conclusions on the matter of legislation or otherwise. which wvill enable us to protect ourselves and to protect congress from this flood of bills that is pouring in upon us. . have no personal complaint to make. mr. president. - i am willing. for the present at least. to continue to serve in the capacity i am serving. and to perform labor that ought not to be imposed upon any senator. but. looking to the future. i feel that it is my duty to call the attention of the senate to existing facts. and to ask that i may be permitted the privilege of making an investigation. that will not cost much money. for the purpose of trying to find a remedy for what i think is a very great and growing evil.","mr. speaker. this measure. familiarly known as \"the grout bill.\" is one of the most important that can go upon the statute books. it seeks to make oleomargarine and other imitation dairy products subject to the laws of the state or territory into which they are transported and to impose a tax of 10 cents a pound on oleomargarine when colored to resemble butter. it is not new in the field of legislation. nor are the questions involved either novel or of uncertain legality. thirtytwo states. possessing fourfifths of the population of the united states. absolutely forbid the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine when colored to resemble butter. and the highest courts in those states. including the supreme court of the united states. have upheld the constitutionality and validity of these laws. this proposed legislation. therefore. is in line with the policy and the expressed wish of a large majority of the people of our country. the opponents of this bill assume at the outset of the discussion that oleomargarine is as wholesome and healthful a food product as butter. in its report the minority of the committee labors hard to prove this assumption. opinions of \"leading scientists\" are given atlength. backed by \"ph. d.s\"and \" ill. d.s.\" and supported by chemists certificates and the dicta of courts. but plain everyday facts show that oleomargarine is neither as wholesome nor as healthful as butter. the oleomargarine tested by the friends of this measure is taken from the stock offered for sale in the grocery storesnot from the supply made purposely for the laboratories. in july. 1899. samples of oleomargarine taken from stores in new york and brooklyn were found to contain 10 per cent of paraffin. in other words. a 60pound tub of oleomargarine would contain 6 pounds of paraffin. \"a substance.\" says the president of the national dairy union. i\"which the strongest acids are unable to affect.\" one of the uses of paraffin is to protect bronze and marble statues from the weather. as a food product it is absolutely indigestible. among the articles named in the patents granted for the manufacture of substitute butter are borax. cottonseed oil. bicarbonate of soda. alum. glycerin. sulphuric acid. tallow. corn starch. caustic potash. castor oil. chalk. slipperyelm bark. olive oil. turnipseed oil. chlorate of potash. oil of peanuts. nitrate of soda. stomach of pigs. nitric acid. mustardseed oil. sugar. caustic soda. and bicarbonate of potash. it is possible that socalled \"neutral grease.\" when subjected to these acids and alkalies. may be wholesome butter. but. \"leading scientists\" to the contrary. 32 states. having over 60.000.000 people. have prohibited such deodorized grease from being colored in imitation of butter and sold in the market. it is no secret that butter fat. found in the milk of all mammals. is the natural food of infant offspring. having the most delicate of all digestion. and that milk and its butter product are among the most healthful and important articles of food. the young. the sick. the oldeverybody can use them with the least possible harm. butter melts at 92 degrees. and the normal heat of the human stomach is 98 degrees. naturally this fat. taken in its raw state into the stomach. will digest easily and imperceptibly. nature so intended. on the other hand. oleomargarine melts at a temperature varying. from 1020 to 106. \"a temperature.\" says exgovernor hoard. of wisconsin. \"which no healthful stomach ever attains. as a consequence. this unnatural foreign fat must be expelled by sheer gastric action and force.\" when stearin. of which candles are made. or paraffin. whose use has already been indicated. is added. in order to make the cottonseed oil stand up like butter. the digestible character of the mixture may well be doubted. possibly strong men whose work keeps them out of doors ten or twelve hours a day may be able to dispose of it without injury. but men of sedentary habits and people with delicate stomachs can not use it with impunity. but. mr. speaker. oleomargarine is used in public institutions. say the opponents of this bill. that is undoubtedly true. mr. edmund hill. of the somerset county council. england. is authority for the statement that it is eaten by the inmates of the wells county asylum. with which he is connected. in the asylums of the neighboring countiesdorset and hantsbutter is furnished. and the death rate at wells is 30 per cent higher. at the taunton hospital. when butter was used. 11 deaths occurred in thirteen months. when oleomargarine was substituted. 22 deaths occurred in nine months. the same authority states that the use of oleomargarine is forbidden in the hospitals of france. the president of the national dairy union declares that in institutions for the blind and for girls in the united states the use of oleomargarine has very perceptibly lowered the vitality of the inmates. many other wellauthenticated reports showthat oleomargarine is clearly not as healthful as butter. but whether healthful or not. if people prefer to use oleomargarine in its uncolored state as a substitute for butter because of its cheapness or for other reasons they have and ought to have the right to do so. and dealers should have the privilege of selling it to them. nor does this bill withdraw or curtail that right. it seeks only to impose upon it a tax of 10 cents per pound when colored in imitation of butter. no one has a moral right nor a legal right. under existing laws in 32 states. to color it or sell it as butter. the fact that it is a recognized food product can make no difference. flour is a staple article of food. but it is a deception to sell it in pulverized sugar. peas. as a food product. are healthful and desirable. but it is a swindle to sell them for coffee. so oleomargarine may be clean and palatable. but to give it the color of butter and sell it as butter is a deceptionprobably the greatest deception practiced in the sale of food products. mr. speaker. it is stated. apparently on good authority. that 83.000.000 pounds of oleomargarine were manufactured last year and sold to the people of the country for about $20.000.000. with a profit to the manufacturers and dealers of $10.000.000 to $12.000.000. there is no wrong in this if it is uncolored and sold as oleomargarine. but when colored in imitation of butter and sold as butter the transaction takes the form of a swindle. the fact that inferior qualities of butter are colored and sold as a superior quality does net make it right to color and sell oleomargarine as butter. a reprehensible practice in the sale of butter is no excuse for the perpetration of a fraud in the sale of oleomargarine. nor does it extenuate or lessen the fraud because oleomargarine may be a clean food product and capable of use as a substitute for butter. such suggestions are unworthy the gentlemen making them. mr. speaker. admitting all that is claimed for oleomargarine as a food product. the fact remains. as appears from the reports. that its ready sale is dependent almost entirely upon its imitation of butter. the author of this bill is authority for the statement that not one pound in a million of colored oleomargarine is bought aud eaten by the consumer for what t is. the dealer may know its true character. and hotel and restaurant keepers and other customers may have purchased it with the same information. but those. as a rule. who eat it do so believing it to be butter. it is put up like butter. served like butter. and colored like butter. while its taste. unfamiliar to the consumer because butter is never present for comparison. may not disclose its character. the methods of its sale prove that it is never intended to be known by its right name. fourfifths of the colored article. says the majority report of the committee. is sold illegally. as indicated by the reports of the treasury department. wrappers and stamps are removed. not only to deceive revenue officers and secure its salesmen from arrest and prosecution. but to prevent consumers and small purchasers from obtaining knowledge of its true character. the assistant commissioner of agriculture in the state of new york reports that it is put up in 2. 8. and 5 pound packages and delivered by wagons to boarding houses. restaurants. hotels. and other customers whose names and addresses are designated by registered numbers. so that if venders are detected and arrested for violating law. their customers may not be involved with them. a prominent firm in newark. n. j.. declared. under date of june 4. 1000. that the whole business of marketing oleomargarine is deceit and deception. the dairy commissioners in the state of connecticut report finding 3.600 pounds hidden in the cellar of an undertakers warehouse. concealed behind coffins and within caskets. the great profits arising from its sale make men willing to take such chances. oleomargarine sold as butter returns an average profit of about 15 cents per pound. armour &amp;. co. report that its cost. including a 2cent tax. does not exceed 7 cents per pound. when sold as butter. it brings from 18 to 80 cents per pound. such profits not only become an irresistible temptation to sell the product. despite state and united states laws. but they too often create a fund whose influence prevents the rigid enforcement of law. the opponents of this measure. in the minority report. complain that as nothing in the bill decreases the temptation or increases the difficulty of such violations. the increased taxation must either be fraudulently evaded or force the honest manufacturers out of business. a bill need not safeguard the collection of an increased tax on oleomargarine any more than an increased tax on whisky. penalties for vi6lation of law and methods for detecting fraud are already sufficient. but why should an honest manufacturer of oleomargarine be forced out of business by this bill? an honest manufacturer will not now seek to color his product in imitation of butter. because that is prohibited by law in 32 states. while this measure reduces the tax on the honest product from 2 cents to onefourth of a cent per pound. nor will this measure crush out the manufacture of oleomargarine and eliminate it as a food product unless it be true that the people now purchasing it in the belief that it is butter will refuse to buy it when it appears as \"white grease.\" without the color or semblance of butter. the minority of the committee in its report claim that \"oleomargarine is now practically all bought by the poorer classes of our people.\" whether these consumers will continue to eat it after their eyes are opened to its character is a problem for the future. if they refuse. the manufacturers of oleomargarine will be crippled. if not crushed. if they continue to buy it. its manufacture and sale will at least be transferred into honest methods. it is idle to compare the sales of butter with those of oleomargarine. and argue that since the latter do not curtail the former. the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine should not be disturbed. suppose 2.000.000.000 pounds of butter are made and sold annually and okly 83.000.000 pounds of oleomargarine. what has that to do with the .question? this measure is not predicated upon commercialism. no one objects to the manufacture and sale of uncolored oleomargarine. and all are indifferent as to whether the price of butter is or can be controlled by the price of uncolored oleomargarine. the principle involved in this measure is one of common. everyday honesty. it is only when the manufacturers and venders of oleomargarine seek to dispose of it for what it is not. that the people are aroused. and the law invoked. the public can not be deceived. they know what influences its sale. only when colored in imitation of butter and sold as butter is it purchased or eaten. in other words. only when fraud is perpetrated can it be profitably put upon the market. if this were not true. the manufacturers and venders of oleomargarine would notbe now so bitterly assailing this bill. it is to prevent deception. therefore. that this measure is presented. and the farmer who eats butter churned from the milk given by his own cows is not any more interested in its passage than the millions of people who are compelled to purchase butter. and who desire protection from the deception of oleomargarine vendors."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>year<\/th>\n      <th>environment<\/th>\n      <th>labor<\/th>\n
