I yield myself the balance of my time. Madam Speaker. I thank Congresswoman McBath and Congressman Armstrong for this bill. I thank my colleague. Congressman Raskin. for bringing up how we should be reducing the rate of recidivism in this country with different policies and that we can work together. He mentioned the First Step Act. also. I was glad that he mentioned it. It was a bill that inspired me a couple of years ago. When I was a State lawmaker. Donald Trump signed the First Step Act into law in December 2018. This was a bipartisan bill. It was done in such a significant way. but when I learned about President Trump signing the First Step Act into law in December 2018. I was sifting through the bill. and this is where I got my start in criminal justice reform. There was a provision in there that would ban the shackling of women during birth. This was actually a thing that was going on in our prison system. I saw this because I am a woman and very passionate. like my colleague across the aisle. about womens issues. I looked at the State of South Carolina and learned that we didnt have this codified into law. that women in our State penitentiary system. our State system. could still be. and in some cases were. shackled while they were actually giving birth. That inspired me to do a bill that was signed into law by my Governor. Henry McMaster. in May 2020. It banned the shackling of women in our system in South Carolina and allowed these infants. these babies. to have skin-to-skin contact with their mothers after they were born. It allowed women to have their children visit them once a week in prison. It allowed them to have feminine hygiene products accessible to them. I really applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working together because we know that when we give people opportunities after prison--jobs. therapy. intense therapy. job training. and careers afterward--they dont want to go back to prison. They dont want to go back to jail. This body. this Chamber. has a long history of working together to reduce the rate of recidivism. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill to increase transparency in the Federal prison system and provide much-needed recourse for incarcerated persons experiencing abuse. Nobody wants that to happen. Madam Speaker. I encourage colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this very necessary legislation. and I yield back the balance of my time."},{"1":"1.182023e+13","2":"2023","3":"H","4":"Mr. VARGAS","5":"173","6":"Yes","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. many times. things around here get topsy- turvy. We have a group here involved in an anticapitalist crusade against free-market principles. attempting to prevent financial institutions from allocating capital in accordance with investors preferences and risk management priorities. Under their proposed resolution. investment advisers can no longer consider environmental. social. and governance factors that materially impact a companys performance and bottom line. That means that your hard-earned dollars cannot be adequately invested because you. the American worker. are now exposed to greater risk. It is interesting it doesnt say that you must invest in ESG. All that the Biden administration says is that you can if you want to. Whatever happened to capitalistic ideals that you should be able to invest in what you want? You are trying to force people to say: No. you cannot invest looking at a strategy of ESG. That doesnt make any sense at all. It doesnt make any sense at all. It is anticapitalistic. It is antimarket. We should not support this resolution."},{"1":"1.172022e+13","2":"2022","3":"H","4":"Mr. CHABOT","5":"491","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. this week is National Police Week. a week we set aside to honor the brave men and women who tirelessly work to protect us and keep our communities safe. Unfortunately. their jobs are becoming more and more difficult. more and more stressful. and as a result. they need our support now more than ever. Over the last 2 years. violent crime in this Nation has soared. Nationally. we saw a 30 percent increase in murders from 2019 to 2020. which is the largest increase during a single year in our Nations history. That troubling trend continues in 2021 with FBI data indicating that homicides rose another 5 percent in the Nations 22 largest cities over the already inflated levels of 2020. Overall. in those 22 cities. homicides are up 44 percent since 2019. Think of that--44 percent. Not surprisingly. these disturbing increases have accompanied calls in many cities. including in my hometown of Cincinnati. to defund the police. Quite frankly. Mr. Speaker. that is the last thing that we should be doing during a violent crime surge. That is why the legislation that we are considering today is a welcome bipartisan step in the right direction. Law enforcement officers. firefighters. emergency medical personnel. and corrections officers are frequently called to respond to dangerous and often traumatic situations. As a result. these officers are at a greater risk of developing stress and trauma-related disorders. Studies show that public safety officers are 25 times more likely to develop PTSD compared to the general public. Tragically. more public safety officers die by suicide every year than those who lose their lives in the line of duty. Yet. trauma-related disorders are not covered by the primary Federal disability benefits program for police officers. and that is the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program. or PSOB. which is run by the Department of Justice. The PSOB program currently provides death and education benefits to the family members of public safety officers who die in the line of duty and also offers disability benefits to public safety officers who become totally and permanently disabled. However. the PSOB program does not currently offer death benefits to public safety officers who tragically take their lives as a result of PTSD. acute stress disorder. or other stress and trauma-related disorders. This bill. H.R. 6943. the Public Safety Officer Support Act. addresses this oversight. This bipartisan legislation recognizes just how stressful and difficult being a police officer is nowadays. It makes sure that those officers who have experienced traumatic events on the job. and are struggling as a result. receive the support they need and deserve. The men and women in law enforcement need to know that they have our full support and that they will not be punished or stigmatized for human emotions. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this commonsense. compassionate proposal. and I reserve the balance of my time."},{"1":"1.172021e+13","2":"2021","3":"H","4":"Mr. PANETTA","5":"353","6":"Yes","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. today. I rise in support of H.R. 1868 to prevent these harmful budget cuts to vital agricultural programs that are relied on by farmers. farmworkers. and food-insecure families in all of our districts. If we dont pass this bill today. $29 billion in agricultural funding would be subject to these sequester cuts. Those types of cuts would zero out funding for such crucial agricultural programs like EQIP. the Conservation Stewardship Program. and the Regional Conservation Partnership Program. In my district on the mid-central coast of California. many farmers. ranchers. and forest landowners rely on those types of helpful programs not just to survive. Mr. Speaker. but to succeed. They use those programs to harvest their products and to be part of the climate solution. The producers in my district understand and appreciate the old adage called usufruct. which basically says the land they use now must be kept fresh and fertile. not just for them. but for future generations. It is these programs that contribute to their current product and. yes. that type of forward thinking. Sequester cuts would also prevent the Federal Government from purchasing and donating food to food banks through section 32 purchases. After the year we had. in which food banks contributed so much to the food security of so many of my constituents. we should be doing everything we can to protect and bolster our food programs. We should also be doing everything we can to protect the production of food. but sequestration cuts would compromise many parts of the farm bill. like the specialty crop block grants or the agricultural research extension programs at public universities. As the co-chair of the Congressional Agriculture Research Caucus. I know that these types of ag research programs help our farmers meet the challenges of 2021 and will allow them to prepare for challenges of the 21st century. Mr. Speaker. as the Representative from the salad bowl of the world. it is my job to ensure that my farmers. farmworkers. and food-insecure families have all the tools that they need to live and lead healthy and productive lives."},{"1":"1.162020e+13","2":"2020","3":"H","4":"Mr. FITZPATRICK","5":"529","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Chair. I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 535--The PFAS Action Act. This bill is a big step towards cleaner water for all Americans. It designates PFOA and PFOS as hazardous. these are two of the most prevalent substances that make up the group of substances known as PFAS. These forever chemicals are known to pose serious health concerns that have affected many of my constituents throughout Bucks County along with Americans across our country. 99 percent of people have traces of PFAS in their blood. One of my top PFAS priorities has been getting a federal Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for PFAS chemicals in our water. Most states do not have an MCL and ones that do. are not uniform. State residence should not be the defining factor for an American to have safe drinking water. having one universal MCL for PFOA and PFOS in the U.S. helps to solve this problem. Currently there is no limit on how much PFAS pollution is in our water and air. This bill gives EPA the power to begin regulating this lethal pollution. It will jumpstart the cleanup effort and hold PFAS polluters accountable. It will require polluting companies to submit information to EPA. so that the Agency can more fully evaluate the environmental and health effects of these toxins. Hundreds of PFAS chemicals are used in commercial goods and The PFAS Action Act will put in place a labeling system so that PFAS-free products can be easily identified by consumers. I have seen firsthand the devastating health effects that PFAS substances cause in my community. The Department of Defense (DOD) used PFAS chemicals in its firefighting foam for decades at the Willow Grove base that contaminated the water and soil in Warminster. PA. Last month I supported a new Defense bill that became law which ends the practice of using that specific kind of firefighting foam by 2024. This bill goes further and will make people safer and less likely to consume these toxins. Every American deserves access to clean drinking water and clean air. Most of us think only clean water comes out of our faucets when we turn them on. unfortunately. this is a misconception. Until this bill is signed into law and is fully implemented. we cannot trust that our water is not contaminated with these toxic substances. I urge my Republican colleagues to vote yes on this bill. A vote for this bill means that you care about safe drinking water for your constituents. EPA has promised to address PFAS. and this bill will ensure that they make substantial progress by setting firm deadlines. I would like to thank Congresswoman Dingell. Congressman Upton along with Congressman Kildee. who co-chairs the Bipartisan PFAS Taskforce with me. for their work in leading this important bill. I also want to thank Joanne Stanton and Hope Grosse of the Buxmont Coalition for Clean Water along with many of the townships and municipalities throughout my district. they have fought for years for meaningful action to be taken on this issue. and while this bill is by no measure the finish line. it is a major milestone."},{"1":"1.162019e+13","2":"2019","3":"S","4":"Mr. GRASSLEY","5":"842","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"The short answer to your question is yes. but I would like to give a longer answer. if I could. and give you my perspective of TANF. TANF is an acronym for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program. which was created almost 23 years ago to provide help to low- income families with children in order to promote work and to strengthen families. The creation of TANF sent a very clear message: People receiving help from the taxpayers should be expected to work. to prepare for work. or to take steps to become more self-reliant in exchange for having the taxpayers help you through difficult times in your life. TANF also sent another message. this one to our 50 States: In exchange for this funding. States must help people find work. prepare for jobs. or do other things that will help families get back on their feet. Besides Senator Daines mentioning Montana. I presume that of the 49 States. many are not meeting the requirements of TANF. Obviously. it does not make much sense for us to have standards if we dont enforce those standards. There have been many proposals in recent years to improve the program. but. unfortunately. none have become law. That is why I am grateful to be here with Senator Daines. who effectively represents Montana. I know Senator Daines has been working on fixing problems with TANF and getting more people from welfare to work. Other than these statements he is making here. this year. as evidence of his work. Senator Daines introduced a bill with Ranking Member Brady. of Texas. of the House Ways and Means Committee. that seeks to help more people find jobs and escape poverty. Senator Daines and I have agreed to work together. along with our other colleagues on the Finance Committee. to find ways to get something done on TANF as it has been too many years since any changes have been made to the program. I am grateful for his commitment to work with me to update this program. and I do look forward to working with the Senator and the other members of the Finance Committee to see what we can agree to. for reforms are needed more now than ever. To my colleagues and people in the Senate who feel this way or to people outside the Senate who feel this way with regard to any talk of reforming TANF as being needlessly harmful to the people whom Senator Daines and I want to help. I say what is really harmful to people is. if there are incentives to stay on government programs. because being on government programs guarantees a life of living in poverty. What our goal should be for everything is to help people get out of poverty. and the way to get out of poverty is to be in the world of work if you have the capacity to work. Maybe some people who have certain physical conditions arent able to work. and we have to help those people. Yet. for people who have the capability of improving themselves. they ought to be incentivized to improve themselves. Not only that. but it would work well for the needs of our labor markets requirements right now. and the Senator gave the statistics that there are more job openings than there are people for those jobs. In the final analysis. if we want to get people in the workplace. we ought to have programs that incentivize people to go to work. and our reforming of TANF takes care of some of that. We also have to get rid of this cliff we have. that being. when people make $1 more than what they get from the government programs. they lose everything. I can give you an example. When I went to a factory in Northwest Iowa. I asked: Have you ever thought about encouraging people who are on welfare to come to work? He said: We have one. He works until he makes about $800. He quits for the rest of the month and then comes back at the beginning of the month because he knows he is going to lose all of those benefits. It seems to me we ought to do away with that cliff and that we ought to encourage people to get jobs. If they make more money. they shouldnt lose everything all at once. Then. as they work their way up the ladder and improve themselves. maybe they will be off of the programs entirely. In being a humanitarian. that is the way I see it. You are not a humanitarian if you give a person a life in poverty. which is what life is if you are just on government programs. In most cases. you have to be in poverty to qualify for the programs. Yet a few working people qualify for some. In helping to be humane to people. we provide a process for them to be in the world of work and improve themselves. So I look forward to working with the Senator."},{"1":"1.152018e+13","2":"2018","3":"H","4":"Mr. HIGGINS","5":"167","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. there are 54.000 structurally deficient bridges in America. Every second of every day. seven cars drive on a bridge that is structurally deficient. Earlier this month. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli issued a report finding that our broken sewer systems are dumping billions of gallons of sewage into our lakes and rivers. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the Nation a D rating when it comes to infrastructure and estimates that it will cost $2 trillion just to bring our infrastructure to a state of good repair. Mr. Speaker. a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan over 5 years would create 34.5 million jobs. and infrastructure pays for itself with $1.60 of new economic growth for every dollar invested: this. according to the Congressional Budget Office. That is 6.9 million jobs each of the next 5 years and 575.000 jobs each month for the next 60 months. Mr. Speaker. it is time that we get out of Iraq and Afghanistan and invest in nation building in America. with American workers and for the American people."},{"1":"1.152017e+13","2":"2017","3":"S","4":"Mr. THUNE","5":"99","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. today I recognize the hard work of my Commerce.

Congress passed a law on an overwhelming bipartisan basis to provide a standard way of doing business for motor carriers nationwide. This preemption provision resulted in increased efficiencies that led to lower transportation costs and improved services. which have benefitted shippers and consumers throughout the country. For two decades. this intent of Congress was adhered to for those involved in interstate commerce. and even upheld by the Supreme Court. Unfortunately. a recent Ninth Circuit Court decision has brought confusion to what had been the clear intent of Congress. and in my home State of Kansas. numerous trucking companies and drivers have become victims of these unintended consequences. As the Senate begins consideration of the Transportation. Housing and Urban Development. THUD. Appropriations bill. the issue of trucking preemption laws may be debated once again. Due to escalating rhetoric and increasingly pointed statements regarding this issue. I sought the objective. authoritative policy expertise of the Congressional Research Service. CRS. to answer one-by-one many of the claims being made. As the debate on THUD appropriations moves forward. I would encourage any of my colleagues interested in the trucking preemption debate to consult this CRS analysis and judge for themselves the merits of this important issue. I think they will find many of the claims made in opposition are exaggerations. if not outright falsehoods. and that the original intent of Congress on this matter was and continues to be critical for preventing unnecessary burdens on an industry that hauls our Nations freight and is vital to our economic well-being. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the CRS memo provided to me with its thoughtful and informative answers. Thank you. There being no objection. the material was ordered to be printed in the Record. as follows: Congressional Research Service. April 6. 2016. MEMORANDUM To: Hon. Jerry Moran. From: Rodney Perry. Subject: Implications of Section 611 of the Proposed Aviation Innovation. Reform. and Reauthorization Act of 2016. This memorandum provides responses to your questions concerning California law and the implications of Section 611 of the proposed Aviation Innovation. Reform. and Reauthorization Act of 2016 (Section 611). Section 611 contains two primary provisions. The first provision would expressly preempt state laws that prohibit employees whose hours of service are subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation (DOT) under 49 U.S.C. Sec. 31502 from working to the full extent permitted or at such times as permitted under [49 U.S.C. Sec. 31502]. It would also preempt any state laws that impos[e] any additional obligations on motor carriers if such employees work to the full extent or at such times as permitted by DOT regulations issued pursuant to 49 U.S.C. Sec. 31502. which permits DOT to prescribe requirements for the qualifications and maximum hours of service of motor carrier employees. The second provision of Section 611 would expressly preempt any state laws that require payment of separate or additional compensation by a motor carrier that compensates employees on a piece-rate basis. so long as the total sums paid to an employee. when divided by the employees total number of hours worked during the corresponding work period. equals or exceeds the applicable minimum wage for that state. You specifically asked for responses to the following questions: 1. Although the meal period must be paid if the employee is on-duty or required to remain on the premises. doesnt California law permit an on-duty meal period only if there is a written agreement between the parties that can be revoked at any time? Absent such agreement. isnt the default obligation to provide an off-duty meal period? Does the employer have to pay for an off-duty meal period? Under California law. unless an employee is relieved of all duty during a meal period. the meal period is considered an on duty meal period that counts toward hours worked. and is thus compensable. On duty meal periods are only permitted when: (1) the nature of the work prevents an employee from being relieved of all duty. and (2) there is a written agreement between the employer and employee for on duty meal periods. Such a written agreement must state that the employee can. in writing. revoke the agreement at any time. Absent such an agreement. any meal periods provided as required by law are off duty. Off duty meal periods do not count toward time worked (i.e.. they are unpaid). 2. Does anything in Sec. 611 mandate that motor carriers utilize piece-rate pay systems? Under Section 611. if a motor carrier compensates an employee on a piece-rate basis. it is not required to provide any additional compensation so long as the sum of the piece- rate compensation. when divided by the total number of hours worked during the corresponding pay period. equals or exceeds the applicable minimum wage. This does not appear to require motor carriers to pay their employees on piece-rate bases. Rather. it seemingly prevents an employer that chooses to pay its employees on a piece-rate basis from having to provide additional compensation in specified circumstances. 3. Is an employer. paying an employee on a piece-rate basis. in compliance with federal minimum wage laws if the sum paid to the employee. when divided by the total number of hours worked. meets or exceeds the applicable minimum hourly wage rate? This appears to be correct. Courts have generally held that an employer meets federal minimum wage requirements if the total weekly wage paid is equal to or greater than the number of hours worked in the week multiplied by the statutory minimum rate. 4. Would a motor carrier employee loading a truck have to be compensated for that time as hours worked under federal law? Does anything in Sec. 611 alter the conclusion? Pursuant to the federal minimum wage requirements. covered employers must pay employees the applicable minimum wage for all compensable hours worked. The Supreme Court has held that activities that are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities for which covered workmen are employed are compensable. At least one federal appellate court has found that loading a truck is an integral and indispensable part of the principal activity for which a truck driver is employed (driving a truck). and thus is compensable. Section 611. by its terms. specifies circumstances wherein state laws. regulations. or other provision[s] having the force and effect of law are preempted by federal law. As such. it does not appear that section 611 would alter the determination of whether time spent loading a truck is compensable under federal law. 5. Under California law. would a motor carrier have to pay a driver for the mandated 10-minute rest break? If a driver were to take a rest break or any other type of break of 10 minutes. would a motor carrier have to pay the driver for that time under federal law? If Sec. 611 were enacted. would the requirement under federal law still apply? Under California law. motor carriers are required to provide employees with paid 10-minute rest breaks for every four hours worked. Under federal law. employer-provided breaks that are between 5 and 20 minutes in duration are generally compensable. Section 611. by its terms. specifies circumstances wherein state laws. regulations. or other provision[s] having the force and effect of law are preempted by federal law. As such. it does not appear as though section 611 would alter the determination of whether a 10-minute break is compensable under federal law. 6. Does California Labor Code Sec. 226.2 apply to independent contractors or only to employees? By its terms. California Labor Code Sec. 226.2 (Section 226.2) applies to employees. Given the time constraints required to respond to your request. and the methodology used to search for relevant cases. CRS could find no case law interpreting Section 226.2 that discusses its potential applicability to independent contractors. 7. Would Section 611 preempt state meal and rest break laws. like Californias. as applied to motor carriers? Section 611 would preempt any state laws that prohibit employees whose hours of service are regulated by the Department of Transportation (DOT) under 49 U.S.C. 31502 from working to the full extent permitted or at such times as permitted under [49 U.S.C. Sec. 31502]. Section 611 would also preempt any state laws that impos[e] any additional obligations on motor carriers if such employees work to the full extent or at such times as permitted by DOT regulations issued pursuant to 49 U.S.C. Sec. 31502. which permits DOT to prescribe requirements for the qualifications and maximum hours of service of motor carrier employees. Thus. any state meal or break laws that impose more stringent requirements on motor carriers than DOTs meal or break regulations for motor carriers. found at 49 C.F.R. Part 395. would seem to be preempted by Section 611. This interpretation of the legislative language would appear to be consistent with the legislative intent behind Section 611."},{"1":"1.142015e+13","2":"2015","3":"H","4":"Mr. HOYER","5":"346","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. let me thank Mr. DeFazio for yielding and for the work that he does on this committee. Let me also say to the chairman of the committee. Mr. Shuster. how pleased I am with the kind of work that he does on the committee. Very frankly. Mr. Shuster is committed to getting things done and to working in a bipartisan fashion. That is good for this House. and it is good for his State. and it is good for the country. I thank him for his leadership. Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of this 60-day extension because it is essential that we do this. The consequences of not doing it would be very. very negative. I rise to lament the fact that we have gone 10 months in our having known full well that this date was upon us and that theoretically. we thought. that funding as well as authorization would end on the 31st of this month. We have now found that funding will not end. This bill is necessary to authorize. not to fund. because funding is available for the next 60 days from the 31st. I also rise to urge this House. under Mr. Shusters and Mr. DeFazios leadership. to do the work we were sent here to do--to invest in America. to invest in the growth of our economy. to invest in the creation of jobs--in fact. what the board of directors of the greatest country on the face of the Earth ought to have done many years and. certainly. months ago. I am absolutely convinced that this House has the capacity. the intellect. and the ability within 60 days to come to this floor with a bill that will invest in our infrastructure and provide sufficient funds to make America competitive and to pay for it. not to pass the expense along to future generations--my children. my grandchildren. my great grandchildren. They are going to have to buy for themselves the infrastructure of their generations. and they ought not to have to pay the bills of our generation."},{"1":"1.130089e+09","2":"2014","3":"S","4":"Mr. HARKIN","5":"1169","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Madam President. in a few moments we are going to vote here in the Senate on whether we are going to bring the minimumwage bill to the floor for debate and a vote. In a few minutes. it will be clear where each Senator stands. Who in this Chamber is going to stand with millions of Americans who work full time for a living but who are left in poverty or on the brink of poverty. struggling to make ends meet? Who is going to vote to give these good people a fair shot at the American dream. and who is going to vote against them? We are going to find out in a few minutes. There is no question that working families need a raise. Fourteen million children in Americathat is one in every fiveare in a family that would get a raise under our minimumwage bill. Businesses need a raise. Over 600 economists7 Nobel Prizewinning economistshave said the lack of demand is what is hurting businesses in America. because people dont have enough money to go into their stores on Main Street and buy what they need. Businesses need customers. If we raise the minimum wage. the people who are getting the raise arent going to go to Paris. France. and spend that money. They will spend it on Main Street. That is what our businesses need. Our economy needs a raise. because when businesses do better. they hire more workers. they add jobs. and it generates more economic growth. People in poverty definitely need a raise. This bill. our minimumwage bill. will lift an estimated 7 million people out of poverty. All working families need a raise. Some of my friends on the Republican side say not all of this goes to people who are in poverty. That is absolutely true. because 12 million people who have family incomes between $20.000 and $60.000 a year will also get a raise. What is wrong with that? These hardworking families need to be able to put some money aside for a rainy day. provide for their kids education. maybe buy a new car. buy a new home. upgrade. What is wrong with that? So. yes. this helps a lot of American families get a fair shot at the American dream. I might add. taxpayers need a raise in the minimum wage. Right now. we are spending about onethird of $1 trillion-$243 billion a yearon social programs to help families who are struggling to make ends meet. who are low income or who are in poverty. It has been estimated that the minimumwage bill will save $4.6 billion a year in money we wont have to pay for food stamps-$46 billion over 10 years taxpayers will save when we increase the minimum wage. because people will have the money. They will be able to go out and buy their own food and they wont need food stamps. Again. any way we look at it. we need to raise the minimum wage. I wish to pick up where Senator SCHUMER left off. This is about real people. This is not abstract. This is Alicia McCrary of Northwood. IA. a wonderful woman who came to testify before our committee. She has four boys. She moved to Northwood from another State. She was in a very abusive relationship. She wanted to get her kids to a safe place. so she moved there with her four boys. She testified. She works at a fastfood restaurant. She makes $7.65 an hour. She has four boys. as I said. She is an amazing woman. working very hard. She rides a bus 20 miles each day. every day. to get to work. She wants to work full time. but the bus. which costs her $10 a day. by the way. only runs until 3 p.m.. so she has to leave by then. Her wages are so low that every day she has to tell her children they cant have things their friends have. They cant play a certain sport. They cant all get a haircut at the same time. They cant even buy shoes at the same time. because she cant afford it. Alicia does not want to be on public assistance. but she has to be. She is participating in a program run by the North Iowa Community Action Agency to help her achieve selfsufficiency and get off the system because she wants to support herself through her own work. Here are her own words: If the minimum wage is increased. it would be very helpful to my family.... I would see more reductions in TANF That is her public assistance and food assistanceand would see another increase in my rent. but that would be OK. I will have more money overall and it would come from my own hard work and my family will be better off. I want to work and stand on my own two feet .... I work very hard doing my job and I believe I am worth $10.10 an hour .... If you can move forward with increasing the minimum wage. my family will be more successful in reaching our goal of a better life. This is the real people who will be helped by increasing the minimum wage. I have listened to a lot of the debate on the floor and I have heard the objections from my friends on the Republican side. I have heard a lot of talk about the Keystone Pipeline and the highpaying jobs it would create. I dont doubt that it probably would. But unless Alicia is ready to pick up and move her four kids to Texas and become a petroleum engineer. it is not going to help her one bit. I havent heard one offer from the other side that will be a single solution that would help Alicias life be better. So the Keystone Pipeline isnt going to help Alicia. a fastfood worker who works hard every day. It is not going to put food on her table or help her boys get a haircut or get a pair of shoes or buy a computer so they can do their homework. A minimumwage increase will do that. A minimumwage increase will give Alicia a raise. The American people are desperately calling for us to pass this bill. The time has come. In fact. it is past time to do the right thing. the morally correct thing. to raise the minimum wage. The time has come to give realistic hoperealistic hope. not false hopeto people such as Alicia McCrary and so many people in our country who work hard every daymillions of working Americansto give them a realistic hope that our economic system is not going to continue to leave them further and further behind. It is time to say yes to giving a fair shot to the American dream. to being a part of the middle class. to Alicia McCrary and millions of hardworking but lowpaid Americans. The time has come to raise the minimum wage. Madam President. I yield back any remaining time."},{"1":"1.130028e+09","2":"2013","3":"S","4":"Mr. KAINE","5":"1422","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. the Senate has begun a historic debate on comprehensive immigration reform. We have had and will continue to have hours of debate on this issue. I think it is appropriate that I spend a few minutes explaining the bill in Spanish. a language that has been spoken in this country since Spanish missionaries founded St. Augustine. FL in 1565. Spanish is also spoken by almost 40 million Americans who have a lot at stake in the outcome of this debate. First. I want to applaud my colleagues in the Gang of 8. who have worked tirelessly to come up with a bipartisan comprehensive bill. This issue deserves an open and fair debate on the floor. It has been over 25 years since we passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill. The next few days and weeks will not be easy. they will be a test for the Senate. and whether this body can debate. offer amendments. compromise. and ultimately come together on an issue that will move our country forward. This debate is about Isabel Castillo. This young woman from Harrisonburg. VA was brought to the United States by her parents at the very young age of 6. Her parents performed hard labor in order to support their family by picking apples and working in a poultry plant. All they wanted. like all parents do. was a better life for their children. Isabel did everything rightshe graduated from high school and went on to attend college. where she graduated magna cum laude. She did not qualify for financial aid. due to her immigration status. and worked for a year to save money for college. After she graduated from college she was unable to legally find a job. Instead of giving up. this young woman organized the Harrisonburg Dream Act chapter to raise awareness about her situation in order to help other students. This is one example of many as to why we need to pass an immigration bill. For students and families. such as Isabels. this is about their future. The last time Congress passed a comprehensive immigration bill was in 1986. Many of the concerns I hear from Virginians involve issues that the last immigration reform bill did not addresslack of sufficient border security measures and a way to address the large number of undocumented immigrants in our country. The last immigration reform bill also did not include spouses and children of legalized immigrantswhich created a strong incentive for many to enter or remain in the country illegally. This time around. things are different. I have been very impressed by the open process we have had in the Judiciary Committee: 212 amendments were considered in the Committee. 30 Republican amendments were accepted. and 12 full committee hearings on immigration and border security were held before markup. I understand that some doubt remains as to whether or not this bill will fix our broken immigration system. While not perfectI can confidently stand here today and say this bill will do more for border security. more to improve our current backlog. more to strengthen our employment verification system. and more to put measures in place to deal with the future flow of immigrantscompared to any other immigration bill in history. This bill will first and foremost create a path to earned citizenship. not amnesty. Undocumented individuals will have to meet several stringent requirements such as. paying fees and fines. passing national security and criminal background checks. paying their taxes and learning English. And before anyone can come out of the shadows. this bill requires a border security strategy and border fencing strategy within 6 months of enactment. I am proud that this bill includes strong provisions to protect students who only know this country as their home. DREAMERS. as well as agricultural workers. who perform some of the most difficult laborthese individuals will have an accelerated path if they meet certain conditions. In order for the U.S. to be the most talented country in the world. we must fix the current flaws in our immigration system. Our immigration system does not meet the demands of businesses that wish to attract and retain highly qualified immigrants. It is not about just addressing the shortterm needs of the STEM workforce but about investing in the future of our children. In order to ensure we remain globally competitive. we must increase our investments in education. This bill does just that by establishing a STEM education initiativefunded through fees collected from employers of foreign STEM workers. According to the Council on Foreign Relations 60 percent of U.S. employers are having difficulties finding qualified workers to fill vacancies at their companies. This bill also creates a fair path for individuals who want to come into this country and start businesses. create jobs. and invest in the economy. In Virginia. Asianowned businesses had sales and receipts of more than $13 billion and employed more than 92.000 people. Virginias foreign students contribute more than $405 million to the States economy in tuition. fees. and living expenses every year. Immigrants contributions in the hightech sector are striking. with one study finding that immigrants started 25 percent of all engineering and technology companies founded in the United States between 1995 and 2005. Through this bill individuals who earn a masters or other postgraduate degree in STEM fields from American universities can apply for legal permanent resident status. This bill also changes our current visa system from one based on arbitrary numbers to one that is market based and understands the needs of U.S. employers. The Federal Government currently spends nearly $18 billion on immigration enforcement every year. more than the combined budgets of all other Federal law enforcement agencies: U.S. Border Patrol apprehension of foreign nationals between ports of entry fell to a 40year low of 327.577 in FY2011. and Removals grew from 30.000 in 1990 to more than 391.000 in FY2011. This bill goes even further by allocating up to $6.5 billion additional for border security. It requires a biometric exit system to be in place at the 10 largest international airports in the United States within 2 years. and 20 additional airports within 6 years. It is not just about spending more money at the border. but about being strategic in how and where we spend our resources. One of the key issues that we must address is to hold employers accountable and ensure that we have an effective employment verification system in place. As of May more than 400.000 employers registered for everify. This bill will mandate that all employers use a verification system that ensures all employees are legally authorized to work in the United States. and fine companies that employ undocumented immigrants. The State Department is currently processing visas for Filipino siblings of U.S. citizens who submitted their visa applications 24 years ago. I ask my colleagues to imagine if you had to wait over 24 years to see your family members. This bill provides sufficient visas to erase the current backlog of family and employmentbased visa applicants in the next 7 years. starting in 2015. Lastly. and probably one of the most essential pieces of this bill. is how we deal with future flow of immigrants wanting to come to this country. This bill creates a future immigration framework that is premised on a meritbased points system. The bill establishes a new nonimmigrant agricultural worker visa. and sets forth provisions relating to the integration of new immigrants. and includes provisions to deal with the present and future workforce needs of the American agriculture industry. while protecting workers from being displaced or otherwise adversely affected by foreign workers. In closing. I welcome this debate. English settlers who landed at Jamestown. VA in 1607 helped begin our Nations great history as an immigrant Nation. And Virginian Thomas Jefferson. as he wrote the Declaration of Independence. expressed his clear understanding that immigration was a positive force for our Nation. Today. Virginia has the ninthlargest immigrant population in the country. with over 903.000 foreignborn residents. Immigrants contribute greatly to the richness of our Commonwealth. I hope that we will start a new chapter and send a strong message to the world that we are a country of laws but also of fairness and equality. Lets not repeat the mistakes of the past but lets also remember that the perfect should not be the enemy of the good. Finding a perfect solution should not stand in the way of progress. Lets show this country and the world that this is not a Republican bill and it is not a Democratic bill but it is a strong bipartisan bill. It is time that we pass comprehensive immigration reform.

Not only has the majority refused so far to pass an extension of the payroll tax holiday. meaning even though were still struggling to recover from a recession. the average American family will see a $1.000 increase in their taxes come January. They have also refused so far to extend unemployment benefits for the 2.1 million Americans whose benefits will run out in the coming months if Congress does not act. Congress has never allowed emergency extended benefits to expire when a jobless rate has been anywhere close to its current level of 8.6 percent. Some Republicans like to argue that unemployment benefits give people a disincentive to work. But how are people supposed to take jobs that dont exist? Believe me. most of the people who are unemployed in our country right now would much rather get a job. but they cant find one. There are still roughly 6.5 million fewer jobs in the economy today than when the Great Recession started in 2007. So were supposed to let them and their children starve or face possible eviction or foreclosure? All of the money that the unemployed receive in benefits goes right back into the economy when they buy groceries. clothes. and health care. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that allowing these Federal unemployment benefits to expire would hurt consumer demand and. thereby. cost the U.S. economy 528.000 jobs. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has indicated that providing extended unemployment benefits is one of the most effective job creation strategies available during a period of high joblessness. stating. Households receiving unemployment benefits tend to spend the additional benefits quickly. making this option both timely and costeffective in spurring economic activity and employment. The choices facing us today couldnt be any clearer. Thats why. Mr. Speaker. if we defeat the previous question. I will offer an amendment to the rule to require that we vote on an unemployment benefit extension and that we vote on a payroll tax holiday extension for next year before we leave for the holidays.

Mr. Speaker. today the House is going to consider H. Res. 1460. which honors National Pollinator Week. With the efforts of the Pollinator Partnership. a majority of States and a number of Federal agencies. including the Department of Agriculture. have officially recognized June 21 through June 27. 2010. as a time to reflect upon the importance of. and challenges facing. these species. The resolution. as offered. acknowledges how vital bees and other pollinators are to our ecosystem and agriculture and supports the goals and ideals of National Pollinator Week. As mentioned by my colleague. 75 percent of all flowering plant species rely on creatures like birds. bats. bees. and butterflies for fertilization. It would be a misconception. however. to think that pollinators are only important to plants and provide little benefit to us. In fact. one out of every three bites of food that we eat as well as $20 billion of products in the United States alone are derived from pollinators. In light of those kinds of figures. the security of our food supply clearly hinges on the survival of these species. National Pollinator Week is a time to reflect upon these contributions and what we can do to help preserve these animals. On a similar note. Mr. Speaker. to further emphasize the importance of this issue. I recently participated in cofounding and am now cochair of the Congressional Pollinator Protection Caucus. along with Representative TIM JOHNSON. Representative CARDOZA. and Representative HENRY BROWN of South Carolina. The caucus is a bipartisan source of information and discussion related to how natural. political. and economic developments impact the security of pollinators and their habitats. Last week. a briefing on the future of pollinators and in recognition of National Pollinator Week was held in conjunction with the caucus and was a tremendous success. We are planning more events and briefings to keep Members and their staffs informed on this important issue. I urge all of my colleagues to become members of the Congressional Pollinator Protection Caucus. Mr. Speaker. National Pollinator Week provides us with an opportunity to recognize how important pollinators are to the sustainability of our environment and to our food supply. You know. Mr. CARDOZA. several in my local media and throughout have come forward with all sorts of humor about this. you know. It bees that way. and Its the buzz and a whole bunch of these things. But when all is said and done. I think we all recognize that beyond the humor. this is a critically serious matter for the food supply of this Nation and. indeed. the world. Therefore.

I rise tonight to speak about an amendment that I believe will pave the way to expand quality preschool education for our Nations children. I believe. as so many people in this Senate believe. that we must invest in our children in the dawn of their lives. as Hubert Humphrey said many years ago. The reason we must do that is. if we dont invest in them in the dawn of their lives. we cant expect them to be healthy. we cant expect them to learn and to grow and to have all the benefits that we hope any of our children would have as they move into school and begin to move into the future together. I thank Senator CONRAD for the work be has done on this budget resolution and allowing us the ability to offer amendments like this. In particular. on this subject matter both Senator KENNEDY and Senator DODD not only have done great work over many years. but in particular this year. and their staffs have helped on this issue as well. I appreciate that. My amendment is simple. It creates a deficitneutral reserve fund for expanding preschool education to children of lowincome families. It is my hope the Congress can come together in a bipartisan way on legislation to expand access to preschool education for children. especially children of lowincome familiesbut it would not be so limited. We could also cover children of lower and middleincome families as well. Mr. President. you know wellyou have spoken about thiswe already have two great programs that help our children among several but two that I will mention tonight. We have Head Start and the Child Care Development Block Grant Program. These are programs that we know work. They deliver results for those children and for our country. So 1 believe both Head Start and the Child Care Development Block Grant Program are good investments for those children. for their families. and for our future. I believe Head Start and the Child Care Development Block Grant Program should receive the funding they need from Congress this year in this budget. At the same time. I also believe a preschool program for early learning that I speak of tonight will complement and add to and enhance the ability of these other programs to help our children. I also believe that by setting up a deficitneutral reserve fund. this amendment will eventually require offsets. But I also think when we do that we are speaking not just of a program that should work but a program that will be fiscally responsible and maintain fiscal discipline. I want to make sure that in this amendment. in this budget process we are engaged in right now. that we leave flexibility for the Health. Education. Labor and Pensions Committee and the Senate itself to create a preschool assistance program for the States. I believe this amendment does that. I hope this flexibility will allow us to work across the aisle in a bipartisan fashion on the parameters of this program and its eventual costs. Early childhood education has been a priority of mine for many years and had been a priority of mine in State government as the auditor general and State treasurer of Pennsylvania. In the Senate it will continue to be a top priority for me. I have been a strong advocate for improving the quality and safety of childcare in my home State of Pennsylvania. and I will continue to do that in the Senate. We know this: study after study shows that investments in preK are not just good for that child and not just good for that childs family but. of course. for the State in which they live and for our whole country. We hear a lot of talk in this Chamber about growing the economy. making sure people have the ability to be entrepreneurs. to invest and to grow and to make money and to build our economy. That is great and we all support that. But if we really are serious about growing the economy of America today and into the future. I believe we must invest in our children. We know these programs pay dividends for our children and for our future. I believe the Bush administration should not only put together the right kind of budgetand I have been critical of many aspects of the Presidents proposalbut I think the administration should increase funds for Head Start. not cut them. It should increase funds for the Child Care Development Block Grant Program. and at the same time we must help our States in their efforts to establish quality prekindergarten education programs so that all children. no matter what their background. can enter school ready to learn. Investments In our children and early childhood education should be a top national priority. something that should have bipartisan support. I believe it will and it does. By working to make sure that every child is ready to learn when they enter school and by nurturing our children during their early years. we make an investment that pays dividends to the child and for the country.

As the 109th Congress comes to an end so. too. does the remarkable 24year tenure in the House of Representatives of one of the bravest and most decent members to have served in this body. I had the privilege of working in LANE EVANS first campaign in 1982. At the time LANE declared his candidacy. he was considered a sacrificial lamb running against a wellentrenched Republican incumbent. His was a pipe dreamexcept to the many labor union workers. consumer and civil rights activists. and ordinary residents of this western Illinois district who saw something special in this young. legal assistance attorney. When the incumbent lost his primary election to a State Representative from the far right wing of the party. LANE EVANS campaign gained momentum and this young Democrat become the Congressman. the first Democrat to do so since the Civil War. In the first campaign. LANE spent lots of time with his young volunteers. After all. he wasnt much older than they. He sported a Beatlelike bowl hair cut that he maintained until rather recently. resisting all goodnatured recommendations for a style update. He was modest. unassuming. friendly. and also inspir ing. He showed a humble respect for each and every voter. addressing them in the softspoken. sincere manner that he never lost. The quiet strength that came from being a United States Marine during the Vietnam era always shone through. From the first day and throughout his career in the House. LANE EVANS remained true to his core progressive beliefs. The working and retired men and women of his district and the veterans throughout the nation could always count on LANE EVANS being there for themno excuses. no exceptions. Environmentalists named him an Environmental Hero. There were those who encouraged LANE to trim his positions in order to ensure his reelection. In the end. his consistency proved to be a great asset. appreciated by his constituents who always knew exactly where he stood and who trusted that LANE would not bend with the changes in the polls. As the Ranking Democrat of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. LANE EVANS is recognized as the leading advocate of veterans in Congress. responsible for legislation to compensate veterans and their families for the effects of Agent Orange. help Persian Gulf and women veterans. and those now retuming from Iraq and Afghanistan. The veterans service organizations have honored Lane with their highest awards. LANE EVANS has always been a leader in the fight for universal health care. Parkinsons disease has forced him to end his productive service in the House. Even now. however. he acknowledges how fortunate he is to be able to afford the best care. while so many Americans are not. He has become an advocate for expanding funding for research into the cure for Parkinsons and many other diseases that might benefit from govemmentfunded embryonic stem cell research. As in all things at all times. LANE EVANS is handling this newest challenge with courage and dignity. On a personal note. LANE EVANS has been a close and dear friend to me and my husband.

Born in Poland in 1920. Pope John Paul II grew up in the aftermath of World War I. As a young man. he witnessed the injustice of the Nazi occupation of his country. lived amid the horrendous crimes of the Holocaust. and survived decades of repression behind the Iron Curtain. Out of those experiences. he developed a hopeful view of the world that defined his 26 years as the leader of the Roman Catholic Church. and he shared that vision with Catholics and nonCatholics worldwide. As the first nonItalian Pope since 1523. Pope John Paul II was a truly groundbreaking figure. He redefined the papacy. coming out from behind the walls of the Vatican to travel to 129 countries and literally reach out to people wherever he went. Through his travelmore than any other Popehe helped rejuvenate and expand Catholicism to areas far beyond its roots. During his 26 years as Pope. the Catholic Church grew from 750 million people to over 1 billion. with most of that growth coming from the third world. For those in developing countries who struggled merely to survive. the Pope was a strong advocate for economic justice. And for those who lived under repression. he was a powerful voice for freedom. His 1979 visit to his native Poland is viewed as the spark that ignited the labor movement which toppled communism in Poland and led to its demise throughout Eastern Europe a decade later. It was his powerful yet simple belief in the value of human life that brought him to challenge violence wherever he saw it. He chastised the brutal Communist governments of Eastern Europe. He criticized the military junta that governed Brazil in the early 1980s. He condemned nuclear war while meeting with survivors of the Hiroshima bombing. He called for an end to the violence in Northern Ireland. And he appealed for human rights in Cuba. The Pope consistently urged leaders and citizens alike to seek peace and respect human life. The Pope also sought to heal wounds. He apologized for the errors of Catholics over the last 2.000 years and for injustices against Jews. women. indigenous peoples. immigrants. and the poor. He acknowledged the failure of many Catholics to help Jews during the Holocaust. And more recently. he condemned the sexual abuse of children by priests in the United States. The Pope reached out to members of other faiths at a time of growing sectarian violence and religious strife. He was the first Pope to pray in a synagogue. the first to visit Auschwitz. and the first to make an official papal visit to the Holy LandJohn Paul II made great strides in improving relations between Catholics and Jews. And just as he acknowledged the mistakes made by his Church and its members. he also demonstrated a willingness to forgive those who had done harm to him. In December 1983. he met with the man who had attempted to assassinate him 21/ half years earlier. During that meeting. the Pope forgave the man who had shot him three times. The Pope regularly visited the United States and met with five Presidents. He believed that the U.S. had a special responsibility to the world calling on our Nation to be for the world. an example of a genuinely free. democratic. just and humane society. In recent years. even as his health deteriorated. he refused to give up. And in this. he served as a model to millions of people throughout the world about how faith and willpower can overcome adversity. Indeed. I cannot remember a Pope who has been more warmly received and loved. I had the great honor to meet him at the Vatican in 1982 where I presented him with a cross sculpted from handguns melted down after being turned into police when they were banned in San Francisco. He received my gift warmly. giving me a rosary in return. The world has lost a strong voice for peace. justice. and human dignity. Pope John Paul II will be dearly missed."},{"1":"1.080152e+09","2":"2004","3":"H","4":"JACKSON LEE","5":"1925","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. my friend and colleague. and also thank the gentleman from California for allowing us to come at this time. I imagine this time is the reason why so many of us. in fact I would say this entire House. cherishes this body and cherishes this institution. because it allows us to come at a time like this and shed our Democratic and Republican labels and simply approach this tribute as Americans. I would imagine that is what these times. although sad. allow us to do. I am proud as an American to come forward and to salute an American President. and to be able to join the millions of Americans mourning the passing of President Ronald Reagan and celebrate his service to the people of the United States and his leadership In promoting the cause of freedom for all of the people of the world. Protest has its place. protest is good in life. but protest has no place in death. and so this opportunity is to acknowledge the principles by which this President lived and stood for during his Presidency. The love that President Reagan had for this Nation was infectious to the point that it reflected on everyone who listened to him. here in America and abroad. Even when his actions did not agree with the policies and initiatives of many of us who wear a different political hat. he maintained himself with integrity and engaged in honest and open debate. We have heard repeatedly over these last couple of days that despite partisan disagreements. former President Reagan followed the tenet that at 5 p.m.. we are no longer Democrats or Republicans. rather. we are Americans. families and friends. I am reminded of the stories told about he and Speaker of the House Tip ONeill. who shared in their Irish heritage a bit of good conversation and maybe a little bit of drink. The differences may have been real. but because of the way President Reagan led. he taught us that there is a big difference between strong beliefs and bitter partisanship. As the Commander in Chief. he was the voice of America in imparting both good news and bad news. As we mourned the loss of our brave astronauts in the Challenger tragedy. it was President Reagan who reminded us. Nothing ends here. Our hopes and our journeys continue. We in Texas at that time appreciated his strong leadership and that in fact even in spite of the Challenger tragedy at that time. we would prevail and we would go forward. President Ronald Wilson Reagan was an American who will always be remembered. He will be forever remembered for the warmth and the respect with which he accorded others. Furthermore. our thoughts and prayers are with Nancy and his children at this difficult time. Strong beliefs and a love of our country are the only way to bring this country forward as we face a costly and difficult war in Iraq and a budget that is struggling to survive. Strength and leadership is what we need now. Strength and leadership will be required to bring this Nation back to the standards by which we have always been known. I believe it is appropriate to read his famous words: We have every right to dream heroic dreams. Those who say that were in a time when there are no heroes. they just dont know where to look. President Reagan himself admitted that he was an optimist and he believed that this Nation had an optimistic future. and so he was always able to rise to the occasion and share words of encouragement. President Reagan always stressed that America is a can do country. I would say to you that we Democrats agree. We can and will get back on the right track. largely through his legacy of integrity and hard work. With strong leadership and a real commitment to confronting the problems facing American families. we can improve upon our weaknesses. Optimism. the true challenge for all Americans. something President Reagan has left as his legacy. He once said. The house we hope to build is not for my generation but for yours. It is your future that matters. And I hope that when you are my age. you will be able to say as I have been able to say. we lived in freedom. we lived lives that were a statement. not an apology. It was interesting to hear over these last couple of days the number of young people. then young people. who were amazed that they had the opportunity to work in President Reagans administration. Sixtynine years old when he took office. it seemed that he gravitated toward young people. Now being able to recite their wonderful experiences again. a tribute to a man who had a great history. We will always remember him as the man who tore the Iron Curtain down. He did it with a kind of leadership and integrity but sternness and determinedness. I will simply say no one will ever forget him challenging Mr. Gorbachev by saying. Open this gate and. Mr. Gorbachev. tear down this wall. We are better for it. He did it with a sternness but also with an attitude of peace. I am grateful also for the shining example of the wonderful relationship between him and his wife Nancy. the great love that they shared and the fact that they were married for some 52 years. Might I share with you some words that he wrote in 1983 on their 31st wedding anniversary as he was riding on Air Force One. and might I commend to you Nancys book. I Love You. Ronnie. published in 2000. but hear these words. He wrote. I more than love you. Im not whole without you. You are life itself to me. When you are gone Im waiting for you to return. so I can start living again. That is a true testament to the value of marriage and partnership and they did it unabashedly and without fear. Mrs. Reagan wrote in 1989. Some of the reporters who wrote about me felt that our marriage was at least partly an act. But it wasnt and it isnt. And I believe her. Finally. in 1998 she told Vanity Fair magazine: Our relationship is very special. We were very much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie. well. its true. It did. I cant imagine life without him. Mr. Speaker. I started by saying that is why I cherish this institution. because it allows us now to come together again. not wearing any partisan hat but simply saying that we are Americans. I do not know if she would mind me saying this. but my daughter is now 24. I remember her as a small girl. very small. and she always used to refer to Ronald Reagan as the grandfather. I had to kind of clarify that for her. but it was out of the mouth of a child that described him as such. And so I simply leave you with the idea of why we have come today to be able to honor this American President. It is because he did leave us with a sense of optimism and an ability to go forward. to look at the troubles that we might be facing both to the left and to the right and forward and back but yet to say that we are determined to succeed. I would only say that in his passing. let us maintain the legacy of optimism for this country. We are the showcase of the future. And it is within our power to mold that future. this year and for decades to come. It can be as grand and as great as we make it. No crisis is beyond the capacity of our people to solve. no challenge too great. the words of Ronald Reagan on With that. Mr. Speaker. I simply say. farewell. farewell. And though we say farewell to a great and wonderful American President. his legacy will live on that Americas future is founded in our optimism and our belief in freedom and democracy and certainly this day our understanding that we all are Americans. Mr. Speaker. I rise in strong support of the resolution offered by my colleague. Representative LEWIS of California. to mourn the passing of President Ronald Reagan and to celebrate his service to the people of the United States and his leadership in promoting the cause of freedom for all the people of the world. The love that President Reagan had for this Nation was infectious to the point that it reflected on everyone who listened to himhere in America and abroad.

Furthermore. our thoughts and prayers are with Nancy and his children at this difficult time. Strong beliefs and a love of our country are the only way to bring this country forward as we face a costly and difficult war in Iraq. the largest budget deficit in history. escalating health care costs. and two million jobs lost over the past three years. Strength and leadership will be required to bring this Nation back to the standards by which we have always been known. We must follow his famous words: We have every right to dream heroic dreams. Those who say that were in a time when there are no heroes. they just dont know where to look.-January 20. 1981 President Ronald Reagan always stressed that America is a can do country. We Democrats agree. We can and will get back on the right track. largely through his legacy of integrity and hard work.

And I hope that when you are my age. you will be able to say as I have been able to say: We lived in freedom. We lived lives that were a statement. not an apology. So when we return to work next week. I hope this House will be inspired by the leadership of Ronald Reagan instead of mired in the partisan politics and a lack of integrity that have too often affected our work as of late. We should be inspired by his patriotism and devotion to our country. Moreover. we should remember his faith. his optimism. and his unwavering commitment to his convictions as we do the work of the American people."},{"1":"1.080045e+09","2":"2003","3":"H","4":"BLUMENAUER","5":"231","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. when facing a 2003 budget deficit that will likely exceed a record $400 billion. Congress should be looking for ways to cut red ink. Instead the Republican leadership is cutting taxes by $350 billion and adding more to our debt. Neutral observers agree this tax cut package will do little to stimulate our sagging national economy and do little to help the 139.800 unemployed Oregonians. This tax cut package and the new budget is leading us towards a $1 trillion deficit over the next 10 years. My constituents are clear about their priorities as witnessed by a difficult decision to raise taxes that will provide the necessary local revenues to help fund education. social services and safety programs. Oregon understands that targeted infrastructure investments can put people to work tomorrow and better our communities. Oregons crumbling bridges. which jeopardize the economy and safety. will cost over $4 billion to repair but would provide 190.000 jobs and $25 billion in economic activity. The Federal Government should be helping States and communities address these types of needs with targeted investments and programs. The budget gimmicks. sunsets. and deficits created by this bill prevent me from supporting it. I will continue to fight for a sample course of fiscal responsibility and domestic security that can be achieved by taking common sense actions. We should not mortgage the future by playing fast and loose with the truth today and the economy tomorrow."},{"1":"1.070126e+09","2":"2002","3":"H","4":"PUTNAM","5":"921","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Chairman. I want to commend the gentleman from Arizona on the outstanding work that he has done to make America secure. but some of the rhetoric that I hear from the other side gives me pause and what comes to mind is how quickly we forget. Some of the environmental concerns that have been raised are completely bogus. Mr. Chairman. When we have a situation where 16 or 17 miles of coastline cannot be used at Camp Pendleton. when we have a situation where soldiers have to draw a circle in the sand and stand there and pretend that it is a foxhole. we are not training our soldiers realistically. The success that we have seen in Afghanistan is the direct result of investment in training and personnel and in troops and in equipment. But that training cannot continue under the current environmental restrictions that we have. This bill makes some commonsense reforms that allow our soldiers. sailors and airmen to prepare to wage and win war. I commend him for his leadership on this and his striking the delicate balance that recognizes the stewardship of the Department of Defense and the overarching mission that they have. which is to keep America secure. For the past year. the Government Reform Committee has been investigating the growing number of restrictions. or encroachments. placed on training at military training ranges by environmental regulations. urban sprawl. international treaties and competition for limited airspace and frequency spectrum. In May of last year the Government Reform Committee held its first hearing on this issue titled Challenges to National Security: Constraints on Military Training. In August of last year the Government Reform Committee on National Security. Veterans Affairs and International Relations. of which I am vice chairman. held a field hearing in my district at the Avon Park. Fl. Air Force Bombing Range to address the issue of military training range sustainability. Our hearings have demonstrated that environmental regulations are among the most pervasive and burdensome constraints on military training. At a hearing last spring. for instance. the committee learned that 16 of 17 miles of coastland at Camp Pendleton. California. are offlimits for amphibious training due to a growing list of wildlife protections. Witnesses also testified that soldiers are not allowed to dig foxholes on some ranges. and instead must practice jumping onto circles marked with tape. As the Defense Department has been forced to expand the amount of land set aside for protected species such as the fairy shrimp. the gnatcatcher. and the checkerspot butterfly. training lanes have become artificially narrow. Environmental laws and regulations have inhibited training at bases across the country and on the waters offshore. Fewer and fewer training areas are now available for realistic combat livefire training. When combat drills become predictable and repetitive. readiness declines. Our experience in Afghanistan has demonstrated that our success on the battlefield is directly related to the quality of our military training. We must ensure that wellintentioned environmental regulations do not lead to shortfalls on the proving ground that later become disasters on the battlefield. The changes proposed in H.R. 4546 are intended to save lives in real combat. The issue is not readiness versus the environment. The issue is our commitment to our military men and women and their families. When we send our constituents or their sons. daughters. spouses. or parents into harms way. we should do so only in the complete confidence that they are ready. They will only be ready if they are thoroughly and realistically trained. Our military men and womenand their families. have a right to expect that training. and we as a nation have an obligation to provide it. H.R 4546 provides a commonsense change to laws that have overburdened the military and restricted training efforts. These are not broad waivers. There are no exemptions and no rolling back of decades of environmental law. The committee mark is a good start. but more may need to be done. The current hairtrigger application of broadly defined environmental regulations has profoundly affected vital military research and development efforts as well. For example. a scientific study funded by the Pentagon showed that a new longrange. lowerfrequency sonar designed to detect ultraquiet enemy submarines would harass marine mammals under the existing definition. The Navy is now waiting for a letter of authorization from the Fisheries Service to allow use of the sonar. If the definition of harassment were changed. the Navy likely would have greater leeway in using the sonar without seeking permits or exposure to lawsuits. The Navy should not need to get permits every time an aircraft carrier changes position and the military should not be exposed to lawsuits for allegedly annoying a marine mammal. More than anything else. military readiness depends on realistic training. Constraints on military training and research are a growing challenge to our national security. To perform a constantly expanding range of missionsfrom peacekeeping to assaulting and holding a hostile beachheadthe men and women of our armed forces must train as they fight. They must train under conditions as much like the real thing as possible. The issue is not readiness versus the environment. Our military men and women have all volunteered to go into harms waywe owe it to them. and their families. to send them there trained to win. Training saves lives. In this time of war I urge my colleagues to make protecting the lives of our military men and women our highest priority. Supporting this legislation will do that. I urge passage of the bill."},{"1":"1.070021e+09","2":"2001","3":"S","4":"REID","5":"725","6":"Yes","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. I rise today to discuss an important piece of legislation that I believe we should be working on today. certainly tomorrow. This legislation. the bipartisan brownfields bill. S. 350. was reported from the Environment and Public Works Committee on February 27 by a vote of 153. This legislation now has 66 cosponsors. It is ready for floor action and has been for more than a month. There were a couple of people in committee who voiced concerns about specific bill language. particularly Senator VOINOVICH. I indicated at that time that we would work with him prior to the bill being ready for floor action to satisfy any problems he might have. and we did that. We worked with him. and I think Senator VOINOVICH is satisfied. Actually we worked day and night to reconcile these differences. The bill is very important. The bill would produce almost 600.000 jobs around our country. It would increase annual tax revenues up to $2.4 billion. This is important environmental legislation. We need to move forward immediately. There has been a lot of controversy over what President Bush has done and what he has not done. but the one thing that he campaigned on was this legislation. He campaigned on the importance of this legislation. This is a bill the administration endorses. This is a bill the Clinton administration endorsed. This is legislation that we should move forward. I see no reason we cannot. We are ready on this side to move forward. We hope that our friends on the other side of the aisle are ready to move forward. We have worked on this legislation for years. It is just not in the best interests of this country not to move forward. We have to move forward. This bill is truly a compromise. It is a consensus. I think its passage would indicate the true nature of this Senate. We are split 5050. and this legislation. certainly with 66 cosponsors. indicates our ability to reach across the aisle both ways. When we entered into this historic power sharing agreement this year. we indicated that we had a thoughtful. bipartisan Senate. I think it indicates the bipartisan nature of this bill. There is no need to wait any longer. We have a half million contaminated abandoned sites in the United States that are waiting to be cleaned up to become thriving parts of our communities. Some of these sites would take only a few dollars to clean up. For example. Mr. President. in Las Vegas. where we have the old National Guard armory. $50.000 in brownfields money cleaned that up and produced a site that is now really a thriving economic entity within the State of Nevada. It is creating jobs. There is now a tax base that will help support the people of Las Vegas and the State of Nevada. I do not want to be partisan today and I will not be partisan today. but as the days go on I am going to have to be more direct as to what the problem is in holding up this legislation. As I said. we are clear on this side. It is not right to hold up this bill. And I also say that this legislation has the support of the Senate. If we do not move this bill forwardand I think we could finish in just a few hoursin the regular course. I am going to be obligated to attach this bill to other legislation that moves through this body. I repeat. with 600.000 jobs. 500.000 abandoned sites. increasing annual tax revenues up to $2.4 billion. this is a bill that is good for the environment. It is good for jobs. We should not delay its consideration any longer. It is supported by the last administration. supposedly by this administration. and I hope the leadership in the Senate. the majority leader. will allow this matter to be brought before the Senate. This legislation has been worked on very closely by Senators VOINOVICH. INHOFE. BOND. and CRAPO. as well as Senators CLINTON. BOXER. CORZINE. and GRAHAM to accommodate all their interests. Senator SMITH and I have worked hard to have this bill reported out of committee. I hope we can have action on the Senate floor at an early datemaybe this afternoon. maybe tomorrow.

I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman. I want to begin by congratulating the gentlewoman from New York . I was very lucky when this competition began. because I have two of those 14 rivers designated in my congressional district as American Heritage Rivers. I think it is important to recall what the objectives were as we began down this course. First. natural resource and environmental protection. something we certainly can all rally to. Second. the question of tasteful growth and economic revitalization. Third. and perhaps the most important. historic and culture preservation. This initiative involves the coordination of a number of agencies. as well as the cooperation of local leaders. but the main initiative here is to help people who live near these rivers effectively coordinate their efforts to preserve. protect and revitalize the watershed areas. What is significant about the Blackstone River. where much of our industrial heritage grew from or certainly tle Connecticut River. which is New Englands mightiest river. is that virtually everything that occurred in the Pioneer Valley began because of the Connecticut River. There are few words in American history or. for that matter. world history. that are more powerful than the word river. The success of these initiatives not only are underway but the navigators have been put in place. The catalyst that these rivers offer I think for further tasteful growth and development are very important to all of us. Let me. if I can. take one moment to congratulate the late Senator John Chafee. who was a great champion of this initiative and. indeed. much of the growth in the Blackstone Valley and the success that we have had with that proposal stems from the commitment of former Senator Chafee. the navigators have been entrusted with the revitalization of these two rivers and they have done a tremendous job in a very. very short period of time. These proposals represent no threat to local property owners. indeed. if anything. they have enhanced the property values of those who live along these waterways.

I yield myself 3 minutes. Madam Chairman. I first want to join with the chairman to state that I do support the amendment and compliment the gentleman from North Carolina for bringing it forward. This bill is going to create new financial institutions. allow them to provide new services which will hopefully lower the cost to consumers and create greater competition. and in the end the consumers are going to benefit that. But there is a serious concern. and that has to do with lending institutions who have the ability to exert undue influence. some would say even potentially coercive influence over their customers. H.R. 10. this bill. substantially erodes the States supervision over insurance sales. In fact. it defers to the Comptroller of the Currency with regard to the sale of insurance by national banks. And there is great concern on my part and others about this bill for that reason. and it is my hope that we will go beyond this amendment in conference to deal with this. But it is extremely important. I think. that the House tonight assert the concept that lenders cannot exert this influence. tying sales of other services in order to influence a loan. Today in every State in the union that conduct is assured through the actions of insurance commissioners and state legislators. Unfortunately this law. H.R. 10 if it passes. will preempt that making that authority void. I think it is important for Members in the Chamber then tonight to say that no consumer who is applying for a loan or any form of credit should mistakenly believe that their purchase of insurance. or any other service for that matter. from that lender will enhance their ability to get that loan and that credit. I have a similar provision in this bill with regard to the conduct of the activity of title insurance. however it goes substantially further. It reasserts the State authority over the conduct of title insurance sales activity. Again. I hope that the conferees will find a better solution than just this amendment. but I think it is essential tonight that the House make clear that we want these protections for consumers in its place. I would like to just speak briefly to the bill. I hope tonight that we will have an overwhelming support for this bill. I have some concerns about the State regulation of insurance and the structure of these new financial institutions. but it is essential that we modernize our financial institutions. We have a trade surplus in services and substantially a consequence of our competitiveness in financial services. and if we want to maintain the jobs and the opportunities. the investment in our economy and the growth. then we need to have institutions that are competitive internationally.

We have shown in our home State that it is possible to have a thriving. prosperous economy and take steps to limit these environmental problems that our colleagues have talked about. The fact is. our country can help play a leadership role in controlling global warming without causing an economic meltdown. There are. really. three approaches that the State of Oregon has used. as the first State in the country to have mandatory controls on carbon dioxide emissions. First. as Senators BYRD and KERRY have talked about. we give great emphasis on market mechanisms. We are not talking about a big government approach. We are talking about using the market. Second. we have taken steps to build these new approaches into new powerplant design. It is prospective. so that all those who are constructing our new powerplants understand the rules. Third. we have given special rewards. credits. for innovative approaches such as proper management of our forests. I conclude by saying that properly managed forests can be very effective in helping to capture greenhouse gases. carbon dioxide. and removing them from the air. Our Northwest forests are some of the very best carbon sinks in the world. The older forests are estimated to be two to three times as effective in capturing carbon dioxide emissions as new growth.

I would say to my friend from Nebraska. that I think. as I have indicated. we now have 243 species that have already been listed and we have 182 candidate species. I do not really think that should be the role of Congress. to vote on each of those. We could spend a lot of time that should be spent in the agencies of government. both Federal and State. Of all of the numerous special interest groups I have listened tohomebuilders and contractors. labor unions. environmental groupsI do not think anyone has suggested we should vote on each one of those. I think they all suggest that the process should be more deliberative in nature and allow more input from the private sector. not because the Federal agencies have done anything wrong in listing the endangered species. but the purpose is to allow State governments and the local entities to feel better about the listing. so they understand it better. To this point it has all been done by the Federal Government and there has not been enough input from State and local governments. So. I would say to my friend. I think the main thing we have to take into consideration is there probably have been some listings that have been wrong. although I do not know of any. But I think the problem istake. for example. in Nevada. We have. surprisingly enough. word that we are the fourth highest State in the whole Nation for endangered species. It is surprising to some people because we are an arid State. But one that caused a lot of attention was the desert tortoise in southern Nevada. It literally brought construction in rapidly growing Las Vegas to a standstill until we worked it out. I do not think. in hindsight. there was anything wrong in listing the desert tortoise. But State and local governments should have had more input in that listing. rather than having it just given to us all at one time. and that is what we are trying to do in the reauthorization."},{"1":"1.040046e+09","2":"1995","3":"S","4":"GLENN","5":"3137","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"These articles show how the moratorium sprung from the minds of people intent not on a better or smarter Government. but a dumber Governmentslow. inefficient. less likely to act on behalf the public interest. A review of the progress of the House bill confirms my view of this bill. House sponsors moved the starting date around several times so that some rules could go forward and others would be caught. And despite the broad sweep of the moratorium. special exemptions were soon added. The exemptions ranged from a promise in committee by the chief sponsor to protect watermelon marketing ordersaccording to the National Journals Congress Daily. February 2. 1995. page 5to floor amendments exempting a variety of FCC matters. China sanctions. customs modernization. airline safety. and other issues. In the Senate. the record is quite similar to that of the House. On February 7. 1995. the Governmental Affairs Committee held the first of five regulatory reform hearings. On the seventh. we heard testimony from the majority leader and a number of other Senators. including the primary sponsor of the moratorium. Senator NICKLES. As our committees majority report says: Senator Nickles stated that the purpose of the temporary moratorium is to give Congress enough time to pass legislation to comprehensively change the regulatory process. With due respect to my colleague from Oklahoma. since that hearing we have devoted several weeks to the moratorium and now are on the floor to debate itthis is all time that has taken away from regulatory reform. I am sorry to say. not added to it. On February 22. 1995. the committee devoted an entire hearing to the moratorium. This hearing reinforced my conviction that the moratorium is a bad idea. Mr. Rainer Mueller. a businessman from California. described his personal tragedy of the death of his 13yearold son to E. coli infection and the impact of the moratorium on USDA regulations. Witnesses from the Department of Transportation and the Food and Drug Administration described specific health and safety rules that would be stopped by the moratorium. Examples of such rules from other agencies provided a clear picture of the potential destructive impact of the moratorium on important government actions on behalf of public health and safety. While other witnesses told of regulations that certainly should be reviewed. if not rescinded. the thought of stopping all rules. including the meat inspection rules. in an effort to get at those bad rules. was simply not convincing. And ironically. one witness pointed out that the revised moratorium proposal before the committee would only stop significant rules. the very rules that already undergo the most rigorous regulatory analysis under Presidential Executive order. Finally. Sally Katzen. Administrator of OMBs Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs [OIRA] told of the Presidents current order to agencies to review existing rules and eliminate or revise outdated or conflicting rules. This review will be completed in about ten weeks. It seems to me that we should get this information before even thinking about stopping regulations. When asked about requirements for regulations. Ms. Katzen also confirmed something that the former Republican EPA general counsel. Donald Elliot. told the committee on February 15. 1995. As much as 80 percent of all rules are mandated by Congress. This is a very important fact. It shows that if anything. we in Congress are the problem. not the agencies. We pass strict laws that agencies must implement section by section. letter by letter. It is simply the worst kind of legislative schizophrenia for Congress to pass laws and require agencies to implement them. and then turn around and tell them to stop doing what we just asked them to do in the first placeand with a few exceptions. without even regard to human health and safety. Again. I can only say that an effort targeted at bad rules makes sense. but to shoot down all rules. good and bad alike. just makes no sense at all. On March 7 and 9. 1995. the committee met to mark up the moratorium bill. Debate among the committee members about the scope of the bill and its exemptions and exceptions highlighted one of the biggest problems with the moratorium. that is. the way in which it would stop important regulations. such as those that protect the American people from serious health and safety risks. While purporting to be a moratorium on all significant regulations. the bills sponsors recognized that this broad sweep is not a good idea and accepted several amendments to exempt specific rules. But. they also rejected others. To look at what was accepted and what was rejected shows the arbitrary nature of the bill. The committee accepted the following exemptions: First. an exemption for rules to ensure the safety and soundness of a Farm Credit System institution or to protect the Farm Credit Insurance Fund. Second. an exemption for rules on commercial. recreational. or subsistence * * * hunting. fishing. or camping. Among other things. this would allow the annual revision of duck hunting regulations to go forward. These rules are very important to the economic health of many regions in our country. Just ask Senator PRYOR from Arkansas. or Senator WELLSTONE from Minnesotatheir States would be significantly hurt by even a delay in the hunting season. Third. an exemption for rules on overflights on national parks. Fourth. an exemption for any rule to enforce statutory rights that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race. religion. sex. age. national origin. or handicapped or disability status. Fifth. an exemption for aircraft safety. including rules to improve airworthiness of aircraft engines. Sixth. an exemption for safety and training standards for commuter airlines. Seventh. an exemption for EPA rules to protect the public from exposure to lead from house paint. soil or drinking water. Eighth. an exemption for rules on highway safety warning devices at railroad crossings. Ninth. an exemption for negotiated rulemakings under the Indian SelfDetermination Act Amendments of 1994. Tenth. an exemption for rules to provide compensation to Persian Gulf War Veterans for disability from undiagnosed illnesses. as provided by the Persian Gulf War Veterans Benefits Act. Even with that wide range of exemptions. the committees majority rejected the following exemptions: First. an exemption for USDA rules to reduce pathogens in meat and poultry. Second. an exemption for EPA rules to control of microbial and disinfection byproduct risks in drinking water supplies. Third. an exemption for rules to ensure safe and proper disposal of radioactive waste. as well as any action regarding decontamination and decommissioning of NRClicensed sites. Fourth. an exemption for health and safety rules. where the agency has concluded to the extent permitted by law that the benefits justify the costs. Fifth. an exemption for any rule that enforces constitutional rights of individuals. Sixth. an exemption for rules required by statutory or judicial deadlines. . Seventh. an exemption for rules that are the consensual product of regulatory negotiation pursuant to the Regulatory Negotiation Act. These amendments were rejected. and they were rejected on a straight partyline vote. To show how arbitrary these votes were. let me just compare one or two of the amendments that were accepted with amendments that were rejected. The committee accepted an amendment to exempt from the moratorium EPA rules to protect the public from exposure to lead from house paint. soil or drinking water. but rejected an amendment to exempt EPA rules to control of microbial and disinfection supplies. Why lead and not waterdont my Republican friends recall that Cryptosporidium in drinking water killed over 100 people in Milwaukee. WI. and made 400.000 people sick? The committee accepted an amendment to exempt rules that would clarify responsibilities among railroad companies.

It is only fair to say that I do not think that this bill is quite as good as he would represent it to be. In fact I rise in opposition to S. 687. the socalled Product Liability Fairness Act. The bill is anything but fair. and the Senator should not move forward with this legislation. Proponents of this bill attempt to characterize it as a moderate bill. as a watereddown version of draconian measures rejected by the Senate year in and year out. They say that because it is less draconian than it was. we should accept it now. They even had the audacity to proclaim that it is somehow proconsumer. Let me set the record straight. This bill has gotten better. It has gone from horrible to very bad. No matter how hard proponents try to justify this bill as needed to stem supposedly outofcontrol insurance rates. outofcontrol litigation. outofcontrol legal fees. or to prevent the decline of American competitiveness. there is no hiding the fact that it is nothing but a base attempt by manufacturers and product sellers to escape liability for defective products that injure or kill innocent Americans. No matter how far proponents stretch to characterize this bill as proconsumer. it is still the most comprehensive anticonsumer piece of legislation that has been or will be considered in this Congress. Let no one be fooled about that. This bill is opposed by every major consumer protection organization in this country. It is opposed by dozens of leading groups representing senior citizens. labor. the environment. and victims of defective products. It is opposed by the AFLCIO. the American Bar Association. the American Association of Retired Persons. the Conference of State Chief Justices. the National Conference of State Legislatures opposes this bill. the American Public Health Association opposes this bill. and 100 law professors around the country. This is a bad piece of legislation. Who is on the other side supporting this bill? The corporate worldbig and small. This alignment should tell you a lot. This legislation intrudes upon an area of law that. for over 200 years. has been reserved to the States. and suddenly those who always talk about States rights are now coming here to the Congress and saying that we should intrude upon those States rights. That is why the Conference of State Chief Justices and the National Conference of State Legislatures oppose this bill. I am not saying the Federal Government should never preempt State law. but the changes proposed in S. 687 represent an unjustified and unprecedented usurpation of the States longestablished authority over tort law. If we do it here. where else do we move in? The former candidate of the States Rights Party of the United States. who ran as their Presidential candidate. will oppose this bill. What a contradiction in terms to run as a candidate of the States rights people in this country and then support this bill. which intrudes upon those very same States rights. This bill is being driven by myths and anecdotes and wornout scare tactics. The original justification for this bill was that it was necessary to forestall an insurance crisis and to prevent an alarming increase in insurance costs. But that argument went out the window after the insurance industry publicly testified that the bill would have virtually no effect on insurance costs. and evidence showed that the availability of affordable insurance is governed by insurance companies underwriting practices rather than product liability. That should have put that argument to bed. But you still hear proponents resorting to it. Another justification traditionally offered for this bill is that there is an explosion of product liability suits. That simply is not true. That is not in accord with the facts. Proponents focus on increases in product liability claims between 1980 and 1988. but there was a specific reason for that. That was due to the cases filed by reason of asbestos claims. Dalkon Shield. and Copper7 IUD legislation. What they ignore is the fact that the number of product liability cases in Federal courts. other than asbestos cases. has been shrinking steadily in recent years. The 1991 annual report for the National Center for State Courts reports that the number of tort filings fell by 1 percent between 1990 and 1991. If proponents were really concerned with an increase in suits. they would be acting against commercial litigation. Businessagainstbusiness suits have increased in recent years. Businesses suing businesses in contract disputes accounted for nearly half of all the Federal court cases between 1985 and 1991. In State courts. such suits accounted for 14 percent of filings. while product liability suits accounted for less than 4 percent of filings in 1991. But business has craftily exempted itself from this bill. This means that if a defective machine explodes in a factory. a worker who was killed or injured would be forced to sue under the severe constraints of this bill. while the employer could sue completely free of any such restrictions. The worker would not even be able to recover a penny if the machine was more than 25 years old. because the bill cuts off the right of consumers--but not businessesto recover for 25yearold capital goods. So businesses want to preserve their suits against each other. they just do not want injured consumers to sue them. It is the little guy who is left out. It is the average individual person who is precluded from going forward with his litigation. But the businesses are still left in a position to sue one another. Yet. another traditional justification for this bill has been that jury awards are erratic and excessive. giving windfalls to undeserving plaintiffs. Again. the facts show otherwise. In fact. under our current system. injured people absorb and pay for much. if not most. of their injuries themselves. A recent Rand Corp. study found that only 1 out of every 10 Americans that are injured due to product hazards ever seeks compensation through the tort system. Of these cases. twothirds involve motor vehicle accidents. In addition. injured Americans recover only about 60 percent of their costs of nonfatal injuries through public and private sources. They. the individuals. must shoulder the remaining 40 percent out of their own pockets. The 1992 report by the National Insurance Consumer Organization showed that the average payment to victims of all claims closed during the previous decade was $3.767. Punitive damages are not out of control. as proponents of this bill would have you believe. There have been only 355 punitive damage verdicts in State and Federal product liability cases since 1965. Did you hear that? Only 355 punitive damage awards since 1965almost 30 years ago. Would the proponents think that the punitive award of $5 million for the death of a family member was excessive? Or $1 million for the permanent loss of sight or fertility? What if it were your mother. or your sister. or your brother. or your father. or your child? Over onequarter of these punitive award cases involved asbestos. Asbestos aside. that means there have only been 266 cases in which punitive damages have been awarded in a product liability case in nearly 30 years. With the exception of asbestos. the number of punitive verdicts in product liability cases has been declining in the last 6 years. Another holdover theme from the Bush administration shifts blame away from manufacturers of defective products and onto lawyers. This amounts to little more than lawyer bashing. The 1992 report by the National Insurance Consumer Organization estimated the average fee paid to victims attorneys for all product liability claims during the previous decade at $1.256. That is the average fee. The bills proponents claim that S. 687 will create a nationwide uniform product liability law. It will do nothing of the kind. The provisions of S. 687 would be grafted onto the different product liability laws and standards in the 50 States. The result will be a hodgepodge of State and Federal standards which will create new uncertainties for tort litigation in State courts and diminish the authority of State judicial systems to define and enforce their own rules governing product liability Mr. President. there is much more that I have to say about this particular piece of legislation. I think there are others waiting to be heard. I do not wish to assume up to myself all of the time that is available. and I yield back the remainder of my time."},{"1":"1.030009e+09","2":"1993","3":"H","4":"GOSS","5":"950","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I am very much cognizant of the fact that the President of the United States delivered an excellent joint session speech here. and among the things he challenged Congress to was a way to cut expenditures of the budget of this Nation. I think that that is a task that we have not addressed properly yet. and I know that there is a lot of controversy about exactly how we should do that. I also noticed today that even though many Members have stood up and said that there were some specifics they thought should be considered for cutting that they labeled as waste or unnecessary and held out. that they have not received much attention. Rather. the majority has rallied around. and I think properly. the President and the Presidents cut list for areas of savings and cutting Federal expenditures Today. I noticed the Washington Post. which usually has been a very staunch defender of the Clinton proposals so far. and. in fact. the majority party generally. and I think most people would agree that that has been the case. and this editorial today lists some of the Presidents proposed cuts as wispy. I looked that up. and I think that means wispy as in willothewisp. like not there. In other words. we are talking about some cuts. some ways to reduce our deficit that. in fact. just are not going to materialize. Therefore. we are going to have to find some other ways to cut. and we are going to have to find some programs and label them clearly for what they are. and that is unnecessary if. in fact. they are. How are we going to do that? I think that the questions that most Americans are asking. certainly that we are getting on our phones. are. OK. we agree with the need to sacrifice. We want to respond to the Presidents reasonable call to sacrifice for the good of our country. But tell us precisely what it is we are sacrificing for. Just exactly how are you going to use those dollars that we send to you in Washington? And so I suggest that we have got a new test in Congress to deal with the question of how we justify the public expenditure of dollars. What. in fact. will be the priority list? Will we use yesterdays priorities. or will we catch up with where we are today and talk about. in fact. the needs of today in our Nation? I think it is also clear that we are going to have to recognize that there are some limits of the affordability. We cannot endlessly go forward taxing. taxing. taxing. I think that it is clear in the proposal that the President has given us that there are not enough wealthy to pay all the costs to reduce the deficit. We have run out of wealthy. it seems. and some of the taxation is inevitably going to hit the middle class and perhaps below the middle class. as we see. So we must reject the idea that raising taxes and hitting only the rich is the way. It is not enough. Clearly we have also been asked to chop out identifiable waste. and that means we have got to identify waste. and it is to that particular point I have risen this evening. I have submitted for the public record a list of 50 highly suspect expenditures which I believe this Nation can do without. They total approximately $200 billion over 5 years. which is a very significant contribution to reducing our deficit and getting on with the job of building the strength of our economy. And. of course. that means jobs. This list of 50 expenditures does not necessarily come from me. In fact. none of them are original with me. They come from organizations such as the Government Accounting Office. the Congressional Budgeting Office. the Grace Commission and other credible grassroots organizations that have studied the ways Congress is misusing. wasting. or creating redundancy or duplication of services. I think that. as we go forward and look at the balance of what these 50 projects are. we will discover that they are elimination of some subsidies. cuts in some programs. reduction of personnel in some. reduction of. say. travel expenses in others. getting at the bureaucracy which everybody knows is bloated. I think it is fair to say that all of them on this list. Just about all of the subjects that I think are suspect that are on this list are discretionary expenditures. They are not the entitlements. I am not trying to suggest that we ought to in any way discuss entitlements until we look at our discretionary expenditures. I think the approach I have taken which is appropriate is to refer this list to the Committee on the Budget and ask the Committee on the Budget to Justify the continuation of each and every one of these projects and programs. Some will clearly pass muster. Some will be found to be useful. Some clearly will be found to have benefits that I do not presently see. But I think this legislative approach is one that is clearly going to bring the issue to the forefront. I know that some will say this is very parochial: You probably have not put anything from your own State in. In fact. I have. So when this list is examined and it is available. because I will submit it at this time to be included in the RECORD. I will be happy to stand behind it and answer further questions. Mr. Speaker. I am including in the RECORD the list of proposed cuts and savings as follows:"},{"1":"1.020158e+09","2":"1992","3":"H","4":"GRADISON","5":"340","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of this bill. The bill reported by the Appropriations Committee would rescind $5.8 billion in budget authority for fiscal year 1992. The associated outlay reduction will reduce the fiscal year 1992 deficit by $1.3 billion. With a fiscal year 1992 deficit now projected to be around $370 billion. every dollar of unnecessary spending that can be eliminated is Important. The Appropriations Committees should be commended for their efforts to develop a responsible spending reduction bill. This bill reduces spending slightly more than requested by the President in his rescission proposals considered by the committee. but even more could be saved. The committee did not consider the $2.2 billion in defense rescissions transmitted by the President which are not included in this bill. another $5.4 billion could be saved and the total BA reduction could be nearly doubled to $11.2 billion. Despite the apparent good start at spending reduction. let us not feel ourselves into thinking that every dollar rescinded by this bill represents a real reduction in spending. In many instances. the Appropriations Committee has simply recognized reality and rescinded funds that are no longer needed for their intended purpose. There is nothing wrong with doing this. but it is certainly nothing to brag about. Other reductions. such as the reduction in funds available for delayed obligations in the Labor/HHS appropriation. simply remove spending authority which should never have been provided in the first place. Unfortunately. this bill rescinds only $18 million of the $4 billion in delayed obligations contained in the fiscal year 1992 appropriation. The entire amount should be rescinded because there is not enough room under the fiscal year 1993 spending cap to meet both these delayed obligations and legitimate fiscal year 1993 spending needs.

I rise today to pay tribute to a remarkable woman. Jill Ireland was a British actress and cancer crusader who spent the last years of her life fighting the debilitating disease of breast cancer but did not let it defeat her. Instead. she fought in public. where her courageous 5year battle brought hope and inspiration to both the ailing and the healthy. With her death last week we lost a very special advocate for womens health. In books and frequent lectures about her battle with the disease. Ms. Ireland spoke eloquently about selfrespect and optimism in the face of devastating illness. She wrote a bestselling book about fighting her disease entitled Life Wish. She called herself a survivor. not a victim. In January 1988 she testified before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. of which I am a member. representing the American Cancer Society. At this hearing Jill pleaded eloquently for a bill I had introduced to address the critical heatlh issue of early detection of breast cancer through mammography. so that other women would not have to suffer as she had suffered with this terrible disease. As she stated at that hearing: If it were not for a mammogram. which detected my cancer before I did. I would not be standing before you today. pleading for the lives of American women. My tumor was not detectable by examination. It took a mammogram to save my life. If all women knew about the benefits of screening. and if it were available to them. so many women could be spared surgery. painful treatment. and death. Mammography screening can detect breast cancer when it is in its very early stage. At this early stage. the chances for cure are over 90 percent. Yet is is estimated that fewer than 10 percent of women over 65 have mammograms regularly. One primary reason for this is that the cost of a mammogram can be a tremendous burden for an elderly women on a fixed income. Jill Ireland can no longer stand here and plead for the lives of others. it is up to us to carry on that work for her. I know of no better way to attempt to carry on In her footsteps than to continue to press for measures which enable all women to receive mammography screening and other necessary medical services. As Jill Ireland stated before my committee: Breast cancer is a great leveler. It knows no boundaries. It does not respect income levels. ethnic distinctions or social standing. It strikes the young. people in full stride of their most productive years and it strikes the elderlymany of whom are surviving on a mere $400 a month from Social Security. Our memorial to this exceptional woman must be to ensure that no woman experiences the devastating effects of breast cancer simply because she could not afford to have a mammogram."},{"1":"1.010069e+09","2":"1989","3":"H","4":"FLORIO","5":"298","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I wish to express my strong support for H.R. 982. to take the Postal Service off budget. As a longtime cosponsor of this legislation. I know how important this bill is to the thousands of postal workers across our Nation. In the past few years. the Postal Service has been the target of budget cuts that have harmed its workers and affected its ability to provide its vital service to the American public. Although the Postal Service does not contribute to the Federal deficit. it has been considered fair game for legislators wielding the budgetcutting axe. Restoring the Postal Service to its former offbudget status is necessary to prevent against further budget cuts. The Postal Service Is unique In the extent to which it affects and is affected by the general public. Unlike any other Government fund. the Postal Service provides an essential public service to virtually everyone in the country on a daily basis. Other Federal programs can control their costs by regulating the extent to which the public has access to and utilizes their services. But the Postal Service has no control over the volume of mail or the extent to which the public uses the postal system. It Is a universal service. open to all. This makes the Postal Service far more sensitive to arbitrary budget cuts. When its operating budget Is cut. the Postal Service has no choice but to reduce the level of service it provides. This has a direct and almost immediate impact on the general public. This is why it Is essential that the Postal Service be moved off budget. This is the only way to protect postal workers and ensure that the Postal Service is able to continue to provide the best possible service to the American public."},{"1":"1.000247e+09","2":"1988","3":"H","4":"ROSTENKOWSKI","5":"592","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to this procedure of agreeing to the Senate amendment without a conference. Almost 3 years ago. the House began a major effort to come to grips with our evergrowing trade tensions and to change the focus of our trade policy. After much debate. we finally succeeded this year in enacting a major trade policy reform bill that will be remembered as one of the landmark achievements of the 100th Congress. Many Members worked long and hard on that bill. We had several forces working against usincluding the highfinanced lobbies of foreign governments and corporationsbut we prevailed. Unfortunately. we now find ourselves voting to repudiate the very principles underlying the omnibus trade bill just 1 month after it was signed into law. The omnibus trade bill is based upon the premise that the United States must take a firm stand against the artificial trade barriers of other nations. We want the governments of the world to break down their protective walls and stimulate the world economy by expandingnot restrictingmarkets. This textile bill. however. does Just the opposite. It encourages all countries to maintain their trade barriers. and invokes the very kind of trade policy that we find so offensive in other nations. Why should we expect other nations to play by rules that we wont even play by ourselves? This bill makes the United States. and the U.S. Congress in particular. look like hypocrites who are not really serious about fair and open trade. The Senate amendment to this bill does nothing to improve it. The socalled Daschle amendment merely attempts to buy off the opposition of farm groups. It is nonsensical trade policy. It says that farm exports are more important than other exports like steel or autos. Not only are we going to make it harder for developing countries to sell textiles and thereby earn dollars to buy U.S. exports. but we are going to penalize them if they use those dollars to buy Boeing airplanes or Caterpillar tractors or Motorola pagersanything other than agricultural goods. Does that make sense? Sure. agricultural exports are an important part of my States economy. but so are a great number of manufacturing industries who are officially relegated to the status of secondclass citizens under the Senate amendment. How can we look a steelworker or a machinetool worker in the eye and tell him his Job is less important. as a matter of trade policy. that the farmers? After years of spiralling trade deficits. the United States is finally in the midst of an export surge. We should be marshaling all of our energies toward the goal of opening export markets and encouraging increased exports of all U.S. products. Erecting permanent barriers to the U.S. market just gives other countries the perfect excuse not to open their markets to our goods and services. I believe in the policies and goals set forth by this Congress in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act. And I believe that the prosperity of American workers and firms depends on the consistent and vigorous enforcement of the principles set forth in that act. This vote today is the first test of whether we are willing to stick to those principles. I share my colleagues concern about the problems faced by American textile workers. But I believe those problems must be solved through rational policies that are fair to all Americans. and I cannot. in good conscience. support a measure which is so clearly contrary to the principles of open and fair trade."},{"1":"1.000085e+09","2":"1987","3":"H","4":"OBERSTAR","5":"741","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. this may be the most important bill that we vote on in this Congress because it deals with the needs of people here at home. people in their everyday lives. It deals with the future of our country. with education and training. as the chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor so eloquently said just a few moments ago. This bill deals with matters of human equity. In this appropriation bill the committee has restored funds that the administration through OMB would have cut. It deals with vocational education. We have talked a great deal about productivity in America. about keeping America competitive. but if we do not have vocational education programs in this country. we are not going to train the workers of tomorrow for the skills of tomorrow. The administration proposed to eliminate $890 million in vocational education funding. This bill restores that funding and increases it to $900 million. That is the minimal amount. We should be doing more. We are only providing as much as we have done in the current year. College work study is a program that helps the poorest and the neediest of our society. students from families at the lowest end of the economic ladder. This bill restores those funds and restores the opportunity for children of poor families to have a higher education. And then there is a trade adjustment assistance. We passed trade legislation just a few weeks ago in this body which said that we are going to put an emphasis on training. on education. on replacement of jobs lost through unfair trade practices by the adjustment assistance mechanism. This legislation restores funding that the administration proposed to eliminate. It would restore the entire $50 million budget for trade adjustment assistance. This fulfills a commitment made in Federal law in 1974. when we passed legislation that opened the doors on trade. to allow unfair trade practices and the goods produced by them to enter this country. to allow other countries to dump their unemployment on Americas shores. There are 12.000 people in my district who are out of work because of the imports of steel that have denied markets for iron ore in northern Minnesota. because the only market for our taconite is the domestic steel industry. Those workers are skilled and trained. and they want to have other jobs. but they cannot find work in the taconite industry. Under the trade adjustment assistance program. they will learn other skills and they will go somewhere else and find another job. or when we attract other industries. they will train for the skills that those industries will need in northern Minnesota. There are 800 unemployed steelworkers in my district who have been laid off from the taconite industry. and who are likely to qualify for trade adjustment assistance. but who will not get a dime unless we pass this legislation. fund TAA. and give them an opportunity for a job. In fact. as of now. only 125 workers have been certified for TAA. and only onehalf of them are being funded. because the appropriations have been inadequate. even with the supplemental we passed earlier this year. because the administration has failed to be tough on unfair trade practices. and failed to keep faith with the principles of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. Then we have library services. When the disaster of steel imports hit and the iron ore economy of northern Minnesota went into recession. the laidoff workers went into the libraries to research job opportunities. to learn how to write a resume. to learn where they could go for new job opportunities. It was the libraries that helped them learn those skills of job application. of writing resumes. of learning where they could get training opportunities. Mr. Chairman. we spend more in this country on military marching bands than we spend and propose to spend in this budget for library services. I think that is an outrage. But this legislation will restore at least the level of funding. and just a little bit more. not even enough to keep pace with inflation. for one of the most important services in our entire society. that of library services. Mr. Chairman. I think the amendment offered by my colleague. the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. FRENzELJ. would be a disaster.

In"},{"1":"9.802366e+08","2":"1984","3":"S","4":"MOYNIHAN","5":"851","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. I rise today to offer legislation that would ensure a costofliving increase in January 1985 for the Nations Social Security and supplemental security income beneficiaries. The Social Security Act provides for an automatic benefit increase in any year when the cost of living rises by 3 percent or more. Inflation. of late. has slowed markedly. and in most respects this is a welcome and happy event. But for aged and disabled Americans. lower inflation is a mixed blessing. Current projections for the increase in the Consumer Price Index from the third quarter of 1983 to the third quarter of 1984 are hovering just below 3 percent. While this may mean only slightly higher prices for the goods our elderly and disabled citizens must purchase. it also appears that. barring the change I am proposing. Social Security and SSI recipients will receive no costofliving increase. The fact is. we are in a position to provide for this increase. because the trust funds are in satisfactory condition. On January 15. 1983. the National Commission on Social Security Reform. on which I served. agreed to a set of recommendations to put Social Security on a firm financial footing. Our proposals became law 3 months later. and optimism about their efficacy has been vindicated. On April 5 of this year. the trustees of the Social Security trust fundsTreasury Secretary Donald T. Regan. Labor Secretary Raymond J. Donovan. and Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret M. Hecklerreported that benefits to be provided under these programs can be paid well into the next century. This 1984 trustees report assumed that in January 1985. benefits would increase 4.7 percentthat being the projected rise in the CPI. In 1985. that increase would cost the Social Security system $8.3 billion in benefit payments. If benefits were adjusted in January of next year based on a 2.9percent CPI increase. the cost to the OASDI funds would be about $5 billionroughly $3.3 billion less than is now incorporated in the trust fund projections. Let me also note that over 2 years. this legislation will not cost the trust fund any substantial additional moneys. Under the provisions of the Social Security Amendments of 1983. if recipients forfeit their COLA because the CPI rises less than 3 percent. the COLA for the following year would be based on the increase in the CPI over the previous 2 years. With this legislation. then. we simply would ensure that our elderly and disabled citizens receive their COLAs when they need itwhen the CPI rises. without waiting an additional year. And let me mention another happy fact. The OASDI trust funds are in even sounder condition today than the 1984 trustees report had estimated. That report predicted a trust fund balance in January 1985 of $27.7 billion. According to Social Security actuaries. the military adjustment payment to the trust funds will exceed the trustees expectations by some $2.6 billion. Moreover. the current recovery is increasing revenues into the fund at a faster rate than expected. A timely COLA of just under 3 percent would leave the trust funds in a fine and healthy condition. President Reagan now supports this increase in Social Security benefits. This week. the President joined in the view of the trustees of the Social Security funds. The Presidents remarks are a happy. though somewhat belated. expression of confidence in the solvency of the Social Security funds. In effect. he acknowledged that the trust funds are healthy enough to provide benefit increases beyond those required by present law. Perhaps now. at last. the constant harping we have heard about the failings and possible demise of the Social Security system is at an end. Single Americans on Social Security receive an average benefit of $425 a month. an- annual income of just $5.100. This increase of roughly 3 percent will mean about $12 more each month. or $144 a year. The average benefit for aged couples on Social Security. about $700 a month. would be increased by roughly $21 per month. That means $252 more a year for a couple living now on just $8.400. Among the most poor agedthose receiving SSIthis increase will mean $108 more per year for an individual now living on less than $3.800. and $168 more per year for a couple now receiving less than $5.700 in annual support. These certainly are small sums for individuals. but they maintain the buying power of their current incomes. These increases just keep pace with actual inflation. inflation which elderly and disabled Americans cannot offset. like some of the rest of us. by working harder. This increase of about 3 percent will keep almost a half million elderly and disabled Americans above the poverty line. according to estimates by the American Association of Retired Persons. Can we do otherwise? Can we sit by and watch a half million of our elderly and disabled citizens slip below the poverty line? They deserveindeed. have earnedthis costofliving adjustment. I invite my colleagues to join me in this effort to grant a costofliving adjustment to the millions of elderly. blind. and disabled Americans who receive Social Security and supplemental security income.

I rise in strong opposition to the conference report on H.R. 4961. the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. Although it is with some discomfort that I find myself compelled to vote against the position of the President and many of my good friends. partilcularly on this side of the aisle. I am convinced that this tax bill is not in the best national interest. Before I outline my specific objections to the bill. I would like to emphasize that the entire procedure by which H.R. 4961 has been considered by Congress is. in my view. unconstitutional. The Constitution specifically mandates that all revenue measures must originate in the House of Representatives. This tax package. however. was written in its entirety by the Senate Finance Committee. It was then attached to H.R. 4961. a minor bill passed by the House last year which actually provided for revenue reductions. No hearings were held by the House Ways and Means Committee. there was no opportunity for the full House to perfect the Senate bill. nor of voting it up or down. By agreeing to send H.R. 4961 directly to conference. a motion I opposed. we in the House effectively abrogated our constitutional responsibilities and established a precedent that will undoubtedly haunt us in years to come. If for no other reason. therefore. this conference report should be rejected on constitutional grounds. Mr. Speaker. H.R. 4961 provides for tax increases totaling $98.5 billion over the next 3 fiscal years. $228 billion over the next 5. On an annualized basis. this works out to the largest peacetime tax increase in history. No matter how proponents of the bill attempt to diguise this fact by terming it tax reform. revenue enhancement. or improved compliance. the fact remains that. if this legislation is enacted. the average American household will pay an additional $2.500 in taxes by 1987. I yield to no one in my advocacy of efforts to reduce budget deficits and to bring the growth of Government under control. I am afraid. however. that what really lurks behind all the talk of tax reform and compliance by advocates of this bill is yet another attempt to finance unrestrained Federal spending. According to OMB Director Stockman. Federal spending. as a percentage of GNP. will reach its highest level since 1946 this year. The Presidents original program for economic recovery called for a reduction of this ratio to 19.3 percent in 1984. Current estimates are that Federal spending will consume 24 percent of GNP in fiscal 1984. During this fiscal year. the Federal budget will increase by 11.7 percent. a rate substantially greater than that of inflation. The implication should be obvious: if we are serious about controlling the growth of the Federal Government. reducing the deficit. and improving the economy. we must cut spending. A midAugust Gallup survey asked how Congress should reduce the Federal deficit: 50 percent of those questioned said reduce spending. only 4 percent said raise taxes. The rest suggested doing both. or had no opinion. The same poll shows that 66 percent of those questioned oppose this tax bill. It is that simple. To attempt to avoid the admittedly difficult process of cutting spending by burdening the American people with additional taxes is not only bad economic policy. but also reflects an utter lack of congressional courage and responsibility. It is claimed by proponents of this tax package that we are getting $3 in spending cuts for every $1 in tax increases. It is more likely that the ratio will be just the oppositethe spending cuts enforceable by the congressional budget process amount to only 27 cents of savings for each dollar in increased taxes. For fiscal year 1983. the first concurrent budget resolution assumes budget savings of $50.6 billion from changes in present law. aside from reconciled spending cuts. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. $33.6 billion of these assumed savings are implausible or nonexistent. Based on this analysis. the ratio of all spending cutsthose subject to congressional enforcement and othersto tax increases for fiscal year 1983 is about I to 1. The administrations arguments are based upon questionable projections and assumptions about future econom. ic activity which cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. While all tax increases are subject to reconciliation. only a fraction of the projected spending cuts are. Further. if our inability to agree to the limited spending cuts mandated by the budget resolution. as evidenced by the controversy over Federal retiree COLAs. is any indication. tax increases may play a larger role in reducing the deficit than even now anticipated. I would like to reiterate. Mr. Speaker. that tax hikes are not the way to reduce the deficit. particularly since the concurrent spending cuts promised seem increasingly illusory. In the past. tax increases have been enacted on the basis of the argument that they were necessary to finance spending programs. historically. the greater the tax increase. the greater the growth in Federal outlays. With Federal spending now at an alltime high as a share of GNP. congressional policy should be clear. We must focus on substantially cutting spending. on reducing the growth of Government. and returning economic resources to the private sector where they can be most effectively utilized. In addition to the fact that the tax Increases contained in H.R. 4961 will be quickly consumed by rising Federal spending. it makes little economic sense to enact a tax bill of this magnitude at a time when the economy is only now showing signs of recovery. Although such signs existinterest rates. for instance. are declining rapidlycorporate liquidity is at its lowest level since World War II. beforetax profits are down 30 percent from last year. and business failures are running at their highest rate in 50 years. There is no evidence which suggests that taxes should be raised during a recession. Herbert Hoover tried it in the early 1930s. and turned a recession into the Great Depression which. at its peak. resulted in an unemployment rate of 25 percent. If this legislation is enacted. fully onefourth of the tax relief provided by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA) will be repealed. Aside from reducing personal income tax rates over a 3year period to a level where. in view of social security tax increases already mandated and bracket creep caused by inflation. the tax burden of most families is held relatively constant. the ERTA provided Important incentives for business investment and expansion. Although business received less than 20 percent of the total tax cuts enacted last year. these benefits were intended to help the private sector create more Jobs and profits. H.R. 4961. however. repeals nearly 70 percent of these business tax reductions and will have the Inevitable effect of hampering savings and new investment. At a time when the private sector is struggling to overcome the worst recession since World War IIa recession caused in large part by the misguided Federal economic policies of the pastit is just plain wrong to take away tax incentives which would ultimately result in more jobs for Americans who want to work because we in the Congress have been unable to restrain our appetite for spending. Aside from its impact on business. the tax bill before us contains many elements which will adversely affect the average taxpayer. Above all else. the American people desire simplicity. certainty. and fairness in the tax code. H.R. 4961. as passed by the Senate. is a 758page compendium of complicated corrections. changes. and additions to present law which represents a substantial retreat from our efforts last year. in enacting the Economic Recovery Tax Act. to move in the direction of clarity and certainty. With regard to fairness. the bill provides for an increase in the Federal excise tax on cigarettes. but none on alcohol. It establishes a complicated and burdensome tip reporting system which must be observed by waiters and waitresses. but makes no change in the threemartini lunch business deductions. The general compliance provisions included will empower the IRS to intrude more easily and often into the affairs of lawabiding citizens. Perhaps the most onerous provisions of the bill is that requiring the withholding of dividend and interest income at source. The withholding of 10 percent of all such income whenever it is credited to an individuals account will take billions of dollars out of the national flow of savings so essential for the investment necessary for capital formation and economics growth. Those who will suffer directly. however. are not large corporations. or even the financial institutions which will be responsible for the actual withholding. but the small savers who depend to varying degrees on dividend and interest income. and who religiously pay their taxes. While private savings and investment will be hampered by withholding at source. it is by no means certain that the revenues anticipated will be forthcoming. The increased operating costs of financial institutions necessary to comply with the withholding provisions are deductible business expenses. and will thus reduce net revenues. many individuals may compensate by lowering withholding on their wages. Two years ago. Congress passed a resolution objecting to a similar withholding proposal by a vote of 401 to 4. If anything. withholding would have a more deleterious effect on the economy today. The bill contains a number of additional provisions which will discourage savings and investment. The ability to reinvest certain utility stock dividends without taxation. enacted just last year. is repealed. The tax benefits of private pension plans are significantly reduced. At a time when the future of Federal retirement programs is increasingly questioned. it makes little sense. in my view. to reduce the attractiveness of private plans. There are. Mr. Speaker. several positive features of this bill. The mortgage subsidy bond program is expanded. and will thus stimulate housing construction. For many years overdue. the tax treatment of the life insurance industry is reformed. the tax treatment of independent contractors is clarified in a constructive fashion. These provisions notwithstanding. however. I remain opposed to H.R. 4961. I am committed to the Presidents program of reducing the size of government. By providing for massive tax increases over the next 5 years. this bill will help finance historically high levels of Federal spending. spending which we in the Congress have proven unwilling and unable to bring under control. The bill. if enacted. will make economic recovery more difficult by assuring that a greater share of national resources will be consumed by the Federal Government. The incentive of individuals and businesses alike to save and invest is reduced. The ability of the IRS to intrude in the daily lives of our citizens is enhanced. In short. Mr. Speaker. we must not enact this huge tax package at this time. To do so would. in effect. be reflective of the fact that we have chosen to violate our constitutional responsibilities. and to discard our commitment to economic sanity. I. therefore. urge that the conference report on H.R. 4961 be rejected."},{"1":"9.701315e+08","2":"1981","3":"H","4":"FORSYTHE","5":"359","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I support the passage of H.R. 1486. a bill to assure that the integrity and values of Protection Island in Washington State are retained and perpetuated for the nesting seabirds and the harbor seals found in Puget Sound. The island serves as an extraordinary breeding area for six species of seabirds. Over 40.000 seabirds utilize the 400acre island for nesting. In addition. the beach areas serve as habitat for pupping and hauling out activities of harbor seals. In 1968 a development company purchased the island and initiated plans to develop it as a residential and recreational home subdivision which included nearly 1.100 lots. To date nearly 600 lots have been sold. but in 1974 a building moratorium was imposed on Protection Island until a Stateapproved water system could be developed. Consequently. development has been limited to a small airstrip. an unapproved road system. a marina. and a small number of residences. However. there is no doubt that should the water problem be resolved and development commence. the value of this island as a seabird nesting site would be dramatically reduced. Many of the property owners on Protection Island have indicated a willingness to sell their lots in order to facilitate the establishment of a national wildlife refuge. However. other landowners are opposed to selling their property. Many want to continue to visit or reside on their property. and others want to maintain ownership for investment purposes. The legislation before us today will authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire the lands. waters. or any interest in such lands and waters on Protection Island as are necessary to carry out the purposes of the refuge. At the same time. those lotowners who had structures on their lots suitable for personal residence on January 1. 1981. are assured of being offered life or other extendeduse reservations on their property. The bill assures the protection of the birds and marine mammals and their important habitat while providing for the continuation of a limited number of activities. Therefore. Mr. Speaker. I want to urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of H.R. 1486."},{"1":"9.603337e+08","2":"1980","3":"S","4":"BRADLEY","5":"1343","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I thank my colleague from New York. Mr. President. high unemploymentcontinues to threaten the economic progress of our country and the cohesion of our society. Some 71/2 percent of our population is currently out of work. and the near term prospects for a substantial decline in this figure look increasingly dim. Action taken this year by the Houseits repeal of the socalled Maybank amendment by the overwhelming majority of 220 to 179took advantage of a rare opportunity to combat this unemployment problem in a costeffective way. In essence. the House proposal permits society to maximize the overall benefits of those dollars that Congress decides should be spent. This strategy of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal expenditures is worthy of our strong support. The principle behind the repeal of Maybank is far from revolutionaryin fact. it was enacted into law by both houses of Congress in 1977. That year. Congress amended the Small Business Act to authorize Federal procurement officers to set aside certain contracts for small businesses and for businesses in labor surplus areas. Labor surplus areas basically are areas of exceptionally high unemployment. The House amendment simply seeks to conform the procurement of nonstrategicand I emphasize. only nonstrategicitems by the Defense Department to this setaside strategy. a strategy presently employed by all Federal agencies--except DOD. Labor surplus areas are defined by the Department of Labor as all cities. counties. and county equivalents with a population exceeding 50.000 where the unemployment rate has been at least 20 percent higher than the national average over the previous 2 years. These pockets of unemployment are not the special burden of one region. or group of States. Pockets of unemployment exist everywhere throughout our Nation. For example. according to the latest figures published in May of this year. California has 57 labor surplus areas. Arkansas has 38. Tennessee has 49. and my own State of New Jersey has 20. Let me assure you. these areas are not all burntout ghettos. uninhabited swamps. or devastated ghost towns. On the contrary. they constitute some of this countrys most productive areas of past years which. for various reasons. presently suffer from excess capacity. Through the repeal of Maybank. the military will continue to procure its daily goods and services from experienced and efficient producers. with the added advantage that persons living in areas of high unemployment will have new and productive job opportunities. Further. the House proposal has a second. very important advantage: The enhancement of national security. By encouraging a more diversified manufacturing base. it will help to secure the Nation during times of emergency against procurement delays or shortfalls due to insufficient manpower or productive capacity. Indeed. this was the primary purpose of the setaside policy when it was first articulated by the Defense Manpower Agency in 1952. Its contribution to the relief of unemployment was. at that time. regarded as a positive. but incidental. side effect. Despite its manifold benefits. the setaside program was crippled from the start by an amendment inserted by Senator Burnet Maybank in the 1954 defense appropriations bill. The amendment prohibits DOD from paying higher prices for contracts in order to relieve economic dislocation. GAOs interpretation of this amendmentwhich has been included in every subsequent defense apnropriations measurehas prevented DOD from totally setting aside any of its contracts for labor surplus areas. This is because GAO holds that restrictions on bidding create the presumption that a higher price must be paid than would be paid without such restrictions regardless of the actual result. This is undeniably an unfair assumption. The House measure seeks to overcome this situation in a balanced and sensible way. In the interest of maximizing the costeffective use of spending from the perspective of the total Federal budget. itintroduces some flexibility by allowing contracts to be set aside by the Secretary of Defense when he determines that bidders in labor surplus areas will be plentiful enough to insure a reasonable price to the Government. The amendment permits the Secretary of Defense to do this. it does not require him to so do. Nor does it tell him which contracts to set aside. or how many contracts should be set aside. All this is entirely up to him. Indeed. it is difficult to imagine why this very flexible proposal should meet with any opposition.. Finally. Mr. President. the House action is especially timely in light of forthcoming large increases in spending important to our national defense. Presidentelect Reagan has called for substantial increases in defense spending over the next several years and many colleageus in the House and Senate. on both sides of the aisle. agree. and within sensible limits. I agree. At the same time. Presidentelect Reagan and several Members of this legislative body have expressed their strong desire to bring the Federal budget into balance. something with which I disagree more. But no one would disagree that a strong defense posture and an antiinflationary budget picture are both worthy goals. However. taken together undoubtedly they will result in a squeeze on necessary social programssuch as unemployment insurance and public jobs initiatives. Under these circumstances. a measure which seeks to use DOD dollars to combat unemployment where it is most severe is especially attractive. It will put the additional dollars earmarked for defense to work. not only for national security purposes but for domestic economic purposes as well. And with unemployment nearing 8 percent. the latter concern is no less pressing than the former. It is even likely that this modification of Maybank will help the Federal Government in its efforts to keep spending down. It has been estimated that each Federal dollar spent on procurement generates between $3 and $4 of private sector activity. Spent in the right place. of course. this money in turn creates new jobs. And for every 1percent decrease in unemployment that might result. a total of $20 billion is saved in welfare and unemployment expenses and gained in tax revenues. Thus. a major advantage to targeting nonstrategic defense procurement to alleviate unemployment is its overall positive effect on the Federal budget. Reduced costs of unemployment will more than offset any insignificant additional cost that might result from restricting bids under the labor setaside program. Mr. President. the House has acted wisely in this matter. I commend our colleagues there for their responsible action in the House. The overwhelming majority with which they voted to amend Maybank220 to 179is an indication of their strong feelings on this issue. However. this Senator believes that with the Senate adjournment close upon us. our primary concern must be to pass the defense appropriations bill currently under consideration. Therefore. we ask that the distinguished Senator from Mississippi and his distinguished colleagues on the.Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense give fair and new consideration to the merits of the House proposals in conference. I know the distinguished chairman to be fairminded and firmly believe the House arguments for repeal to be persuasive. I am sure he and his colleagues will give these arguments careful attention. Finally. I would note. that the language of the socalled Maybank amendment. which the committee has inserted into the bill constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in that it requires the Department of Defense to do something which the Department is not required or authorized by law to do otherwise. I raise this matter simply to point out that those of us who have fought long and hard for this amendment find ourselves now in a position which. upon parliamentary objection. might indeed frame the issue in a new light. Mr. President. I yield to the Senator from New York for his comments. I wish to reemphasize for the RECORD that if we. indeed. are serious about reducing Federal expenditures and increasing national defense at the same time. the repeal of the Maybank amendment is a commonsense way to achieve bothtargeting nonstrategic defense dollars into areas with very high unemployment. thereby employing people. taking them off welfare and unemployment compensation. and giving them a productive life. while enhancing our national security at the same time. Mr. President. I am pleased to yield to the Senator from New York."},{"1":"9.601340e+08","2":"1979","3":"H","4":"CHARLES WILSON","5":"677","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. the conference report now before the House will provide the District of Columbia government with total resources of $1.9 billion for fiscal year 1980. of which 40 percent or $784.5 million will be in Federal funds. This amount includes a Federal payment of $238.4 million and Federal loans for capital outlay of $125 million. The conference agreement provides a total of $1.5 billion in District of Columbia funds. and includes $1.4 billion in operating expenses and $157 million for capital outlay. This is $115 million below the amount requested in the amended budget. $58 million above the House allowance. and $19 million below the Senate bill. The increase of $58 million above the House bill is due primarily to budget amendments totaling $86.6 million which were transmitted to the Congress too late for consideration by the House. In Federal funds. the conferees recommend a total of $373.7 million. a reduction of $113.2 million below the budget request. $46.2 million above the House allowance. and $10.9 million below the Senate bill. Mr. Speaker. the increase above the House allowance is due partly to the budget amendments I mentioned a moment ago and partly to a reduction in the carryover surplus which was required to fund the fiscal year 1979 supplemental. The conferees have approved $5.1 million for operation of a summer jobs program for District youth. ages 14 to 21. as well as $4.2 million for a jobs program for adults with dependents. Language has been included in the bill prohibiting the use of funds for the summer youth jobs program until the citys plan is approved by both the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. A total of $2.9 million has been approved to cover the costs of equipment and contractual services for the care of St. Elizabeths patients who are placed in communitybased facilities. The conferees recommend a total of $10.2 million for the citys day care program. an increase of almost 10 percent above the 1979 level. The conference action adds $800.000 and 33 positions to the fire departments budget for the sole purpose of improving the emergency ambulance service. The city will now have a total of 15 emergency ambulance units available. The conference agreement includes an increase of $11 million above the House allowance to cover the costofliving salary increases. This will provide a total of $58 million for this purpose. Mr. Speaker. the District of Columbia has entirely too many employees. If you count employees paid for through Federal grants. there are over 47.000 employees for a population of 672.000. The committee is trying to do something about this. and in conference we agreed to hold down the personnel ceiling to the lower level that was in the House bill. In addition. Mr. Speaker. the conference action reflects a onehalf percent base reduction in overhead and administrative costs for all departments except the public safety agencies as reflected in the House bill. The full budget request of $351.500 has been approved for the Districts Commission on the Arts and Humanities. This will allow the Commission to fully match the basic State agency grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Additional funds have also been approved to meet the increased demand for birth and death records and to provide for improvements in the treatment and prevention of alcoholism. The conferees have approved various increases which will provide improved staffing and maintenance at several recreational facilities throughout the city. The conferees have agreed to the full budget request for the citys Department of Housing and Community Development. except for the half percent base reduction. and have included an increase of $250.000 for a home mortgage assistance program for low and moderate income families. For mass transportation. the conferees have approved the revised budget request of $17.8 million for the citys capital contribution to Metro. The conferees were unable to resolve their differences concerning the abortion issue. and that amendment. amendment No. 27. has been brought back in disagreement. Mr. Speaker. the conference agreement provides adequate funds for the operation of the District of Columbia government during fiscal year 1980. This is a good conference report and I urge its adoption. At this point in the RECORD. Mr. Speaker. I will insert a tabulation summarizing the conference action. The table follows:"},{"1":"9.502977e+08","2":"1978","3":"S","4":"HEINZ","5":"601","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. 38 years ago the Soviet Union forcibly occupied the independent State of Lithuania and began to persecute its residents. The immediate consequence of the Soviet invasion was the deportation of tens of thousands of Lithuanians to Siberia. Since then the Soviets have continued to abridge the rights of the Lithuanians. We in the United States cannot imagine the pain of forced separation from family. of extended periods of isolation in spartan prison cells. of long hours of intensive interrogation for supporting the implementation of policies which would insure the protection of rights to which every human is entitled. As a citizen of a nation which identifies the assurance of human rights in its founding documents. I feel it my duty to protest the gross injustice which the Soviets perpetuate through tactics of terror against individuals to whom they are responsible. The signing of the Helsinki and Belgrade accords. which has encouraged Lithuanians to seek to exercise their basic human rights. has not altered favorably Soviet behavior. They have continued to employ show trials and harsh sentences to intimidate and silence these brave people. This is but another reason that we who are free to express our opinions must denounce the activities of the Soviet Union. Several examples will serve to illustrate the nature and the degree of Soviet repression: Last year I brought the arrest of Viktoras Petkus by Soviet authorities to the attention of this Chamber. Petkus. a member of the Lithuanian Public Group to promote the implementation of the Helsinki accords. has been detained since August 1977 because of a possible connection with the Gajauskas case to which I will refer later. This treatment clearly violates the Helsinki accord. the implementation of which is the goal of the Lithuanian group. Petkus has been active in the promotion of the observance and fulfillment of the humanitarian articles of the final act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. as well as the dissemination of Lithuanian literature on which he is an expert. These pursuits merit praise. not persecution. however. the Soviets have arrested Petkus three times since he was 18 and imprisioned him for a total of 16 years. Such flagrant disregard for basic human rights is intolerable. Today. I also wish to mention the case of Balys Gajauskas who has spent more than half of his 51 years in Soviet prisons. On April 14. 1978. Gajauskas was sentenced to 10 years at a Soviet strict regime labor camp and 5 years in exile for alleged AntiSoviet agitation and propagandaa catchall statute that is cited as the basis for many of the lengthy prison terms received by prisoners of conscience. In this particular instance. Gajauskas was incarcerated because of an innocent association with Petras Plumpa. a deeply religious advocate of Lithuanian independence. Plumpa allegedly printed the Chronicle of the Lithuanian Catholic Church. hardly a vicious crime. During the course of his trial. however. evidence was presented that proved that the fingerprints on the Chronicle. the only link between it and Plumpa demonstrated by the Soviets. were not Plumpas. Nonetheless. Plumpa has been sentenced to eight years of strict regime. The goal that these men seek and for which they are punished is the realization of fundamental human rights and basic freedoms. including freedom of thought. conscience. religion. and belief. Freedoms on which our forefathers established this great Nation. We cannot ignore the Soviet Unions blatant violation of the rights of its citizens and maintain our responsibility to the Helsinki accord and the more than 1 million Americans of Lithuanian heritage. We cannot remain silent--we must vigorously protest the gross injustice perpetrated by the Soviet Union.*"},{"1":"9.500486e+08","2":"1977","3":"H","4":"MIKVA","5":"1321","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. today I am introducing a bill to improve the quality of services dispensed by Government agencies. A substantial number of Americans. perhaps the majority. have personal contact with the Federal Government only when they have a problem. For example. when a social security check is late in arriving or when there is a dispute about veterans benefits. For these citizens. the satisfaction or dissatisfaction is largely determined by the quality of service they receive in response to that problem. I think the relationship between the citizen and the Federal Government needs improvement. Citizens are more than taxpayers. they are also consumers of Government services. In the commercial world. the consumer usually has many alternatives available to him in order to express dissatisfaction. ranging from sending angry letters to the merchant or manufacturer to refusing to purchase the service or product. Unfortunately. the citizen/taxpayer/consumer does not have the luxury of seeking alternatives to the Social Security Administration--SSA. the Immigration and Naturalization ServiceINS or the Veterans AdministrationVA. They are. in truth. the only games in town. And if one is not willing or able to play by their rules. then there is no game. This bill will give the workers In these three Federal agencies a name and a face. It will make them personally accountable to the people they serve. and it will also give each Member of Congress the opportunity and responsibility to evaluate the service provided by the VA. the SSA. and the INS. The bill is entitled the Congressional Action Line Liaison Act. or the acronym CALL. Whenever an individual either writes to or personally appears at one of these agencies to initiate a complaint or question. the individual will be provided with a CALL card. The CALL card asks for the name of the citizen. the name of the Government employee. and several other brief questions designed to measure the citizens satisfaction with the work done on his or her behalf. One portion of the CALL card will contain the address of the House of Representatives and a space to write in the name of the persons Representative and to affix a stamp for mailing. The other portion of the CALL card will have the name of an official within the agency to whom the citizens eValuation will be sent. In short. CALL card Is intended to show that a citizen has called on an agency for assistance and is now calling on his or her Member of Congress to be aware of the quality of services being delivered by that agency. It allows for praise or criticism. as the matter warrants. It is time that Americans had an opportunity for holding Government agencies and personnel accountable for delivering quality services.

I say yes. The right to organize to negotiate labor contracts is inherent to the concept of freedom. and laborers should have the right to strike in pursuit of their demands. I believe the right to strike carries with it a responsibility to the public interest and we in Congress must give long overdue attention to that public interest. but those who strike should not be punished by denial of food stamps and those who engage in a lawful strike should not be smeared in their efforts to improve their conditions of life. The difference between a free society and a slave society is the right to personal opinion and individual freedom. including freedom to join a labor union. I do not support legislation which says to an American on strike for better conditions that he must either return to his job or be left with his family to go hungry. We cannot starve free men into submission and we should not try. It is enough that we have required the striker to register for a job and accept work outside the struck plant if work is available. American labor must be free to the same extent that American industry must be free. Both should yield when there is a clear violation of the public interest. Public interest Is not served. however. by telling the union member that he must work or go hungry. That is not the mark of a free society. that is the mark of totalitarianism. (By unanimous consent.

The mimeograph mills of the Great Society are constantly grinding out big slogan words like massive attack. bold and imaginative planning. which create the impression that poverty and the other evils which confront mankind are being rolled back before the forces of Federal law and Federal money. But when the time comes for some constructive action. I have learned from bitter experience that the Great Society frequently puts on a new face and looks the other way. In Mexico there is a saying. Mucho ruido. pocas nueces. Literally. it means Much noise and few nuts. Figuratively. it means Much talk and little accomplishment. A rather exotic Yankee philosopher. Yogi Berra. recently stated: You can observe quite a lot just by looking. Well. I have been looking at all the Federal Government has done about poverty in my own hometown and I have observed quite a lot and. in my opinion. it can be best expressed with the Mexican phrase. Mucho ruido. pocas nueces. I take this time. Mr. Speaker. to give you a concrete example. documented in fact. of the schizoid actions of the Johnson administration in the last few days in my congressional district. To set the stage. let us first take a look at my hometown of Gilroy. Calif. We are primarily an agricultural community in an area which is almost in a different economic world than the rest of Santa Clara County. Because the fastgrowing electronic and industrial complex of northern Santa Clara County has not yet come to the Gilroy area. we will probably be required to depend upon agriculture and food processing as our economic base for a few years to come. This dependence creates serious unemployment problems since agricultural employment is highly seasonal. Furthermore. because it is a pleasant place to live. many migratory workers who travel across the State during the summer spend their winters in Gilroy. These people are underskilled and have not been fortunate enough to have received the training which would enable them to break their migratory pattern. Their lot admittedly is not the most pleasant. There is need to help them develop skills which are in demand and at the same time to develop jobs which they can fill. The Office of Economic Opportunity has designated Gilroy as a pocket of poverty. Two years ago a nationally televised report by the Columbia Broadcasting System held it up as an example of poverty in the midst of affluence. According to figures taken from the Santa Clara County Special Census of April 1966. 41.7 percent of Gilroy families have an annual income of less than $6.000. 23.5 percent get less than $4.000. and 8.4 percent get less than $2.000. The Santa Clara County Welfare Department estimated early in January that more than 1.000 families are currently on the welfare rolls in the greater Gilroy area. The State department of employment estimates that the level of employment fluctuates wildly throughout the year. with a low employment of 1.721 to a high of 7.926. The Federal Government sends a parade of VISTA volunteers to Gilroy to assist migratory workers. The Gilroy Area Service Center of the Economic Opportunity Commission receives comparatively heavy financing in its efforts under the poverty program. Though I wish I could claim differently. these facts show that we do have a problem In Gilroy. Constructive Federal help would be useful and welcome in meeting our peculiar economic problem. As the remainder of my story will show. we took the constructive steps advocated by the deluge of paper and press releases which come from the mimeograph mills of Washington. We found a means of doing something constructive. We courted one branch of Government. we were encouraged. and then we were jilted. At the same time. another branch of the Great Society continues to pipe its tune which leads people down a road of false hope. frustration. and continued poverty. Last fall. Swift & Co. expressed an interest in establishing a meatpacking plant near Gilroy. I talked personally with Mr. J. A. Copeland. vice president of Swift & Co.. who confirmed this interest. The meatpacking plant would immediately employ 350 unskilled laborers who would be furnished yearround employment at good wages. Here was an opportunity in one fell swoop to break the migratory and poverty pattern of 350 human beings for all time. And the anticipated growth of Swift & Co. would undoubtedly more than double their Initial employee requirements. But Swift & Co. had to be assured that adequate utilities could be furnished. the most crucial being a sewage treatment and disposal system to handle the large discharges that come from a meatpacking plant. This situation appeared made to order for the grant and loan program authorized by Congress and administered by the Economic Development Administration. Gilroy was encouraged to submit its application and did so. I had numerous contacts with the Seattle Regional Office of the Economic Development Administration in an effort to expedite processing of this application and received courteous and efficient replies from Mr. V. W. Cameron. the area director. At one time. Mr. Cameron wrote. and I quote: Since the Swift and Company project involves approximately 900 new jobs. its location may have considerable impact in our evaluation of this Gllroy application. In the meantime. Swift & Co.. anxious to make its decision and proceed with the construction of its new west coast facility. patiently marked time. The Seattle office of the Economic Development Administration acted expeditiously and I was finally informed that the application had been sent forward to Washington. At this point. the old Washington runaround started to operate and political gobbledygook and doubletalk began. Twice I was informed by Washington Economic Development Administration officials that the application was still in Seattle. Upon checking there. I found on both occasions that the information from the Economic Development Administration In Washington was false. On one occasion. I was even told the name of the lady in Washington who had the application on her desk. I pressed further and submitted a letter written to the city manager of Gilroy by Mr. John W. Nordstrom of Swift & Co.. which said in part: We cannot definitely state that if Gilroy is given the money for this sewage disposal plant that Swift and Company would build there. but we can say that Gilroy would not be considered for this plant if a sewage disposal facility is not available. On February 6. I wrote a letter to Mr. Ross D. Davis. Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director of Economic Development. enclosing a copy of Mr. Nordstroms letter. in which I said: Perhaps it is too much to expect the Federal Government to make an advance commitment conditioned upon Swifts action in this case. This being true. we are then faced with the situation of which comes first. the chicken or the egg? It is my considered opinion that a conditional commitment on the part of the Federal Government should be made and the condition should be that the grant will be approved if and when an industry is attracted to Gilroy because of the grant which would provide permanent employment to those who are presently unemployed. This would break the impasse and would certainly serve the intent. purpose. and spirit of the law. I received various oral indications from representatives of the Economic Development Administration which strongly suggested that funds were unavailable and that though Gilroy was a pocket of poverty. the overall unemployment figures of Santa Clara County were not sufficiently high to warrant a grant. I countered with the figures from the State department of employment. the Santa Clara County Welfare Department. and the special census taken in 1966. and heard nothing further regarding the overall unemployment figures of Santa Clara County. Finally. I received a copy of a letter from Mr. Lambert S. OMalley. Deputy Assistant. Secretary for Operations. Department of Commerce. addressed to the Honorable Kenneth L. Petersen. mayor of Gilroy. It said: Since the amount of money requested is far in excess of the funds available . . .. we have no choice but to limit our assistance to those projects which will do most to further the purpose of the Public Works and Economic Development Act. Although the construction of the facilities you plan would be an asset to your community. we do not see in this project any economic justification since. at this time. the Swift and Company has not made a decision with regard to locating in your area. It is noteworthy that the denial was based upon the allegation that Swift & Co. had not made a definite decision. My suggestion for an approval conditioned upon Swifts decision was totally ignored. It is my understanding that the Economic Development Act is for the purpose of attracting industries and jobs. and not for the purpose of helping industries which would locate in an area with or without Federal assistance in building a sewage plant. I strongly suspect that the Economic Development Administration is under wraps from the administration and is required to hold back construction of sewage facilities and similar public works projects in order to keep the economy from overheating with Inflation. This explains why the administration played Alphonse and Gaston with my request and batted it back and forth between Seattle and Washington as long as It could. It explains why it proferred weak excuses which I met with facts and figures. It explains why it was finally forced to come out and say no. for a very poor reason. We could look the world over and not find a situation which more clearly falls within the spirit and intent of the Economic Development Act. What could have provided 350 immediate jobs for the unskilled in a pocket of poverty. and eventually 900. will be lost simply because of an administrative decision. Disappointing as the unfavorable decision might be. it would have been received much more gracefully had not information come to my desk on the same day that another branch of government was cranking up its mimeograph to announce the release of $109.000 for the California Center for Community Development for the purpose of continuing the training of a group of people who had graduated from the California SelfHelp Service Corps and were now out in the field working with the poor. Last December 30 I visited the California SelfHelp Service Corps. It was located 12 miles north of Gilroy and was funded with Federal money in an amount of $246.836. Since April of last year it has graduated 34 persons with an average thirdgrade education who are now working with the poor in outlying areas. These students are receiving $400 per month and 9 cents a mile for use of their own automobiles. The director of the school is a former employee of the American Friends Service Committee. The executive research director was formerly an economist from Washington and an organizer with CORE in the Watts area. The third member of the permanent executive staff was an editor of a labor newspaper. the Valley Labor Citizen. for 11 years. Field supervisors were and are still employed to supervise the trainees in their field work with the poor. One is a teamster from Los Angeles. Another is the cousin of Cesar Chavez and still another is Fred Hirsch of San Jose. Calif.. long identified with leftwing activity and a controversial individual at best. The school was conducted in an old abandoned grammar school which had been condemned. I would not attempt to judge the quality of instruction. which included lectures from persons like the daughter of Jack London on the history of farm labor organization. officials of SNCCStudent Nonviolent Coordinating Committeewho spoke on SNCCs experience in the South with racial matters. and representatives of the sheriffs department and the industrial welfare department. Though it may not be an indication of what was taught. I was rather interested to note the extensive use of wall posters and sayings which emanated from SNCC and CORE. Above the directors desk was a poster which said: Justice is a twoedged swordbut it is always sharper on one side than the other Another said: Lord. if you would make me in your image. you must be an agnostic. And another said: Were going to tear this country up. then were going to build it back. brick by brick. until it is a fit place for human beings. Still another said: If the courts dont kill a man after he is convicted of committing a crime. what right does a cop have to kill him on suspicion? For no explained reason. a picture of Red Chinese Defense Minister Lin Pao. cut from the cover of a magazine. was prominently displayed on the bulletin board. Another poster put out by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee showed a picture of a sternfaced Mississippi highway patrolman above the caption: Is he protecting us? Some area citizens have called this school an agitation academy and. judging from what little I saw. It is possible they are correct. One fact is certainit has cost about $7.260 for each of the original 34 community service representatives who graduated. As I have said previously. on the same day that the Economic Development Administration denied a loan for a sewage treatment plant to Gilroy. which would have eventually provided employment for 900 individuals. the Office of Economic Opportunity released an additional $109.000 to continue the work of the selfhelp service corps so that 30 of its graduates may continue their work in the field. And what type of work are they doing? According to the gentleman who talked to me when I visited the selfhelp service corps center. they are participating in selfhelp housing programsviolently opposed in some quarters by the building and construction trades unions. They are conducting citizenship education and in Modesto they are helping to organize welfare recipients and equip them to be better able to secure all their rights. Thus. at the end of the current grant. which Is to be spent on 30 of the original 34 graduates. we will have approximately another $3.633 invested in each of the trainees. Each of the 30 now represents a taxpayers investment of more than $11.000. Mr. Speaker. the war on poverty continues to flounder. The Headstart program and the Neighborhood Youth Corps program have achieved a degree of success. but the former properly belongs under the direction and administration of the U.S. Office of Education and local school systems. The latter should be under the administration of the Department of Labor. administered through State departments of employment. The Office of Economic Opportunity Is hiding behind the skirts of a successful Headstart and Neighborhood Youth Corps program and continuing to throw money around in improperly planned. proliferated efforts which lack coordination and commonsense. I believe that with the above exceptions It Is achieving nothing except to excite false hopes and create frustrations in the poor. Furthermore. as I have repeatedly stated In the past. I believe the program is being utilized as a base of political operations for those ultraliberal persuasion. Mr. Speaker. the series of events I have related. though they affect only a small locality within this Nation. could be typical of what Is going on everywhere. They raise a very serious question as to the sincerity of the Johnson administration. Does the administration really want to get at the causes of poverty and give people the dignity and pride of holding a steady job. or do they only want to build bureaus and political bases of power. hire topheavy bureaucracies. and train people to agitate rather than work? I suppose I am being provincial. but. frankly. I feel sorry for the migrant workers of my hometown who lost their chance for a better life last Thursday. while the poverty program continues to train more paid agitators to tell them how bad is their lot. Mr. Speaker. this does not make sense and the American people know it. This Congress should do something about attacking the real root of poverty. Let us train people to want jobs--to hold themand let us do things which will create jobs."},{"1":"8.901684e+08","2":"1966","3":"S","4":"ROBERTSON","5":"189","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I think so.

I believe. a particular responsibility to see that the act is fairly and effectively administered. For nearly 2 years. I have felt some concern about how this legislation works in actual practice. I believe it would be helpful to the Congress to cite one example which has taken place in my own State. After the legislation was enacted. a small business firm located in Levittown. N.J.-since renamed Willingboroproposed to the Labor Department a project providing onthejob training for 12 unemployed persons as building maintenancefloorworkers.

Williams. who was troubled by the substantial number of unemployed men in the TrentonLevittown area. They lacked Jobs and the training necessary to obtain them.

There was every reason for Mr. Williams to believe that his proposal would be a useful contribution to reducing unemployment in a difficult area. His proposal was considered by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Industry and by the Federal Department of Labor and was approved by both. A contract was signed on July 22. 1963. to launch this modest pilot training project.

I strongly favor safety in the coal mines of the United States and always have. We in Congress have the obligation in occupations of high hazard to make sure that there are uniform health and safety rules. We must protect the worker in these industries as human beings and provide their families and dependents that measure of security and guarantee of life and limb itself that every American feels he holds as his birthright. For I believe that there can be no difference in the protection we give to the individual workers so that there are two standards of mine safety in our country today. It is intolerable. both to the worker and to his family. that one man. who works in a mine regularly employing 15 or more individuals underground. therefore receives Federal protection and power of enforcement. while a second mineworker and his family. through no fault of his own but simply because he works in a mine regularly employing less than 15 men underground. receives for himself and his family less safety precautions and protection. Our United States of America is strong enough economically to provide the basic needs of the safety provisions to eliminate needless hazards in all hazardous occupations and particularly in the coal mining industry where a double standard of safety precautions and requirements has been permitted to exist. My hearty congratulations to the United Mine Workers for their officers and members organized and persistent work over the years to provide adequate safety precautions. good wages. and fringe benefits with adequate health protections guaranteed by contract.

I am glad by my vote to be associated with the recommendations of the Public Works Committee in reporting and urging passage of House bill 8667. as amended. As has been explained here. the urgency of final passage and signing into law of this measure are eminent. Fiftyeight going projects are right now facing shutdown because of lack of funds. The tragedy of such forced action in loss of time. in loss of money. in loss of jobs. and in loss to the business communities in which these projects are located can hardly be realized. To make the present situation even more ironic. the Appropriations Committee of the House and the House itself have already made appropriations to carry forward the same projects. But they were forced. because of lack of final action on H.R. 8667 or on H.R. 6016. to make these appropriations subject to a proviso that the pending proposed legislation would be enacted. The distinguished senior Senator from Arkansas. my good neighbor. has already inserted in the RECORD. on page 22929. a list of the projects on which requested authorizations are planned to. be used. In the Arkansas River Basin this includes 14 projects. Since rivers do not recognize State lines. I find that some of the 14 are in Kansas. Missouri. and Arkansas. as well as in Oklahoma. The basin authorization needed for fiscal year 1964 is $31 million. The total needed for both the fiscal year 1964 and the fiscal year 1965 is $157 million. I am griteful to the Committee on Public Works for including the authorizations needed for both fiscal years. Also in the bill is an authorization for a very badily needed and highly justified project for southwestern Oklahomathe Waurika project. On October 22. I inserted in the daily CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. page A6567. the following description of this project: Southwestern Oklahoma is one of the most aggressive areas about which I have ever known. The people of that section are for the most part of pure pioneer stock. with the friendliness of the South and the sturdiness of the West. The .Waurika project is a multiplepurpose project which is estimated to cost $25.853.000. of which the local communities would repay $12.861.000. consisting of $2.417.000 for water supply storage. $9.628.000 for. conveyance facilities. and $816.000 for irrigation. The water supply would meet present and future local requirements for the cities and towns of Lawton. Duncan. Waurika. Comanche. Temple. and Walters. in addition to serving FortSill and industries in the project area. This project has been endorsed by both President Eisenhower and President Kennedy. has the consent of all of Oklahomas neighboring States. and has the endorsement of the present Republican Governor and the former Democratic Governor. my colleague Senator EDMONDSON. It has been recommended by both the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation.

This annual fair is especially important at a time when there Is an everincreasing awareness of the need for expanding markets abroad for U.S. products. The Sixth Annual World Trade Fair will open on May 11. 1962. Sponsored by the New York City Department of Commerce and Public Events. the fair is the largest in the Western Hemisphere and brings together peoples and ideas from more than 70 countries throughout the world. During times of international tension. trade fairs not only provide an opportunity for business and industry to exhibit their wares but also assist in bridging the gaps between nations. Smoother and more harmonious economic relations among all areas of the globe cannot help but be a major factor in achieving permanent peace. President Kennedy has said: I strongly believe that trade fairs. where new products are on view and where technical experience can be exchanged. axe a positive force for greater international understanding and for betterment of our lives. For the first time the fair will have an export section devoted to goods and services of American manufacturers who wish to sell in foreign markets. Thousands of businessmen from abroad attend and participate in this U.S. World Trade Fair each year. Thus the 1962 fair will display to these international visitors many American products designed for sale abroad. Expansion in our export trade is of especial importance to the United States today. To quote from the Presidents Economic Report to Congress on January 22. 1962: Persistent international payments deficits and gold outflows have made the balance of payments a critical problem of economic policy. We must attain a balance in our international transactions which permits us to meet heavy obligations abroad for the security and development of the free world. without continued depletion of our gold reserves or excessive accumulation of shortterm dollar liabilities to foreigners. To increase our exports is a task of highest priority. Expansion in our export trade. upon which at least 6 million U.S. jobs depend. is also vital from the standpoint of economic growth. And economic growth is necessary for the health of our domestic economy and for the fulfillment of our international commitments as leader of the free world. The World Trade Fair is important likewise in promoting tourism in the United States. With New York City as the focal point. there are in addition many other places of interest in this part of the New World. which our inter.national guests will undoubtedly wish to visit. I am pleased that New York City is contributing to the implementation of our international trade policy through sponsorship of the U.S. World Trade Fair. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support this joint resolution. An invitation from the President of the United States to other nations to participate will contribute greatly to the exchange of ideas. the development of our export trade. and greater international understanding."},{"1":"8.700307e+08","2":"1961","3":"S","4":"LONG","5":"597","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. President. on behalf of myself. and my colleague. the senior Senator from Louisiana . I introduce for appropriate reference. a bill to restate the terms of the grant covering the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge and Game Preserve to permit it to comply with current Louisiana law. On September 30. 1920. the Rockefeller Foundation donated approximately 85.000 acres of land in Cameron and Vermilion Parishes to the State of Louisiana. The act of donation of these lands. to be known as the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge and Game Preserve. contained among its stipulated conditions one that provided. in the event oils or minerals were discovered upon or under the donated lands. that the revenues from such oils and minerals mined and developed should be used. first. for the purpose of paying the maintenance expenses of the refuge and game preserve. Any surplus in revenues coming from such mining development should be used by the State of Louisiana for the development and improvement of that States public schools or public health wAork. Oil and gas leases have been granted on this land and now produce royalties. Meanwhile. article IV. section 2 of the constitution of the State of Louisiana of 1942. provided for the setting aside of 10 percent of the royalties received by the State from mineral leases on Stateowned lands for the construction of roads. highways. bridges. et cetera. in the parish producing the minerals. Under this provision of the State constitution. 10 percent of the royalties from the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge should be given to the parishes of Cameron and Vermilion for construction of roads. et cetera. except for the condition in the original donation by the Rockefeller Foundation. which required any revenues other than those used for maintenance of the refuge and game preserve to be used for public schools and public health. The bill I introduce today would authorize the State treasurer of Louisiana. who is presently unwilling to do so without the approval of the United States. to use and apply 10 percent of the Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge royalties for construction of roads and such in Cameron and Vermilion Parishes. as provided in the constitution of the State of Louisiana. and would waive any right of the United States to claim violation of the deed of donation because of such use and application of revenues. The Rockefeller Foundation on April 6. 1944. transferred to the United States all of its rights and interest in these lands. As to the proposal to use the revenues from these lands for purposes other than originally set down in the deed of donation. the Rockefeller Foundation. in a letter of May 31. 1960. to the office of the district attorney for the parish of Cameron. stated that it would not raise on its own initiative any question about the proposed use before any court or legislative body. Therefore. if the United States enacted this bill. waiving its rights to claim violation of the original deed of donation. then the State of Louisiana will be able to set aside 10 percent of the royalties from mineral production on Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge and Game Preserve. to be used by the parishes of Cameron and Vermilion for their own road. highway. bridge. and so forth. construction. There can be no doubt about it. if the grant had been made subsequent to the passage of the constitutional amendment that made 10 percent of the royalties go to a road fund. the grant would have been worded to include this. The bill I have introduced merely removes the technicality that prevents the State treasurer from complying with the State constitution with respect to fund raising from this land."},{"1":"8.602231e+08","2":"1960","3":"H","4":"HOLIFIELD","5":"2051","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Speaker. for 18 months. representatives from the United States. Great Britain. and the U.S.S.R. have been negotiating at Geneva. Switzerland. They have been exploring the possibility of a treaty agreement which would prohibit future testing of nuclear weapons. Because of the present technical difficulty of conducting tests in far off space. and the advanced capability for detecting tests which occur in near space and the atmospheric area. the main discussion has been on the problem of detecting underground tests. The Joint Committee on Atomic Energy deemed it to be in the public interest to explore the technical aspects of this problem. Representative MELVIN PRICE. chairman of the Subcommittee on Research and Development. and Representative CHET HOLIFIELD. chairman of the Subcommittee on Radiation. conducted joint hearings from April 19 to 22. 1960. The purpose of the hearings was to place all known technical facts regarding nuclear test detection and identification before the Congress and the public. We specifically excluded from testimony the policy of whether a test cessation was desirable or undesirable. Our mission was to collate and summarize pertinent testimony from experts in the fields of seismology. geography. electromagnetics. and weapons effects. as related to detection and verification through inspection techniques. It was appropriate to specialize on the phenomena of underground tests. as this poses the greatest and most urgent problem area at this time. Of additional concern is the problem of detecting nuclear tests in high altitudes and in space. which the hearings also covered. A great deal of research and development is likewise needed in these areas before we will have any assurance that a control system will work. We were careful to select the witnesses who had been most active and expert in conducting the underground nuclear tests in Nevada and the chemical underground tests in Louisiana. We also selected a balanced group of scientists with opposing views as to the desirability of conducting further tests. so we would avoid the charge of bias. For instance. it is well known that Dr. Edward Teller. Dr. Harold Brown. and others favor continued testing. It is also well known that Dr. Hans Bethe. Dr. Richard E. Roberts. Dr. Jay Orear. and Dr. Harold Urey are outspoken opponents of further nuclear testing. All of these witnesses and other expert witnesses from the commercial world of oil exploration. mining. and electrodynamics. were allowed complete freedom of expression during the hearings. They were allowed to challenge opposition testimony and invited to submit additional technical papers. It should be understood that the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is not charged with making or reviewing treaties in the nuclear weapons testing field. The executive branch of Government and another committee of Congress has this responsibility. The Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. however. is peculiarly fitted by experience and staff to develop and make known to departments of Government. the Congress. and the people the scientific facts related to atomic energy. The Joint Committee has carried out this type of function in various hearings during its existence. Extensive hearings on the effects of fallout from nuclearweapons tests. the biological and environmental effects of a nuclear war on earths population and environment. and the problem of radioactive waste disposal are instances of studies which are used as valuable textbooks in our educational. industrial. and scientific fields. We realize collections of facts are. or at least. should be. used for the formation of policy. It is true. however. unless facts are known. the formulation of policy in the political and diplomatic fields may lack the basis for understanding or justification. It is understandable that interpretation of the facts may vary the effect of newly discovered facts may not be welcome to negotiators who have obligated themselves to a preconceived position or objective. We note the acceptance by the United States and the United Kingdom negotiators of additional data developed by the Hardtack II series of tests in the fall of 1959 and the rejection of this data by the negotiators of the U.S.S.R. Scientific facts. nevertheless. are cold and dispassionate realities once they are established. They cannot be eliminated by refusing to recognize them. New scientific facts do not always lend themselves to the support of political or diplomatic positions. however desirable those positions may be to their advocates. The negotiations on nucleartests cessation have dragged along for 18 months in Geneva. The debate has been on a mixture of scientific and political problems that seem to be impossible of untangling. The scientific part of the problems have been based mainly on disagreement as to the capabilities for detecting and identifying hidden underground nuclear tests. The problems of inspection of suspicious events. the number of allowable inspection trips. procedures. drilling operations. logistical problems of supply and communications. and so forth. are. of course. most difficult. These problems have never been resolved. and in most instances they have been ignored. In view of the lack of understanding and the scarcity of reliable information in this field. the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy believed it was in the public interest to explore the subject matter. We reasoned it was important to collect the information from reliable sources and publish it so we could properly relate it to our diplomatic objections. What were the most important facts established and in general agreement by and between our witnesses? First. It was the unanimous opinion of all witnesses that a vigorous and sustained program of research and development is necessary to improve our instrumentation and our techniques of detection. identification. and inspection of nuclear explosion tests. The witnesses agreed that the Berkner panel report of over 1 year ago to the President had not been properly implemented in this regard. The socalled Berkner Panel. consisting of a number of eminent American scientists appointed in December 1958. by Dr. Killian. the Presidents special assistant for science and technology. recognized the original position taken by our scientists in 1958 on test detection capability was based on inadequate data and was wrong by at least a factor of four. They recommended an aggressive program or research to develop better detection devices and better techniques. Our witnesses testified these recommendations had not been carried out by the President. In March 1959. the Berkner Panel recommended a research and development program for 2 years which would cost $52.8 million. Testimony showed that over 1 year later. only $8.5 million had been allocated. and of this. only $5 million obligated. Testimony also reflected that although $60 million had been requested for the research and development program by those in the Defense Department having responsibility for its success. these urgently needed funds were not included as a line item in the Department of Defense fiscal year 1961 budget. To be available. the money would have to be taken from other projects or sources. Our committee brought these facts out in our hearings last month. We made available to the Executive Departmentthrough the State Department. the Defense Department. and the Atomic Energy Commissioncopies of the hearing transcripts and. as early as May 2. 1960. preliminary copies of our summary analysis of the hearings. We notified them. on May 5 and 6. 1960. our summary would be made available to the press on Saturday. May 7. for Monday. May 9. release. On May 7. 1960. the President hastened to announce that approximately $66 million would be required in fiscal year 1961 for implementing the Berkner Panel recommendations for improving our detection capability. We approve this recognition on his part and can only speculate why he did not recognize it as early as mid1959. when it was brought out by the panel. The delay is inexcusable in view of the known deficit of detection capability. and in view of its importance in connection with the nuclear test cessation negotiations. I will also be interested in seeing if. in addition to the delayed recognition. the President will now direct or authorize the Defense Department to request any of these funds as a line item supplemental appropriation. or must the money come from other also needed projects. Second. The testimony of both Dr. Hans Bethe and Dr. Edward Teller. established the fact that the cowboy series of chemical explosion tests in Louisiana had proven the decoupling theory. This new technique in reducing the telltale seismic vibrations of an underground explosion by factors up to 300. was admitted to be a fact by all the scientists present. This is accomplished by exploding a chemical or nuclear device in an underground cavity rather than in close proximity to surrounding earth. This is a most important scientific fact. It casts strong doubt on the theory of presently detecting tests of 20 to 30 kilotons. It destroys. for the present. the basis of our test cessation proposal if we relate it to our capability of detecting fully or partially decoupled 20kiloton tests by seismic recordings of 4.75 magnitude or higher. If the Soviets want to test tactical weapons of 1 to 10 kilotons. they can do so with impunity. without muffling under the Geneva control system as presently planned. Even with the recommended improvements in the Geneva system. it is going to be hard to identify unmuflied shots below 5 kilotons. But with decoupling or muffling. it makes the problem of detection and identification 10 to 300 times more difficult. With full decouplingmumflinga 10kiloton device can be made to register about 30 tons. Even with partial decoupling a 10kiloton shot can be made to register about 300 tons. This could be accomplished in a hole of approximately 115 feet in diameter. There was testimony that about 250 underground cavities have been constructed in the United States alone for storage of petroleum products ranging in size up to about 218 feet in diameter200.000 cubic yards. Larger cavities have been constructed for brine production in salt domes. Since the U.S.S.R. has salt domes and oilflelds. it is prudent to assume similar cavities exist in the U.S.S.R.. capable of being used for decoupling of nuclear underground tests. The seismic recordings resulting from these low energy explosion effects change completely the distances needed between detection stations and they raise tremendously the number of unidentified seismic events. We have been discussing with the Soviets the location of 21 detection stations in the U.S.S.R. They have not agreed to this number. Dr. Bethe testified instead of just 21 stations. we would now need 600 additional unmanned stations because of the new decoupling techniqueif we wanted to detect a 20 kiloton. fully decoupled. explosion. Dr. Bethe later changed the figure. by letter to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. to an estimate of 200. His letter will be printed in full in the hearings. A notation of his new estimate number was reported in our summaryanalysis. Dr. Richard E. Roberts of Carnegie Institute testified he believed at least 125 stations would be needed. In either event. the change in numbers of detecting stations in the U.S.S.R. is substantial and must become a serious fact for diplomatic consideration. Third. The scientific fact was established without contradiction that a whole new field of tactical nuclear weapons could be developed and proven feasible by nuclear testing up to a size of 20 kilotons. The committee did not consider one way or the other the desirability of developing additional lowyield nuclear tactical weapons. We were only concerned with the scientific facts relating to the problems of detecting and identifying tests of 20 kilotons or less and their technical significance in weaponry. Fourth. The cost of installing a control system and developing improved seismic and other detection devices to meet the problem of cheating. was not within even a near area of agreement. The estimates ranged from around a billion dollars to 5 billion or more dollars. The time period for such development ranged from 2 to 5 years. based on program priority and dollar support of the effort. It was also pointed out that the art of concealing testsof cheating--offered opportunities for improvement based on effort and dollars expended in that direction by a potential violator. In conclusion. let me assure you these facts are not to my personal liking. I cannot sweep them under the rug because of my hopes for a genuine program of disarmament and my fervent desire for peacea real peace and not a peace in our time. arrived at because of wishful thinking. ignorance of existing facts. or political expediency.

Fourth. I do not subscribe to nor even remotely consider the passage of effective antiracketeering legislation a vindictive assault on the labor movement and. as far as being interested in individual rights and democracy. let me say.

Mr. President. Imagine. if you can. what it would mean to this countryto all segments of our societyif we of the 84th Congress should be responsible for creating a farm market at least twice as great as any we ever have known. It can be done if we will legislate a program to take the blinders off. as it were. of our agricultural research and development program. and throw the full white light of technical research and development. experimentation. test facilities. pilot plants. and unexcelled American knowhow into an allout effort to create new industrial uses for just the everyday products of our land. First. of course. It would mean to the farmer a new life of productivity. It would provide prosperity for him. It would permit him to follow his natural Instinct to get everything he can out of his land. Second. it would create new jobs. Obviously. the demand for farm labor would increase. But its effect on industrial labor generally would be even more phenomenal. Entire new industries with millions of new jobs would come into beingindustries to manufacture new products. The demand for new transportation facilitiesautomobiles. trucks. buses. railroads. airlines. and so forthwould be tremendous. The demand for new farm machinery alone would provide an industrial and labor stimulus almost beyond our comprehension. Third. the increase in retail business would mount into the billions of dollars. Farmers. laborers. and. I am convinced. just about every other category of business customer in the United States would have more money to spend for just about everything business has to sell. Fourth. such a program would. in my opinion. mean the end of a tremendous tax burden now imposed to finance our vast agricultural assistance and storage programs of the momenta burden which we gladly bear as long as it is necessary. but a burden which all of us will agree would be a welcome deletion from our national budgets. If we can bring this aboutand I believe we canit would enable us to reduce taxes substantially and to make it easier to retire the national debt at a faster pace. Mr. President. the ramifications of such a plan are staggering. It is brand new. At the outset. it would cost a little moneybut. by comparison. only a drop in the bucket. After all. when it begins to cost more to repair your automobile. your tractor. or your furnace than a new one would cost. what do you do? You buy a new one. I say to you. Mr. President. that it is high time this Congress bought a new approach to the farm problem. in the form of this research and development plan. It meets the essential test. It is good for the farmer. It shows every promise of proving economically sound. It is. at the same time. good for all of the people. What would such a plan replace eventually? This year. our agricultural assistance programs will represent a total investment of three billion. four billion. or perhaps five billion dollars. Yet. that assistance program has contributed to the accumulation of some $9 billion in farm surpluses. for which not only has the Government paid with the taxpayers money. but which is costing in storage charges a million dollars a day-$365 million a year. By *means of this bill we are only asking for $100 million or less than onethird of the cost to store for 1 year the surplus agricultural commodities the Government of the United States now owns. At this point. I want to take full cognizance of the good work being done toward working out the surplus disposal problem. The Government has sold. or otherwise disposed of. much more of our surpluses than generally is known. I do not want to criticize the good work which has been done. but I am firmly convinced that the program should be expanded and accelerated. Whenever possible. more and more of our surpluses should be made available to the needy at home and elsewhere. I believe that program is being speeded up. It must be. Meantime. these surpluses hang over farm prices like a sword. They depress farm prices. This means lower farm income. It means less farmer spending for consumer goods. It means less tax revenue for the Government. And it means increased investments in agricultural assistance programs. The plan I am proposing would reverse that situation. It would insure the American farmer his rightful share of an otherwise bountiful prosperity. by requiring full production in an economy guaranteeing fair prices. It would put an end to the unsound practice of spending billions of dollars to preserve a bad situation. when a great deal less would provide a permanent cure. No. Mr. President. we cannot solve our farm problem permanently by curtailing production. We must increase consumption. we must find new markets. Since. generally speaking. the vast majority of our people are wellfed. our only alternative is to find new and increased industrial uses for our agricultural products. There is no question that this can be done. It is my opinion that the Department of Agriculture and our research and development people know enough now. so that. given a real opportunity to prove it. they can find industrial uses for 5 billion additional bushels of grain. such as corn. wheat. rye. barley. oats. rice. sorghum grains. and potatoes. each year. Let us remember that at present our total production of these grains is only about 6 12 billion bushels. This entails a total of 180 million acres of grain cultivation. If another 5 billion bushels are added to that. we can see what that would mean in terms of additional cultivation for the American farmers. Under capable and efficient management. the great chemical and oil industries of the United States. have found. through research. many new industrial and commercial uses for their products. They now make everything from rubber to clothing materials from chemicals. The plastics industry has had a phenomenal growth through research. All of this came about in the same degree as these companies invested their profits in research. You will agree that our more successful corporations spend millions of dollars each year seeking new and better products through research. * It is exactly this type of program which must be carried out in discovering new markets for farm products. Yet. no farmer or group of farmers can themselves afford to establish the vast laboratories necessary. to carry out that research. It is simply impracticable and impossible for 6 million individual farmers to get together to carry out the kind of research and development program required to keep agriculture abreast of the rest of the economy. Let me give you one example of a failure to keep pace with an important loss of consumption in farm products. Not so many years ago farm power was provided by horses and mules. This animal power consumed the production equivalent of some 80 million acres of feed grains. For lack of research. in my opinion. we have failed to produce a new market to take up the slack of that displaced production. We have fewer tillable acres in production today than we had 50 years ago. I think the tillable acres today are about 350 million. Fifty years ago. when the only power on the farm was horses and mules. the horses and mules consumed the equivalent of 80 million acres of feed grains. Therein lies the difference between our surplus today and full consumption. Mr. President. I come now to the point of proposing the most important program I ever have sponsored in my almost 12 years in the Senate of the United States. The United States must undertakeand undertake at oncea $100millionayear research and development program to find new and increased industrial uses for agricultural products. I send to the desk. for myself and other Senators. a bill to accomplish that purpose. On behalf of the Senator from Maryland . the junior Senator from Ohio . the senior Senator from Ohio . the Senator from Maryland . the junior Senator from Kansas . the Senator from South Dakota . the Senator from Illinois . the Senator from Idaho . the Senator from Vermont . the Senator from Nebraska . the Senator from New York . the Senator from Indiana . the Senator from Pennsylvania the Senator from South Dakota . the junior Senator from Maine . the Senator from Michigan . the Senator from Kansas . the Senator from New Jersey . the Senator from Idaho . the Senator from North Dakota . the Senator from New Jersey . the Senator from Connecticut . the senior Senator from Iowa . the junior Senator from Iowa . the Senator from Wyoming . the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. THYEl. the Senator from Connecticut . the Senator from New Hampshire . the Senator from Colorado . the senior Senator from Maine . the Senator from New Hampshire . the Senator from California . and the Senator from Wisconsin . I introduce for appropriate reference a bill to accomplish the purposes I have outlined. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the RECORD at this point as a part of my remarks."},{"1":"8.400205e+08","2":"1955","3":"H","4":"FOGARTY","5":"932","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. I think this is one of the most difficult appropriation bills to cut. It carries an appropriation this year of $2.337.000.000. It is $94.600.000 less than the total of the budget requests. and it is $94.200.000 less than was appropriated for the current fiscal year 1955. It is one of the most important appropriation bills because it deals with human beings. It affects all American citizens. not only in their health and welfare. but it gives protection to all those who work for a living in this country. An additional reason is that there is a oneline item in the bill that amounts to 60 percent of the $2.337.000.000. the item for public assistance. This item amounts to $1.400.000.000 which we did not cut a dime because of the statutes we are operating under. When the States approve claims for public assistance. we have no alternative but to match funds on the basis provided by the Social Security Act. As a result of the hearings. during which those in charge of the program told us this figure perhaps will fall $50 million short of meeting these requirements. the committee had no other choice but to allow the full amount of $1.400.000.000. In the first part of the report you will notice we have a paragraph regarding civil defense. We had a request from the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. asking for $1.600.000 for civil defense activities. We have cut this item out entirely because the committee believes that the Civil Defense Administration should keep all their eggs in one basket and not ask every agency of the Government to request the Congress. on a piecemeal basis. to appropriate money for civil defense. We say in our report that the Civil Defense Administration should go to the appropriate subcommittee on appropriations and justify their entire budget before that committee. We did the same thing with regard to defense mobilization activities. for which we received a request from the Department of Labor. We told them the same thing in denying all funds for defense mobilization. We cut the Department of Labor items quite substantially. For the Secretarys Office we allowed a couple of small increases. We allowed most of the request for $173.000 to make a study of those over 45 years old seeking employment. That is a problem that is going to continue to get bigger. and we are not doing anything about it. So the committee allowed an appropriation for the Secretary of Labor to study this problem and to make recommendations to the Congress next year. We also allowed most of a $40.000 request for a program to Improve the skills of the American worker in this country. For the Office of Solicitor we allowed a slight increase. For the Bureau of Labor Standards we also allowed a slight increase. We gave to the Bureau of Veterans Reemployment Rights the sum of $346.000. a reduction of $46.000 from the request and an increase of $46.000 above the appropriation for 1955. For the Bureau of Apprenticeship we gave an increase of $50.000 above the appropriation for 1955. We also told them to use this $50.000 in the field and not here in Washington where they requested it. We cut grants to States for unemployment compensation and employment service administration by $280.000. This is actually a larger cut than it seems because we raised the contingency fund to $20 million. As you know. the contingency fund can be used only for three specific things. that is increased workloads that they could not foresee when they prepared their budget. an increase in State salaries. and increases in work loads because of changes in State law that may take place in the future. Even though that is some decrease in the base appropriation. they will have $5 million more than they have this year to operate with. Now. we show a fairly substantial deduction in the Department of Labor. but most of it occurred in two items. One was the unemployment compensation for veterans. We are providing $120 million. but that is a $30 million reduction which was made because the most up to date statistics we have indicate that the $120 million will be enough to carry out this program this year. The same thing applies to the appropriation for unemployment compensation for Federal employees. This is a new law which became effective last January. We provided $10 million in the supplemental bill for this fiscal year. 1955. and the present bill includes $20 million. It is a reduction of $20 million from what they asked for. but we believe. on the testimony that was presented. that this will be enough to carry them through We show a little decrease in the Mexican farmlabor program. because that law expires the end of December this year. If it is extended. as most people think it will be. we will be back here recommending a supplemental appropriation for the last half of the fiscal year. In the Bureau of Employees Compensation there is an increase of $117.000 for investigation of claims for compensation by Federal workers. In the Bureau of Labor Statistics we allowed three increases amounting to $500.000 in total. They asked for increases totaling $1.495.000.

I want to discuss the security provisions of H. R. 9757. I believe my colleagues in the House are familiar with my interest in the broad field of security in all its varied aspects. My experience in the Government service. in the military service. and in my service on the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy has given me an opportunity to study the problem of securityin terms of its statutory foundation. its procedural structure. and its effectiveness in practice. The joint committee has a Subcommittee on Security. The gentleman from Ohio and the gentleman from California both serve on this subcommittee. It has been my honor and privilege to serve as chairman of this subcommittee. Senator PASTORE and Senator CORDON are the other members. We have given the security aspects of this bill the closest possible study. Every line has been carefully gone over with the experts who have direct responsibilities in the field of security. More important than our study of the bill. or at least of basic importance in terms of our competence to judge this bill. is the continuing review and close scrutiny given to the practice of security since the McMahon Act went into effect. I have not served on the joint committee during this entire period. but I have never ceased to give the matter my closest attention. Chapter 12 of H. R. 9757. composed of six sections. modernizes the security provisions of the existing act. passed in 1946 and reflecting the attitudes of that period as to the exclusiveness of Americas position in the field of atomic energy. Chapter 18. dealing with enforcement. makes more practical and realistic the provisions for effectively maintaining adherence to the security provisions of the bill. and establishes a better legal foundation for enforcing the security measures. As a matter of fact. the objectives of making practical and realistic the security provisions of the act characterize every change we have made from existing law. I would like to recall to your minds. since I am sure my colleagues have gone over the report accompanying this billReport No. 2181the discussion of this allimportant security problem appearing on page 23 of the report. I want to touch briefly on each section of this chapter. but before doing so. I would like to summarize the security accomplishments of this bill. I say accomplishments advisedly. not only because of the very merit of the proposed language but also because of the improvement effected in the Commissions security operations. The new language will give the Commission needed flexibility in specific fields. and assures the American people that the expansion of the whole business of atomic energyin both domestic and international aspectscan be carried out with adequate protection for the security interests of the United States. A major accomplishment of H. R. 9757 is to clear up a situation which has plagued both the Commission and all of the military services since the passage of the act. We have made several attempts in the past to cure this problem by legislation. Nearly 8 years of experience underlie these changes. The problem has been acute during the last 4. as the military services have intensified and expanded their competence. their training effort and their preparedness in the field of atomic weapons. What was once a unique and limited weapon for use only under conditions of very high and very narrow policy determinationsdue to scarcityis now a central item of ordnance in the total complex of weapons systems. Let me give you an example of why the changes proposed in H. R. 9757 are so important. This is a hypothetical case. of course. but not necessarily so. Put yourself in the position of an ordnance technician employed by a Department of Defense contractor developing a guided missile. One of the specifications. set up by the Defense Department. is that the missile must be able to carry an atomic warhead. Can you go direct to the nuclearweapon designers. who are employees of the Commissions contractors in the weapons field? They have a socalled topsecret clearance and so do you. You need to know about the shape and size and weight distribution of the nuclear warhead which your missile is to carry. The present law says you cannot talk to the Commissions contractor unless you have been investigated by the FBI or the Civil Service Commission and cleared by the Commission. Not just cleared by the Department of Defense. even though you may have been investigated a dozen times and tested by every personnelsecurity procedure known to the Department of Defense. You may have handled the most sensitive information in the Nations whole defense setup for years but. unless you have also been through the parallel channels of clearance established by law for AEC contractors. you cannot talk to your fellow weapons expert in the AEC setup. H. R. 9757 clears this matter up. The Commissions contract employer can talk to you upon receipt and notification to your employer of the Department of Defense certification as to your clearance. As matters stand now. this type of information could be given to you only through a third party officially cleared by both of the contracting agencies. The awkwardness and waste in such a procedure is obvious. for the duplication of investigations and clearance actions is costly and unnecessary. The safeguards surrounding the exchange of information with our allies are of vital importance. But they are realistic. As matters stand now. General Gruenther. when wearing his hat as Commander of Allied Forces in Europe. cannot tell his British chief of fighter aircraftassuming he has a British chief directing fighteraircraft operationsGeneral Gruenther cannot even tell him the basic weapon effects needed in the employment of the types of atomic bombs which fighter aircraft can carry. When the general put on his hat as commander of the American forces. he can talk freely to his American staff about the things the fieldoperations commanders need to know. The proposed bill will assist the NATO commander in this regard. It permits the transmission. under rigid safeguards. of the information required for the military employment of the weapon. It specifically forbids. since there is no need for transmission of such information. all data about the design and manufacture of the weapon and the nuclear materials involved. The bill provides the same flexibility in connection with the operations of our own forces. It permits the removal. as the Commission and the military may agree. the removal from the statutory restraints of restricted data of that information relating to the size. weight. shape. and ballistic characteristics of atomic weapons and provides for the continuing protection of such data under military security regulations. Just as the restricted data security requirements provide for one kind of protection of research and development and manufacturing operations. the military security regulations provide protection of another kind to meet the differing conditions of military operations. Heretofore. we have tried to impose the Commissions statutory security standards on information of military operations with respect to information primarily of importance to the military. Needless to say. both the Commission and the Department of Defense are very anxious to have this matter cleared up. We are assured that the language in section 142 will do this. Should it be necessary for me to speak later in more detail on these sections of this bill which deal with the operations of the security system. I will do so. but in order to expedite the business before the House. I suggest you first check the report. I believe you will find it very complete on this point. The last point I will touch on Is the authority given to the Commission to make a determination as to the degree of sensitivity of various types of restricted data. Again. an example might help. During the building of one of the gaseous diffusion plants. there comes a stage when enough equipment is on the floor that a competent engineer or scientist in the field of isotope separation by gaseous diffusion could gain some knowledge of the output of such a plant. That is. he could see the size of the motors and compressors and examine the layout of the plant to get some idea of the volume of flow of the gases. Of course. he would have it for only the one bay. or wing. of the plant. Now. under the present law. the expert welders who have to put this vast system together. but who do not see any plans. specifications. production data. nor do they get anywhere near nuclear materials. and who work under the closest possible and very vital technical supervision and directionthese people have to go through the same security procedure as the top scientists who design the weapons themselves. The cost in time and dollars is obvious. � I want to assure my colleagues of the adequacy and effectiveness of the protective features of the bill. But there is one more item of major. importance. The joint committee has long been of the opinion that the most effective security is attained only if the areas of information requiring protection are held down to include only that information which positively needs protection. H. R. 9757 constitutes an unequivocal directive to the Commission to maintain continuous review of all classified information and to declassify and publish scientific and technical data which can be published without undue risk to the common defense and security. The bill. of course. continues. and I believe improves. the policy declarations with respect.to the Commissions obligations to control of information in such manner as to assure the common defense and security. and with respect to the dissemination of technical information essential to scientific and industrial progress and public understanding and to expand and enlarge the Nations reservoir of scientific knowledge available to all our teachers and research workers."},{"1":"8.300165e+08","2":"1953","3":"H","4":"VELDE","5":"2214","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. it has alway been my desire and earnest attempt to answer personally every item of mail which comes to my office. whether it be from my own district or elsewhere in the United States. In recent weeks an immense volume of correspondence has come to me by letter. telegram. postal card. and so forth. and even my already overworked office staff finds it impossible to acknowledge each communication properly. This correspondence largely has to do with the question of communism. subversion. and the investigations and hearings of the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities. It is my intention to determine the contents of these communications and I hope to reply to each one by the sending out of reprints of my statements here today. I would like to say that it is heart warming and a source of tremendous personal satisfaction to me to note the surge of interest on the part of my correspondents in the problem of. Communists operating in the various free American institutions. I hope that the thousands of alert and loyal Americans who have taken the trouble to write to me personally. or as the chairman of the House Committeeon UnAmerican Activities. will bear with me in this method of acknowledging their correspondence. I feel I can do more justice to their inquiries by taking up the majority of their questions and suggestions one by one and answering in this manner.

I made no such proposal on my own behalf. neither did I make a proposal as chairman of the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities that a general investigation be made of communism in religious fields. My only statements. as shown by a transcript obtained from Mutual Broadcasting System and quoted below. were that it was entirely possible that committee investigators might make inquiry concerning some individual Communists and exCommunists in the religious field.

The committee is operating upon the explicit direction and is under obligation to the Congress of the United States to investigate subversive activities and propaganda under Public Law 601. In charging the committee with this duty the Congress did not indicate or direct that such. investigation should be only those which are nationally popular. It must be recognized that in practically every field of investigation. even those individuals who may not come within the scope of investigation feel a certain stigma attached to them because of those traitors and subversives within their field.

I would like to say that as the investigations and hearings proceed the record will speak for itself and will be disseminated to all interested persons through the medium of printed hearings as soon as possible. Also in this connection I would again like to reiterate the statements that I have made on numerous occasions that the committee is not investigating colleges and universities--that it is investigating individual members in that field who are now or who have been members of the Communist Party. There need be no fear that the investigation being conducted by the committee will in any way abridge academic freedom or place an undue burden upon any college or organization composed of educators if they are working honestly and forthrightly in their important field. It is not my desire. or that of the committee. that the word communism or Marxism become an unspeakable term in any American institution. I feel that every American youth should know the honest truth about communism and Marxism. I do not feel that a Communist can deal with this honestly or objectively. I sincerely feel that there is a very grave distinction between the instruction in communism and the indoctrination in communism. No. 7.

I am greatly encouraged for the future of America by the loyalty to American principles shown in these letters. as well as the confidence in the work of the various investigative committees. our Chief Executive. and the various agencies operating under him. I appreciate the kind comments concerning my appearances. as well as the constructive criticism contained in the letters and intend to make use of all suggestions. .I want to assure you the work of the House Committee on UnAmerican Activities will go forward with no slackening of effort or lessening of zeal. Let us be thankful to God that we are still under a form of government which makes possible the writing of these letters without fear of being thrown into concentration camps or being purged.

I yield myself 15 minutes. The amendment which I propose to the amendment of the Senator from Virginia attempts to strike a middleoftheroad policy in order to deal with the difficult and critical situation with which the Nation is today faced. Today America stands without any protection whatsoever against any kind of crippling. paralyzing strike that might occur in any of our national or indispensable war industries. in our utilities. or in our railroad services. or in any other services on which our security and health as a nation depend. . 910 The impact of the Supreme Court decision wiped away the last vestige of executive power which might have been implied or assumed to deal with the paralyzing situation in which the Nati3n finds itself as a result of the steel strike. Or the kind of situation in which it might find itself as the result of a utility strike. a railroad strike. or many other types of labor crises. I believe that the Supreme Court properly called the attention of Congress to the fact that the power should rest in Government. and undoubtedly does rest in Government. to save the country frcm such situations. But it also held that in making use of such power the Congress is the only branch of the Government which can grant such power. that the Executive cannot legislate. and that the Congress should do so if we expect to prevent such a situation from happening. I tried my best in this amendment to reach a middleoftheroad position. I do not believe that the amendment will be popular with either management or labor. In fact. it is designed solely to protect the public of the United Saes. our military efforts. and our men fighting overseas. without regard to which union they belong to. or whether they belong to the National Association of Manufacturers or the United States Chamber of Commerce. This is action which I believe is necessary. I believe that- the Defense Production Act on which we are working is the last chance Congress will have to speak and legislate during this session. Briefly. I should like to explain the mechanics of seizure. for which this bill provides. when all collectivebargaining arrangements prove unavailing. when whatever tools the President felt. were necessary and could be expeditiously used for the settlement of such a crisis have been used without result. Then. with respect to any defense plants. industries. or utilities which are indispensableand I ask Senators to bear in mind that qualificationto the Nations health and security and to our military efforts in behalf of other nations. the President may give 7 days notice of intent to seize the struck facility or facilities. The reason for the 7 days notice is to encourage the every effort at collective bargaining. The 7 days notice of intention to seize is a drive forward in a lastminute effort to bring the union and management together to settle their own difficulties before seizure takes place. If such effort is unavailing. 2 days before seizure the President must notify the Congress. which must be in session. In other words. if he intends to seize a facility which is important enough to our national defense to require seizure. then before it can be seized he must assemble the Congress in session. if it be not then in session. Within those 2 days the Congress. by concurrent resolution. may prevent the seizure of the facilities. Or. if it does not act within the 2 days. within 15 days thereafter. by concurrent resolution. the Congress can veto. override. and overturn the Presidents seizure of the facilities and direct that the facilities which have been seized be turned back to their owners. I believe that that provision safeguards the system of checks and balances in the extraordinary processes of law which we recognize. are necessary for the national good under the conditions which the emergency creates. Furthermore. this amendment protects both industry and labor. Such seizure as may take place may continue only for a period of 80 days. After 80 days the Congress must extend the period of seizure by concurrent resolution. or. if the Congress be not in session at the expiration of 80 days. then within the first 15 days after the reconvening of Congress the seizure period must be extended by concurrent resolution. This provision gives an added impetus to genuine collective bargaining because it brings about a period of time within which labor and management can say. Seizure is terminating after 80 days. Let us get together and decide these issues through collective bargaining. Subject to all the qualifications and safeguards which have been mentioned. we provide that industry shall receive just compensation under the Constitution for any losses which occur during the period of Government operation. That protects the management side against seizure without due process of law. and awards it just compensation under our Constitution and system of laws. I do not agree that management should be allowed to neglect bargaining in good faith. thereby forcing into seizure necessary facilities in order that the Government may freeze wages and working conditions of labor over a long period of seizure. � So I provide in this amendment for a special emergency board. whose members are to be confirmed by the United States Senate. whose duty it will be to fix temporary wages for labor under Government seizure. We employ a cost of living index. in comparison with .costofliving increases since the last collectivebargaining agreement arrived at between industry and labor. That will provide a yardstick to measure any adjustment of wages or working conditions which the emergency board. confirmed by the Senate. may put into effect during Government seizure. The Board is specifically prohibited from recommending or putting into effect any changes in the union shop conditions of the plant. because we do not believe that during Government seizure any board or Government agency should have the right to change this type of union organization. However. I feel that under the operations of the Wage Board labor has a right to receive increases in wages corresponding to costofliving increases during the period of seizure. It is only fair to protect labor in that way. Mr. President. I should like to invite attention to a small difference between my amendment and the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Oregon [Mr. MoRsE.l. They are very similar in many respects. but my amendment amends the Selective Service and Universal Military Training Act. That makes this provision emergency legislation. so that when an emergency occurs within an emergencyin other words. if the crisis is severe enough to justify drafting the men of America to fight and die in Koreawe should have the right. as a Congress. to expect full production of steel and other goods to supply the men whom we send into combat through selective service. There is a long list of precedents under the Selective Service Act. I should like to call attention to a few precedents involving seizure to support the Selective Service System. Governmentplaced orders must take precedence over all other production schedules. That provision is in the act. If a person fails to carry out such an order. the President is authorized to take immediate possession of the facility or facilities involved. in order to insure production of the needed article. Furthermore. it is made the duty of the steel industry under the Selective Service Act to furnish the amounts of steel needed for production of articles ordered. in accordance with previous sections. and provision is made for seizure of steel plants if such production is not carried out. In enacting the Selective Service Act. Congress decided that the Government could take a portion of industrys production to support Selective Service. But when the entire production of an industry is shut down. are we going to be so cowardly and fearful as to refuse to give the President the tools which every man knows are necessary to put the giant of American steel production back into our war effort?"},{"1":"8.200140e+08","2":"1951","3":"H","4":"SABATH","5":"1477","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. day before yesterday I was requested by the American Heart Association to appear on a television program. I accepted. I made a few short observations. but I did not have time to elaborate on what I intended to say. Mr. Speaker. on Tuesday evening. January 27. in furtherance of the cause of the American Heart Association. I appeared on the television program Life Begins at 80. Among the questions propounded to me was this: What do you consider the most important issue facing our country? I stated that in my opinion the threat of war and the high cost of living were the most serious questions in the minds of the people today. Owing to the limited time accorded me. I was not able to fully give my views and to make clear my position on the important question of peace. However. I did state that I naturally agreed with our President. that his aim is to bring about peace. If time had permitted I would have stressed the point that in the interest of peace. warring nations. after cessation of hostilities or an armistice. had always gathered together around the conference table in an effort to work out peace terms. That very thing is being done today to bring about final peace terms with our late enemy. treacherous Japan. who. without any justification or warning. attacked us at Pearl Harbor. Every American condemned this dastardly act. Today. we are continuing to negotiate final peace terms with this former enemy. The same situation applies to the Hitlerite Nazis whom we are now endeavoring to rehabilitate in every conceivable way. notwithstanding their barbarous. brutal. inhuman atrocitiesyes. criminal deeds against humanity. And. yet. we are also negotiating peace terms with them. while extending relief and aid to the industrialists who built up Hitler. who hold control of the cartels that cost the American people millions upon millions of dollars yearly. In view of the above. why should we not make a real honesttoGod effort to negotiate peace with the one nation that threatens the peace of the world today. as we are doing with those nations who. as I said. wantonly and murderously attacked usand do so before the killing and destruction takes place. We have enough unbiased. honest. loyal. patriotic Americans who would be willing to assume this responsibility. who are not controlled by the war profiteers and militaristic groups. This is the course we should take instead of preparing for war and spending billions upon billions of dollars of the taxpayers money for that purpose. I repeatevery effort should be made to bring about the adjustment of differences that would involve us in a destructive war and actually try to come to some agreement for disarmament instead of rearmament. before the killing and maiming and destruction takes place. General Sherman made the famous statement War is hell. The New York JournalAmerican of Tuesday. February 27. carried some pictures from the battlefront in Korea on its picture page. and the heading over the pictures read: Wars a dirty businessMud. blood. and tears. Nothing I might say would add to the realistic and gruesome descriptions of war by General Sherman and the headline mentioned above. Every word contained in both is all too true. I might add. however. that it is not only the tears of the wounded at the front and the sufferihg and sacrifices they endure. but the heartaches. anxiety. worry. and grief that comes to the millions of mothers. wives. and loved ones at home. In addition to the grieving over the boys on the fighting front. these parents and relatives. as well as the rank and file of the people at home. are confronted with the constantly mounting cost of living which has reached the highest peak in all history at this moment. Soaring living costs always go along with preparations for war or actual war. with its resultant ill effects on the mental and financial wellbeing of our workers and their families. Confusion confounded inevitably results from placing price ceilings on foods and the necessities of life. with wages usually controlled and unable to meet the higher home budget. while other items. such as scrap iron which is not digestible by the people but is palatable to the steel interests in their operations. have their prices rolled back. thus adding to the excess profits of the warmongers. There are many who are charging President Truman with responsibility for the situation today. instead of placing the blame where it belongsat the door of Joe Stalin and on those war profiteers and militarists who have been advising. urging. and demanding that he follow their recommendations. I hesitate but cannot help say that behind this nefarious group can be found the billionaire corporations that are again accumulating millions upon millions of profits out of the warpreparedness program. As far as the military are concerned. only the favored and influential youth are appointed to West Point and the Naval Academ5 where they are educated and cared for at Government expense. Once they become members of the military caste they are never obliged to worry about taxes. the high cost of living. housing problems. or any of the other worries that beset the average working man because they are taken care of for life by a beneficent government. Having a fair knowledge of world history. I have been. and am now. opposed to militarization which invariably at all times has been responsible for wars. That is all the military knows. that is all they thrive on These same leaders and politicians constantly condemn the bureaucrats in Washington. They ignore the fact that nearly all of the principal bureaucrats today are Republicans. such as Mr. Charles E. Wilson. president of General Electric. Gen. Lucius Clay and William H. Draper. former vice president of Dillon Read & Co.. both of whom were connected with the American military government in Germany. William H. Harrison. of American Telephone & Telegraph. Eric Johnston. former president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. and such men as John Foster Dulles. Ripublican advisor to Gov. Thomas E. Dewey. exRepublican Senator Warren 71. Austin. representative to the United Nations. and many others connected with the giant banking interests and big business. There are others from Big Steel. General Motors. the utility interests whose profits reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars each year. It is these men who are largely responsible for our present predicament. Then too. Mr. Speaker. I feel we should no longer follow the diplomatic policies of Great Britain. who. from time immemorial. have played a doubledealing game with all nations. eventually unloading upon us. with the use of our money. all of their foreign involvement. making us share the burdens of controlling her possessions. In furtherance of the real objective of world peace. I have advocated and shall continue to work for the strengthening of the United Nations as the one great bulwark against aggression and war. While the charter of the United Nations may have its weaknesses. I am convinced that it can be made the most powerful instrument for peace yet devised. Mr. Speaker. unfortunately in this enlightened age. instead of following the Biblical precept of turning sabers into plowshares. we are turning plowshares into sz:bers. I realize that the militaristic groups who thrive on wars. such as the munitions makers and war profiteers. are the sole beneficiaries and gainers by wars. Their loved ones are not found in the fox holes and mud holes or in the front lines. nor do they lose their limbs from freezing. their minds from heat. or their bodies wracked with bullets. They are seen in swivel chairs. far removed from conflict or danger. Therefore I know that I speak for at least 98 percent of the American people who are praying and hoping for peace and who suffer anguish and fear for their loved ones in the thought that we might again become involved in fighting another war. So that I may not be misunderstood. though I extremely desire peace. if our country at any time should be endangerd I am ready to vote once more for war. but not until I am satisfied that every effort has been made to bring about peace before such action is necessary. Mr. Speaker. in conclusion I want to repeat and stress again. with all the force at my command. that our duty today is to strive for the settlement of world problems. to ensure lasting peace for all mankind. before the killing and maiming of humanity and the destruction of property and possessions takes place. Peace should come before warnot after. I ask unanimous consent that I may extend my remarks so as to make plain what I started to say and what I intended to say in the few short minutes that I had on this television program."},{"1":"8.102899e+08","2":"1950","3":"H","4":"YATES","5":"107","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I should like to refer the gentlemans attention to subsection (b) on the second page. where the gentleman says: It shall be unlawful regardless of any contract. agreement. or other obligation. for any person knowingly to pay for any labor a wage in excess of the ceiling applicable in respect of such labor.

I think hemight very well conclude that this bill To extend the coverage of the oldage and survivors insurance system. to increase certain benefits payable under such system. and for other purposes. really concentrates on the other purposes. The extension of coverage to State and local employees and employees of nonprofit institutions is voluntary withthe employer. and benefits would be computed on a grossly inadequate formula. The other purposes include the deprivation of coverage of some 750.000 emlloyees now entitled to coverage. The end result looks like a RepublicanNAM compromise. The Republican Eightieth Congress can - claim that it has enacted a social security bill providing for some extension of coverage. and the National Association of Manufacturers can point with pride that their lobbyists have been able to prevent.extension of coverage among the employees of a single major group of private employers. Mr. Speaker. I have summarized the bad features of H. R. 6777. In contrast with the paltry. pitiful pittances with which oldage and survivors insurance beneficiaries and oldage assistance recipients now seek to stave off starvation and inflation is the program of the President on social security which he has repeatedly requested this Congress to enact. On May 24. 1948. the President submitted five essential proposals which should be enacted yet at this session of Congress. They are the following: � First. More adequate benefits under oldage and survivors insurance. 1948Second. Extended coverage for oldage and survivors insurance. Third. Extended coverage for unemployment insurance. Fourth. Insurance against loss of earnings due to illness and disability. Fifth. Improved public assistance for the needy. Mr. Speaker. I have today introduced a bill to accomplish what I believe the President had in mind. although I cannot say that my bill conforms in specific details. When H. R. 6777 is considered by the House. I shall seek to qualify to offer my bill as a motion to recommit in order to give the Members of the House an opportunity to express themselves for or against an adequate socialsecurity program. The principal provisions of my bill are: First. Coverage: My bill would extend coverage to all workers included in the committee bill. as well as the selfemployed. including smallbusiness men and professional people. domestic servants. and men and women in our armed services. The total number of workers whose families would thus become entitled to socialsecurity protection would be approximately 11.000.000. Second. Increase in oldage and survivors insurance benefits: A change in the method of computing benefits would substantially increase average benefits. Moreover. the minimum monthly insurance benefit payable to a married couple would be increased to $30 and the maximum monthly benefit payable to a retired beneficiary and his family or his survivors would be raised from $85 to $150. This latter change would help large families with three or more children. Third. Retirement age for women: My bill would reduce the retirement age from 65 to 60 for women employees. widows. wives. and mothers.. Fourth. Disability Insurance: In line with the recommendation of the President and the Senate Advisory Council on Social Security. I have included a program of disability insurance to cover the hazards of unemployment from sickness or other disability. Fifth. Financing: The tax rate upon selfemployed persons covered by my bill would be one and onehalf times the rate paid by employees. This agrees with the Senate Advisory Council recommendation. Sixth. Public assistance: My bill would provide Federal aid for all needy persons on a basis ranging from 50 to 75 percent of total costs. depending on the relative per capita income of the States. Standards of assistance would be left to the States without maximum limitations specified by the Federal Government. Present limitations upon receipt of public assistance by the aged. blind. and dependent children would be eased In the Interest of an adequate Nationwide system of public assistance. Mr. Speaker. my bill would provide a program under which beneficiaries of oldage and survivors insurance can really survive. and recipients of oldage assistance can. at least. exist.

All of the members of our subcommittee came to the conclusion that this legislation was essential and urgent. and that the persons named above should in their order succeed to the Presidency in the event of the removal. resignation. death. or inability of the President and Vice President to act. The important question developed was whether or not the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate are civil officers as defined by the Constitution of the United States.

Now. let us see what is going to be the remedy. You have more than $27.000.000.000 in circulation now. I have the last report in my pocket. I keep it there. but I use this one of the 31st of July. The last one was issued on the 30th of September. It shows that we have $27.825.000.000 in circulation. All right. what are you going to do? I know a certain element of these money changers Who are international financiers. are more interested in their holdings in foreign countries than they are in your prosperity and mine. They are going to insist on a deflation of the currency. I was surprised to hear Members of the Congress get up here and talk about inflation. the threat of inflation. Why. the poor fellows did not know it. but we already have inflation. We have over four timesmore than six timesas much money as we had in 1930. We already have inflation. Now. what are we going to do? If they begin to deflate that currency. what will happen? We - have a national debt of about $300.000.000.000. The only way in Gods world you will ever pay that debt is to let prices rise to the level of your money supply multiplied by the velocity of its circulation. You cannot do that by raising the piice ofsteel or raising the wages of the steelworkers and leaving the farmers down in the ditch. So you have to do one of two things: You have to take away these artificial restrictions that should have been taken away the day the war closed and let farm prices ri.. to their economic levels. you have to tear from the industrial plants of the Nation the greedy hands of the labor racketeers. who are not interested in the prosperity of the country so much as they are in their own power. and let economic prices level off and adjust themselves. In that way there will be enough national income to carry on this Government and pay the interest and the sinking fund on the national debt. But you let these longdistance patriots. who want to abolish the United States in order to set up a super world government to be financed by us. do away with your national sovereignty. you let them get control and see what they do to this money. They will immedi- ately begin to withdraw from circulation and drive the currency down and down and down. and with it will go prices and with it will go the national income. until you plunge into economic chaos. Then what will happen? You think those boys that are being held in uniform today. those young men who went out and fought and won this war. are going to stand for that? Do you think they are going to pay a $300.000.000.000 debt on a $20.000.000.000 income? Do you think they are going to pay a debt made on $27.000.000.000 of circulation with $4.090.000.000 or $5.000.000.000 in circulation? Do you think they are going to take the last crumb of bread from the mouths of their wives and children to pay the national debt? If you do. you do not know human nature. I will tell you what will happen. You will have some fellow rise up. probably out on we will say the Wabash. somewhere out in the center of the country. They will call him a longhaired agitator. He will say. If I am elected President of the United States I will repudiate those bonds. There is your danger. Just as surely as the night follows the day. if you let Eugene Meyer and the crowdhe trained with in the twenties do exactly what they did then and drive the currency down and down until farm prices go below the cost of production. breadlines stretch down the streets of your cities. and a wave of suicides sweep over the land. if you do that then you will have some man rise up and say. Why should we continue to pay this? Make me President of the United States and I will wipe it out. He will probably be elected. It happened in a State once.

Without disclosing to the taxpayers that it was money out of their pockets which moved the surplus wheat and cotton out of the United States. the New Deal loudly proclaimed to the public that * these exports were the result of the operation of the trade treaties. The irony of all this propaganda. extolling the virtue of the tradetreaty program is that surpluses of farm products increased. Furthermore. agricultural exports have declined. and in the fiscal year 1939 agricultural exports as a percentage of total exports reached the lowest point in the history uf the United States. Rather than let the public know the extent of the failure of the tradetreaty program. every possible deceptive device has been used to make it appear in a favorable light. The New Deal under its inept leadership. having gradually blocked every export outlet. turned to Government speculation in farm products. and even pegged prices above world levels. Then facing failure at a time when the Reciprocal Trade Treaty Act would have to be renewed. the Commodity Credit Corporation wheeled its loan battery into action. Althougi_ widely advertised as a selfsupporting program. the real truth is that as of January 1. 1940. taxpayers had already contributed $214.000.000 to restore the impaired capital losses the Corporation had suffered between the fiscal years 1934 and 1939. Here let me present the -bureaucratic or interdepartmental stupidity raised to the nth degree. Just listen to this: The Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation. during the fiscal years 1938 and 1939. spent $30.479.112 for the surplus removal operations of 20 commodities. yet the State Department reduced the tariff on many of these commodities 50 percent. Please listen. Over the same period. imports of these same commodities were valued at $92.298.000. We have heard the freetrade bureaucrats and the New Deal Democrats rave about the inequities of the HawleySmoot Act. They refer to it as the cause of war. pestilence. and famine. yet. after being in full control of both branches of Congress since 1933. not a move has been made to repeal this tariff act. As far back as 1931. you Democrats were in control of Congress. which was prior to the advent of the New Deal. at which time Henry T. Rainey was Democratic majority leader. When reminded by a Republican Member that the Democrats had promised that. if elected. they would lower the tariff rates in the HawleySmoot Tariff Act. he hurled this defiant reply: Lower the tariff drastically? You Republicans will not do it. and we Democrats dare not do it with conditions as they are. We do not want this market flooded with the products of cheap labor in other countries. To still rail against a tariff act. knowing full well that the New Deal administration has had the necessary majority in both branches of Congress with which to repeal the act of 1930. is the rankest kind of hypocrisy. There is nothing that has appeared on the surface of our national affairs which more clearly demonstrates the danger to representative government than to have half truths as well as false statements relating to public questions disseminated by an internationalminded propaganda organization. The irony of it is that the taxpayers of the United States are financing such a propaganda organization to the extent of $27.000.000 annually. A highly organized group of foreign experts. bent on the ruination of our foreign trade and prestige among nations. if left undisturbed to their cunning and treacherous devices. could not have done more than was done by those who. in desperation. sought to build up our export figures by suffering and permitting the shipment of scrap iron. copper. tin. oil. gasoline. machine tools. and other essential war materials to our potential enemies. It was known. of course. that the war materials exported to Japan were to be used to murder our friends the Chinese. furthermore. the vast amount of the shipments of such war materials. in the light of developing events. should have put this administration on inquiry. But even the exports to Japan from the United States during the period of 1936 to 1940. inclusive. amounting to 7.246.721 tons of scrap iron. 740.752 tons of steel ingots and blooms. 4.582.472 tons of refined copper. 18.347 tons of scrap copper. 92.427 tons of tin plate. 55.251 tons of tinplate scrap. petroleum and products valued at $219.856.062. 4.674.782 bales of cotton. aircraft and parts valued at $18.774.823. machine tools valued at $37.035.056. when added to the export figures failed to produce an amount of exports sufficient to enable the special pleaders to make out a case for the New Deals foreign policy.

On the 15th of May I asked the Secretary of Agriculture to supply me with the historical facts on wages and farm prices over a period of years. and particularly for the war years. The result I have here and it should be of general interest. Using the 190914 years as a base with an index of 100. these figures show that in 1914 earnings of factory workers stood at 105.5 and farm prices at 101. In 1919 earnings of factory workers stood at 225.6 and farm prices at 213. That was the peak for farm prices. In 1920 -wages went up to 273.3. and farm prices receded to 211. Next year. the big slump came. wages going back to 239.1. while farm prices crashed to 125. That was the story of World War No. 1. Now compare the story of World War No. 2. In 1939. earnings of factory workers were 304.3 of the 190914 level. while farm prices were only 93 percent of that level. In 1941. last year. wages went to 348. up 44 points. while prices received by farmers went to 122. up 29 points. but leaving farm prices at about onethird of an equitable relationship based on the parity period of 190914. Parity. it should be remembered. is an equitable relationship and is not a fixed figure. It is designed to express the ratio between what a farmer has to buy and what he has to sell. These figures. prepared by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. are an amazing revelation that not only are farm prices far below the level of wages in fixed dollars. but that they are only a fraction of wages in terms of purchasing power and far below World War No. 1 ratios. And his memory is dull who does not recall the World War $2.20 wheat. Today it is $1.20. Yet the staggering truth is that in the entire field of national endeavor. the farmer was the one individual who was most ready to do his job in this war.

I cannot at this time attempt to answer the Senator properly. As I have stated. until 1873 our Government recognized gold and silver as primary money. there was not gold and silver. there was bimetallism. With the demonetization of silver by our Government it suffered a displacement and was denied the high honor which It had theretofore occupied. Efforts to restore it failed and the domestic price of silver continued to decline .until in 1931. 1932. and 1933. as I recall. it had reached the low level of approximately 30 or 40 cents per ounce. As a result of the fight which was made looking to its restoration. the Silver Purchase Act was passed. That act gave hope to the bimetallists and was regarded as an indication that our Government was preparing the way for a wider use of silver for monetary purposes with the ultimate purpose of restoring it to its former partnership with gold. That measure was not an indication of the abandonment of silverquite the reverse. as I have statedbut the bill under consideration. when introduced. demanded the absolute repeal of the Silver Purchase Act. The amendment to it. however. makes the concession that domestically mined silver may be acquired under a more recent act. I have attempted to point out earlier in my remarks the effect of the amended Townsend Act and have argued that it would be regarded as a declaration that the United States no longer contemplates bimetallism. that it Will treat silver as an unimportant metal which finally must be regarded as a base metal fit only for industrial purposes. But. Mr. President. I must hasten on. The President stated in his message of May 22. 1934. that the view expressed was a step toward improving the financial and monetary system of our country. This statement would indicate that our monetary system would be improved by the adoption of the plan indicated by the President. He further stated that it was necessary to broaden the metallic base of our monetary system and to stabilize (I urge that we keep in mind the word stabilize). the purchasing and debtpaying power of our money on a more equitable level. Senators will recall the message which the President sent to Mr. Moley who was In attendance at the monetary conference in London. That message. as I interpreted it. was that no policy should be agreed to by the representatives of our Government which was not designed to provide an adequate monetary system. one capable of meeting the demands of the people. one that would result in increased prices for farm products and in improved conditions for labor. . The silver situation was under consideration at the London conference and. as I interpreted the position of some of the delegates to the conference and the message of the President. consideration must be given to the question of restoring silver to its proper monetary station and to provide a monetary base adequate to provide currencies and credits imperatively needed to revive business and to promote the welfare of our own and other countries. I again refer to the Presidents message in which he stated: This policy was initiated by the proclamation of December 21. 1933. bringing our current domestic production of silver into the Treasury. as well as placing this Nation among the first to carry out the agreement on silver which we sought and secured at the London conference. We have since acquired other silver in the interest of stabilization of foreign exchange and the development of a broader metallic base of our currency. A golden thread and a silver threadif I may change the expressionruns through the message of the Presidenta broader metallic base. not gold monometallism. but bimetallism. silver was to constitute a part of the base. to make it larger and stronger and more stable and important. The President further added: We seek to remedy a maladjustment of our currency. That there was a maladjustment of our currency must be conceded by all. There were forces in operation which tended to the concentration of gold in the hands of a limited number or group or nation. This resulted in a maladjustment which had serious repercussions upon credit and trade and indeed upon the industrial and economic life of the people. The President added: In further aid of this policy (that is. the policy leading to bimetallism) it would be helpful to have legislation broadening the authority for the further acquisition and monetary use of silver. Manifestly the President was looking to a proper use of silver for monetary purposes not only in our own country but. I believe. throughout the world. He is not seeking gold alone as the monetary base but in his message he frequently refers to silver and its monetary uses. He does not refer to silver as a base metal or as fit only for industrial purposes. but I respectfully insist that he indicates that the use of silver as primary moneymoney of ultimate redemptionmoney in association with gold provides a broad and stable foundation for our currencies and credits and for the monetary needs of the world. The President further added: I therefore recommend legislation at the present session declaring it to be the policy of the United States to increase the amount of silver in our monetary stocks with the ultimate objective of having and maintaining onefourth of their monetary value in silver and threefourths in gold. The- executive authority should. be authorized and directed to make the purchases of silver necessary to attain this ultimate objective. The authority to purchase present accumulations of silver in this country should be limited to purchases at not in excess of 50 cents per ounce. That was the initial movement which it was hoped and expected would culminate in an increase in the price of silver until it reached $1.29 per ounce. The President further stated that: The executive authority should be enabled. should circumstances require. to take over present surpluses of silver in this country not required for industrial uses on payment of just compensation. and to regulate imports. exports. and other dealings in monetary silver. I beg Senators to remember that the word silver is emphasized over and over again by the President in that message. He indicated his confidence in silver as a part of our monetary system. and urged a monetary plan which would broaden the monetary basenot narrow itby including in it silver as well as gold. He further stated: Because of the great world supply of silver and its use in varying forms by the worlds population. concerted action by all nationsor at least a large group of nationsis necessary if a permanent measure of value. including both gold and silver. is eventually to be made a world standard. Mr. President. this important message met with general approval throughout the United States. Even our gold friends paid tribute to Mr. Roosevelt for his prescience. his knowledge of financial questions. and his prophetic vision. which contemplated the restoration of silver to its proper position in the monetary systems of the world. This message was a challenge to those who were seeking to destroy silver for monetary uses. and also to chain all nations and peoples to the gold standard. Congress promptly responded to the message of the President and passed an act authorizing and directing the Secretary of the Treasury to purchase silver. issue silver certificates. and for other purposes. This act was approved June 19.. 1934. Senators cannot forget that following the demonetization of silver in 1873 many political as well as economic battles were fought for the purpose of restoring silver to its timehonored place. Many measures were introduced in Congress to rectify what many of the American people believed was a great crime in the demonetization of silver. Following the destandardization of silver there was an almost unbroken volume of protests against the gold monometallists who were attempting to rivet the gold standard upon the American people. I may add that in the Congress which enacted the socalled Silver Purchase Act measures were introduced in both branches providing for the remonetization of silver at a ratio of 16 to 1. My recollection is. that in practically every session of Congress for many years preceding the enactment of the Silver Purchase Act. measures were brought to the attention of the Congress challenging attention to the unsatisfactory economic conditions and demanding that silver be restored to its rightful place in our monetary system. International conferences were held from time to time at which the need of a broader metallic base than that afforded by gold were under consideration. Indeed. throughout the world there was a feeling that our monetary base was uncertain and insecure and that it should be strengthened so as to include silver as well as gold. At the economic conference held in London in 1933 the silver question occupied an important place upon the agenda. At the International Chamber of Commerce gatherings in many countries the question of remonetization of silver received attention. and. though no agreement was reached. there was a growing feeling of dissatisfaction with the attitude of those who insisted upon adhering to the gold standard. Without desiring to bring political parties into the discussion. I may add that the Democratic Party. at the convention which nominated Mr. Roosevelt for the Presidency. declared in effect in favor of the rehabilitation of silver. I wonder if my Democratic friends have forgotten that declaration in the Democratic platform. which was prepared largely by the able Senator from Virginia and one or two other persons. I happened to be a member of the committee which drafted the Democratic platform upon the occasion referred to. The platform called for a sound currency. which was to be preserved at all hazards. This was an expression of disapproval of the monetary policies of the Government. and its devotion to the gold standard. The platform further declared in favor of an international monetary convention. to be called by our Government. to consider the rehabilitation of silver. as well as related questions. Prior to the enactment of the Silver Purchase Act the Congress had passed the act of May 12. 1933. vwhich authorized the President by proclamation to fix the weight of the gold dollar in grains. ninetenths fine. and also to fix the weight of the silver dollar in grains. ninetenths fine. in ratio to the gold dollar. in such amounts as he found necessary from his investigation to stabilize domestic prices or to protect foreign commerce against the adverse effect of depreciated foreign currencies. The President was also authorized to provide for the coinage of gold and silver at the ratios so fixed. The message of the President which led to the enactment of the Silver Purchase Act. as well as the act to which I have just referred. demonstrates that the administration which came into power in 1933 believed in silver as a part of our monetary system. and was determined to enact such legislation as would give to the American people a sound currency. a currency based upon the money of the Constitution. namely. gold and silver. Undoubtedly there were divergent views among members of both political parties in regard to what we have been pleased to call the monetary question. There were those who believed that with the confused and conflicting situation throughout the world. and with the fierce spirit of nationalism which prevailed in many lands. any attempt to adopt a universal currency or money would result in failure. There were others. as I have indicated. who believed in the gold standard alone. There were still others who. resting their faith upon historical facts. believed that gold and silver at a fixed ratio afforded the soundest currency and the safest monetary policy which could be devised by man. Jefferson and Hamilton. representing two schools of political philosophy. dominated the political development of the Nation from its commencement. They submitted what might be called our monetary policy. It was a bimetallic policy and was in accord with the worlds monetary historyindeed. with history almost from the beginning of civilization. They recognized that gold and silver had proved the most effective and stable instrumentalities for government financial policies and for fiscal and financial relations among the peoples of the world. History has proved the physical relationship between gold and silver. Throughout the centuries they have been found in physical relation with each other in an almost uniform ratio. Nature welded these 2 metals in a constant and practically undeviating relation of approximately 14 parts of silver to 1 part of gold. Jefferson originally was inclined to silver as a base. because he believed it to be less liable to fluctuate than gold. However. Hamilton asserted that the use of either metal alone would abridge the quantity of circulating medium. I commend that statement to my Republican friends who seek to restrict the circulating medium. Their great patron saint. Hamilton. insisted upon gold and silver because he believed that the use of either metal alone would abridge the quantity of money or circulating medium to which the people were entitled and. therefore. would be liable to all objections which might arise from a comparison of a full. with the evils of a scanty circulation. Jefferson said. Let the standard. therefore. rest upon both metals. So the ratio was fixed at 151/2 parts of silver to 1 of gold. by weight. As we all know. the system so carefully devised and launched upon the young nation in 1792 functioned perfectly. though in 1836 the ratio was slightly altered from 151/2 parts of silver to 1 of gold to 16 to 1. by the law of that year. as to silver dollars. the weight of fractional silver coins remaining as before. I again refer to one of the statements in the Presidents message: As a part of a larger object. some things have been clear. One is that we should go forward as rapidly as conditions will permit in stabilizing the purchasing and debtpaying power on a high level. Declines in commodity prices have wrought serious injury to the American people. The farmers do not receive adequate prices for tlieir products. labor is not fully compensated and there is a feeling of unrest and. with some. despair because of the unsatisfactory and tragic industrial and economic conditions. May I quote again from the Presidents message: Another is that we should not neglect the value of an increased use of silver in improving our monetary system. Since 1929 that has been obvious. Manifestly the message of the President is a criticism of the goldstandard policy and a declaration in favor of giving to silver a more important place in our monetary system. He further added in his message thatSome measures for making a greater use of silver in the public interest are appropriate for Independent action by us. It must be borne in mind that following the passage of the act of 1873. which demonetized silver. gold had been the standard. and opposition to bimetallism had found increasing support. particularly among the creditor class and large vested interests. The administration that came into power in 1933 was confronted with a tragic situation. which was brought about in part by unwise and unsound monetary policies. Perhaps I am unorthodox. but I believe that I am orthodox in that I believe in the money of the Constitution. and in the bimetallic policy which the founders of the Republic gave to the American people. I think that there was a departure from sound and safe policies when silver was demonetized and when gold was made regnant and all powerful. The Silver Purchase Act was an attempt to break the chains of gold. or. at any rate. to aid in giving to silver its appropriate place alongside of gold in order that both metals might meet the demands of trade and commerce. and afford the American people increased purchasing power for their commodities. I recall that great leaders in both the Republican and Democratic Parties avowed their faith in bimetallism. I recall that by the act of March 1. 1893. Congress declared: It to be the policy of the United States to continue the use of both gold and silver as standard money. and to coin both gold and silver into money of equal intrinsic and exchange value. such equality to be secured by international agreement or by such safeguards of legislation as will insure the maintenance of the parity of gold and of the coins of the two metals and the equal power of the dollar at all times in the markets and in the payment of debts. And It is hereby declared that the efforts of the Government should be steadily directed to the establishment of such a safe system of bimetallism as will maintain at all times the equal value of every dollar coined or issued by the United States in the markets and in the payment of debts. That is the law today. Mr. President. this declaration of policy was reaffirmed by the unrepealed act of Congress of March 1. 1897. and again by an act of Congress. still on the statute books. of March 14. 1900. I invite attention to section 3 of the Silver Purchase Act. which. in effect. is an affirmation of the views of Congress that gold and silver are. and shall be. the legal currency of our country. Senators will recall that the Secretary of the Treasury is not only authorized but. directedand I emphasize the word directedto purchase both gold and silver at home or abroad. not to be impounded and sterilized. but to serve the monetary needs of the people. It is to the credit of President Roosevelt that he sought to restore silver to its high station and to give to the American people a sound and stable currency. resting upon gold and silver. which. as I have indicated. are provided in the Constitution as the money for this Republic. But there are those among us who demand the repeal of the Silver Purchase Act. There has been a widespread propaganda in favor of destroying silver. and this demand culminated in the bill now before us. However. the measure was so extreme that it has been amended. and. as I have before stated. its provisions are now limited to the repeal of the provisions of the Silver Purchase Act which authorize the acquisition of foreignmined silver. The measure. however. in my opinion. is a repudiation of the policy of the administration as announced in the Silver Purchase Act. Its purpose is ultimately to destroy silver for monetary uses. not only foreign silver. but silver mined in the United States. It seeks to destroy silver for monetary uses. It seeks to relegate it to the position of a mere commodity. It seeks to limit the money of ultimate redemption. It seeks to make money scarce and. therefore. dear. It is an involuntary confession that there is virtue in the quantitative theory of money. Shylocks and selfish creditors reap larger benefits with a limited quantity of money. with the gold standard rather than under the bimetallic system. Mr. President. I cannot refrain from quoting Mr. Keynes. who. a few years ago. was an ardent advocate of the goldstandard fallacy. He has recently stated thatThe periods when the supply of gold was such as to make it competent of serving the needs of the worlds principal medium of currency have been rare and intermittent. If any metal is to make this claim on the basis of long historical experience. it must be silver. not gold. We are repudiating Mr. Keynes. repudiating the history of the past. and we want to make gold the basis of our monetary system. I am repeating when I challenge attention t3 the failure of gold to meet the demands of the world and to my insistence upon a policy which contemplates the restoration of silver to its proper monetary station. As we know. until 1816 gold and silver were recognized as primary moneys in all countries of the world. Among primitive people barter prevailed. but as civilization developed and international relations became more intimate it was found imperative that there should be a medium of exchangea measuring rod. so to speaka plan under which transactions among nations and individuals might be facilitated and balances of trade settled. Because of the inherent qualities of gold and silver. they automatically became. among civilized peoples. the standard or base of their monetary systems. As I have indicated. explorations in the earth revealed the physical relationship between the two metals. So. by custom and regulation. gold and silver became the moneys of most countries. We know that in Napoleons day gold and silver were universally recognized as the moneys of civilized nations. Gold and silver were coined at the ratio of 15 or 15/2 to 1. and transactions. Including securities issued. were based upon and governed by the existing relationship between gold and silver. It was discovered that with an abundance of gold and silver. prices advanced. wages were higher. and a corresponding development occurred in all departments of human endeavor. It was discovered that when obligations of governments and the people were payable in gold. rather than in gold or silver. the economic and industrial life of the people were brought under a cloud. And so. through the experiences of the people. they demanded the monetization of both gold and silver. Our Government accepted the bimetallic theory. and the first Important legislation placed gold and silver side by side as the base and foundation of our monetary system. The world has discovered the Inadequacy of gold to meet the needs of the people. and the demonetization of silver has been followed in many countries by the abandonment of the gold standard. Throughout the world people are inquiring why silver was robbed of its monetary status and attempts are being made to enthrone gold as the supreme monetary power. Professor Cassel. who was an outstanding political economist. declared that the relentless struggle for gold has brought a fall in prices which has resulted in a crisis. producing a general depression. heavy losses. economic difficulties. and industrial unemployment. That prophesy. Mr. President. has been verified. In the United States and throughout the world the heavy burdens of debt have been placed upon individuals as well as upon communities and governments. These obligations are so huge as to reach astronomical figures. Certainly there must be alleviation of this most oppressive condition. and there would be if silver were remonetized and placed alongside gold to meet the needs of the world. Sir Henry Strakosch. a very eminent writer upon finance. gold and silver. and the monetary policies of the world. has declared that the deficiencies of monetary gold are well over 100 percent. which has resulted in a sharp fall in commodity prices. The gold supply of the world Is approximately $25.000.000.000a small sum measured by the worlds obligationsbut. as I have indicated. if silver were restored to its proper monetary station. the pressure of creditors would be diminished. the burdens of the people would be lightened. Iknow that appeals for a broader monetary base as requested by the President may be disregarded but It seems to me that the time is at hand when there should be a militant campaign for reforms in our monetary system and for the recognition of silver as an indispensable part of our monetary system. May I call attention to the words of Sir George Paish. who visited the United States but a few years ago. when a number of Senators. including the senior Senator from Nevada. were attempting to effect reforms In our monetary system. I might add that this distinguished Britisher is an authority upon finance and monetary questions. He indicated the importance of a restoration of silver. and in one of his statements which received wide circulation. declared that the financial situation is one of unprecedented difficulty. and that the world. particularly since 1914. has lived upon credit. and is indebted. both nationally and internationally. for fabulous sums of money. There are some who insist that gold Is a stable moneyindeed. the only stable moneybut the fact Is. that measured by commodities. by human labor. for the things which gold purchases. its variations and. indeed. its gyrations. demonstrate that it is a most unstable commodity and not a satisfactory measure of value. It fluctuates when measured by labor and commodities and by the ordinary standards of value. There are many who believe that it possesses less merit. so far as stability is concerned. than silver would have possessed had it not been demonetized. After all. value simply means value in exchange. and it arises out of the relations which exist between things. Intrinsically. it is said money has no value. Purchasing power is a value in economics. The level of prices of commodities is determined by the number of units of purchasing power. If the number of units is reduced. each remaining unit possesses greater value. expressed in commodity prices. and the prices of commodities. measured by the monetary unit. fall. Value. like utility. it has been said. possesses no intrinsic value. but expresses in exchange nothing but ratio. To speak of the value of an ounce of gold is meaningless. as it is to speak of the ratio of a given number. There must be another number in order to make a ratio. Therefore value simply means value in exchange. Human estimation placed on desirable objects whose quantity is limited determines value. We all recall the statement of the historian. Sir Archibald Alison. who refers to the tragic condition of Great Britain following the demonetization of silver by Great Britain. He states that small land proprietors were ruined and distress was universal. My recollection is that he stated that within a period of 7 years the number of landowners was reduced from more than 100.000 individuals to less than 30.000. and that a large population became the objects of support by organized charity. Mr. President. we are familiar with the important place which Sir Henry Deterding occupies in the financial world and in trade and commerce. He has declared that the destruction of silver values will defeat trade revival. and that so long as gold and silver were in cooperation. things went well. but that governments governed by theorists. and shelterIng themselves behind socalled money experts. adopted gold as their sole standard of value and ousted silver by paper. Whether paper is represented by bankers bills or by bank notes. the only reason for its value is credit. and credit is the same as every other commodity or faculty. in that the more there is of it the less valuable it becomes. A few years ago. as Senators will recall. the League of Nations and the McMillan committee of Great Britain. in their studies of world conditions and the monetary situation. declared. in substance. that if the world was to be rescued from bankruptcy. there must be a material increase of prices. particularly in the field of agriculture and labor. Efforts to establish gold as the sole and universal standard of value have constantly and uniformly failed. It is against the inexorable logic of nature and experience. As early as 1871 Ernest Seyd. a great economist. said: It Is a great mistake to suppose that the deflation of the gold values. besides England. will be beneficial. It would only lead to the destruction of the monetary equilibrium hitherto existing and a decline in prosperity all over the world. Mr. President. this was a prophecy of great significance. The fiscal history of India during the past 40 or 50 years is sufficient to demonstrate that fact. A great country. but subJect to foreign domination. in the main has proved immune to laws designed to transform its monetary system by the mandate of Great Britain. As Senators know. in 1897 the Indian mints were closed overnight to the further coinage of silver. and the market value of bullion within a few hours shrunk onehalf its previous price. producing serious consequences. of courseindeed. bankruptcy. We recall that the President of the United States at that time. Mr. Cleveland. demanded that there be a cessation of coinage in the United States. and England. by act of Parliament. decreed the extension of the gold standard over India In 1900. However. the rupee continued in circulation. and �445.000.000 sterling were lost for all time in India in the effort to accomplish the impossible. When the idea was abandoned in 1925 Great Britain was still unconvinced. and there was created an Indian Currency Commission. which in 1926 recommended the socalled goldbullion standard. fantastic in design and impossible in practice. It decreed the destruction of the rupee and the dumping of the resultant bullion on the worlds market. However. it was confronted with obstacles. Its paper substitutes for the rupee were rejected by the people and Great Britain was compelled to modify its announced plan. Silver as a measure of value has accompanied every world movement designed to stimulate exchanges. and the extension of the worlds purchasing power. and throughout the world the people have attempted to increase its use in spite of bitter opposition. The shrinkage of legal tender money consequent upon the enormous and unceasing demands for it automatically advanced the market value of silver bullion from the close of the World War. in 1919. from 60 cents to $1.40 per ounce in gold. No inflation resulted. and the situation brought about as a consequence of the rise in silver gave hopeful promise of the legitimate and desirable rise in prices. with no basis for inflationary activities. It seemed that bimetallism had become automatic. and the problem of silver and gold happily adjusted. Unfortunately. our Government sought to prohibit the export of standard dollars. while making it plain that no prohibition existed against the export of bullion. Accordingly more than 29.000.000 silver dollars were sold to the exporters by the Treasury. which were melted at Shanghai. and dumped on the market to regulate our exchanges with countries having a silver money standard. These efforts to destroy silver have contributed to world financial and economic disorder. They have injured even gold. which now shuns the habitations of men. It finds no place in the channels of trade. It is a stranger to the people. it has failed to be a proper world measure of value. It has been aggressive in characterhidden. but nevertheless a powerful tyrant. Mr. Keynes recently said: The periods when the supply of gold was such as to make it capable of serving the needs of the worlds principal medium of currency have been rare and intermittent. If any metal is to make this claim on the basis of long historical experience it must be silver. not gold. I repeat. there is a conviction upon the part of many people that the gold standard has failed to meet the needs of the people and that silver must be restored to its proper monetary status. A short time ago an organization in Great Britain promulgated a statement bearing upon the question of bimetallism. Some of the leadingstatesmen of Great Britain are members of that organization. Sir Robert Horne. a distinguished leader in Britain and a member of Parliament. was chairman. Sir Hugo CunliffeOwen. a distinguished statesman and economist. was also a member. together with Rt. Hon. L. S. Amery. a member of Parliament. This organization declared thatMetalliccurrency reserves in silver. which would then become freely available for payment of international differences as well as in support of domestic currency reserves. The metallic basis of credit would thus be expanded and the level of commodity prices raised and kept higher and more constant than would be possible with gold alone. Here was an appeal for bimetallism by more than 30 of the most distinguished representatives of capital and labor in Great Britain. It contained a declaration that gold was inadequate. and a prediction that with its powerful grasp prices would continue to shrink and economic disaster would be inevitable. The organization further declared that cooperation between the British Empire and the United States and France. and reintroducing silver into the monetary system of the world. would result in the present depression ending and prices could be rendered comparatively stable on their higher level. Mr. President. we know that the increasing strain upon gold reserves resulted in various countries abandoning the gold standard because of its inadequacy to meet governmental and domestic needs. A research was recently made by the League of Nations and the McMillan Committee of Great Britain. into world conditions. and they pointed out that the worlds production of goods demanded increased currency and credit. and that the gold available to meet monetary needs was a diminishing quantity. It has been stated that one of the causes of the economic and financial trouble was the depreciation of silver not only in silverstandard countries but throughout the world. It seems to me that in view of the fact that a few countries have most of the gold and are draining other nations of their gold. they are contributing to the economic problems of the world. Mr. President. I believe that the worlds progress not only demands the rehabilitation of silver but a redistribution of gold. that there is now a maldistribution of gold everyone must concede. I have offered a bill calling for the coinage of gold for circulation and upon some other occasion I shall ask for its consideration. Mr. President. I shall detain the Senate no longer. I express the hope that the bill under consideration may be defeated. Confused conditions throughout the world forbid. it seems to me. the passage of a measure which will have a disturbing effect upon international affairs. In this critical period it is my deliberate judgment that the passage of this bill would be harmful not only to the American people but to democratic nations. it would have unfavorable repercussions in the republic to the south of us. And our neighbor upon the north is engaged with its associate commonwealths in a titanic struggle. Our relations with it are most cordial. and it is obvious that the enactment of the measure under consideration would interpose obstacles to continued commercial and business relations and might affect in some degree the credits and financial transactions between the two Governments or their nationals. I emphasize the fact that this is a most inauspicious occasion to consider the bill before us. and its enactment would be followed by consequences which. in my opinion. would be not only unfortunate and disadvantageous but injurious to our own and other countries. I cannot help but believe that we should defeat this bill not only for our good but for the good of the peoples in other lands and of those who come after us."},{"1":"7.600044e+08","2":"1939","3":"H","4":"BURDICK","5":"484","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. under the permission granted me.

I hope those of us who favor the recommittal of the bill are generous enough to attribute the highest motives. political and otherwise. to those who will not take and are not accepting our views on this question. I think we are generous enough also to compliment the members of the committee. who have served long and faithfully in the preparation of the bill. They should be especially complimented because the bill before the Senate is a decided improvement upon the original bill presented to the committee. It is the hope of those of us who favor recommittal. now that the bill has had a hearing before the Senate and before the entire country. and Senators have had an opportunity to express their views. and the people of the country have had an opportunity also to express their views. that the committee may find in the debate some helpful suggestions toward the improvement of this important measure. Before I proceed further. I desire to pay a special tribute to the Industry. the courage. and the perseverance of the junior Senator from Virginia . Representing a philosophy entertained by nearly half the Members of this body. he has battled day In and day out for preserving constitutional rights in the bill and for making it a bill that .would result In promoting economy. I do not seek to find. in my brothers and my colleagues of my own party. false. jealous. and selfish motives. I have been in public life long enough to know that environment is a tremendous factor. even more than party labels. in influencing official judgment. I believe. also. that it is not only a Senators duty to differ with his party on fundamental questions. if prompted by honest motives and convictions. but as well to offer and fight for constructive criticisms that may prevent his party from taking action that may seem to be contrary to the public welfare and injurious alike to country and party. I can well understand the position of the able Senators from Virginia. The instinct to be strong and able defenders of the Constitution is bred in their very bones. It is the same spirit that we observe in my own State of Massachusetts. I can understand the Senators from the South battling against the wage and hour bill. They have had bred in their souls the principle of States rights. I can understand how we who come from great industrial centers raise our voices. even against our party leaders. when the suggestion is made for special benefits to farmers which may result in increasing the cost of living. I refuse to think In terms of selfish personal motives or of political partisanship in the discussion of a great question which goes to the very foundation of constitutional government. Mr. President. the debate on this measure has developed the unmistakable fact that it is one of the most important and farreaching proposals that has been sent to the Congress in many years. First of all it authorizes the President to transfer. retransfer. regroup. coordinate. consolidate. reorganize. segregate. or abolish the whole or any part of any agency. or the functions thereof. which he thinks may be necessary for the efficient conduct of the Government. with the exception of certain independent establishments mentioned in the bill and other designated limitations. It is estimated that this places under the control of the President. for the purposes designated. more than 100 agencies of the Government. He cannot transfer to any other agency all of the functions of any executive department. the implication. however. is clear that he may transfer to any agency the functions of any executive department less than all. Generally speaking. he may transfer the functions of every commission. board. bureau. administration. authority. division. or activity in the executive branch of the Government. except the nine governmental establishments defined as independent establishments. The President Is authorized to establish a civilservice administrator. instead of the present Civil Service Commission. for a term of 15 years. The President is further authorized discretion to extend the classified civil service and the provisions of the Classification Act to any or all Government employees who are not now subject to the Civil Service Act. or the Classification Act. The bill abolishes the office of the Comptroller General and the General Accounting Office. replacing it with an Auditor General and an Auditing Office. the latter to report to a special joint congressional committee the result of its audit. The bill sets up a new Department of Welfare and creates a National Resources Planning Board. The Department of Welfare. under the contemplation of this act. may become the largest and most important and. likewise. the most expensive agency of the Federal Government. yet it is defined and explained in only two pages of this bill. How farreaching the functions of this new Cabinet office shall extend no one can prophesy at this time. The new department will administer the laws relating to any agency or function transferred to It which relates to public health and sanitation. protection of consumers. education. relief of unemployment and of the hardshipp and suffering caused thereby. relief of the needy and distressed. assistance of the aged. relief and vocational rehabilitation of the physically disabled. While the bill would seem to embrace only the above enumerated functions. yet those who have from time to time vigorously protested against the centralization of Federal control over education should bear in mind that this is to be one of the important functions of this new Cabinet officer. and all experience indicates that he will seek to expand and enlarge the Federal Governments control over education. We have before Congress at this very moment recommendations transmitted to us with the approval of the President which if they are enacted into law contemplate a tremendous expansion by the Federal Government into the realm of publicschool education throughout the Nation. One thing is certain: We can look forward to increased momentum in support of the campaign that for years has been waged by organized groups seeking Federal control of education that the States have heretofore resisted. Mr. President. I have referred to the importance and momentous character of the powers delegated to the Executive in this bill. All these powers are rightly reposed in the Congress under the Constitution. They are powers which it is the duty of Congress to exercise. They are powers which the Congress has exercised since the founding of our Republic. Not one of these agencies. bureaus. or departments came into existence except by an act of Congress. Congress has specified the functions of every one of these departments. Let me remind the Senate that not one of these agencies. bureaus. or departments and their defined dutiesexcept a few recent and temporary agencieshas come into existence except after hearings before committees of the House and Senate. and by a majority vote of both the House and Senate and the approval of the Executive at the time of their creation. What a spectacle to the country for this Congress now to confess that it is unable to effectively perform the duties that have been heretofore performed by our predecessors and which is the duty and responsibility of the Congress under the Constitution. What is the reason for this extraordinary proposal? What is the emergency that demands this surrender of our constitutional powers? This Is not a time of war that requires sudden and speedy reconstruction of the executive departments. There is indeed a new business depression. but no one claims that the proposed reorganization is for the purpose of meeting this new economic emergency. It is said that the President can do this job more effectively and more speedily than Congress. I concede that to be entirely within the realm of possibility and even probability. Indeed. I believe President Roosevelt would act with the highest motives. However. I submit that such contentions are no justification for such a course. except in a dire emergency. and even then can be defended only on the assumption that Congress is incompetent to perform its constitutional duty. The advocates of this transfer of constitutional powers and authority by Congress to the Executive seem blind to the fact that such a course parallels events that have been taking place elsewhere in the world and have contributed to the overthrow of democracies in other countries. It is precisely the same arguments which are advanced here today that have been advanced in other countries to overthrow democracy. It is always urged that social and economic abuses have grown up In the body politic and that the ordinary processes of constitutional government are unable to adequately cope with them. Hasty and remedial action has been the battle cry by the forces that have been attacking parliamentary government and moving in the direction of a totalitarian state. The framers of our Constitution had full realization that abuses in the social and economic order would from time to time arise. they foresaw that our people at times would become restless. impulsive. and demand hasty reforms. It was because of their foresight that they interposed the checks and balances in our form of government to guard against sudden and rash movements away from democratic ideas. Many times during the past century there has been extreme dissatisfaction with political policies of Presidents and parties. yet at no time have our people sought to remedy through weakening the power and authority of any one of the three branches of the Government so wisely set up by the founders. Our people for 150 years have been taught to patiently wait the operation of normal correctives. It is this attitude of invoking the operation of normal correctives through the years that has contributed to the preservation of our institutions and contributed materially to our political stability and our social and economic progress. Every other method than the normal corrective method provided by our Constitution when applied in other parts of the World have resulted in the overthrow of democracy. and whatever social and economic benefits have resulted ternporarily they have been accompanied by ruthless disregard of the peoples rights. We must admit the harmful effect of abuses in our social and economic system. We must all recognize the need for correction. But the bill now before us is not even remotely claimed to be for this purpose. Mr. President. before we vote today let each Member of the Senate reflect once more on the full import and significance of this transfer from Congress to the Executive of this power of life and death over all the agencies. over all the bureaus. over all the departments. and all the commissions except for the nine that are specifically excluded by the terms of the bill. It means that for a period of 24 months from the date of enactment of this billif it be enactedthe continued existence of any and all of these agencies. bureaus. and commissions will be solely at the sufferance of the Executive. that the tenure of office of each appointive executive officer. commissioner. administrator. director. or bureau chief outside of the specific reservations in the bill. will be within the control of the Executive. that the hundreds of thousands of Government employees within these departmental bureaus and agencies and commissions are placed in jeopardy because the particular bureaus. agencies. or commissions in which they are now employed may be abolished by the stroke of the Executives pen. The authority to be delegated to the Executive to reorganize at any time and from time to time during a period of 24 months. the structure of the executive branch of the Government carries with it the authority to change the personnel of the executive branch of the Government from top to bottom. Our forefathers never believed in concentrating the powers of government in the hands of a single man. Every one of the constitutions of the Original Thirteen States revealed the strong and indeed bitter opposition to autocracy. The colonists had had their experience with kings and royal governors and were determined that the American Government which they set up should afford no opportunity for a return to oneman power. They provided for divided authority and divided responsibility. This was a fundamental element of their concept of democracy. and they regarded division of authority as the surest safeguard to preserve democracy. It is this divided authority we are abandoning in this bill Every Member of the Senate is cognizant of the rising tide of public protest against the proposals in this bill. and particularly with respect to this broad grant of authority to the Executive. The protests have come from every section of our country and from every class of our citizensfrom the farmers. organiied labor. whitecollar workers. colleges. pulpits. and the press. Why are these protests. which are similar in character to those which were so strongly voiced by the country a year ago. when we had under consideration the bill to reorganize the Federal judiciary and the Supreme Court? They are because the country recognizes in the present bill. as it did last year in the court bill. a grievous impairment of the fundamental principles of division of the power and authority of government into three independent branchesthe judicial. the legislative. and the executiveand the potential concentration of all power and authority in the Executive. Let us heed these protests. Let us pause before it is too late. Let us realize that. from the moment of enactment of the present bill. what the Congress will have done cannot be undone. Congress will have tied its own hands. Nothing short of a twothirds vote of both branches of Congress to override a Presidential veto can thereafter recall the delegation of this authority to the Executive. or cancel any governmental change that the Executive decrees."},{"1":"7.501403e+08","2":"1937","3":"H","4":"WOOD","5":"117","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. these industries were exempted in the bill. and I know that no member of the committee had any intention of exempting the employment of children in these industries.

As President Roosevelt has asked Congress to turn over to Mr. Hopkins $3.000.000.000 to spend as he pleases. I am presuming you would be interested in my personal experiences as a contractor with W. P. A. This letter to Murray is longwinded. but I was anxious to be specific and not deal in generalities. In this letter I attempted to show: 1. The red tape and delays I have encountered in order to secure laborthe fallacy of not utilizing the efficient N. R. S. organization more fully. 2. The labor scale is all out of line with prevailing wages in this area. with the result that men on W. P. A. work do not wish to work on private contract work. farms. or P. W. A. and State highway work. 3. Ninetyfive percent of W. P. A. employees are picked for political reasons rather than fitness for the job. and that three of the supervisors on one project. in Saline County. are running for political office. 4. Wives of welltodo men are placed in charge of sewing circles. whereas there are plenty of efficient destitute women available for the work while wives of politicians are employed. 5. Inefficiency of work done and the poor class of work performed. 6. By permitting men to mess around on W. P. A. jobs has spoiled even the good workers and made loafers out of them. 7. With a million dollars of construction work going on in Saline County and contractors short of labor. yet four W. P. A. jobs are going full blast In this county. 8. W. P. A. certainly does not increase the morale of the men. 9. W. P. A. is poor politics. for it only provides for three and onehalf million men and disregards another 7.000.000 men who are crying for work. but who are not on relief. and they are sore as hell. I have quarries in Mercer. Daviess. Randolph. Johnson. St. Charles. Saline.

What about the onehundredodd million Americans who are not on relief but are working every day and will have to pay the bill? I hope this hasnt bored you. and I am sorry I seem to be so longwinded.

I include the following statement on labor legislation given out on August 22. by Henry Ohl. Jr.. president of the Wisconsin State Federation of Labor: On the eve of the announcement of a great effort to bring about the rejuvenation of the Democratic Party. it became necessary to warn the workers of Wisconsin of the consequences of misplaced confidence. The Wisconsin State Federation of Labor deemrs it a duty to inform working people that the Democratic Party in Wisconsin. together with its reactionary political ally. the Republicans. has proved itself unworthy the affiliation or support of decent citizens. Its indifference toward the asinine and dishonest acts of Its legislators during the present session of the legislature deserves only contempt and condemnation. Wisconsin labor will never forget that it was the Democrats in the State senate. acting as the henchmen of the antisocial. moneymad Republican representatives. who strangled the highest hope of working men and women for economic sanity and social security by defeating the Wisconsin labordisputes bill. sponsored by labor. This was the most Important and vital piece of labor legislation of the session. It was patterned after the Wagner Labor Disputes Act. passed by Congress and signed by President Roosevelt. Its provisions were to apply to intrastate business while the Federal act covers interstate enterprises. The bill was defeated by a conspiring alliance of Democrats with reactionary Republicans. By their action the Democratic State senators stamped themselves as enemies of the organized labor movement. and the whole Democratic Party organization. by its failure to rebuke its legislative representatives for this action. has placed itself in the same position. The State labordisputes bill took no advantages away from capital except the unwarranted. usurped power to squelch intercourse between workers that comes from selforganization into bona fide labor unions. without interference on the part of employers. As a result of the prostituted statesmanship of these misrepresentatives of the people. strikes. lockouts. industrial controversies of various kinds become inevitable. for. with or without a labordisputes act. labor in Wisconsin will never surrender the natural. constitutional right to organize. If it was the intention of the Democratic Party and its Republican money ally to test the caliber of the organized labor movement in Wisconsin by running counter to its entire program of reconstruction. we say to them now that we accept the challenge for a finish contest on both the economic and political fields. Every clearthinking worker is chagrined at the murderous assault made jointly by Democrats and Republicans on the labordisputes bill. They are also cognizant of other transgressions by these political misfits who lack every qualification of statesmanship. The Wisconsin worksprogram bill. under which labor had hoped to secure something more than a standarddestroying wage. and which we had every hope would develop a model for the Nation. was assailed as mercilessly as was the labordisputes bill. Organized labor will not forget with what fiendish glee the State senate. again led by the Democrats. endeavored to crucify the Wisconsin State Federation of Labor on a lying joint resolution. when they knew it was a lying resolution inspired by a politically disgruntled senator. A more decent assembly. composed of Progressive and Socialist members. rebuked the intent of the senate by killing the resolution by an almost unanimous vote. Numerous pieces of vital legislation were mercilessly mangled by Democratic amendments before the original bill was given the final death vote of the false statesmen of the Democratic Party. who held the balance of legislative power. Space forbids a complete review of all the impudent defiance of the will of the people in the present legislature by Democratic edict. A more complete presentation will be issued from the official records at the close of the session. We ask the Milwaukee electorate particularly to weigh the fact that this city furnished the kind of reactionary senators that made the science of government a travesty in Wisconsin in 1935. Of Milwaukee Countys 7 State senators. 6Galasinski. Phillips. Schoenecker. Shenners. and Zimmy. Democrats. and Morris. reactionary Republicanvoted against the labordisputes bill. and Callan. Democrat. was absent. Out of the 14 Democratic State senators only 1 votes for the bill. It is highly significant that of the 6 Republican senators 5 voted against the bill. This conclusively shows the tieup between the Democrats and the reactionary Republicans. While the rejuvenation of a discredited political group is being attempted. it will be well for Democrats to consider that every controversy with employers involving industrial relations. sought to be covered by the State labordisputes bill. will be charged to Democratic perfidy and Republican chicancery. Every strike that takes place because of the opposition of the employer to the right of selforganization will be attributable to Democratic glorification in the enslavement of labor and treachery to their own standard bearer. Franklin D. Roosevelt. Every penny of cost. every sacrifice. every pang of anguish that might have been avoided by the enactment of the labordisputes bill will be an additional blot on the escutcheon of Democratic politics in Wisconsin. The failure of every effort to develop labors plan for managementlabor cooperation must be accounted for by Democratic political dishonesty and broken pledges. aided and abetted by spurious Republicanism. Whatever decent and honest individuals may yet call themselves Democrats after the legislative abortion of 1935 must wonder. as we do. under what process a structure as decayed as is the Democratic Party in Wisconsin can be rejuvenated. The most reactionary and bitterly hostile senate in Wisconsins history. that of 1935. contained not only old. wornout fifteenthcentury minds. but the younger members. sans any idea of the meaning of statesmanship. aped the fogies in their most indecent and unpatriotic political maneuverings. I Had it been the deliberate aim of those who held the reins of Democratic Party management to commit political suicide. they could not have made a better job of it. The failure of the party leaders. young and old. to protest oftrepeated. unscrupulous. laborbaiting acts of the partys adherents in the legislature certainly offers no hope of awakening a conscience where there is none by a belated assurance of rejuvenation. Our complaint is not on the basis of a few individuals violating their pledges. but against the party in Wisconsin as a whole which connived at and aided in the grossest. deliberate violations of the principles of democracy and studied labor oppression. with the aid of Republicans as indecent politically as they. They have also called to their aid every recalcitrant employer whose god is profits and to whom the common weal Is meaningless. The Wisconsin State Federation is primarily an economic. rather than political. movement. Politics to us is merely an instrument for economic and social betterment. To this end clean and honest politics or statesmanship is essential. That kind of politics is expected and demanded by our movement. Labor and the farmers have been too patient with the spoilsmongers in both the Democratic and Republican Parties. We have dared to venture into the political arena to accept the challenge of reaction and treachery as characterized in the Wisconsin Senate of 1935. Our people must not be misled by assurances that any party so utterly lacking in statesmanship as the Democratic Party now promising to rejuvenate itself. anymore than the grabbing. grafting Republican Party can ever be eligible for the suffrage of the great hosts of men and women of labor in the industries and on the farms of the Badger Commonwealth."},{"1":"7.301958e+08","2":"1934","3":"H","4":"WOLVERTON","5":"885","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. it is gratifying to realize that some of the injustices suffered by veterans and their dependents as a result of the socalled Economy Acts of last year have been corrected as a result of legislation passed by this Congress over the Presidents veto. There are yet many inequities and injustices that remain for correction by another Congress. The progress made by this Congress. however. in rectifying the wrongs committed by the previous Congress in its very drastic and unfair treatment of veterans affairs. gives promise that there will be continued action until every wrong is righted. This change of attitude upon the part of many Members of Congress toward veterans legislation brings a sense of justification to those of us who last year cast our vote against the legislation that sought to balance the Budget at the expense of deserving veterans. widows. and orphans. The socalled Economy Act was passed under the pretense that a balanced Budget would result and that such was necessary to maintain the credit of the Nation. If this had been true. and not the direct result of a highpowered propaganda carried on by the National Economy League in behalf of those who. because of their wealth. were subject to the payment of income taxes. there would have been no such outburst of indignation and cry of distress raised by veterans and Federal employees. But when all pretense of a balanced Budget was cast aside by everincreasing expenditures to provide thousands of jobs of a political character for political workersand there have been 81.000 additional and new jobs provided during the past year over and above what previously existedit was natural for veterans and others to ask why should deserving veterans and Federal employees be required to pay for this orgy of spending by reduction. and entire loss in some cases. of disability allowances and compensation. And furthermore it is well. when considering the necessity of a balanced Budget. to realize that there are three ways to accomplish the purpose. One method is to cut expenditures until they do not exceed income received. the other method is to increase the income until it equals the expenditures. or there might properly be a combination of both. The injustice of the Economy Act was due to the fact that it only adopted the first method and thereby required disabled veterans. including old Civil War veterans and their widows and underpaid Government employees to suffer cuts in order that the Budget might be balanced. It is almost inconceivable that veterans disabled in the service of their country and even widowed scrubwomen working on the floors of Government buildings for a few dollars per week should be required to carry the burden of maintaining the credit of the Nation. Dictatorial power was given to the President to accomplish the purpose. It would have been more just if the dictatorial power had been broadened so as to include the right in the first instance to compel additional contributions from possessors of wealth. who were most able to pay. Why require the disabled veteran. the widow. and the scrubwoman to balance the Budget when the wealth of the country is permitted to invest in taxexempt securities and thereby escape making any contribution to the Government? What right have these individuals and their associates in the National Economy League. many of whom benefit by mail and other subsidies and large retirement pay or pensions from the Government. to cry Treasury raiders  at deserving veterans? It was the realization that a great wrong had been done a year ago that caused Congress. in answer to a Nationwide demand. to reverse itself this year. and I am confident that a sympathetic and just treatment of veterans and Federal employees will continue to evidence itself until full justice has been done. It is also gratifying to realize that in the closing hours of Congress favorable consideration is given to a bill that will extend relief to some of the widows and orphans of World War veterans who had previously been denied assistance of any kind. There are thousands of needy World War widows in the United States. with small children. who receive no aid of any kind from the Government. They are entitled to relief not only from a humanitarian standpoint but also as a matter of common decency and welfare to the country. This has been corrected to some extent. but the full victory is yet to be won. The Government of the United States has a sacred duty to perform toward its defenders and their dependents. The men who offered their lives for the countrys defense were given every assurance. based upon the former established policy of the Government. that they would be cared for in time of need and their dependents would not be permitted to suffer when they were gone. If it was not in the written contract between them and the Government when they enlisted. then it was most certainly there in principle. Through all the years of this Nations history there has been a recognition of this obligation by the Government. and there is a duty upon each of us to see that it shall continue to be recognized. No nation should ever forget the sacrifices of its defenders. nor cease to be grateful."},{"1":"7.300540e+08","2":"1933","3":"S","4":"WALSH","5":"138","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President.

He has heard parts of the same speech several times possibly. but. regardless of what the Senator from Nevada may wish. my state of health is such that I feel able to go on and complete my work this afternoon. Is it not an amazing thing. Mr. President. that Senators who are so bent upon having their own way. so determined that their way is the right way. should be so unwilling to accord one of their numbers. coordinate in position. and representative of a State at least as important. the same privilege of speaking at some length that they themselves demand on other occasions? I can well recall when. at a time when we had important business that we wished to transact. the Senator from Nevada held the Senate on the 4th of March at great length. discoursing on reclamation in Nevadaa matter of vital importance to him at the time. but probably of as little concern to the Senate as what I am saying is of concern to the same body. But Mr. Justice Taney said of this Congress thatThey had an undoubted right. as independent sovereignties. to accept any cession of territory for their common benefit. which all of them assented to. and it is equally clear. that as their common property. and having no superior to control them. they had the right to exercise absolute dominion over it. subject only to the restrictions which Virginia had imposed in her act of cession. There was. as we have said. no Government of the United States then in existence with specially limited and enumerated powers. The territory belonged to sovereignties. who. subject to the limitations above mentioned. had a right to establish any form of government they pleased. by compact or treaty among themselves. and to regulate rights of person and rights of property in the territory. as they might deem proper. It was by a Congress. representing the authority of these several and separate sovereignties. and acting under their authority and commandbut not from any authority derived from the Articles of Confederationthat the instrument usually called the Ordinance of 1787 was adopted. regulating in much detail the principles and the laws by which this territory should be governed.Then he makes a reference to slavery in that connection. which of course was the matter pending before the court. I omit that. and go on to the next paragraph: This was the state of things when the Constitution of the United States was formed. The territory ceded by Virginia belonged to the several Confederated States as common property. and they had united in establishing In it a system of government and jurisprudence. in order to prepare it for admission as States. according to the terms of the cession. They were about to dissolve this federative union and to surrender a portion of their independent sovereignty to a new government. which. for certain purposes. would make the people of the several States one people. and which was to be supreme and controlling within its sphere of action throughout the United States. but this Government was to be carefully limited in its powers. and to exercise no authority beyond those expressly granted by the Constitution. or necessarily to be implied from the language of the instrument. and the objects it was intended to accomplish. and as this league of States would. upon the adoption of the new government. cease to have any power over the territory. and the ordinance they had agreed upon be incapable of execution. and a mere nullity. it was obvious that some provision was necessary to give the new Government sufficient power to enable it to carry into effect the objects for which it was ceded. and the compacts and agreements which the States had made with each other in the exercise of their powers of sovereignty. Chief Justice Taney continued: It was necessary that the lands should be sold to pay the war debt. that a government and a system of Jurisprudence should be maintained in it to protect the citizens of the United States who should migrate to the territory in their rights of person and of property. It was also necessary that the new government. about to be adopted. should be authorized to maintain the claim of the United States to the unappropriated lands in North Carolina and Georgia. which had not then been ceded. but the cession of which was confidently anticipated upon some terms that would be arranged between the General Government and these two States. And. moreover. there were many articles of value besides this property in landAll this has an Important bearing upon the disposing clause of the Constitution. because Chief Justice Taney was pointing out the different kinds of propertyterritory. lands. and movable propertyand he said: Furthermorethere were many articles of value besides this property and land. such as arms. military stores. munitions. and ships of war. which were the common property of the States. when acting in their independent characters as confederates. which neither the new Government nor any one else would have a right to take possession of. or control. without authority from them. and it was to place these things under the guardianship and protection of the new Government. and to clothe it with the necessary powers. that the clause was inserted in the Constitution which gives Congress the power To dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belongIng to the United States. It was intended for a specific purpose. to provide for the things we have mentioned. It was to transfer to the new Government the property then held in common by the States. and to give to that Government power to apply It to the objects for which it had been destined by mutual agreement .among the States before their league was dissolved. It applied only to the property which the States held in common at that time. and has no reference whatever to any territory or other property which the new sovereignty might afterwards itself acquire."},{"1":"7.102871e+08","2":"1931","3":"S","4":"COPELAND","5":"97","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"That is correct.

The Box amendment was before the committee and everybody was for it. but because three railroad men came before the committee and a couple of sugarbeet planters came before the committee you heard no more about the Box resolution..so that all this talk about keeping down the number in order to protect American labor is all bunk. As long as immigrant labor will submit to exploitation and work under miserable conditions at low wages there is no talk of immigration restriction. The committee had opportunity to do it. but they refused to do it. The. hearings had before the committee speak for themselves. Those hearings are full. and fully prove beyond doubt that the Committee on Immigration have not really the- Interests of American labor at heart. I will stand by what is in those hearings. I want to say. in all fairness. that the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Box] is standing loyally by his flanme -and is in no way responsible for the neglect of the committee to act. We have had a great deal of talk about the depression in agriculture. We have heard the talk that we have too many people engaged in agriculture. Here we provide for bringing some more in. always. of course. if they will work for low wages. This House would vote for any amendment to the immigration law that would permit the entry of fathers and mothers as citizens. The committee knows it and will not dare to put it to the House. We can not under suspension of the rules as this bill is being considered offer an amendment as to fathers and mothers of citizens. and the committee proposes to jam this measure down under a suspension of the rules. and the best test of their unwillingness to consider this matter upon the merits is that you divide the time for the discussion of the bill only among those who favor the bill. No other committee of this House would do that. If it were the purpose of the Committee on Immigration to prevent competition with American labor they could have stopped 300.000 Mexicans each year at the boundary. When the immigrants come from southeastern Europe they already have their relatives here. they have their contact here. and they do not go to work for starvation wages under the padrone system. That is why they are undesirable to the committee and employers of cheap labor. But you go down to the Mexican border. as the hearings show. and there they hire those people and pay them shamefully low wages and work them all hours of the day and night. and you do not hear anything from them about the restriction of immigration."},{"1":"6.902221e+08","2":"1927","3":"H","4":"HAUGEN","5":"1289","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. in response to questions asked by the gentleman from Minnesota in respect to the Senate amendments to H. R. 15474. the farm relief bill. as stated. in order that the bill might be disposed of before adjournment on Thursday. time did not permit discussing the proposed amendments in detail during the reading of the bill. Inasmuch as the bill and amendments had been before the House and under consideration for four days. and in order that the bill might be passed on that day. Thursday. it did not seem necessary or advisable to discuss the bill or amendments further in detail. and. therefore. as stated I would. avail myself of the privilege. under the rule. to print. to set out. and briefly comment on the amendments. Senate 4808. as introduced in the Senate. and H. R. 15474. as introduced in the House. are identical in principle and in text. except in section 1. in respect to the declaration of policy. Line 8 of the Senate bill. after the word  commodities. the following words are eliminated: To prevent such surpluses from unduly depressing the prices obtained for such commodities. And section 6. page 10. lines 21 to 26. inclusive: The operation of the board in any basic agricultural commodity under this act shall be conducted in such manner. -and the agreements entered Into by the board during such operations shall be upon such terms as will. in the Judgment of the board. carry out the policy declared by section 1. While the specific direction of policythat isto prevent such surpluses from unduly depressing the prices. and that the operations of the board and the agreements entered into shall be upon such terms and in such manner as to carry out the policy declaredwould make it clear as to the psiwposes of the bill and serve the board as a guide. and eliminate discussion in that respect. the declaration of policy. section 1. declares it to be the policy of Congress to promote the orderly marketing of basic agricultural commodities. to provide for the control and disposition of surpluses of such commodities . to stabilize the market against undue and excessive fluctuations. to preserve a dvantageous domestic markets. to minimize speculation and waste in marketing such commodities. and to encourage the organization of producers of such commodities into cooperative marketing associations. which gives the board power to promote orderly marketing. to stabilize markets. and to enter into agreements with cooperative associations to remove. withhold. or disp6se of the surplus of basic agricultural commodities. and to thus bring about a balanced condition between agriculture. industry. and labor. and to prevent the exportable surplus from establishing the price of the whole crop. and thereby carry out the outstanding purpose of the bill. Of course. anything short of that particular purpose would fail to carry out the policy. Considering the makeup of the board. and the responsibility of its makeup lodged in the producers. as well as the boards responsibility in the matter. it is fair to assume that we may have the service of a board in sympathy with the particular purpose of the bill. and it would seem safe. therefore. to place confidence in the board to carry out the outstanding purpose of the bill. to establish a parity between agricultural commodities and the products of industry and labor. Section 2 (b) is amended which adds two members to the nominating committee. and provides that two of the members in each district shall be elected by a majority vote of the heads of the agricultural departments of the several States in each Federal land bank district. which. in effect. adds two members to the nominating committee. and provides that two additional members in each district- shall be elected by the heads of the agricultural departments of the various States. Section 6. at end of line 19. page 8. paragraph c in respect to the board commencing operations. is amended by providing that in any State where not as many as 50 per cent of the producers are members of cooperative associations. an expression from the producers of the commodity shall be obtained through a State convention of such producer. and at the end of line 4. page 9. there is added that until the board shall become satisfied that a majority of the producers favor such action. which in effect provides that the board shall be satisfied that the majority of the producers favor the commencement or termination of the operating period. These last two mentioned amendments place additional safeguards. to the extent that two additional members are added to the nominating committee and requires an expression from the producers of the commodity in States where not as many as 50 per cent of the producers are members of the cooperative associations. Section 6. paragraph (a). section 15 (4) and (a) (4) are. amended so that the board may in its discretion treat as a separate basic commodity one or more of such classes or types of tobacco as are designated in the classification of the Department of Agriculture. This in effect leaves it to the discretion of the board to add tobacco as a basic agricultural commodity. With the prevailing conditions in the tobacco market. there can be no objection to giving them the benefit of the advantages offered by the bill. Section 6. paragraph (e). and section 11. paragraphs (a). (b). and (d). are amended. giving the power to the board to insure such commodities against undue and excessive fluctuations in market conditions and to insure any cooperative marketing association against decline in the market price for the commodity. at the time of the sale by the association. from the market price of such commodity at the time of delivery to the association. This makes it more clear as to the power of the board in protecting cooperative associations or producers against losses under agreements entered into. It goes without saying -that any agency or producer entering into agreement with the board. as provided in section 6. paragraph (e). which provides forthe payment into the slabilization fund for such commodity of profits after deducting the costs and charges provided for in the agreement of any such association. corporation. or person. arising out of such purchase. storage. or sale. or other disposition or contract thereforcan not. of course. if they may not share In the profits above the specified amount agreed upon be expected to carry the losses. Although the bill provides a guaranty against losses. there can be no objection to adding the insurance provision. Section 12. pages 17 and 18. the following words are added to paragraph (b) : For the purpose of developing continuity of cooperative services. including unified terminal marketing facilities and equipment. And this section Is also changed to make funds available for the purpose of furnishing funds to cooperative association$. engaged in the purchase. storage. or sale. or other disposition. or processing of any agricultural commodity. and provides funds to be used by it as capital for any agricultural credit corporation. Again referring to the makeup of the board. it goes without saying that the board having the best interests of the producers at heart. and the purposes of the bill in mind. would not enter into agreements to carry out any of the numerous impracticable plans promoted In the past. resulting in millions of dollars of losses to the investors. Section 15 definitions. (2) Is amended so as to read the term processing means spinnig. milling. or any manufacturing of cotton other than ginning. The House bill provided that processing means ginning. The amendment provides the equalization fee may be collected at spinning. milling. or other mnufacture of cotton other than ginning. which I understand meets with the general approval of the representatives of cotton growers. and to which. in my opinion. there can be no objection.

I now ask your consideration of another aspect of this question. Much of the propaganda in behalf of this resolution comes from the political agents of the Government. the officials of the United States. And this is one of the dangers confronting the American system of government. We employ and pay from the Federal Treasury large sums of money to establish great bureaus. and then these bureaus inaugurate intensive propaganda for their own enlargement. We vote sums to bureaus to increase their powers and personnel. and behind these bureaucratic walls these very officials become Irresponsible to the interest and deaf to the cry of the people. In the States the proximity and responsibility of officials to the people are close. thereby giving to the people ail interest in and a control over their agents. with consequent increasing knowledge among the people of the subjects administered and a more concrete sense of obligation of tie officials to the people. Tile magnitude of our country and people. if nothing else. necessitates our dual system of government. Mr. Lincoln declared in his first inaugural address thatto maintain inviolate the rights of the States to order and control under the Constitution their own affairs by their own judgment exclusively is essential for the preservation of that balance of power on which our institutions rest. And these institutions. it is obvious to comment. are equally the States and the Union. Fiske. a great publicist and historian. also declared thatIf the day should ever (which God forbid) arrive when the people from the different parts of our country should allow their local affairs to be administered by prefects sent from Washington. and when selfgovernment of the States shall have been so far lost as that of the departments of France. or even so far as that of the counties of England. on that day the progressive political career of the American people will have come to an end and the hopes that have been built upon it for the future happiness and prosperity of mankind will be wrecked forever. Chief Justice Chase. in the case of Texas v. Whites (7 Wallace. 700. 725). decided in 1868. pronounced the judgment thatUnder the Constitution. though the powers of the States uere much restricted. still all powers not delegated to the United States nor prohibited to the States are reserved to the States. respectively. or to the people. And we have already had occasion to remark at this term that  the people of each State compose a State having its own government and endowed with all the functions essential to separate and independent existence. and that  without the States In union there could be no such political body as the United States. Not only. therefore. can there be no loss of separate and independent autonomy to the States through their union tinder the Constitution. but It may be not unreasonably said that the preservation of the States and the mintemince of their governments are as much within the design and care of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union and the maintenance of the National Government. The Constitution In all its provisions looks to an indestructible Union. composed of indestructibli States. The indestructible state mentioned by this great jurist did not contemplate indestructible geographical units with feeble and negligible political powers. but al indestructible political entity historically recognized for centuries in the philosophy ofgovernments as a sovereign statehaving its own government. and endowed with all the functions essential to separate and independent existence. Moreover. the corollary is inevitable that in our dual systems of governments neither government is authorized to destroy the other. but each must respect and preserve the other. By amendment after amendment these essential functions are being reduced to Impotency. We lop off one limb from the tree of the States to engraft it upon the Federal Constitution. only to observe the lessening of community responsibility and the enfeebling of community vigor. But now comes this radical anlendment that goes further than the amputation of the limbit digs up the very roots of the tree. The administration of the powers. conferred by the proposed amendment will necessarily invade every community and home. Federal espionage will haunt every fireside. But the reply is made that the amendment only enables tile Federal Governmeat to cooperate. that it will be a system of assistance. and not of domination of the States. If this be true. then what is the necessity for the amendment? The proposed amendment gives power to regulate child labor. This word is comprehensive.

The wages paid in the cotton mills of this country and the manner in which women and children have been worked in those mills is a national disgrace. I have before me a pamphlet entitled Wages and hours in American industry. prepared by the National Industrial Conference Board and published in 1921. This concern is composed of manufacturers. and the cotton manufacturers of the country occupy a prominent place in it. In this pamphlet they have a chapter on cotton manufacturing. and in that chapter they give what they call classified payroll data. Among other things. this data shows for a typical month in 1914 and for six months of 1920 and six months of 1921 the average weekly earnings in the cotton factories. North and South. of women. and male skilled and male unskilled labor. and the average for all. By multiplying the amount of weekly earnings. as given in the pamphlet of this manufacturers association. by 52. it is obvious that one gets the total amount the laborer could earn if he worked every week in the year. Constructed on this basis you get the following table: Gottonmill workers yearly earnings (for 52 weeks employment). 1914 1920 1921 NORTH.

The cotton manufacturer pays his labor just Mr. President. it ought to be enough to say that labor today as little as possible without any regard to tariff legislation or in the United States is paid less in the purchasing power of its wage than at the beginning of this century. No man who has taken the trouble to go into the figures showing the increase in the cost of the necessaries of life will dispute that statement for a moment. I have submitted to the Senate ample proof on that subject. It Is overwhelming. The shrinkage in the purchasing power of the dollar is such that the actual wage of labor in the United States today is below what it was at the beginning of the present century. measured by the purchasing power of the dollar. The purchasing power of the dollar today Is 38 cents as compared with what it was in 1901. The table which I have presented demonstrates beyond all question that the profits of the manufacturer have little to do with the wages of the worker. no matter what the manufacturers profits may be. In the cotton business. at least. its history shows that the wages paid to labor will not be voluntarily increased. I think that is true of every other industry. If 10. 20. 50. and 100 per cent annual profits do not induce the manufacturer to raise the wages of his labor above starvation level. what is the use of talking about aiding labor through a protective tariff? Never was a greater fallacy than that you could make labor prosperous by adding to the wealth of the employer. Not one cent of the millions or billions that go into the employers pockets as the result of a protective tariff in excess of the fair margin of profit ever benefits labor. That is an axiom that applies to the cotton schedule and the woolen schedule and the steel schedule and every other similar schedule in this bill. Of course. it is true that if a manufacturing business can not be conducted and some moderate profit realized it will in time be abandoned. and labor thereby will lose employment. But if it can be conducted at a moderate profit. no matter how great the wealth you may shower upon the manufacturer by embargoes. tariffs. or other favors. you will not benefit labor one cent. They will pay labor just what they are obliged to pay labor. and not one farthing more. and all the surplus of profits that come from a tariff and from other favors bestowed will be put Into the coffers of the corporations and into the pockets of those who own the business. That is why. Mr. President. the robber rates of tariff in the cotton schedule. the steel schedule. the wool schedule. and other schedules in this bill will not benefit labor in the least. but will simply enrich the great manufacturers by the hundreds of millions and billions of dollars which they will thereby be able to extort from the consuming public. and will lay upon the consumer that enormous burden in addition to that which he carries now. Mr. President. I want to say just this word In closing: I hope to be able to devote some time to the cotton schedule after its rates shall have been fully settled upon and presented by the committee to the Senate for its consideration. I want to say that I shall be fortified with proof here to show that upon every step of conversion cost. from the gray cloth to the finished product. the processes are so improved in this country that the cost in Great Britain exceeds the cost here. That is my belief. based upon cablegrams which I have received within the last 24 hours touching this subject. I hope to be able. Mr. President. to submit some observations further on this schedule at another time. and I hope to be able also to take up certain other schedules in the tariff bill and submit them to some discussion and analysis. I believe this is all I care to present at this time."},{"1":"6.603223e+08","2":"1921","3":"H","4":"BLACK","5":"293","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"In just a moment. It is the publics turn now. The pendulum has swung back the other way. and it has swung back with a vengeance so great that thousands of farmers and business men have been pushed to the verge of bankruptcy. and unless these regulatory commissions can regulate in the interest of the public at the time that it is necessary for them to do so. then regulation is a failure. because a regulatory system that will only regulate in favor of capital and labor and not in the interest of the general public would be a failure and would have to be discarded. I am making no such accusation against the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Railroad Labor Board. I have no reason to believe they will fail to function in the public interest. now that the time is approaching when necessity demands that they do so. When wheat was selling for more than $2 per bushel and corn for $1.75. and cattle and hogs in proportion. and cotton at 30 and 35 cents per pound. and cotton seed at $60 per ton. and hay at $25 per ton. these rates were not excessive. They were reasonable and fair enough. But cotton is no longer 30 and 35 cents per pound. but is dragging at onethird that price. Corn is no. longer $1.75 per bushel. but is selling in the principal markets at very much less than onehalf that figure. Also wheat. cattle. hogs. wool. hay. and practically all raw products have undergone a radical decline.

It was called for the purpose of considering the legislation proposed in House bill 4630. Iittle has been heard from the farmers of the country upon this subject. I am sure the committee will be glad to consider the resolutions adopted by the conference. as follows: Your committee begs leave to report as follows:  That tae conference called at Fargo May 23. 1917. for the purpose of discussing governmental control of food prices. hereby goes on record for the following principles:  1. We believe that the present war emergency and the worldwide shortage necessitate that our Federal Government shall take upon itsell larger powers. in order to encourage greater food production and to control the sale and distribution of food products. We believe thai such action would be in the Interest of producers and consumers.  2. We favor a rigid governmental guaranty to the farmers o1 profitable prices for staple farm products. Such guaranties are neces sary for farmers to know bow to reorganize their farming operationi and to secure an Increased production. Such reorganization incur .xtra outlays of capital and extra expenses for labor and other essen tial factors. In.the event that the Government should see fit to flx the prices of food products that farmers shall obtain. we also favor a rigid governmental control of the prices of other commodities than food. -such as fuel. clothing. and agricultural requirements necessary or incident to the manufacturing and the mobilization of farm products. We believe that the principal factor in determining the prices of farm products to farmers should be the aveagecost of producing such products. . -3. We earnestly suggest that in line with the course of othr warring nations the Government shad immediately prepare itself to seize and operate. whenever and wherever necessary. all transportation agencies and terminal elevators and warehquses.  4. We hereby empower the committee which has been designated to represent us at Washington to systematize and present all necessary data and to ascertain the wishes of this conference and of other graingrowing Interests as to what is considered by the farmers to be a failprice guaranty on the standard grades of grain.  5. This conference also takes the opportunity to express its loyalty to the President and the Government of the United States. and to state the desire of farmers organizations of the Northwest represented here to cooperate In the working out of this most important policy of foodproduction control.   6. Your committee. after careful consideration of such facts and data as it has available. Is of the opinion that the prices guaranteed by the GoVernment for our 1917 crop of wheat shall be $2.50 per bushel for No. 1 northern wheat. at northwestern terminals. and we believe that toe delegation to be sent to Washington to represent this conference shall use every legitimate method to establish this price."},{"1":"6.401899e+08","2":"1916","3":"S","4":"McKELWAY","5":"912","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"They contribute about $60.000 a yearmost of them from $2 to $25 a year. They are a perfectly selfsustaining organization. and McKelway will sustain himself as long as they will permit him to keep his contract with the Treasury. So this agitation will go on. Mr. President. All I can say is that I hope and I know that when this bill is passed. either in the House or tile Senate form. and is brought before the Supreme Court. that court will know that they are at the parting of the ways between a Federal Government of sovereign States with a central Government exercising only the powers that were delegated to it and necessarily implied from those delegated. and a centralized Government here in Washington. which. under the guise of controlling commerce among the States can say to any individual State in the land. whether it Is the wheatgrowing State of Minnesota. or tile Dakotas. or the cottongrowing State of Texas. or the manufacturing State of New York. or the mining and mineral State of Pennsylvania.  Gentlemen. in our opinion. soandso is for the public benefit. and until you meet our views upon that question. change all your conditions and customs and laws according to the standard that the representatives of other States meet here in this centralized Government and set up. you have an enlbargo placed around yjou. you have a circle of fire around your State that you can not go through. I know that the Supreme Court will understand that thley are up against a change in the form of our Government. It is not simply the passage of this bill. but if it is sustained by the court we shall have changed our form of government. The Senate and the House of Representatives are sitting here almost like the British Parliament. not with the direct authority to do these things in any State. but saying. under the strained construction given to these opinions of our highest courtwhich is the law. and we can not question itthat we can exercise every power specifically granted by the Constitution to demand conditions and arrangements in your State. and nobody can question it. Tie Senator from Ohio [Mr. PomEaENE]. who. I think. is too good a lawyer to stick to the opinion that lie delivered here this afternoon. intimates that because the preanlble of the Constitution says that. in order to form a Union and to promote the general welfare these specific powers are delegated to Congress. and all other powers are reserved to the donors. that anything that we think is for the general welfareI have heard of the general  beforecan be done. IfI we only think it is for the general welfare we can do It under any clause. we can need not hunt out the connerce clause of the Constitution. because every grant of power from the States or from tile people of the States to the central Government was to be exercised for the general welfare. of course. Under that theory. we can tax them all to death. because we think it is for their welfare to tax themand I do not know but what we have started upon that course also. Mr. Presidentbut I do not see why other. Senators can not see that they are opening an entirely new door in this country. and I can not see why they do not see that It is an undesirable door to open. The Senator from Georgia the other day said that we were lifting the lid of Pandoras box of evils. and so we are. The worst of it is that we are doing it thinking that we are acting in a holy cause. But. Mr. President. it means the beginning of the downfall of the kind of Government that we and our fathers and everybody who has lived between them and us had thought had been established in this country. I do not think Senators would feel about this thing if they were back home the way they feel about it here. at least I judge the way they feel by the way they are going to vote. I know if I were a member of my State legislature or the governor of my State and I saw that this proposition was pendIng in Congressthat Congress was assuming authority to control all tile men. women. and children In my State. to fix the hours of labor and the wages at which people might earn a living. and the power to cast out into starvation and to make tramps of a lot of ablebodied boys who would not go to school. but wanted to workthat such a bill was pending here and my Senators or Representatives were going to vote for it I would take the first train down here and tellthem what the people at home thought about that sort of thing. You are transferring to the General Government your local home rule and your local home government and the control of your own personal affairs. which. of course. the Government is interested in. because tile whole is interested in the welfare of all its parts. but this Government is founded upon the principle that everything shall be done by the people within their. own States at home. especially about their own conditions of work and labor. and that nothing shall be (lone down here to interfere with that except what is expressly delegated to this Government to do."},{"1":"6.303874e+08","2":"1915","3":"S","4":"LODGE","5":"55","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I agree with the Senator from South.

I will answer the :Senatores question as I proceed. I had intended to discuss that -question. We must .remember that from *1900 to 1911. a period of about 12 years. 72 per cent of this ne . immigration came from .southern and western Europe. Of that72 per cent ofthe entire im.migration. 82 per cent went into the Atlantic division of States. where the manufacturing Industries are so fully developed. .and of this number substantially 60 per cent were farm laborers in the countries from which they came. And yet this 82 per cent .have avoided our farms and have gone to these great manufacturing centers and have taken possession of the unskilled branches of labor and receive .the lowest wages of any of those who are engaged .in the manufactures. About onethird of our -Present immigration is of the Old .type. and they are almost wholly skilled laborers. and take the higher and betterpaid branches of labor .in the industries of the country. The change that has come about since 1882 is shown in the last -census. which speaks of the old -element of .immigration.and. the new -elementthat is. the foreign born still living in this -countryin this way: .According to ithe last census It appears that in the 10 years preceding 1910 there has been a decrease to tileextent of 300.000 in foreignborn residents coming -from Great Britain. Ireland. Scotland. Germany. and the Scandinavian States. while the increase of those coming from southern and western Europe has gone :from 1.800.000 -to -5.000.000. or an -increase of 3.200.000 in the 10 years. I stated. in an interruption that .I made while the Senator from Missouri was speaking. that the Immigration Commission made an investigation of 37 of the principal industries of Ithe United States east of the Rocky Mountains. They came in contact with 620.000.individual operatives.in these industries. They ifound that .taking -.them all together 59.9 per cent. almost 60per cent. were foreign born. but -they alsofound that the Immigrants of the old immigration were occupying the good positions. those requiring skilled labor. while those of the new immigration. those who have been coming in suchnumbers during the last 10 years. were performing the lower grades of work. and were treceiving -correspondingly low prices for .their labor. In the iron and steel :industries. slaughtering. meatpacking. wool and the manufacturing of wool and worsted. coml. copper. .leather. cotton goods. clothing. and silk goods. the average number of foreign born found in those industries amounted to 65.6 per cent of the whole."},{"1":"6.200730e+08","2":"1912","3":"H","4":"CARLIN","5":"419","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. I consider myself as warm a friend of the District of Columbia as any Member of this body. Both by my voice and my vote I have consistently advocated every measure that tended to the improvement of this great national city. and I propose to continue to do so. because I believe that every citizen of this great country should and does feel a proper pride in this beautiful city. But when gentlemen who live at great distances from Washington undertake to make the State or any part of It that I represent in this body the dumping ground for all the filth of the District of Columbia. they can only do it over my protest. and they must do it consistently with the rules of this House. It is only a few short months since the Committee on the District of Columbiawhich it seems to me spends more time in trying to write into appropriation bills matters that have no place there than they do in investigating matters of great concern to the people of this Districtundertook to place another prison under the shadow of Mount Vernon in the State which I in part represent. and the gentleman from Ohio and his associates insisted in the presence of this body and of the American people that it was a splendid thing. and that it ought to be put there. Now. we are told that this nauseating garbage plant. the effluvia of which he thinks would be a delight to everybody passing up and down the Potomac River. ought to be placed in the State of Virginia. Mr. Chairman. if this is a bad thing. we do not want it. and if it is a good thing. for Gods sake do not deprive the people of the District of Columbia of its beneficial results. You start with this garbage proposition at the foot of Seventh Street. and transport these thousands of tons of garbage all the way down the Potomac to Occoquan. and there the garbage stays. sending its effluvia throughout that whole section of country before it is put into this delightful deodorizing plant. like the one which seems to have been erected near Columbus.

That is to say. the Senate has increased the limit of cost $200.000. exclusive of indirect charges. Now. under our system in the navy yard. we have to charge up the indirect charges against the cost of the ship."},{"1":"6.101534e+08","2":"1910","3":"S","4":"JOHNSTON","5":"1489","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. the chairman of the committee was entirely correct in saying that the committee was unanimous in reporting this resolution favorably. But they were not unanimous that the resolution should pass. They were perfectly willing and desired to submit to the Senate whether it should embark on this enterprise at a cost of $65.000. and they wanted the advice of the Senate before doing so. The chairman says that the purpose of It is to get the present retail prices. We have been engaged for nearly two months now In the work of the committee. We have examined a number of witnesses. and we have devoted patient time and consideration to the subject We have gathered a mass of facts and testimony. We have practical Information as to the wholesale prices of the articles. especially in the food line. and I do not see that we should spend $65.000 to find out what are the retail prices. I do not see what good that would accomplish. Necessarily the retail prices In the various cities will differ more widely than the wholesale prices. In the same town you will find one man selling steak at 25 cents a pound and another at 20 cents. I do not see that the committee will arrive at any conclusion except the conclusion well known by every family in the United States. that the prices are infinitely higher now than they were ten years ago. That is a fact which is already in evidence before the committee. but we are unable to report upon the cause. and when we obtain the retail prices of these numerous articles throughout the country we will be no nearer a conclusion than we are now. This morning. or yesterday. I clipped from a paper a telegram from New York in which the following is stated: NEW YORK. April 16. As the price of meat started downward In the past twentyfour hours meat dealers and importers announced that they have discovered the solution to the high cost of living puzzle. They intend importing meat in great quantities from Australia and Argentine Republic just as England does. Then. instead of being compelled to buy socalled meattrust Psroducts. paying trust prices. the dealers get meat. which they claim s of the same quality. at from 3 to 6 cents per pound cheaper. The meat trust made its first hostile movement today to check the incipient importation of beef. mutton. and pork. when plans were made to ask the Government to stop the influx of foreign meat on the ground that it was not properly inspected. At least a score of meat dealers In Brooklyn who have taken advautage of the Australian beef. today started to undersell the houses r.elying on the beef trust. The beef trust gets its meat from western and Mexican cattle. while. if Australian importations grow. this meat will probably be landed upon the Pacific coast and sent east by rail. While England relies very largely upon Australia and Argentina for Its meats. the distance to the United States is much less than it is to England. It was announced today that aside from the lower price of foreign meat the cost of living was gradually declining in Greater New York. Since April 1 pork has fallen nearly $2 per barrel. and hogs $2 per hundredweight. Sayles Zahn. owner of a chain of meat shops. declared today that the trust could be forced to lower prices by importing foreigngrown meat. The Australian meat Is better than the trust beef. said he.  In addition to this. we are able to undersell at the rate of from 3 to 6 cents per pound. The Zahn houses have brought In 500 sheep. 3.000 lambs. and 1.000 sides of beef within the past two days. and have 2.000 sides of beef on the way now. not to mention options on 100.000 sheep and nearly as many cattle. The sudden dropping in prices. due to imported meat In the poorer sections of the city. nearly resulted in rioting. so overjoyed were the people. some of whom had been unable to afford meat as a diet for weeks. The butchers and meat dealers are talking of banding together for the importation in order to contest any action which the trust may start. It is feared that the trust will wait until the meat dealers have a great deal of Imported meat on hand and then break the prices so that it must all be sold at a loss. If this be true. it makes a material fact to be ascertained by our committee. and it gives a reason why we are paying higher for these articles now than in the past. Yesterday the following telegram was published in the Post of this city: NEw YORK. April 19. The present sensational drop In the price of potatoes may mean cheaper food of all kinds. Farmers are closing out their supply of old potatoes for as little as 20 cents a bushel. which is the lowest price in many years. Other foods are also cheaper. As a result of its investigations the American Agriculturist for April 23 will say : A marked decline has occurred in the prices of certain food products. If this decline continues much longer. the commissions that are investigating high prices will find themselves out of a job. Compared to the high point in wheat last year. the present market at Chicago shows a decline of 17 cents a bushel. The decline in corn from the high point of last year is 19 cents and oats 20 cents. In other words. the present wholesale price of oats is 32 per cent below the highest prices of last year. corn is off 24 per cent. and wheat 14 per cent.  Butter has declined 6 percent. eggs have gone off. as usual in the spring. Even beef cattle have no more than held the high quotations of March. and hogs are a trifle off. although still very high. and prices of sheep and lambs well maintained. There has been a break in the price of hay at country points in the West. Beans are also cheaper. Altogether Indications multiply that a reaction in food prices has taken place. With good crops in 1910. we may expect the price of food to consumers to be considerably lower than during the past twelve or eighteen months. although we do not look for a return to the phenomenally low prices of ten and twenty years ago. CHICAGO. April 19. Chicago butter dealers declared today that an investigation of conditions under which the Elgin butter board fixes prices has been started. with a view to presenting the evidence to the United States district attorney. T. E. Purcell. one of the Chicago dealers. who was at Elgin. said today : I  The Elgin committee. as a rule. makes the price without a single sale. and we have to suffer from it for the rest of the week. PITTSBURO. April 19. Hogs dropped 40 cents a hundred here today. The record price made less than a month ago was $11.85. Todays best price was $9.40. Mr. President. I think the committee ought to take up these statements and find out the facts in regard to them. If beef and fresh meat can be imported and sold here at 6 cents a pound cheaper than the present price. notwithstanding the tariff on those articles. the country ought to know it. I am opposed to the adoption of the resolution. I am satisfied that it would require at least four months time. as the chairman has stated. But a little while longer would be required for the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Commerce and Labor to gather these facts without any cost through the agencies they already have. I do not see why we should embark upon it when it can be done with probably a delay of only a couple of months. If we delay four months we will be too late to introduce any legislation at the present session of Congress. and if it comes in in six months we will be able to in. troduce it at the next session. The creation of the committee was justified by one bill that it reported here. the bill in regard to cold storage. but I do not think if we will sit all summer and employ the agents which are called for by the resolution we would be any nearer a conclusion as to the cause than we are now. We know that the fact exists. and we know practically.how much greater the cost is than it was ten years ago. It seems to me that the Senators on the other side of the Chamber would not consider it so imperative now to ascertain the cost of high living as the question whether they shall be allowed to live any longer or not. The recent elections indicate that there will be a struggle for existence by our friends on the other side. I hope. Mr. President. that the resolution will not pass."},{"1":"6.100511e+08","2":"1909","3":"S","4":"hALE","5":"227","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Before this matter passes from the Senate i will be brought out how superficial and inadequate was thi. socalled examination made by this committee into the conditions of labor affecting this industry in Canada. Some of us. Mr. President. have passed our lives on the border. and we go into Canada. and we see the condition of labor compared with our labor. I know what it is in the State of Maine. across ah imaginary line. a part of the way between Maine and New Brunswick. and when you pass from Maine and its industries and its population and its manner of living into New Brunswick you pass as clearly into a new condition as.if you went into another generation. My colleague and I know this. It is knowledge from constant experience and observation. It is knowledge that comes from observation of conditions. and it is worse than useless. and to us it is not much better than nonsense. to talk about the equality of wages and the price of wages in Canada and the United States. I know it by observation. traversing hundreds of miles repeatedly. and it is a part of the policy of this warfare that is made by the newspapers against this industry to ignore what some of us know to be the difference between the conditions in labor here and there."},{"1":"6.000645e+08","2":"1908","3":"H","4":"LOVERING","5":"1527","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"If the gentleman will wait. he will see that I have referred to that point and that I recognize that fact. As I said at the hearing. I hoped they would do this. and if they did present such a bill as was satisfactory. I would gladly support it. I did not complain that the bill for a commission was tabled. for I thought it no more than fair that the committee should have every opportunity to perfect their own bill. And still the time went on and no agreenent was reached. and now the chairman of the committee has come round to the idea of a commission. though to my mind too large and too unwieldy to be practicable. If it had been designed to make it abortive and futile. it could not have been better conceived. Meantime the Senate passed and sent over to the House the Aldrich bill. as a purely emergency measure. recognizing the fact that if a radically new financial system was to be adopted it would take time. and that work should be committed to a commission. As the Aldrich bill finally passed the Senate it was obviously in such shape that it could not pass this House without material amendments. I could not vote for it as it was. I would have been glad to have seen it amended. and would have voted for it. but I understand that the Committee on Banking and Currency has -tabled it without any attempt to alter or amend it. And now comes the Vreeland bill. which retains the best features of the Aldrich bill and extends the basis for currency circulation to commercial credits. in the shape of commercial paper. and I stand ready to support it as an emergency measure. still holding to the necessity of passing a currency commission bill. Now. Mr. Chairman. I think I look at this question from a practical business standpoint. at least. I am trying to. With me it is a live question and a serious matter which concerns my personal business interests. It is no academic question with me. What do I see? More than 20.000 workmen in the employ of concerns in the management of which I and my family are interested working short time and some at reduced -wages. It is of vital importance to us all that we should resume work full time at the earliest moment. This can not be until trade improves. Half a business always means a loss to every industry doing a half business in the country. You can not make a profit In running any concern half time. I do not care what it is. Trade will not revive until confidence Is restored. Confidence will not be restored until we have the assurance that no such crisis and panic as we saw last fall shall recur. and we can have no such assurance until we have written on the statute book some such law as the Vreeland or Aldrich bill to stand as a barrier between us and a panic. It is amusing to hear the charge made that a panic is either a Democratic .or a Republican panic. Crises may be the result of party action. and they may not. but panics will come as long as bad men are treacherous. as long as good men are timid. and as long as fools are reckless. A panic is an unreasoning animal instinct. Selfpreservation Is the first law of nature in man or beast. What so surely can prevent or allay a panic among people escaping from a burning building as the knowledge that there are ample and varied exits for escape? What so surely can allay a currency panic as the knowledge that an adequate supply of currency can be had whenever and wherever needed? The other escape from the building may never be used. the other supply of currency may never be tapped. What would you say if you were down in a mine and there was but one exit of escape. You yourself. everyone of us. would be subject to panic. but if we knew there were other outlets. although they might not have been in use for years. it would at once set us at rest. it would at once allay the panic. One word on the size of the commission proposed. Is it reasonable to expect that so large a commission as fortythree. drawn from all over the United States. can be got together and held for five or six months to attend to its appointed duties? If twentyone men outside of Congress can be found who are big enough and capable enough to serve on such a commission. they would be likely to have such important interests of their own as to make it impossible for them to attend. A report and bill from such a currency commission. to have any weight with Congress. should be a unanimous measure. I can not help feeling that there is a great deal more apprehension in the public mind on the subject of financial legislation than there need be. I do not believe that there is one. and only one. practicable workable plan that is possible. Indeed. I believe there are many plans that would be successfully operative either one of which might answer equally well every public need. On the other hand. I do not believe that any financial scheme could be adopted in which some one could not pick flaws. and perhaps. to their own satisfaction. demolish. It all depends upon whether it was for their interest to pervert the use of a system to unlawful purposes. The world has moved on since the days of Hamilton. and it is doubtful whether if he were with us today he could devise a scheme of finance that would close every door to modern cupidity. Conditions with which we have to deal are totally different from those presented to him. Men were not then the lawbreakers that they are today. Whether it was that they were better than they are now. or whether it was that they had not learned how to strain and break the laws. as we do. it matters not. This we do know. that no sooner is a law made today than the best legal talent in the country is employed to find some way to evade it. or to find a way over. through. or under it. In fact. the best paid lawyers today are those who can do what the late Sydney Bartlett said his client wanted him to do. He said: You want me to show you how to do an Illegal thing In a legal way. No sooner is a currency bill brought out than every banker takes his pencil and figures out how much extra money his bank is going to make under it. Yes. and if he finds that he is going to make a small amount. and that some other banker in some other section of the country is going to make more than he can make. why. then. that is a sufficient reason why he should condemn it. forgetting that the public needs are to be met. forgetting that his bank will profit by the facilities the public will derive from the increased issue of circulation. even though it be taken out by some other bank. We have listened to several Members of the House upon finance. but. with the exception of Mr. FOWLER and Mr. WILLIAMS. we have had no affirmative propositions for currency reform. We have listened In rapt attention to the very able and instructive essay of the gentleman from Ohio on  Financial crises. but we listened in vain for any plan to guide us out of the wilderness of our perplexities. We listened to two very able speeches of the gentleman from Connecticut . and while they were overflowing with prophecies of dire misfortune if we adopted any of the measures proposed. yet he failed to indicate by a single word what should be done. Not a single constructive proposition did he suggest or advocate. He was forceful in his condemnation of every propbsition that har been submitted to this House. with the exception of a commission. I do not propose to criticise these gentleman beyond calling attention to the fact that from men so well informed as they are we had a right to expect some proposition of an affirmative and constructive character. I do not propose to criticise them. because I myself am disposed to leave the permanent reorganization of our financial system to a commission. but I do feel that some effective emergency measure should be adopted at this session of Congress. I did not vote for four battle ships. because I do not believe there is any danger of a war. but I do believe there may be a panic. and. at all events. I would have at least one good financial battle ship in the shape of an emergency measure such as is proposed in the Vreeland bill. I shall. therefore. vote for this bill. and earnestly hope it may be adopted by this House."},{"1":"5.901839e+08","2":"1907","3":"S","4":"DICK","5":"318","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I renew the motion to lay on the table the motion of the Senator from Montana.

The resolution which was adopted yesterday seeks to furnish to the Senate precisely the same information. which is whether the Government owes these postmasters anything or not. and. if it owes these men anything. how much?

I do not believe it is fair or honest to retain information which deals with what the Government owes for services. and a Senate resolution asking for information so pertinent to so vital a question. it seems to me. is fairly answerable by the Department. and whether it entails labor or cost is not a matter of so much moment. it seems to me. as fair dealing with our public servants."},{"1":"5.900550e+08","2":"1906","3":"H","4":"NORRIS","5":"103","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Just a moment.

As the gentleman well understands and knows. under the law of 1890. which proivdes as a maximum $12 a month for pensions. all soldiers who go on under that law did not get $12. but it must be shown that the disabilities are permanent before $12 is paid. and the Cleveland order merely assumed that the disabilities were permanent where he reached 75 years of age provided he had gotten on the pension rolls under the law. That is. that he had proved he was sufferiig from disability. not contracted by his own vicious habits. which prevented him from doing manual labor. He had to show that first. and then if he were 75 years of age or when he became 75 years of age it was assumed that he was permanently disabled. and he was given the full amoimt. Now. the difference between thatwhich I do not think was right. because I do not think they had a right to assume a fact that the law required to be provenand this is that this does not require any proof at all. but assumes the whole state of the law as soon as a man proves he is 62 years of age."},{"1":"5.800749e+08","2":"1904","3":"H","4":"VAN DUZER","5":"1258","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Speaker. I have examined with considerable care the bill which has been introduced here by the distinguished gentleman from Washington . and which is now before the House for consideration. and I wish to say that I am heartily in favor of its passage. relating. as it does. to the opening up to settlement of an Indian reservation. the lands of which will thus become fruitful and productive under the operation of the Newlands national irrigation act. This bill appeals to me strongly because it involves an addition to the public domain of a large body of land which will hereafter become available for the home seeker who is now looking westward with hope for his future habitation. This particular bill involves the opening of an Indian reservation in the State of Washington which contains much land that will come under the administration of the reclamation commission provided for by the Newlands Act. The application and effect of this bill is local. but the question of irrigation. to which it relates. is a question now of national importance. and it is upon that subject that I propose to address the House at this time. I The State of Nevada is now opening up great opportunities to home seekers under the beneficent operation of the Newlands national irrigation act. and I propose to say a few words concerning Nevadas development under it. I have been granted the courtesy of the House on numerous occasions. As a new Member I have had no ambition in the direction of statesmanship. and I have left the disussion of the questions of the tariff. reciprocity. imperialism. and other great questions to men whose years of experience in this House and whose national reputation entitle them and their views to consideration. but when it comes to the subject of the State of Nevada I have no hesitancy in addressing this House. because my long residence in that State certainly entitles me to speak intelligently upon her many resources and with a firm belief in her magnificent future. Finding that my remarks during the present session of Congress have led Members of the House to believe that the great State of Nevada was nothing but a mining State. that we had but one res )urce. namely. the mining industry. and that with its exhaustion we would eventually b ecome a wornout State. I have taken the floor this evening for the purpose of showing to my colleagues in Congress that however great Nevada may be as a mineral State that fifty years hence her reputation will rest more largely upon her agricultural development and growth than upon her mineral production [applause]. and one of the purposes of this speech is to let you know that under the operation of the Newlands Act we have a great future from an agricultural standpoint. When you call to mind that Nevada is one of the largest States in area in the Union. and that she has numerous valleys containing millions of acres of bench and valley lands. with a soil that is wonderfully fertile. needing only the magic touch of water to make it productive. the mind can hardly grasp the possibilities of the agricultural development of Nevada. Nevada is peculiarly favored in climatic conditions. Montana and Idaho. to the north. every few years are swept by blizzards and shriveled by severe cold waves and deep snows. while the State of Wyomingand I will concede to my friend and colleague that he has a great Stateyet. as compared with Nevada. Wyoming is a windswept and bleak plateau . while Arizona and New Mexico. whose admission to the Union as separate States I hope will some day come to pass. are subject not only to severe droughts. but to blisteringly hot winds. Nevada possesses a singularly equable climate. Blizzards are unknown. and while it is true that we have a sort of continual drought. mildly speaking . yet we have in the mountains heavy falls of snow which. yielding to the soft and gentle warmth of spring. send forth to the arid and thirsty plain streams of water which. impounded by the reservoirs soon to be built. will turn the gray sagecovered plains of Nevada into beautiful fields of alfalfa and cereals. dotted with happy homes. every township with a schoolhouse flying the American flag. and. with her churches and villages. making her an ideal agricultural community. [Loud applause.] In view of the fact that Nevada will be the first State to receive a pract cal demonstration of the success of this measure. in view of the fact that Nevada will receive more direct benefit possibly than any other of the arid States from the operation of this act. and because we have the honor of claiming the author of this great measure as one of our distinguished citizens. it is my purpose at this time to consider Nevadas development as well as the history of the Newlands national irrigation act. I shall consider Nevadas future. because from every congested city in the East. where vice. crime. and pauperism are bred [applause]. a large population is constantly yearning for the freedom of the West. From the wornout and debilitated fields and valleys of New England. where agriculture is rapidly becoming a lost art . the New Englanders are seriously thinking of enlarging and widening out their intellectuality and freedoni by going beyond the sound of the dear old Atlantics roar and finding out what there is beyond the snowcapped smnmits of the Westa land that was conquered and given to civilization by their fathers. I shall take up the history of the Ncwlands Act. on which Nevadas future depends. because the Republican party showed in the last Congressional campaign. and will more strongly show in the coming national campaign. a disposition to. claim the. credit for this great act which Mr. NEmVLAN DS. then Representative and now Senator from Nevada. originated and urged as a nonpartisan measure. I shall ask at this time the indulgence of the House to print extracts from newspaper articles. from speeches. and any and all data bearing upon either the history of the measure or upon the projects now being carried forward in the State of Nevada under direction of the reclamation service of the Geological Survey. I shall also ask permission to incorporate in my remarks for the benefit of the home seeker. who is particularly making anxious inquiry regarding this work in my State. such information from the reclamation service as will give him some definite idea as to when the project may be sufficiently completed to enable him to take advantage of it. and also statements showing how. when. and where titles to these lands may be secured. But before I proceed to take up these matters. I wish to submit a few additional facts regarding the State of Nevada. I am happy to perceive that any statement of mine regarding Nevada is at least received with some interest upon the floor of the House. and if I have omitted any fact in her history or industrial development. or if I have omitted to make any prophecy ascribing to her a little more glory and greatness than that claimed by any other State . I hope that my colleagues will have the kindness to come to me and suggest in what way I may fill up any omissions. because I assure you that any omissions I have made regarding my loyal devotion to my State are omissions not of the heart. but of the head."},{"1":"5.701306e+08","2":"1903","3":"S","4":"TILLMAN","5":"125","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Is there any thing in this billI have not had time to examine it criticallyuthorizing this new Secretary of the Department of Commerce anLd Labor to institute suits against anybody for anything?

I do not know whether I should take any note of the sentiments that have fallen from the distinguished gentleman who has just taken his seat . I understood that he was to speak in favor of the bill. r believe he has said that he will vote for it. But if any part of his speech has been directed to the bill itself. it has been to give a reason for his vote upon it. with which not one on our side will agree. Whether it was exactly to be expected of him when he took the floor in advocacy of this measure that he should attempt to put its advocates as much in a hole as he could is a question which I must leave to the gentleman himself. It has not been my habit to comment on what has been said by others. I want to stick to my subjectto the bill itselfand I shall do so. I commence by saying that this is not a measure which is advocated by us because it is a step toward free trade. and anyone who favors it upon that ground will make a mistake. Mr. Chairman. I approach this subject in an earnest spirit. far beyond any mere question of business or moneyed interest. I want to vote upon this question as a man who is looking. not to the interest of Cuba. not to the pockets of any man. not. indeed. to the mere pecuniary interest of the country. but to the general welfare of this people. And I want to say that in my opinion the vital question before us today is not whether the beetsugar industry shall be successful in the United States or not. I do not believe that this bill will interfere with a single American industry. But the vital question is not that. The vital question is whether Cuba shall have a cooly population and be another Santo Domingo. or whether it shall grow up as a free and independent nation. colonized by people who are fit to make it so. All history emphasizes what I have said. Cuba ip. too near for us to be indifferent to what goes on therenot for her sake. but for ours. To those who speak about the interests of any industry of this country. I appeal to say whether the difficulties to which we have submitted on account of Cuba are not of greater conse.. quence than the interests of any such industry in these whole United States. I appeal to my friend from Michigan or my friend from Minnesota to say whether during the old days Cuba was not the protector of the slave trade. whether the traders that ran there were not always slipping slaves into the United States. whether there was not constant friction with this nation on that account. whether. coming down to a later period. the insurrections in which the people there were engaged did not bring on collisions with this country which many times all bat went to the verge of war. whether the affair of the Virginius did not appeal to us more than any question of trade. whether the destruction of the sailors of the Maine does not always so appeal to us as we recall the awful fact and the tremendous consequences. History teaches us that we can not be indifferent to the welfare of Cuba. What is more. our own action binds us to feel such an interest. We have been strenuous in asserting the new development of the Monroe doctrine. which demanded of us that. as to all American nations. and. most of all. Cuba. we will maintain their independence. their territorial integrity. and the rights of their population against European domination. In the case of Cuba we have made it a matter of agreementThat the government of Cuba shall never enter into any treaty or other compact with any foreignpower or powers which will impair or tend to impair the independence of Cuba. nor in anv manner authorize or permit any foreign power or powers to obtain by colonization or for military or naval purposes or otherwise lodgment in or control over any portion of said island. We have claimed and exercised the right and power to intervene to prevent any foreign domination. We did this in Mexico under the Monroe doctrine. In Cuba we have made this a matter of agreement and we have agreed with Cuba that if her liberty be in danger we will maintain it. The Government of Cuba consents that the United States may exercise the right to intervene for the preservation of Cuban independence. the maintenance of a government adequate for the protection of life. property. and individual liberty. and for discharging the obligations with respect to Cuba imposed by the treaty of Paris on the United States. now to be assumed and undertaken by the Government of Cuba. Mr. Chairman. those obligations were obligations to maintain a proper government. We have assumed no control. Cuba is free. We have rather assumed the protection of the liberties of Cuba and of its people in just government. and we can not be indifferent to what sort of people there shall be there. Questions of trade. questions of commerce. are subject to the question of who will be there. What constitutes the state? Men constitute the state. If we do not pass this bill. if threequarters of the plantations of Cuba are sold under the hammer. what will happen? What better way could there be of putting them under the domination of the sugar trust than that? And over half are mortgagedheavily mortgaged. If my friends wish to give the sugar trust power. let them refuse to pass this bill. Mortgage foreclosures will give the sugar trust the power. But. whether it be they or other large land owners who get control of the lands of Cuba. their wish will be � for labor. and if this bill do not pass. and it be possible for them. they will do what Hawaii has long wished to do. namely. encourage cooly immigration. Chinese or otherwise. under contracts. which amount to slavery. and will reestablish the cheap and nasty methods of the cultivation of sugar cane in that island. It is an island which has 41.600 square miles of land. sufficient. with the density of population that there is in Massachusetts. to accommodate 15.000.000 of people. although it has now only 1.600.000. It is an island which. with the density of population that there is in Porto Rico. would have sufficient land to maintain a population of 10.000.000 of people. If this wonderful and fertile land. with its gentle slopes and fertile plains. and with its equable climate except on the immediate sea coast. if that place is to fill up with labor contracted for from China (perhaps contracted for from Africafor who knows. in these days. but that this commerce may extend even into the midst of the Dark Continent?). if this country is to fill up with that sort of labor. it will be another Santo Domingoneither more nor lessand we shall have to maintain the guaranty that we have given. not by the strength ot the people of Cuba. but rather by the swordby our Navy and by our Army.-and by no other means. If. on the other hand. as proposed by this bill. that sort of immigration and contract labor shall be cut off. if they can only admit population as good as that which comes to the United States. if the island can grow up as Texas did when it became an independent State and was peopled by the immigration of Englishspeaking people to such an extent that. although Spanish was once the language of that magnificent State. it is today ahost unknown. If Cuba can grow in that way. if such growth can be encouraged by encouraging trade with America so that our capital will go there. so that their trade will come here. so that the affiliations between one and the other will be the same as has existed between Florida and the North. and that have built up that garden of flowers. I say if this can be done. the guaranty of independence costs us nothing. She has her independence. an independence protected not by war. but protected. created. and maintained by the sweet and blessed arts of peace. Mr. Chairman. I have wondered sometimes why this clause of the bill has not been more attended to. why there has not been laid upon it more stress. We do not agree to give Cuba reciprocity absolutely. It is upon condition of the enactment by its government of immigration. exclusion. and contractlabor laws as fully restrictive of immigration as the laws of the United States. That condition is emphasized by the last clause of the bill. which provides that if these laws be not enforced it shall be the power and the duty of the President. whenever he shall be satisfied that either such immigration. exclusion. or contractlabor laws or such agreement mentioned in this act is not being fully executed by the government of Cuba. to notify such government thereof. and thereafter there shall be levied. collected. and paid upon all articles imported from Cuba the full rate of duty provided by law upon articles . imported from foreign countries.  Mr. Chairman.the emphasis of this bill is given. and justly given. to this clause. It appears in the beginning as a condition. but if the condition contemplated by the bill shall not take effect. it appears in the end as a proviso. by which it shall be defeated."},{"1":"5.601248e+08","2":"1901","3":"H","4":"GROW","5":"484","6":"Yes","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I agree in part with the remarks made by the gentleman from Georgia . But the land that the Indian claims as his own has no property value unless it is cultivated. The basis of the freehomestead law that passed Congress was that the wild. uncultivated lands of the wilderness belonged to the man whose industry made it valuable to civilization by his labor. His title to ownership in such land is sealed in the sweat of his face as it moistened the soil he tilled. What right can these Indians or Indians anywhere have to land without cultivation? Running over lands with a bow and arrow or fishing rod does not give a man a title to land uncultivated and unimproved. I am opposed to the whole policy of the Government that treats the Indian as the owner in fee of uncultivated land. How can he have more than a possession title simply by making moccasin tracks over it. with his bow and arrow. The Indian has no more right than a white man to the soil because he tramps over it. If he has. the agents of the Hudson Bay Company are just as much entitled to the great wilderness of the Northwest. They traversed it with shotgun and fishing rod and all the implements of a hunters life as early as the Indian or at the same time. Why should the Government make a treaty with the Indian to buy his land. to which he has only possessionary title? The old policy was to make an arrangement for him to leave his present occupancy and to find a new home. It is well enough that the Government should make such arrangement with him. He leaves his old hunting ground and finds another. All the attachments he severs is the graves of his ancestors. But immigrating people do that all over the world. The sons born in New England today go forth and find new homes in the West. and stop only when they reach the shores of the mighty ocean. This Governments policy inflicts a wrong on the Treasury of the United States in treating the Indian as owning in fee land which neither he nor the white man has any just title to without they apply labor to it in cultivation. The Government should return to the old policy practiced for fifty years. paying the Indian tribes for moving from one place to another if his land is wanted for settlement. No matter what the Government pays for his consent to move. it is better than expelling him by shot and shell. But until he acquires the exclusive right to the soil by cultivation he has no property right to sell to anybody. The earths surface. created by the Almighty for the support of the race. becomes individual property only by the application of mans labor in its cultivation."},{"1":"5.600851e+08","2":"1900","3":"S","4":"HANNA","5":"318","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"1 do notwant to take up any time in a dialogue on this iatter. I simply desire to state the facts as I know them. and I propose to present them fairly. The cost of making armor. of course. depends largely upon the cost of the raw material and labor. There has been an advance of fully 25 per cent in both since the question was under discussion before. and particularly in labor. which amounts in these works. I am told. to over 30 per cent. Therefore the conditions are not quite so favorable now for regulating theprices as they have been. While I have not fully considered and do not know what is the best basis upon which to compromise this.

There are other features of this bill I would like to speak about. but will not delay the House. Of his tariff work it must suffice to say that the Morrill tariff and the name of its author are together embalmed in history. and will there remain as long as governments exist among men. Mr. MORRILL was placed on the Committee on Ways and Means by Speaker Orr in the Thirtyfifth Congress. where he remained until he went to the Senate. though he did not become chairman until the Thirtyninth Congress. when a new committee. viz. on Appropriations was formed. and Thaddeus Stevens. another distinguished Vermonter. but representing a Pennsylvania district. was made chairman of the new committee and Mr. MORRILL chairman of Ways and Means. During the war Mr. Stevens had been chairman of this committee. but the two worked together like brothers. Mr. Stevens always recognized Mr. MORRILL as an authority on tariff and finance. he was also conscious of his matchless influence in committee and on the floor. and when anything difficult was to be accomplished this great debater and skillful parliamentary leader deferred to Mr. MORRILL. whose word he knew to be law and gospel with his fellows. A third of a century ago the name. of the great commoner. Thaddeus Stevens. was upon all lips. and traditions of his eloquent harangues. filled with brilliant sallies and biting witticisms. still linger in this Hall. and what place he may take in history I will not undertake to say: but sure it is that his quiet. unpretending. industrious compeer already has assigned to him a niche in the temple of fame. The idea of permanently endowing out of the public lands an institution .of learning in each State for instruction in agriculture and science is believed to have been original with JUSTIN S. MORRILL. But whether or not the conception was his. certain it is that he is the man who put the landgrantcollege act upon the statute book. It seems to have been an early and favorite project with him. It is not generally known how long and patiently and against what reverses he struggled with this pet measure. It passed both Houses in the Thirtysixth Congress. but was vetoed by Buchanan on the ground that it was unconstitutional and that the Treasury was already empty. It was reintroduced in 1862. and through his skillful management became a law. and today 64 landgrant colleges in all the States and Territories. representing an aggregate capital invested of $25.500.775.63. with 1.522 teachers and 25.069 students. constitute the fruit of this legislation. The first fruitbut who will measure the farreaching influence of this galaxy of industrial colleges upon the future of the American people? Who will compute the results? The central purpose in founding them was to furnish the tiller of the soil such information and aid as would just a little lighten his burdens and if possible increase his profits. the former of which Mr. MORRILL kihew to be heavy and the latter small. His experience with his little farm in Strafford had revealed to him how little is known of the science of agriculture. really the chemistry of nature. how little is known of those hidden processes by which the harvest is made ready. but not always worthy of the sickle. He saw also how scientific research alone could throw any light upon these problems. and how. too. not the farmer alone but all mankind were interested in their solution. And then. too. born and reared among a working people and himself a worker. his sympathies naturally went out toward those who win their way by honest toil. and he said to himself: Let us establish institutions of learning to fit this class the better to act their part in the battle of life. not by giving them instruction in the ancient classics nor in belleslettres. but. in the language of the act itself. in agriculture and the mechanic arts. and to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life.~ Ordinarily he who founds an institution of learning is entitled to large credit. What shall be the measure of honor for the m~n who founded these thirtyeight colleges. from which goes out an army of educated men every year to mingle in the walks of life? What a legacy not alone to the present but the generations that shall go marching down the stretch of time! What a monument. too. to the wisdom and largehearted statesmanship of the man who so amply provided for the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes! And what wonder that when he came to die. these institutions. their officers. professors. and students. all felt that they had indeed lost a friend. as did also the agriculturist and his coworkers throughout the length and breadth of the land. from the dairymen of California to the horticulturists of Illinois. who sent to the family resolutions laudatory of the dead statesman and expressive of their sense of personal bereavement? The death of but few public men has so touched the hearts of the American people as the death of the man to whom we today pay tribute. and this was in large part because he had succeeded in accomplishing something in a public wayfor his fellowmen. These two great public measures. of which Mr. MORRILL was the author and finisher. and of which I have spoken somewhat at length. because I think all will concede that they give him a place in his countrys annals clearly above the average legislator. were both completed while he was still a member of this body. where he served for twelve years. ending March 4.1867. at which time he took his seat in the Senate. and by reason of his long and distinguished record in the House he at once took higher position and rank in that body than is usual for the new Senator. His committee assignments were soon the very best. Finance. Public Buildings and Grounds. and Education and Labor being among the number. When John Sherman left the Senate for the Treasury portfolio under President Hayes in 1877. Mr. MORRILL became chairman of the great Committee on Finance. which he retained until his death. except for the short time when the opposition was in control. And as the head of this great committee the Senate and the country had the benefit of his large experience and ripe judgment on all the financial questions of the day. He was indeed a recognized authority on finance. and his opinions had great weight alike with the Senate. at the Treasury Department. and with bankers and capitalists and solid men of business throughout the country. He was strongly urged by President Hayes to take a seat in his Cabinet. but preferred to remain in the Senate as the servant of the little State he loved so well. But time forbids that I follow in detail. as I would like. Mr. MORRILLS long Senatorial career. which is everywhere luminous with wisdom of both speech and action. and nowhere clouded with distrust or the faintest breath of suspicion. The people of his State were not only proud of him but they believed in him. and with one voice called him again and again to the high trust he so ably and honorably kept. But meanwhileThe muffled tramp of years * Come stealing up the slope of time. and the erect figure of 44. when he entered public life. would hardly be recognized in the venerable form of 88. with its slight literary stoop. but the face always fine. a model for the artist. was the same. only grown finer still from the moldings of the gentle. just spirit within. Mr. MORRILL was always a student. was never idle. and when not absorbed in public duties. or with his farm in Strafford. for mental recreation he turned to standard literature. and as the result was the possessor not only of much literary information. but of excellent literary taste. The little book he prepared for his friends a few years ago. entitled The SelfConsciousness of Noted Persons. shows a wide range of careful reading. which he kept up until the day of his death. And as an illustration of his industry and literary taste he left in manuscript. not quite complete. in his chaste handwriting almost as plain as print. a new and enlarged edition of this book. in which he gives such additional instances which he had found in his later readings as would illustrate its title. It is only natural that a man in whom there was not the slightest trace of conceit. and in whom modesty itself seemed personified. should have noticed in his reading those passages where distinguished persons betrayed consciousness of their importance. and it is fit that such a man should make a collection of them for amusement and instruction. in fact this little book is only a literary embodiment of the wellknown pleasantry and humor of its author. which continued unabated to the last. Surely his was a beautiful. triumphant old age. His temperate. wellordered life had brought to his closing years more than usual vigor of mind and body. and on the anniversary of his birth thousands of friends were wont to assemble with cordial greetings and congratulations. so that this annual gathering in honor of the aged Senator came to be a settled social function of the capital. These occasions called out the very elite of official and social life. Members. Senators. cabinet ministers. Justices of the Supreme Court. foreign legations. and Presidents also paid their respects. and the grace and dignity with which the venerable Senator and Mrs. Morrill received their guests would have done honor to a prince and princess of the blood. The distinguished character of this annual gathering illustrates better than any words of mine the high place held by this grand old man in the confidence and esteem of all classes. high and low. for to them were also bidden the plain. common people. who were made equally at home with those high in rank. .Notwithstanding his advancing years. Mr. MORRILLS mental vigor was as great as ever. The older he grew in body the younger he seemed to grow in spirit. his bright sunny nature shining out as though no shadow was near. He was. in very truth. a young old man. retaining all of the purity and much of the imagery and harmony of youth. But theInaudible and noiseless foot of timewas steadily carrying him toward the dark valley. and in his serene and peaceful old age. with one foot already in the border land. he could well have said. in the words of Longfellow. to whom. by the way. he was related in blood: Age is opportunity no less Than youth itself. though in another dress. And as the evening twilight fades away The sky is filled with stars. invisible by day. But at last in the merry Christmas time. full of years and full of honors. as a child falls asleep he passed away. And on this anniversary of the birth of the Father of His Country. a fit day for these memorial exercises. the two Houses of Congress have suspended business for the purpose of reviewing his work. recounting his virtues. and paying tribute to his memory. Meanwhile he sleeps with his kindred in the narrow valley where he first saw the light and with the people he loved and served. and who in turn loved and honored him. And now we bid our kind. benevolent. lovable friend a tender goodbye until we meet again. as was his belief. in that celestial country where at last shall be fohndThe day that hath no evening. The health that hath no sore.

It was hoped by the friends of this legislation that it would have been enacted into law during the last session of this Congress. but recognition under the rules could not be secured. therefore our proposition to take it up today. believing that the necessary vote can be obtained. The paragraphs of the bill. through the untiring industry of the management ofthe exposition. are familiar to the members of the House and supported by the entire body of the commercial exchanges. boards of trade. and a number of associations for the advancement of our export trade. We are confident and believe the House can intelligently act under the rules of suspension. but the time -islimited in debating and a twothirds vote necessary. The appropriation asked for is $350.000. and in reply to the gentleman from.Missouri. I would submit that. although different in several paragraphs. the bill is in some respects analogous to the many appropriations heretofore made for expositions. mainly differing. however. in the $300.000 paragraph. giving to the building a pelmanent -structure that will be for all time and contain exhibitions of American products and manufacture. and teaching our merchants and farmers how best and most economically the export trade of our country can be enlarged and developed.

Pa.. of one and onehalf millions of dollars. which was paidl back and returned to the United States Government. In New Orleans. at the time of the exposition there in 1884. a loan was made by Congress of $1.000.000. I do not wish to make the suggestion in the way of any unfair criticism. but it is proper to say that this loan has never been returned. Financially aid was also extended by the gift of an appropriation. specified as such. of $350.000. in order to allow that exposition to pay the awards made. In other words. the Government gave to the exposition. qualifiedly. the sum of $350.000. while in the great Columbian Exposition at Chicago. Ill.. Congress gave. absolutely a gift. the sum of $2.554.000. The expenses of the committee on the part of the Government and the buildings for the Government exhibits were also paid for out of the Treasury of the United States to the extent of $2.132.106. Now. Mr. Speaker. these are all under what is known as the generalwelfare clause of the Constitution. and there was no other authority for it. In that connection. under this same provision of the Constitution. the generalwelfare clause. we have legislation in Congress annually for the support and continuance of the Patent Office. for the educational bill. your Agricultural Department. where the people are aided and taught agriculture. for the LightHouse Establishment. for the safety and promotion of commerce. for the Department of Labor. for the laboring interests of the country. for the moneyorder service in the PostOffice Department. for the general welfare and convenience of the people. he parcelspost delivery. and the provision of law by which merchandise may go through the mails at the rate of 16 cents a pound. All of these are laws which are framed under the same generalwelfare clause of the Constitution and are beneficial for the welfare of the people. and on that account we submit that this exposition in Philadelphia is directly for the promotion of our export trade. We claim we stand upon constitutional grounds and hinitations. Never in the history of this country. or any other country. has the export trade grown so rapidly as it has grown throughout all parts of our country during the past three years. There is no period in the history of our country which by comparison shows such a rapid increase as during that time. and we rank today as the second export country in the world. Great Britain leading only by $255.000.000 more than our own country. and last year. 1893. we exported $1.200.000.000. For the last three years theexports of merchandise exceeded the imports of the like class by $1.249.542.000. while for the three previous years the surplus of exports was only $263.931.000. The United States exports for 1898 will amount to $1.200.000.000. Those of Great Britain. for the first ten months of this year. amount to $9625o00.000. or at the rate of $1.155.000.000. These figures represent domestic products alone. while those for the United States include reexports of foreign goods. Englands exports of colonial products are running at the rate of $300.000.000 per year.which carries up her current total export trade to $1.455.000.000. or $255.000.000 more than ours. We now rank second in magnitude among the exporting nations. This proposed exposition is wholly in the interest of the export trade of the country. and to be held during the coining year. and if Congress is to make an appropriation in aid of such a wise and beneficent purpose. it must be made now. in order that the plans already prepared shall be carried out. and by the middle of the year. not later than September. the buildings will be completed. Aided as the work will be by direct contribution to the extent of the Government aid. and by special contribution on the part of a number of subscribers. as well as by the city itself. there can be no unnecessary delay. It is. therefore. Mr. Speaker. national in its character and national in its purposes. It is not to be an exposition like those we have had heretofore. It is to be an exhibition. a kindergarten. based on purposes that are simply for the benefit of the people in dollars and cents. It is not for the sightseers. It is to be for business men. for business purposes. showing how they can enter into competition with foreign nations in the markets of the world. showing by its exhibitsthe products from all over the worldthe development of manufactures. and just how and where and in what manner the exports of this country may meet the competition of other nations in the other markets of the world. It is to go even further and show how goods shall be packed and shipped. which is a great item of consideration and enters largely in the expense account common to competition. The Government appropriation is not to be available until the citizens of Pennsylvania contribute at least $300.000 toward the exposition. Twice this sum is already practically guaranteed. Fiftysix acres of valuable land. upon which the exposition buildings are to be erected. have been contributed by the city councils of Philadelphia. The exposition grounds are within ten minutes ride by street car from the city hall of Philadelphia. It will be of special advantage to the manufacturers and producers of the United States for the exposition to be held in 1899. as an international commercial congress. comprising the representatives of the South American Republics. South Africa. India. Australia. China. Japan. and other countries. is to meet in Philadelphia next June. This distinguished gathering will represent the purchasers of ninetenths of the volume of foreign goods consumed by the countries named. The international commercial congress will bring together about four hundred leading merchants from all parts of the world. who will come to make business connections in the United States and to discuss the best means of extending American trade into their respective countries. The exposition will have the united support of the Philadelphia Commercial Museum and of the Franklin Institute. of Philadelphia. The exposition is not to be a moneymaking enterprise. Neither the incorporators nor anyone connected with the exposition association will have any financial interest in the success of the exposition. The chambers of commerce. boards of trade. and other commercial organizations of the United States have close official relations with the Philadelphia Commercial Museum. and have earnestly commended the plan of the proposed exposition. These trade bodies represent practically every State in the Union. The exposition will display only manufactured articles and products suitable for export. The recognition of the National Government and its support and sanction are essential to the complete success of the undertaking. and will insure the most good to the business interets of the country. The exposition is to last for six months. At the expiration of that time all buildings. permanent exhibits and other property in its possession will revert to the Philadelphia Commercial Museum. The great field of work which the Philadelphia Museums now cover. enlarged as it will be by the exposition. has already been covered by many of the nations of the world. Great Britain. Germany. Russia. France. Belgium. AustriaHungary. and Italy have dispatched commissioners to the Orient. Australasia. Africa. and SpanishAmerica to investigate the conditions of trade and gather samples of natural products and of manufactured products most favored in each market. and to make the same available to the manufacturing and commercial interests of their respective countries. This work has been supplemented and their trade has been promoted by establishing and maintaining out of the public treasury institutions of like nature to the Philadelphia Museums. The Imperial Institute of London is such an institution. installed in a most imposing building erected at a cost of probably more than $2.000.000. The Brussels Museum is another. and it is believed that the work of the consular agents of Belgium incidental therewith exceeds all their other work. There are several of the institutions in Germany. the principal one probably being the ExportMusterlager and Commercial Museums. Stuttgart. The work of the institutions in France is understood to be conducted by its chambers of commerce. but there are like commercial institutions at St. Petersburg. Russia. Vienna. Austria. Budapest. Hungary. and Milan. Italy. It is believed that the exhibits at none of these institutions is as valuable and varied and the store of information as comprehensive and great as at the Philadelphia Museums. The Philadelphia Museums have worked with the cooperation of the State Department. each of whose Secretaries. beginning with and succeeding Mr. Gresham. has directed the consular officers of the United States to assist them in every possible way. and has made available the consular reports. Our export trade is growing with a certainty and rapidity unexampled. Our opportunity to lead Great Britain for the first time is already assured. I believe this exhibition will be of value without limit. and we will in a short time stand upon the atlas of the world not only the greatest of nations in mans humanity to man. but also in the development. sale. and manufacture of the products of our soil. and in the labor of our mechanics. as well as the greatest nation in the export trade. making our people rich. prosperous. and happy. and following the destiny that leads to nobler works and greater fields of national usefulness."},{"1":"5.401462e+08","2":"1897","3":"S","4":"HAWLEY","5":"211","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"There are to be on this proposed commission ten Congressmen with nine outsiders. with a distinct and evident purpose that the Congressmen shall control the commission.

There were ten Congressmen against nine of us. So before the Senator from Massachusetts had risen. by a curious coincidence. I had marked out upon the bill precisely the amendment that he is about to move to it when the bill gets into the Senate. a proposition to create a commission to be composed of nine citizens taken from private life.

A great part of the area of the State of Florida has been taken away from the settlers upon the public lands of the United States who have. by law.. a right to them. We should not be so considerate of the claims of the nonresident people in the shape of corporations as to deprive the people who are to live and labor on this land of their right under the law. The Interior Department should not be allowed to approve and patent land that is obviously not within the terms of the act and which they are prohibited from doing. This is a subject which should have the attention of Congress. Nothing can be more oppressive to the people than to allow the public land to be unlawfully approved in great bodies to individuals and land speculators. agents. and corporations. I have not drawn the resolution with a view of censuring or affecting any corporation. but I have a letter from settlers who in that far region of the South. away down upon the coast near Cape Sable. desire to make a home there. and they are making application for the land and stating that it is high and dry land and suitable for settlement. and they are informed from the Interior Dearitment that without a survey and without examination it has een approved as swamp and overflowed land under the selection of some agent or other. That is the whole of it. and I was further informed by an official letter from the Department some months ago that there was an agreement to approve nearly the whole peninsula of Florida. under the name of the Everglades. by its exterior lines and without an interior survey or examination. to the State. and that would be to railroad corporations and would cover the whole area with a denial of the right to free homes: M Air.

If any citizens of the United States. wherever they dwell. or any corporation composed of citizens of the United States. have got hold of. or are trying to get hold of. any land they ought not to get and have not a title to. of course they ought to be stopped. and it is the business of the Department to do it. and if the Department does not do it. it is the business of Congress to see that the proper legislation is enacted. There is no objection to that. What I do object to is the coming in and taking of those things for granted and having the Senate order legislation before the committee have inquired into the facts or into the necessity for it. but if the Senator now consents to the amendment that they shall report such legislation as in their judgment may be necessary.

If English manufacturers will buy our cotton. make it into cloth -with labor paid higher than we pay. and send the goods back here and sell them for half the price it costs us to manufacture them.

It is a very just and material one. Still the fact remains that foreign cotton is brought to this country and sold in competition with ours. Raw fur skins and undressed furs are to come free. but fur hats must still pay a duty of 30 per cent. Hides. hoofs. and horns are on the free list. but the manufactured products of these articles are still favored with a duty. Wood in its natural state and in its crudest and simplest phases of manufacture is thought to need no protection. but as soon as the deft fingers of the carpenter. the mechanic. and the artisan have touched it a tax of 20 per cent is imposed. Mica. to my regret and the chagrin and injury of a most respectable element of my constituents. loses by the provision of the bill the 35 per cent protection hitherto enjoyed. but stoves. in the manufacture of which it is most extensively used. still glisten and glow in the sheen of a 30 per cent protection. Mr. Chairman. I might extend this reviewof what I consider the objectionable features of the bill. but I do not deem it proper to do so. Sam Jones. in many respects the biggest man of this day and country. speaking of the necessities of the hour. says that what this country needs now is not so much a man to think and plan and doctrinize. but a man that will act. that will get up and geV hnd do something. That is what is needed in the religious field and that is what is imperatively demanded in the political world. In the light of most solemn promises and party pledges I stand ready to support the measure in whatever shape it may finally come to a vote. It will not meet every expectition of an impatient. suffering people. but in view of its many features of substantial relief and the wide field of hope it opens up. I am prepared to say.  with all its faults Ilove it still. Mr. Chairman. I do not impute to elections as much significance as some do. Where there are great sectional interests involved they seldom settle anything- definitely. The only solution of such questions is revolution or war. The slavery issue was agitated hotly for nearly half a century. Elections were lost and won and won and lost upon it. The press teemed with incendiary .articles on either side. bigmouthed politicians bawled themselves hoarse. ambitious and aspiring statesmen skulked and squirmed and  trimmed. False prophets were up all over the land. and now and then declared the issue settled. but after the shedding of much precious blood the final solution was had at Appomattox. And so. I do not contend that the election of 1892 turned solely on the issue of a particular kind of tariff. nor that this issue is finally and unalterably settled. But. sir. as it was one of the elements of that contest. and made unusually prominent therein. we have a right to infer that much stress was laid upon it by the.voters of the country. and to allow to it a proper influence upon the results of that very important election. Regarding that election as only a very significant battle won. we are still to prosecute the war to its legitimate conclusion. The selfsame fight we are now making was fought by our predecessors sixty years ago. The battle was fought along the same lines. Then. as now. it was claimed that certain industries and certain classes of laborers in the country needed special privileges and advantages to enable them to live and to prosper. Then. as now. they demanded and obtained concessions and contributions from the brawn and sweat of the masses. The manufacturers have changed in nothing except in the argument of their contention and the method of their warfare. Every privilege then claimed was on the score of infancy. No other pretense was advanced. Sir. that argument has died with the flight of years. A later and more effective one has taken its place. How it has cheered the bountyhunting. looting horde to many an onset. Oh. Labor! Labor! 1low many crimes are committed in thy name! Whatwas then asked in consideration of the inefficiency of tender years isnow urged from a sham regard for the interest of labor. Sir. we are constantly reminded that there is an army of laborers in this country who can not exist and flourish save by the fostering care of this Government. That army. we are told. is now knocking at the door of Congress. with petitions in one hand and threats and protests in the other. demanding an indefinite continuation of the taxes that have too long burdened an indulgent people. Gentlemen upon this floor talk often and vehemently aboui the protection of the laboring clesses of America against the pauperpaid laborers of Europe. But. sir. who are the laborers of this country. and where do they live. and how do they live? It has been shown by an eminent statistician that there are in this country about 17.000.000 laborers in all. of whom about 13.000.000 are engaged in industries not susceptible of socalled protection. while 600.000 of the remainder are only occasionally benefited thereby. So that we have in round numbers only abott 3.400.000 as the benqflciaries of the protective system. Sir. if there were no other argument against it but this it ought not to stand on its present footing for a day. A general economic law that does not dispense its benefits with equal hand impartially to every class and to every individual. however high or low. is inherently and eternally wrong. What right has the lawmaking power of this nation to say that thirteenmen shall be assessed for the benefit and wealof three other men no better than the thirteen and having no better or stronger claims upon the Government than the thirteen? As Democrats we have been taught to believe. and we do believe. that every citizen in this broad land must work out his own individual material welfare and salvation. not with fear and trembling. but looking to the Government only for equal laws. equal burdens and benefits. and equal protection to property. to person. to life. and to liberty. Hehasarighttoexpect this much and no more. Thisdoctrine is old and elementary. I know. but it can not be that it has lost any of its force from age. It is the same that was taught by Jefferson and Madison and Monroe and Jackson. Whenever it has had occasion to speak. the judiciary of the country. with rare exceptions. has given to it its unequivdcal sanction. As late as 1892 Justices Brewer. Field. and Brown. of the Supreme Court of the United States. joined in an opinion that epitomizes the true Democratic idea. Hear what they have to say on this line: The paternal theory of government Is odious. The utmost possible liberty to the individual. and the fullest possible protection to him and his property. is both the limitation and the duty of government. If it may regulate the price of one service which is not a public service. or the compensation for the use of one kind of property which is not devoted toa public use. why may it not with equal reason regulate the price of all service and the compensation to be paid for the use of all property? But our Republican friends tell us that while protection does more especially enhance the price of the protected labor. that it really does more than this. that it sdatters its beneficence broadcast. as it were. dispensing blessings where they are not solicited even or expected. In a word. they tell us that a high tariff *ill increase the wages of all industries. agricultural as well as manufacturing. The constituency whom I feel proud to represent here are mainly engaged in agriculture. If. therefore. itcan be demonstrated that the passage of this bill will work to their detriment I should feel impelled by the highest official obligation to oppose it. B it it has not been and can not be shown that such is the case. According to the report of the Senate Committee on Finance upon Wholesale Prices. Wages. and Transportation. no such argument can justly be made for protection. Statistics are always dull and often unreliable and. I think. should be sparingly indulged in. Some one has aptly remarked that though figures do not lie. liars sometimes figure. According to the figires of this report by Mr. ALDRICH for the committee. it appears that the rise in wages in agriculture since 1860 has been only 4 per cent. while in the protective industries it has been in round numbers 69 per cent. In 1866. Mr. J. R. Dodge. the Statistician of. the Departmentof Agriculture. made his first investigation into farm wages and announced thegratifying result of an increase of 50 per cent since 1860. But a like investigation in 1892 disclosed The unpalatable fact of a decrease of 46 per cent since 1866. leaving as a balance an increase of 4 per cent since 1860. From an examination of the same statistics we also find that the staple agricultural products. such as enter into general consumption and constitute the neceqsaries of life. on the whole. have declined 6 per cent since 1860. So. sir. the agricultural laborer can make his own deductions and comparisons. Mr. Chairman. I undertake to say they can not be very unctuous to his pride or his sense of justice. He will find that while wages of 100 cents which he would have received in 1860. have been increased to 104 cents in 1892 for the same amount of labor and length of service. that on the other hand the products of that labor would have been so decreased in price that the same quantity of such products that in 1860 would have yielded 106 will now yield but 100 cents. so that in reality there is an actual balance against him in 1891 of 2 cents. which onuly can be made good by superior efficiency in work arising from improved implements. improved machinery. and improved methods of farming. etc. Again. it is often asserted here and elsewhere by the advocates of a high protective tariff that while the prices of manufactured products have continued to decline for many years still the standard and dignity of manufacturing labor and the wages of manufacturing laborers have not only been maintained h ut greatly advaneed. If this be true. it is neither strange nor unexpected. Why or how should it be otherwise. if the great and wealthy manufacturers of the country keep faith with those in whose name they have so assiduously claimed the bonuses and bounties of protection? It would indeed be more than Punic bad faith on their part. if. after using their employds as cats paws to pull the chestnuts from the fire. they should refuse themn something like a respectable division of the chestnuts. I will say that if the wages of the mighty host of manufacturing laborers are niot ample and satisfactory. they ought to be. It is not the fault of the laws of the land if they are not. But the whole story of wageearners has not yet been told. There has been suppression of facts anidexaggerations of estimates to such an extent as to leave the real status of the laborer in doubt and confusion:. The report of the Commissioner of Labor shows that there is little ground for the claim so often asserted that American labor has such superior compensation to that of other countries. and especially Europe. He gives us a table. for instance. in the cottonmanufacturing industry. from which it appears that in a Southern district of the United States the average daily wages in this industry was 69 cents. while those of England in like industries were 66 cents. and the differ.enee of wages is more .than discounted by the cheaper supply of all the necessaries of lifecheaper rents. cheaper fuel. cheaper clothing. etc. I beg the indulgence of the House for submitting two tables taken from that report. from which it will be seen that wb lIe American wages in the few industries given are higher than those in Europe. yet. as a matter of fact. the amount actually saved as surplus is nearly the same in the two countries: Income and estpendfture8 per f armly.

But to conclude in that five minutes the matter of which I was talking when the hammer fell. They say. repeal the Sherman law in order that you miy strengthen our credit abroad. I repeat. it is already as good as that of any nation on this earth. Well. but say some of these gentlemen.  repeal the Sherman law and we will give you something to go in its place. Will you?

Grover Cleveland? I pause for an answer. if anybody is authorized to speak for him let him answer here and now. The gentlemen from New York and from Ohio both stand pledged to repeal the tax on the circulation of the State banks. The last Democratic national platform pledges such legislation. That would give us oldfashioned Democratic wildcat money. Mr. Speaker. for myself I am free to say that if I have to choose between silver at the ratio of either 16 to 1 or 20 to 1 of gold on the one hand. or the revival of the wildcat currency that cursed this country up to 1860 on the other. I will be found for silver every time. To my Republican friends. in conclusion. I say. to what feast are we invited? To the repeal of this act that we wrote upon the statute book. and that has been beneficent in its operation. and when it is repealed. with a contracting currency and an increasing population. we have full notice that there is to follow fast and furious upon its track the performance of the pledge made by the Democracy. upon which they say they won full power. namely. to strike down the last vestige of protection to American industries and American labor. and place upon the statute books in lieu thereof a tariff that will yield revenue only. but no protection to any American citizen who walks upon our soil and breathes our air.

The Senator is aware of the fact. no doubt. that such have been the changes in military weapons that people are unarmed. and that it would be scarcely possible for them to supply themselves with the military weapons which are now in use in actual war. I say this to emphasize the changes which are going on. I refer again to the fact that all our laws have tended to the cesolidation and organization of capital. and that the effect of those organizations is that labor. by which I mean all industrie. not organized. has become feeble for want of organization. I believe public policy demands that the organization of labor should b- encouraged as we have heretofore encouraged the organization of capital. I think that most thoughtful men agree with me that its organization ought to be encouraged and no. discouraged. My reasoning in regard to the Homestead case has been that the organization there which controls $25.000.000 capital has actually. so far as it has power. forbidden the organization of labor. The managers have absolutely refused to recognize organized labor. and are exerting themselves to destroy the organization of labor. That I understand to be the exact condition. This controversy had its origin in that. I understand. Now. I have mainlained that the right of labor to organize is as perfect as is the right of capital. I dislike using the terms capital and labor. because they mislead. I dislike to antagonize two elements so important to the welfare of society even by repeating the terms. I understand the Homestead men were at their homes. and that this was a distinctly lawless force employed by the owners of the property. not only to recover a possession which had not been disturbed. but it was a menace. it was an attempt at war upon organized labor. I did say that those men had a right to be there. I did say they had a right to defend themselves there. I understand the law to b3 well settled that a i arty in possession may resist any lawless force. While I admit that a party in possession ought and must yield to the law and to the representatives of the law. I do not understand that the citizens of this country. being where they have a right to be. are required to submit to a lawless force. an organized band of lawless men. I maintain. therefore. that their resistance was a legitimate resistance. I think if the Senator has done me the honor to read what I said. he will find I admitted the right of the owners to control their property. but I asserted the right of the laborers to employment. The Senator says they have a moral right to be employed or that there is an element of moral right in the claim of employes to employment. Mr. President. I have gone no further than to assert that moral right. But I have said. and my object in the remarks I made was to intimate to the Senate and to the country that this moral right. which is conceded by allwho criticise me. must in some way or other. how I do not know. be clothed with legal form. The difficulty consists in defining it. but when the existence of the moral right is conceded. all is conceded that I have claimed. I concede all that is claimed in regard to the right of men to contrfl their own property. but I do insist that it is the right of labor to organize. We have passed liberal incorporation laws under which the money of the country is organized and is protected with immense force. because all the capital of the country is in sympathy and cooperates to effect its own common objects. I think it is wise that all that I call labor (which is all that is not incorporated) may organize rightly. and that this large corporation in making their war upon the organization of labor. refusing to recognize the right of labor to organize. have far transcended any right that can possibly be claimed by any property owners. I confess that I sympathize largely with that disposition which inclines American citizens to resist alawlessforce. and this very force. this Pinkerton organization. as it is termed. is one which is lawlessly employed wherever it has been used. The Senator himself does not see any foundation for the right of Pinkertons to travel from State to State and enlist in the service of men who simply desire to employ them without judicial or legislative authority. I have asserted and I maintain the right of these people to defend themselves against the lawless force that was intended ultimately to take life. and I do assert the right of labor to organize. I do maintain that it is the policy of the country that labor should be encouraged to organize. I am not able to understand that reasoning which has led us so long to invite the organization of capital by general incorporation laws. until there is scarcely an interest in this country of any magnitude that is not armed with corporate powers and relieved from the burdens and obligations which attend the private ownership of property. Indeed the boundary between corporations is broken down. The old rure was that a corporation should have such powers as were conferred upon it by law. and that corporations could not form partnerships. The old common law rule has been entirely disregarded. I will go one step further. I maintain that every corporation is public. I maintain that the Legislature has no right to incorporate any bodyof persons except for public purposes.and I conclude by saying that all I meant to assert has been conceded. that these persons have a moral right to employment. dependent upon their conduct. They are under a moral duty to work for reasonable wages under all the circumstances. and they have a moral right to expect it. While the golden rule. to which the Senator has referred. would undoubtedly settle every trouble. yet. inasmuch as we have not reached that perfect state of society. I maintain that all the elements of labor which are not now organized have the right to organize and ought to organize. and ought to be encouraged to organize. and that an attack upon organized labor is of itself an offense. a moral offense atleast. as the Senator concedes. I apprehend. Mr. President. I desire to go no further except to say that 1 have.found it in the course of my life exceedingly difficult to advance opinions that look to the improvement of the laws without subjecting myself to harsh criticisms. I believe that the time will come when the patriotism and wisdom of the people of the States will find some solution of these troubles. and I think that every contribution to that end should meet with not unkind criticism. but should be accepted as the wellimeant effort of a man whose meaning is good. and whose purpose is to improve the law and to benefit the condition of the people of the country. I conclude by saying that I have never asserted more than a moral right of persons under thes. circumstances to employment. One other remark I think I will venture to make before I take my seat. Mr. President. this corporate organization of wealth is increas. ing rapidly and its power for concert. its enormous power separately. justifies such resistance as is consistent with law. and requir~s such legislation as will mitigate the evils that grow out of these enormous aggregations of power. Think of it! At Homestead the managers of the Carnegie establishment with $25.000.000 of capital and with several thousand men employed. assert their absolute. uncontrollable right to control their own property. which I have not denied. They claim the absolute. uncontrollable right to discharge these persons or to forbid these thousands of men from organizing for a legitimate purpose."},{"1":"5.101991e+08","2":"1891","3":"S","4":"STEWART","5":"1129","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. I do notintend to occupy the time of the Senate at any length in the discussion of this question. but I have been of the opinion for many years that it was for the advantage of the country to reduce the hours of labor. I believe the time is not far distant when it will be unnecessary for laboring men to work even as much as eight hours a day. The progress of the world for the last thirty or forty years has shown conclusively that man was doing too much drudgery and not enough thinking. Four millions of slaves were emancipated in this country. since which time the genius of the American people has invented machinery which can perform labor equal to the manual labor of more than one hundred million men. What we want and what we are gradually marching towards is a higher grade of labor whereby we can use the forces of nature to accomplish the drudgerywhich man has been compelled to do. and which was heretofore accepted as his inevitable destiny. Now any intelligent mechanic or artisan can in a few hours with the aid of machinery accomplish as much as hundreds of men could by manual labor in months and perhaps years. In order to accomplish this. if we can safely limit the hours of labor at present to eight hours. we shall liberate many men by giving them time to invent. to think. to become educated in thbir various avocations. It is the mechanic. the man who works with his hands. who discovers new modes of accomplishing great results by machinery. but if you impose upon him such continuous labor that he must occupy every moment left to him in sleep. with no time for reflection and no time for invention. you continue to impose upon him burdens that should be borne by machinery and by other animals than man. I believe. as I said here more than twenty years ago. that any man will accomplish more labor by working eight hours a day thanhe can by working a longer period. if you measure it by his lifetime vastly more. and I doubt very much whetherhe will not accomplish as much in a given day. I have seen a great deal of work done by the eighthoursystem in mining. afdit was ascertained thatin eight hours menaccomplished as much as they didin ten or in twelve hours. They would certainly for a period of six months at least. because they would be more vigorous. Any man can expend his energy sufficiently in eight hours to require rest. and he will accomplish as much in those eight hours as he will if you drag him along through a longer period and destroy his faculties by not giving him time each day to recuperate. The eighthour law was passed in good faith by those who believed in it. I am sorry to say that its purposes have been thwarted by officials of the Government. who did not understand the objects for which it was passed. who were not laboring men themselves. and who did not realize the necessity for rest from manual labor. I am glad the Senator from New Hampshire is at this time p br.-ithis bill. If it shall become a law. it will certainly be a erov.s io1A of his career. I am sorry that a man so thoroughly in syrapatby viib the people is to leave us so soon. but I have no doubt he wiil .un again. I like to see men have some heart and some sympathy v..h the people. A very little observation will satisfy anybo l that everything ea be accomplished in the way of daily labor in eight hours. ThcA. Ii 3no scarcity of laborers. The great trouble is that they can not all b ci cmployed now even eight hours. and people are suflring and t rnu- in this land of plenty for want of employment and for want of the epliortunity to labor for their bread. Why should capital. why should anybody. desire to impose upon those who labor such tasks as will keep them from becomingintell igcTit citizens. keep them from educatingthemselves. andprevent them from inventing and applying the processes of nature to machinery. thcreby relievingand elevating mankind? I think the opposition to the .igbthour law everywhere is unwise and will produce no good. The e pitalist is not benefited by having longer hours of labor. On the ecutrary. he is injured by depriving the people of sufficient opportunii y to inform themselves and to learn how to labor. so as to enable 1imto get a better class of labor. It is from the laboring classes. from the machinists. that we have nearly all this inventive progress and discovery. Very few inventions havebeen suggested by others. If others have made inventions. they received the suggestion in the first instance from operatives with whom they talked. Others may get the patents. but it is the .eactical operative who had the labor to do himself who has seen thu. woy and suggested the way to find machinery to do the work. If there are more laborers than there is labor to be had fbr. then why require those who do labor to continue in serviceso long that thiy can not have the ordinary opportunities for improvement. for red. and for enjoyment? I think there is nothing more injurious to the progress of society than long hours of labor. That has been my opinion for more than a quarter of a centu.y. an d I express it again here and bear my testimony to the truth of the proposition contended for by the laborers. that sufficient labor can b formed. all the work necessary in this country can be perforwal. by workmen laboring eight hours a day. By having no longer hour.. they will have more leisure for cultivating themselves and maing themselves competent to fill the responsible position of citizi:-i ip which they are called upon in this country to fill. They are the ruburs of this country. They should have some time to inform themalvc .. to read the newspapers. to study the questions that tend to ptomoto the material interests of the country. and if you impose upon hem a slavery of ten hours a day there is very little time left for thui. to understand the complicated machinery of the Government undr ..hie h we live. To shorten the hours of labor is to give the people aa Oplortunity to educate themselves. I would educate them. I woudi aid education everywhere and I would take off every burden that limits their opportunities to educate themselves and enjoy their share of tbe blessings of our free Government."},{"1":"5.100676e+08","2":"1890","3":"S","4":"HISCOCK","5":"383","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. I think it proper that I should make a statement right here and now if this discussion of fortifications is to be entered upon. and I desire to call the attention of Senators who propose to discuss that feature to it. I will grant all that is said in respect to wars. but I call attention to the fact that wars have proceeded from threecauses: Conquest. human glory as connected with it. and over the autonomy of states. and the balance of power. They have also been initiated by great nations for the purpose of keeping their people employed. taking care of the elements within the borders of states. I might say fwnishing labor for the people. something to take their attention. That has been a fruitful source of war. Another cause of war has been a dissatisfaction of the people of nations with their forms of government. revolutions have been initiated. To these three causes you may trace all the wars that you will find indicated in your schedule. I have never been alarmed lest there should be an attempt on the part of any foreign Government to subjugate the United States. that a war of conquest would be commenced against us. That notion has never alarmed me. I do not believe that we have yet reached the period when it is necessary for the United States to havea war forthepurpose of employing our people. attracting their attention. It is unnecessary for our people to be governed in any such way as that. I do not believe that over the autonomy of North or South America we are to be forced into a foreign war. It is because I have always been unable to see the causes which would provoke a foreign conflict that I have never been so warmly in favor of an enlarged system of fortifications. I will go further than that and say. of a great Navy or great batteries for the defense of our people. I have said so much thus early in pointing out causes of national conflicts. because I trust if the question of fortifications is to be entered upon here that those Senators who propose to alarm the people by the fear of a foreign war will consider the suggestions I have made."},{"1":"5.001798e+08","2":"1889","3":"S","4":"HAWLEY","5":"225","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"The Commissioner of Labor transmits a special report relating to marriage and divorce.

The people of the world have recognized that. I said that over five millions. nearly six millions. of people have come from Europe to this country in the last twelve yearsmore people than we had on this continent at the time John Adams was elected. President. They came to better their condition and to take up our free lands. Germany sends every year twice as many ablebodied men as compose the Army of the United States. Of the two hundred and fifty thousand Germans who come annually fifty thousand are ablebodied men. That has been about the average. How can we help being better off than the people of the Old World? We are a people young and vigorous. inhabiting a great continent. with labor comparatively scarce. and therefore comparatively dear. not 10 per cent. of many of our most prosperous young States is yet subdued. There is not over 7 per cent. periaps in Minnesota. there is not over 5 in Dakota. not over 2 in Montana and Wyoming. there is not over 5 in Colorado. Wages are obliged to be higher here then elsewhere. Supply and demand regulate that. Wages. like everything else. are regulated by scarcity or abundance. Competition settles rates of wages.. If a man can not get what le wants in a factory he may be able to make more by working on his ownarm. which he can get by going and taking. Of course he will not work at starvation rates with that right open to him. It is a question of supply and demand. No other country can offer such inducements. This being a larger country and a smaller number of people in it than anywhere else. wages are obliged to be higher. It is for that reason that the men of New England have gone to Canada for laborers. and. as some one told me just now. shipped over five hundred Italians the other day. They hire the cheapest labor they can get. They need not try to make anybody believe that they are paying higher wages from pure philanthropy. or because they are endeavoring to aid American labor. Threefourths of our laborers are absolutely beyond the power of Congressional protection. All the men who work on farms are necessarily unprotected. though they are indirectly taxed to death. All the men who build railroads. all the carpenters. the stonemasons. the blacksmithseven tfie doctors. the lawyers. and other professional men are laboring men as well as anybody else. as the Senator from Vermont properly observedthe hackdrivers. the men and the women who work about houses. all are unprotected. And becausb a few men have been smart enough to get machinery that will manufacture now twentyfold what could be manufactured by machinery twenty years ago. and keep up the same tariff to protect that machinery which. although it produces so much. needs only a few hands to run it. when there is an oversupply they organize strikes. turn out the laboring men. grease the machinery to keep it from rusting. and wait until prices are higher. having excluded everybody else from competing with them and forbidding every man who is obliged to sell his products abroad from buying what he needs unless he buys from them at their prices. Under these conditions the manufacturer can afford to wait until his supplies are exhausted before he makes more."},{"1":"4.801000e+08","2":"1885","3":"H","4":"RANDALL","5":"1149","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"In view of the statements which have been made. I think it proper to give a recital of the former action of the Comnittee on Appropriations and the House in relation to this subject. To this end I desire to insert in the RECORD the provisions originally recommended by the Committee on Appropriations. and embraced in the last pension appropriation bill as originally reported from the Appropriations Coiamittee. Section 2 of the bill as we reported it was in this language:. Src. 2. That section 1 of the at entitled An act relating to claim agents and attorneys in pension cases. aproved the 20th day of June.

And the provisions of section 5485 of the Revised Statutes shall be applicable to any person who shall violate this act. I think I am warranted in saying that under these provisions none of the abuses complained of by the gentleman from Ohio would have occurred. But from abundance of.caution. and deeming that the Committee on Pensions. Bounty. and Back Pay had given more thorough and exhaustive examination to this subject. the Committee on Appropriations gave up .the provisions which they had recommended with the view to caring for the interests of the soldiers. and adopted the report of the Connittee on Pensions. Bounty. and Back Pay.

The House is c:.ear. in my judgment. from any censure for any participation it this alleged improper legislation. It went. therefore. the way Ihe gentleman from Ohio desires it now to go. a year ago. to the Senate. The Senate disagreed altogether to any proposition or any legislation having in view the correction of the abuse which the House sought to remedy. They struck the House proposition out entirely. They said. in substance: No. we want no legislation. This is in effect the result of thte action of the Senate at the time to which I allude. When the question came back to the House the House still insisted that legislation was required. and what the gentleman from Ohio has indicated was the character of the legislation upon which the House insisted. When the matter got into conf erence the change was made and legislation was inserted under wlich les were unnetessarily taken from soldiers making applications fbr pensions. and by which they were compelled to employ lawyers here in the city of Washington rather than at their homes. That. Mr. Chairman. is the way in which this legislation came to be placed upon the statutebook. It was never dreamed by any one that such a condition of things would arise as that which has since occurred. and I have deemed it proper to recite the provisions of the bill as reported and sent to the Senate so that the record may be made up and this House relieved from any reflection whatever in connection with this subliect."},{"1":"4.800050e+08","2":"1884","3":"H","4":"WHITE","5":"441","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Out of my eight minutes time I shall not occupy the attention of the committee to show what the rest of it was used for.

It went for surveying and to junketing trips along the river. it went to build boats and into all sorts of expenditures. But the point I make. Mr. Chairman. is simply this. that it out of an expenditureof $856.000 only $24.500 went for labor on construction. and since it is estimated that it will take $33.000.000 to complete the project. I want to ask how many billions of money will be actually required to complete the whole line of the Mississippi River improvement as contemplated? Figure it out for yourselves. gentlemen. at your leisure. remembering that Captain Eads admitted before the Committee on Commerce in 1882 that a mistake of $2.000.000 had been made in the estimate by the levee commission of 1874 relative to closing up gaps in the levees. They estimated for $2.000.000. but $4.000.000 would be required. There is a very popular opinion in this country. and I must avow that I share it in part. that the veto of the President in 1882 was not in the interest of cheap transportation. but in the interest of the railroad kings in this country. Moreover. if the President expects to control the Chicago convention on the 3d day of June next by bidding for Southern votes in his recommendation of the Mississippi River scheme. I think. sir. that he had better look a little sharp. I desire to call the attention of this committee. however. to another fact. that the combination referred to by the President it 1882 has manifested itself already in this House. He recommcnls the Hennepin Canal this year. Two years ago he recommended the Potomac flats and the Mississippi River business. This year lie recommends one million fbr the Mississippi River as a sort of entering wedge for that gigantic scheme. then he goes one better. and recommendsthe IHennepi Canal. You will find. Mr. Chairman. that the friends of the Henfiepin Canal and of the Mississippi River improvement will be standing side by side in the contest. with this difference. that the men in tavor of the Hennepin Canal have possibly always been in favor of internal improvements by the Government. while the friends of the Mississippi River scheme have been on the Democratic side of the question. and been for eighty years the opponents of internal improvements until the prospect of a twobillionofmoney scheme has won them all over.

The practical question before the Senate is just this: Will you pass a law which discriminates against the American author and the American scholar? Now. what is the condition of an author of such a work is is likely to be brought in competition with an English work? What is the condition of a scholar who spends his life at a university. who edits one of the classics. Demosthenes or Virgil or Cicero. or of a scholar who edits Milton or Shakspeare. a scholar like Mir. Hudson. who has produced an edition of Shakspeare which is the result of the study and devotion of a lifetime. a scholar like the editor of the Hillard and Grey edition of Milton. the best household edition ever printed? Now. you say to that author or scholar Your book. if you publish it in tIlls country. your edition of a classic author published here. is to have imposed upon it a duty of from 25 to 40 cents on every article which goes into this produ ction. the paper. the leather. the type. the ink. all highly protected. and the labor. by the result of a system of legislation intended to enhance and avowedly for no other purpose except to enhance and sustain the price of American labor. to be kept at a rate at least 100 per cent. above that of your English or foreign rivals. Now. therefore. if you say that. the result is thatthere can be no American scholarship devoted to the editing of the works of classic authors. whether English or foreign. and American genius in the field of original authorship is to be handicapped and borne down by your system. A slight duty upon books. 20 or 25 per cent.. is the inevitable and logical sequel of the rest of the tariff. The Senator from Kansas may be all right if we were passing under a system of entire free trade and proposing to put a tax upon books. I do not think that American genius. whether in the field of original authorship or scholarship. asks any favors at the hands of Congress. It is not that. It is simply to prevent your other tariff policies. whether right or wrong. from handicapping the American author and the American publisher. If this proposition passes. then you ought to go back in all justice and take off your duty on paper all through. your duty on leather all through. your duty on type. and instead of the policy which enhances the wages of labor adopt a policy which brings it down. While my sympathies are very strong with the Senator from Kansas if I could see a way to accomplish his result consistently with what we have been doing here in other things for the past few weeks. and I would joyfully hail the opportunity. yet I must stand by the bill as it originally came here unless the policy of the bill is to be abandoned altogether."},{"1":"4.700319e+08","2":"1882","3":"H","4":"HAMMOND","5":"423","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I do. too. Senator Grimes said the findings were upon a false basis and upon the exparte statement of the contractors. In confirmation of this last remark Senator SExrtMAX called attention to the fact that the claims were only for $2.383.520.20. and the findings were for $2.267.627. a difference of only 3 or 4 per cent. He also said he understood all extras had been paid for. and with others he fought the bill. It passed the Senate. In the House it was practically defeated. the result being that by amendment Congress passed a resolution of inquiry. (Resolution of 2d of March. 1867. 14 Statutes at Large. page 424.) That resolution embraced all contracts made for vessels between the let of May. 1861. and the 1st of January. 1864. and sought to learn the additional cost which was necessarily incurred by such contractors. Under it a new board was appointed called the Marchand board. That board found for all the fortytwo contractors but $187.475.56. and that nothing was due to Charles Chouteau. this claimant. That is seen in 93 Globe. page 1273. Then all the claimants obtained the passage of a joint resolution remitting them to the Court of Claims and repealing the joint resolution of the 2d of March. 1867. which was in their way. That did not become a law for want of Executive approval. In hisveto message. dated February 7. 1871. President Grant said: It seems to me that the provision thus repealed is a very reasonable one It prevents a contractor from receiving any allowance for an advance in the price of labor and material where he could avoid that advance by the exercise of ordinary prudence and diligence. and the effect of the repeal will be to relieve contractors from the consequences of their own imprudence and negligence.

(17 Statutes at Large. page 764.) and is cited in this report as one of the precedents for the action here asked. The same night. Mr. Foster. of Ohio. reported a bill for the relief of Alexander Swift & Co.. of Ohio. but it didnot pass. The matter came again into Congress for additional action. In the first session of the Fortythird Congress there was a report on a bill for the relief of certain naval contractors. which included this onni made by Mr. Hazelton. from the Committee on War Claims. I ask the Clerk to read from that report the sentences which I have marked."},{"1":"4.601603e+08","2":"1881","3":"H","4":"RYN","5":"299","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"The point of order is made against the amendment that it is obnoxious to a rule that I have not before me.

I will ceal the attention of the Chair to the phraseology of the act itself. showing that nothing but a naked appropriation is necessary to put the act into operation. The act itself does not provide what the cost of the bnlloigshonld be. but it provides that it shall be a tireproof building for the use of the district and circuit courts of the United States. the post.office. the pension agency. the land agency. and other Government offices in that State. The law only needs a naked appropriation to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to construct a building there. and hene I say tbat Congress has within the spirit of the rule already provided by law for the cdnstruction of this building. I say that this is a continuing appropriation. for the appropriation heretofor made provided for the purchase of the ground on which the building should ho erected. which was as indisensahle as any other part of it. Three things are indiapensable in the construction of a building. First. the ground on which It stands . second. the material of which it is constructed. and. third. the labor and skill employed. And you can no more dispense with one of these things than all of them. ani Congress has already made an appropriation of $10.000 to provide for the purchaso of a site for this building. and hence I maintain that the amendment is not obnoxious to the rule."},{"1":"4.600826e+08","2":"1880","3":"H","4":"COBB","5":"286","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Gentlemen on the other side talk of treaty stipulaMloos.

I am unable for one to see why they should be exempted from the rules which obtain in regard to other laboring classes. It was undoubtedly the intent of this law to set an example bythe Federal Government of limitation of the hours of labor which might be followed by the State governments. That example has failed. so far as I am aware it has not been followed by a single State government. It has failed. as I believe all legislation is destined to fail which attempts to limit the hours of labor. Those hours are limited by other causes than by legislation. by influences which are not controlled by legislation but which control legislation. and which have reduced the hours of labor from fifteen or sixteen. as they were less than fifty years ago. to twelve and ten hours as they are now. That influence will continue to be felt until the hours of all laborers are reduced. as the gentleman from New York [Mr. Cox) desires to have them. and in which desire I most heartily concur.

Now. take the law as you find it. make any act you please to carry out the original purpose of the charter. to protect the creditors from the wrong of the debtor. but do not protect the creditor because the creditor made a bad contract. There is no such law as that. You are proposing to protect the creditor because ie made a bad contract at first. you are not proposing to protect the creditor against any maladministration of the debtor. Nobody alleges that it is the bad management of the road that is bringing about this result. it is the mere opinion of the natural course of events. I take this occasion to say that for myself I think the road is worth the money or will be in thirty years or by the time these bonds are due. but that is a mcre matter of opinion. You ionld have no right to take charge of a corporation and administer jts assets because twenty years hereafter it may be in default. It is an absurdity. Again. the rule is distinctly laid down that the conditions or reservations in a contract which are repugnant to the grant or gift by whic4l they are created or to which they are annexed are void. (2d Storys Equity Jurisprudence. section 1304.) If the reservation wouid be void if literally repugnant. much less can you put a constreetion on the reservation which would make it repugnant. Now. you put a construction on this right reserved which negatives a specific sight granted in the charter. The law is that if the reservation literally meant that. it would be void. and now you seek to put a construction on it to make it mean that. That you cannot do. Still again. you cannot use or construe this reservation to  alter. ameu. and repeal so as to defeat or annul the known meaning or understanding of the parties at the time the contract was made. and upon this subject I have authorities here fromn Judge Kent that are very explicit and clear. Judge Kent. after citing Bacons rule. says: The modern and more reasonable practice is to give to the language its just sense .nod to search for the precise meaning and one requisite to give due and fair effect to the contract without adopting either the rule of a rigid or of even indulgent cnstrection. * * * The true principle of sound ethics is to give the con. tract the sense in which the person making i he promise believed the other perty to hav accepted it. if he in fact did so understand and accept it.-2 Kents Coin.. 556. 0.7 That is also the rule of construction of treaties. says Vattel. Th mutunal intention of the parties to the instrumentis the great and sometimes the dimcult object of inquiry when the teons of it are not free from ambiguity. To reach and carry that sntention into elct the law when it becomes necessary will cqntrol even the literal terms of the contract. if they manifestly contravene the perpose. and many cases are given in she books in which the plain intent has provailed over the strict letter of the contract.-2 Kent. 555. NoN\\\\- I put to every Senator here. when these debtors accepted this charter with a distinct stipulation that the Government. until the maturity of the bods. would not exact from them anything in paymeet but half the Government transportation and 5 per cent not carnings. was it understood by either party that the Government should change that and exact al or exact more? For if you have power to exact more you have power to exact all. How did the compauies understand it ? How did the Government say they understood it? How have the Supreme Court decided they understood it? They understood it according to its very language. That is the way they took it. Now for you to exert a general power of reservation to destroy the sense of a specific grant. to destroy the sense in which both parties understood it. in which especially the debtor understood itto exert that general power to destroy that specific grant on that specific stipulation. is a fraud in law. say the books. and you have no power to do it. I admit the full force of the decision read by the Senator from Kentucky. and I wish the Senator from Vermont had heard it. It shows that the reservation of the power to alter. amend. or repeal is to be used to effectuate the original purpose of the grant. VII130 Chancellor Kent continues: So the mutual intention of the parties to the instrument is the great and sometimes the difficult object of inquiry when the terms of it are not free from ambiguity. and to reach ani carry that intention into effect. the law. when it becomes necessary. will control the literal terms of the contract. and if manifestly the contrary is the purpose. and many cases are given in the books in which the plain intent has prevailed over the strict letter of the contract. Why? Because if you induce a man to undertake a risk. to perform a labor under a promise which was specifically given that lie shall reap certain rewards. and after he has performed the labor and taken the risk. for yon. under your reservation of a general power which means to carry out the original purpose. destroy that specific grant. you commit a fraud. See what an absurdity. Here the Supreme Court has decided that under this contract no interest is to be paid except the 5 per cent. of the net earnings until the maturity of the debt. Now. you conic i n hero by legislative power. contrary to the adjudicated intention of the parties. (for the Supreme Court of the United States in their decision adjudicated the original intention and understanding.) and attempt to unsettle the adjudication by declaring that in some form an amount shall be paid more than wis stipulated. The Supreme Court say the original intention of the parties was that nothing but half transportation and 5 per cent. should be paid. Here Kent says. you cannot by a general reservation alter the original intention. you must caery out that original intention and understanding of the parties. and you by this very bill seek to defeat and destroy that original intention. In his able argument the Senator from Michigan [Mr. CnsTiAccY] said in substance that it was no argument against the existence of this power to show it might be injudiciously used. So I tell that Senator it is no argument in favor of the existence of the power to show it might be wisely or even usefully used. If the power does not exist it cannot be used either wisely or unwisely. If Congress can change this contract in any respect it can change it in all respects. If this general reservation to alter or amend gives Congress power to compel the payment of one dollar more than the stipulations require before the maturity of the bonds. then Congress can require every dollar to be paid before maturity. Can Congress by legislation declare that the interest shall be more than 6 percent? I ask the Senator from Kentucky that question. The original act declares that the interest shall be 6 percent. Can Congress now by virtue of its reserved power alter that interest and say it shall be 8 per cent on 10 per cent? Can it declare that the bonds shall be due now? The original contract said the bonds should be due in thirty years and the debt should be paid at the maturity of the bonds. Can you under this power to alter or amend declare that the bonds shall le due tomorrow? If you have the power to declare that the whole: transportation shall be laidwheu the contract requires that only onehalf shall be paid. then you have power to declare that the interest shall be 10 per cent. though the contract says 6. then you have the power to declare that the bonds shall be due tomorrow though the contract says they shall be due in thirty years from their date. But I appeal to gentlemen on another point. and I wish they would answer the question: Can Cougress repeal the act of 1864 and reinstate the first lien of the Government bonds? If so. that is what you ought to do. if the position occupied by the gentlemen of the Judiciary Committee. an able committee I concede. is true. as one of them intinates. that the act of 1864 was aframd--one of them has intimated even that it was the result of briberyif that be true. whynot repeal the act of 1864T"},{"1":"4.500054e+08","2":"1877","3":"H","4":"HART","5":"2949","6":"Yes","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. it is my desire to occupy the floor at this time only to express grave doubt of the wisdom of this proposed measure. and to iive full assent to the views so earnestly declared by the gentleman from New York. [Mr. CntrrTENnrE..] the gentleman from New Jersey. and the gentleman from Rhode Island. [Mr. Ec ims.] who are associated with me on the Committee on Banking and Currency. While I am glad to believe that the friends of this measure are actuated by the same degree of sincerity as those who standin opposition. I cannot think otherwise than that if this bill shall become a law a great wrong will be done. It seems almost a crime to open up this question and plunge the business interests of thowholo country into another period of uncertainty and doubt. when gold and paper currency are so nearly assimilated in value. Notwithstanding the denial of some. I stillbelieve that those undefined laws of trade and commerce. which are as immutable as the laws of nature. will regulate this whole question if we as legislators. instead of tinkering with this subject. will pay attention to building up the material prosperityof our country. In this as in every kind of business. the old saying. Honesty is the best policy. will forcibly apply. This Government has given a pledge to do n certain thing. now let it redeem that promise. In ordinary. everyday transactions we would at once lose confidence in the man who attempted to get rid of paying an acknowledged debt by seeking to pay a sum less than the obligation called for. Is it wise then. in us to place the Government in a position which wouldruin the prospects of any business man. Our credit is worth preserving. We cannot afford to have it impaired. In this case. at any rate. it is oar best poliey to be honest. Mr. Speaker. I have said more than I intended to. My purpose is simply to express a deep conviction that this bill is wrong in principle. likely to be disastrous in effect. and should not become a law. I now yield for a few minutes to my colleague. [Mr. hcCoos.] Liz. McCOOK. Mr. Speaker. I cannot hope to say anything now in regard to the measure now before the House. especially after the able and exhaustive manner in which it has been discussed by those who have preceded me. and nothing but the imperative duty I owe to my constituents and myself induces me to rise for the purpose of giving very briefly and imperfectly my reason why I cannot vote for the bill. In myjudgment. instead of its present title. it should be designated as An act to break the plighted faith of the Government and to impair its credit both at home and abroad. The real question may be disguised by denunciation of national banks. by enlarging upon the danger of contraction and the beauties of expansion. by attempting to array capital against labor. and by reference to the supposed bloodthirsty propensity of the average bondholder. but. after all. the important feature is. Shall the date fixed for the resumption of speciepsyments be repealed and the Government of the United Stales placed lathe atitude of repudiating a solemn pledge? Nearly three years aon the Congress of the United States after full discussion. passed the ill the third section of which is now sought NOVEnmER 16. to be repealed. There were differences then as ner in regard to the wisdom of certain of its features and as to the possible effect upon the country of its passage. So far as I have any knowledge. no effort was made to ignore the fact that resumption at any fixed. definite time. however distant. might work hardship in some instances and possibly cause suffering in others. It was also quite as well understood that any debt. whether private or public. is a burden. that its honest payment often requires great sacrifices. and that. unless repudiation was resorted to. the legaltender notes must be paid at some time or other. The loan was one that had been forced upon the people by the Government in a time of great national peril. when ordinary means had been found insufficient to meet its exigencies. and its eventual payment rested solely upon its honor. As it could not be sued. the hoders of the notes were legally powerless. and while the implied promise of the Government was that they were not to be redeemed in coin until after the termination of the war. it appears to me that no one can. with any show of fairness. defend and justify the indefinitepostponement of the effort. In addition. the act of March. 1869. called the publiccredit act. not only pledged the faith of the United States to the payment in coin or its equivalent of United States notes not bearing interest. bat it explicitly declaredThat the faith of the United States is also solemnly pledced tomale provision at the earlitstpraciable period for the redemption of the United States notes in coin. In January. 1875. six years after this solemn pledge. the initiatory steps weie taken to redeem the promise. but to avoid the dangers of undue haste. the Ist of January. 1679. (four years distant.) was determined upon as the limit when these notes should cease to circulate as overdue and unpaid obligations. and to that extent at least depreciated and dishonored. The necessity that had called them into existence had long since passed away. their presence was a constant reminder of the unfulfilled promise of the Government that had issued them. and the condition of the country justified the attempt that was then made for the first time to give congressional sanction to the pledge of their redemption upon presentation for that purpose. The people. as a rule. accepted in good faith the action of Congress . and. acting upon the belief that a matter of such vital importance would not be lightly interfered -with. began to adjust the business of the country to the new condition of affairs. What has been the result V Without shock and certainly without the widespread disaster predicted by the enemies of the measure. the object sought for has been nearly attained. In my judgment no valid reason. arguing from the present actual condition of the country. can be urged for its repeal. unless. indeed. it is demanded in the interests of those who. having predicted immediate disaster and ruin in consequence of its passage. are exposed to the danger of being considered false prophets by the people. It is indisputable that since the bill became a law there has been a period of depression from which we are now happily recovering. Whatever reasons may be assigned by others in explanation. I believe that it was the natural and inevitable reaction from the overtrading and overspcculatingfollowing the flush times and unlimited expansion of the war period. It culminated in the great disaster of 1873. two years before the passage of the resumption act. and its effects are still felt. At all events. I have seen no reason to justify me in the belief that the resumption act is responsible for the real or imaginary evils complained of. or that it in any manner aggravated them. and. at the risk of being accused of taking a rosecolored view of affairs. I express the opinion that the country as a whole is in a sound and healthy financial condition. and that tiesocalled relief suggested by this act is neither desirable nor advisable. The experiment.if itmaybe called such. has been eminently successful. and the confidence reposed in the stability of the financial policy of the Government. as indicated by the act of January 14. 1875. has taught the people the necessity for a return to the oldfashioned days of industry. prudence. and economy in public and private aflirs. Never before in the history of the Republic has its credit been so good. and. although a year must elapse before the date for resumptiou is reached. the premium on gold has practically disappeared and the purchasing power of the legaltender is within a fraction of that of the standard gold dollar. The immense recuperative power of the country. backed bythefaith of the people in the honest purpose of the Government to keep its pledge. has made the honor and credit of the United States. up to the present moment at least. absolutely unassailable. Whether this condition of affairs is to continue depends. in my judgment. very largely upon the fate of the act under discussion. ]No man can predict with any degree of accuracy the consequences should the opinion become general that it is to become a law. That the actual money loss would be great by the unsettlement of values and the rapid depreciation of the legaltender. I do not for a moment doubt. but. more serious still. irreparable damage would follow from the loss of confidence in the integrity and good faith of a great nation. This same confidence carried us safely through the most perilous period of our national history. and it is as precious and necessary today as it was then. Nothin _ can replace its loss. cud. while a Government may attempt to palliate a national crime or ofter excuses for its acts. the judgment of the world will point unerringly to the fact that. in this case atleast. it was a willful if not dishonest exercise of power. and. in the absence of an overpowering necessity. one absolutely inexcusable under the circumstances. As an eminent writer on this very topic has well said: A nation nay for a time. because of its impersonal character. violate the law of right vithdnt being made sensible of the pensity- but the punishment visits it all the satne and finally declares itself in a national day ofjodgient. 3Mr. Speaker. in support of this act assertions have been made that the contest here is not upon the real merits of the case. but is one between the East and the West. between what some are pleased to call organized capital and the interests of the laborer. and between the debtor and creditor States and communities. if such distinction really exists. To give force to it illustrations have been drawn from the supljosed condition of the city of New York. to the effect that the resumption act was responsible for all the unemployed labor and the sufering there. and thatitsimmediate and unconditional repeal would he a panacea for all our ills. Not satisfied with this. the city and the State have been made especial objects of attack by those who see evidences of crime in the accumulation of capital. and attempts have been made to hold up her capitalists to the gaze of the American peoplo as wreckers 1 and as men not only ready to lure to destroetion. but anxious and willing to trade on the necessities of the Government and the public. Mr. Speaker. every gentleman within the sound of my voice can readily recall the period between 160 and 1855 when there oas an effort made to wreck the Republic. and with it constitutional liberty and the hopes of thosewho believed in the possibility of a government of the people and for the people. At that time of danger and of peril. when State after State was passing urdinances of secession. New York. always true to the best interests of the whole country. throw the weight of her great infldenco on the side of the Union and the enforcement of the laws. Her capitalists. instead of shrinking from responsibility. responded with alacrity to the calls made upon them. and. at a period whea credit wa. as important as men and money as essential as munitions of war. two of her citizens. representatives of this class now so cordially abused. offered without security a loan of $20.000.000 to the Government. and their example was followed bv thousands to the full extent of their ability. Whatever attacks may be made upon them they certainly require no defense at my hands. Denunciation cannot edace the record of thatone act. and the prompt and patriotic manner in which they placed their fortunes at the disposal of the authorities for the suppression of the rebellion entitles them to the respect at least of the American people. So far as the city of New York is concerned. no attempt has ever beeumadetodisguisethefactthatmucli safferingezists there. although there is muehexaggeration and misconception on this topic. Itexisted before the war. before the passagoof the resumption act. and humanly speaking will continue so long as we have great cities with their overcrowded populations. In my judgment no congressional legislation can change or alleviate it. and itisa subjectof so broad a nature and of such vital importance that even if this were the proper time and place I am not prepared to discuss it. Passing beyond the limitsof the city. however. it may not be out of place to refermore especially to the State for purposes of comparison. and to call attention to its position on this question. as indicated by the views of its Representatives in Congress. The first in population and thelargest in representation.it is nomisnomer to call it the Empire State. Reaching from the Atlantic seaboard to the great lakes on the North and West. it stands between New England and the West and South. in constant cobsmunication with ana vitally interested in the welfare and prosperity of each. Without at all desiring to institute any vidious comparison. its interests are more varied and diversified than any State in the Union. With its five millions of inhabitants and its one million of voters engaged in commerce. in trade. in agriculture. in manufacturing. and in mining.it is in every sense of the word a fairly representative State. Its harbors and navigable waters are crowded with the commerce of the world. Its great city. the third on the globe. is the recognized financial centre of the continent. Its valleys are as fruitful as those. of the West or South and are filled with a farming population second to none in thrift. intelligence. and culture. Itstowns and cities are crowded with skilled artisans. and every branch of industry known to our people is recognized and encouraged. Certainly. under these circumstances. no just suspicion can attach to all the Representatives from such a Stats. that they sit here. not in the interests of the people. but in the interest of the bondholder. the national banks and of capital as against labor. Yet without presuming to speak for any one but myself. I am informed that. without regard to party. they will be practically a unit against repeal. Mr. Speaker. I make no pretension to that peeuliarlkind of financial knowledge that can theorize until the subjectmatter is lost sight of in an avalanche of wordsanda wilderness of figures and statements. I content myself with my original proposition that the repeal of the resumption act will be a blow at the faith and credit of the Government. that the legaltender notes are obligations to pay an honest dollar on demand. that they were forced upon the people. and that they are overdue and unpaid. I entirely agree with the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania in his estimate of the value of the greenback during the war. and listened to his magnificent eulogy of them with great interest. Without intrinsic value. they played an Ago important part in the salvation of the nation. but they did it simply and solely because the people believed that the promise on their face would be kept. to the letter. In the face of this express promise. it n ill not be disputed. here orelsewhere. that at some time the Government must discharge its obligations. A definite time has been fixed. and the nearer we approach it the more evident it becomes that. unless obstacle? are interposed. speie payments will bereached without ehock. withont undue contraction. and without disaster. Already. in my judgment. one blow has been struck at the national credit by the passage through this Houst. of the silver bill. opening as it does the door to unlimited inflation. and it is to be hoped that the bus.iuess interests of the country may be spared the infliction of a second in the shape of the one now before us. The present. I believe. is the preliminary skirmish to the great battle to be fought at the ballotbox next autumn. Clearly and distinetlv defined. throwing in the shade questions of southern policy and civil service and towering above all others in dignity and importance. will be the plain issue of who shall control the financial policy of the country and secure possession of the National Treasury. Possibly the plan forthe unlimited issue of the doilarof oar fathers. followed immediately by the effort to repeal the resumption act. may furnish a key to the solution of many of the questions that have puzzled and alarmed the people. Rumors of subsidies of all kinds to be asked for from Congress. new and startling propositions for loaning the credit of the Governmeut to the individual citizen as an aid to emigration. and the uncertain condition of the claims made for destruction of property during the war. are matters that may yet assume such shape asto become of national importance. But. whatever the motive for repeal. like the gentleman from Indiana. although for a different reason. I deem it my duty on this question to adhere to the timehonored maxim of letting well enough alone. and I shall vote. therefore. against any proposition for the repeal of the act for the resumption of specie payments."},{"1":"4.400178e+08","2":"1876","3":"H","4":"BRIGHT","5":"595","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"It is with some regret that I intrude ny renarks on the attention of the Huuse.

The jurisdiction has already attached. and the Senate is vested with plenary judicial power to proceed to judgment. In this state of the case what anuthoricy has a subordinate judicial tribunal to iterpose its power and wrest the jurisdiction and compel the delivery of the testimony in the keeping of the superior court ? Why. sir. I ltsd always supposed that even in a case of concurrent jurisdiction the jurisdiction which tirst attached to the persoi in crimimal proceedings hel its jurisdictin until it was exhausted. The prisoner could tot be held oi trial before two tribunals at the same time. Though the Senate as au.impeaehing euart might proceed without the presence of the prisoner. yet the prisoner would have the right to be present. But what is the meaning of this effort to oust Congress of its jurlsdiction ? I upprehend the sesult would be. whether so intended or not. to intimidate the leadini witnesses and drive them beyond the jurisdiction of the court and aengress. and thus procure the acquittal of the grand offender by default of testimony. And the judgment of such acquittal would be pleaded in bar of the prosecution of impeachment in the Senate. but whether it could te successfully pleaded is another question. This indecent haste to arrest the documentary evidence i the keeping of Congress seems to smack of design. There is to absohte necessity for sch immediate proceeding. The prisoner might have been secured by arrest and hold in bail. I maintain. Mr. Speaker. that the proceediigsin the inferior court might become illegal if resorted to for the purpose of gettitng up prosecutions or indictments against the witnesses whose testimony would convict the prisoner ani by intimidatio keep them from the court. I say so because we have a highly penal statute which prohibits time intimidation of witnesses by threats or otherwise. If the court is resorted to as an instrument of intimidatio. so much the worse. Congress has ample jurisdietion and capacity to try the high offetider who has been summoned before its bar. It is a part of the history of all governments that the reign of high crimes and nmisdemeanors can only be arrested at times by securing the testimony of accomplices. and the state gives immunity to the inforoser as a censideratiou for the advantage of his testimony. Every one must know that if indictments are found in the inferior tribunal which has attempted to oust Congress of its acquired jurisdiction and before the immunity is secured. to accomplice witnesses. they would in terror fly from the jurisdiction of the coert. I believe this attempt of the inferior court to deprive Congress of its acquired jurisdiction will inspire the conviction in the country that this court has been used only as a scapegoat to allow the criminal to make his escape into the wilderness. The country will believe that it woni be only a proceeding to drive away thieves outside of the Cabinet to protect thieves in the Cabinet."},{"1":"4.301097e+08","2":"1875","3":"S","4":"EDMUNDS","5":"504","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I was going on to state: It is one of the misfortunes I labor under that I cannot say everything at once and I do not want to take time.

We all know as a practical thing from what we have seen. those of ns who have been here through one or two presidential elections. that the difficulty in coming to a conscientious and right judgment upon a question that is presented is very great on account of the haste. the want of time. the inability of sixty or seventy Senators--taking this small bodybeing able to see precisely what the question is. Every Senator cannot look at tie papers at the same time. and we are in haste. we must act without debate nunder existing rules. or. if under debate. every Senator who is acting conscientiously. as all do. would wish to see precisely what this document is which is drawn in question. We are acting of course in all these occasions upon the papers and upon the papers alone. Very well. The difficulty therefore is one which exists in all large bodies where you are calle upon to decide suddenly upon a paper which you leave never seen before where a great number of persois canmot take it in hands and inspect it. and they have not time to refer to authority or precedent. or Constitution. in order to come to a right judgment. Now. if you remit. not by force of the power of either body as a part of the legislative department of the Goverument but by force of the law. this power to a chosen body of the members of the two Houses. who are small enough to act together. and each one of whom may be able to see precisely what the paper is that is drawn in question and who may by themselves have time enough. if it be not more than an hour. to study and examine the question conscientiously. and under the sanction of an oath to decide rightly. is there not a greater probability that you reach the true and lawful result. than there isii saying that you leave it at large to three hundred men at the other end of the Capitol and to seventyfour at this end ? I think it is."},{"1":"4.300447e+08","2":"1874","3":"H","4":"MOREY","5":"1491","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I have no apology to offer the House for thrusting on its attention this resolution at this moment.

And yet this realm of fertility is subject to yearly islutdtation from the very waters that have ereated ittie floods of the Mississippi River. Tte whole dolta is an enormous basin. with every acre of its bottom lying deep below the level of cite rivers extreme floods. From Cape Girardeau. in Missouri. to the border of the Gulf of Mexico. it might be regarded. in the greatest flood seasons. as oue vast delta sea. timTOnaY OF Tte CONFLIOT OF IaaBs wrrH niFeoODs.

You will join tue in renidering him ample honors for the grandest of human enterprises when I show yoU that up to the year 1861 lie hiadt reduced the average level of the twelvefoot inuidation by about four feet all over the basin. by running his feeble eartlhcn barriers Anuu 21. along the border of the river. the rhu of the delta sea. and had lined all its interior ehanels with a hardy and most adventurous populaition. Iris levees were two thousand miles in length. They had grownhe could scarcely tell you why or howthrough one hundred and fifty years of struggle. of alternate success ad inundation. No one. for a century. ever dreamed of exterminating the foe. Like the removal of the American savage from the continent. it was a work always progressing but never declared complete. or contemplatedas a whole. But at last the moment came. and the resolutioi was taken to reserve and reclaim the whole delta. The man still lives and is within the sound of my voice. halo and vigorous. with the hope of seeing its completion. who first wrote the proposal. in 1840. to anacle tie river with chains of levees as long as the delta. and to reserve the entire alluvion for the uses of men. And all this labor. these millions of treasure. and these five generations of menhave bes consumed in the struggle without the aid of the strong arm of the Government. Front proprietors first built their own levees. and on* this condition held the titles to these lands (luring the first century of this conflict. When the work grow beyond their capacity. and the unoccupied links of the chain had to be constructed. counties and parishes and districts. then States. one after the other. embarked it this enterprise. and the Government of the United States. having sold its millions upon millions of acres thus rescued by local effort. at last granted the unsalable swamp lands yt to be reclaimed to the States that would undertake to reseie them. a grunt much like the privilege to have all the fish they could catch from the navigable waters. Still the grant had its effect. and the States utilized for levee pirposes all the lands they could still render salable. after the best lands they had reserved had all been selected and bought from the United States. and but for the sad war that ensued we would have triumphed in a complete rescue of the delta sea from the dominion of the floods. Abandonment and destruction followed the clash of arms. and to this day the flood hasbeen regaining his dominion. Theriver had gathered force from his long restraint. His voracity had gnawed away the banks till the dikes of resistance had been driven back to the lower grounds audhadtobe replaced by more powerful and costly barriers. only practicable to a prosperous people. When the cloud of war had cleared Away lie people who survived the conflict of arms returned to find hundreds of miles of their barriers swept away or broleen and unavailing. Fron Cape Girardeau to the Arkansas R iver the right bank was abandoned. except at special localities. and the States of Arkansas and Missouri have made no systematic effort to replace their levees. and for one hundred and twenty miles below the Arkansas River on the right bank the stuaggle to reclaim can searcely be called systematic. and the result has been failne and abandonment. Thus oncthird of the great basin on the right is now open to the ravages of the flood and the eonsequence is desolation and delge. The daily papers and the telegraphic accounts tell us of the distress. calling aloud for rolief. of a suffering people. Below latitude thirtythree on the sight. amd blow thirtyfive on the left bankthe States of Louisiana and Mississippi returned to the great conflict with the floods. Mississippi with four humred miles to guard. and Louisiana with seven hundred and fifty miles of the great rivers front. rallied to repair and rebuild their levees. Tho former has spent some three or four millions and the latter no less than thirteen millions of dollars to replace the levees destroyed by enilitarynecessity and by abandonment during the war. and yet. Mr. Speaker. the daily reportsof crevasses. inundations. and disasterswilltcll you htwutterly inadequate these lifestruggles have been. The cry for help from a suffering people is just now utterly appalling. We come. Air. Speaker. to lay down at the feet of Congress our arms of resistance to those floods. to confess our inability. like tho gallant but misguided solliers of the coufederacy. to struggle longer against a power so exhaustless and nearly omnipotent. flrow the mantle of tbe panoply of your greater power around us. for see ean baild the lereedefenses no longer.
