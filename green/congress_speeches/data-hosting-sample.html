I rise to oppose the confirmation of Joseph Goffman for Assistant Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. My opposition is not about a person. My opposition is about a poisonous idea. The idea of total government control. Mr. Goffman wants to control what Americans can drive. where Americans can work. and what Americans can buy. Mr. Goffman wants to do this by imposing political. punishing. and penalizing regulations. These regulations will cost Americans their future and their freedom. From energy to the environment. Mr. Goffmans record is radical and extreme. Mr. Goffman is one of the main architects of the so-called Clean Power Plan. This was such an extreme overreach that it was struck down by the Supreme Court. Mr. Goffman is also a champion of Joe Bidens out-of-touch. electric vehicle mandates. Mr. Goffman is one of Joe Bidens top generals in Democrats war on affordable. reliable. american-made energy. By the EPAs own estimates. the regulatory costs imposed by Mr. Goffmans department already exceed $500 billion. Mr. Goffman is determined to keep pushing Democrats job-killing. radical. out-of-touch. environmental agenda. The Supreme Court has repeatedly shot down the EPA for overreaching in its authority. Mr. Goffman doesnt care what the Court says. He wants to defy its rulings. including the landmark case West Virginia v. EPA. Mr. Goffman had the audacity to tell the New York Times. This case does not take anything off the menu. President Biden has chosen another unelected. unaccountable. heavy- handed. Washington bureaucrat who believes the rules dont apply to him. If confirmed by the Senate. Mr. Goffman will not moderate. He will not change. He will not stop. If you want an EPA that is more aggressive. more out-of-touch. and controls more of your life. then vote for Mr. Goffman. But if you want to lower costs. unleash American energy. and protect American jobs. then vote no. Energy-producing States such as Wyoming have been in Mr. Goffmans crosshairs for years. We should not allow him to have his fingers on the trigger. The Senate must reject his nomination.&lt.bullet&gt."},{"1":"1.182023e+13","2":"2023","3":"S","4":"Mr. SCHUMER","5":"314","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Madam President.

I did something I havent done in a number of years. which is to attend a session of the U.S. Supreme Court. their oral arguments. Of course. as you know. during the COVID pandemic. even the Supreme Court had to change the way it operated. but now the Court is back in the Supreme Court Building. meeting together. and listening to oral arguments and deciding some of the most important cases that are confounding the country and our legal system. But the case that I listened to oral arguments in hit very close to home because the style of the case was United States v. Texas. It centers on a memo issued by the Department of Homeland Security Secretary. Alejandro Mayorkas. which he released last fall. In it. he provided specific confirmation--indeed. actually direction--to our Border Patrol agents that they would no longer have any hard and fast rules when it comes to removing illegal entry into the United States. particularly by those who commit serious crimes. So rather than a mandatory rule. Secretary Mayorkas said: Well. you have to weigh these various factors to see whether somebody who is guilty of a serious crime should be removed from the United States. Under this memorandum. officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement were discouraged from arresting or removing illegal immigrants unless they posed a threat to national security. public safety. or border security. That sounds reasonable. but it is a little more amorphous. a little more vague than specifically people who have committed aggravated felonies. The memorandum. though. goes on to say that the Agency will prioritize anyone who poses a current threat to public safety. but it is unclear exactly what that means. The guidelines state that this is not to be determined according to bright lines or categories. If you are a law enforcement officer. like the Border Patrol. what do you want? You want bright lines. You dont want categories. You dont want some woke statement about. well. on one hand. you have to consider these factors. on the other hand. you have to consider these factors. They need bright lines so they can make. perhaps. even life-and-death decisions. But what Secretary Mayorkas has said in this memorandum is that there is really no clear guidance. no clear definition for our Border Patrol in terms of the people they need to detain and remove from the United States because they are a public safety threat. I would hope that crimes like murder. rape. and aggravated assault would meet this balancing test by Secretary Mayorkas. but the memo does not offer any specifics. It is. on this hand. you have to consider these factors. on the other hand. you have to consider these without any real guidance. We know it is unfair to our law enforcement officials to not provide them with better guidance because they have to make difficult decisions--sometimes split-second decisions. sometimes life-and-death decisions. And to have somebody come back and say. Well. you didnt properly balance the considerations. as opposed to having a bright line rule or category. which is less discretionary and which provides much more clarity and certainty. I think it is a disservice to them. as well. What about domestic violence. what about child pornography. what about driving under the influence of alcohol. money laundering. embezzlement? You can look in this memorandum and you wont find any answers to those questions. just the old balancing test: On the one hand. think about these things. on the other hand. think about those. The administration has offered such vague guidance with the term current threat to public safety that different ICE officers may well reach different conclusions. Making matters worse. the memo outlines mitigating factors. So not only do you consider these factors and these factors and balance them. then you need to consider mitigating factors that an officer should consider whether to enforce the law or simply walk away. This includes the age of the migrant. as well as how long they have been living in the United States. as if a migrant entering the country illegally somehow would acquire some equity or vested interest because they have been here longer than somebody else. That makes no sense at all. The memorandum also said that the law enforcement officer must also include a consideration of the physical or mental condition of the migrant. It even directs ICE officers to consider how the removal of somebody illegally in the United States would impact other people and their family. Just to be clear. these are not mandates from Congress. This is the product of a made-up memorandum by the Secretary of Homeland Security. Congress has given the Department the authority to exercise some prosecutorial decision. but there is a difference between prioritizing certain offenses for removal and effectively exempting entire categories for enforcement. I think one of the problems that Secretary Mayorkas has is that he thinks he has the authority to pick and choose which laws to enforce. He has no such authority. Now. he does have authority in terms of prioritizing them. But. basically. he said that somebody who was in the country illegally because they violated immigration laws is the lowest of priorities for detention and removal. That is what gets you several million people over the last couple years. That is what gets you a border crisis. which allows for the illegal importation of the drugs that killed 108.000 Americans last year--that sort of wokeness and lawlessness. We have seen previous administrations prioritize the removal of terrorists. transnational criminals. or people who pose a threat to public safety or national security. and that is fine. I think we can all agree that law enforcement should use its limited resources to address the biggest threats but not in the process exempt other people who have violated the law from any potential consequences. It defies all common sense to instruct a law enforcement officer to turn a blind eye when they encounter individuals who came here illegally and committed other crimes just because those crimes arent. in the opinion of Secretary Mayorkas. serious enough or because of the age of the individual or how long they have actually resided here in the United States. The lower court. the District Court for the Southern District of Texas. found that Secretary Mayorkass memorandum guidance doesnt justify common sense. They found that it breaks the law. Congress has provided the requirement and said that the Secretary shall take into custody noncitizens who commit certain crimes--shall. The question Chief Justice Roberts kept asking is. Does shall mean shall or does shall mean may.--because the law. which Congress has passed and was signed by the President of the United States. says that you shall take into custody illegal immigrants who commit certain crimes and you shall remove those individuals once they are released from criminal custody. So the word shall is mandatory. It is not discretionary. Congresss law that we passed isnt just a polite suggestion. It is an instruction. it is a direction. It is a requirement. It is a mandate. The reality of this situation. however inconvenient it may be for some of our colleagues. is that by entering the United States illegally. these individuals have. by definition. broken the law. The Secretary of Homeland Security doesnt have the authority to determine whether those individuals should face the legal consequences that Congress has mandated. That is our job. and the decision was made long before President Biden or Secretary Mayorkas took office. The State of Texas is disproportionately affected because we have a 1.200-mile common border with Mexico. and we are seeing the bulk of this wave of humanity and the drugs coming across the border. and it has imposed a significant burden on our border communities and on our State. But I believe that the State provided a strong case that the Justices should vacate this dangerous and illegal memo once and for all. If you think about it a minute. by saying. Well. you have to weigh these factors against these factors and. oh. by the way. if somebody is of a certain age or has been here a while then you exclude them entirely. what this memorandum did and does is sent a clear message to the world that if you come to the United States illegally. you will be able to stay as long as you dont get caught committing a murder or some other heinous crime. But if you commit other crimes. you still might be released by the Department of Homeland Security because there is no bright line rule requiring removal under those circumstances. This turns on its head what the obligation of the Secretary of Homeland Security should be. He takes an oath similar to the one we take to uphold the law. the Constitution and laws of the United States. I believe it is a clear violation of his oath and his responsibility to try to provide this watered-down memorandum. It is completely impossible for an individual Customs and Border Protection officer to know how they should strike the balance. It is going to be second- guessed. As I said earlier. two Border Patrol agents looking at the same individual may weigh these factors differently. Well. it is contributing to the Biden border crisis that we have seen raging for the past 2 years. The United States. as we like to say. is a nation of laws. not men and women. In other words. it doesnt depend on who you are. It depends on what the law is. and we all have the same obligation to follow the law. The Secretary simply doesnt have the authority to cherry-pick which laws he wants to enforce and which ones he doesnt. Congress writes the laws. and the executive branch is charged with enforcing those laws as written. not as how you wish they would be-- nothing more and nothing less. But. unfortunately. we have seen. time and time again--not for days. not for weeks. but for months and even now years--that the Biden administration has simply failed to clear this very low bar--enforce the law. It is discouraging ICE personnel--again. ICE is Immigration and Customs Enforcement--from enforcing our immigration laws. You remember that. a couple of years ago. some of the more radical members of our colleagues political party said: You should abolish ICE. We shouldnt enforce any of our laws. But the consequences are pretty clear now. They failed to secure the border or provide frontline law enforcement and agents with the resources they need in order to do their job. These can sometimes be very dangerous jobs. What is more. the administration has actually sanctioned villainizing Border Patrol and ICE personnel for doing the very job that we asked them to do--enforcing our immigration laws. Frequently. if you talk to the Border Patrol agents. they will talk about the push factors that encourage people to leave their home country. like poverty and violence. And then they talk about the pull factors. or what they can expect to encounter at the border as to discourage them from coming or to encourage them. There has been no attempt by the Biden administration to address the pull factor that encourages people to make the dangerous trek from their homes and come to the United States illegally. That would be something called deterrence. discouraging somebody from illegally coming to the country in the first place. And the asylum program. which has now resulted in millions of cases on the backlog of immigration courts. there has been no effort made to try to fix the broken asylum process. no attempt to strengthen law enforcement and to actually remove people who have no legal right to be here in the United States. If you go to the border now--as I have been many times--and you talk to the Border Patrol agents. they will tell you that they routinely detain people from as many as 150 different countries. This isnt just people coming from Mexico or Central America. these are literally people coming from around the world. You will find Ukrainians. You will find Russians. You will find people from the Middle East. You will find people from Iran. North Korea. China. The fact of the matter is that if you have enough money. if you are willing to pay the price that these human smugglers require. you can make your way into the United States and through our southern border illegally. So it is an abdication of duty and a complete embarrassment to our law-abiding society. I think many Americans watch what is happening at the border. and they wonder. is this the same country I grew up in. or did I miss something? Because they feel like something has gone terribly awry with this sort of lawlessness and chaos. The Biden administrations laissez faire attitude toward our Nations immigration laws is absolutely disgraceful. and there must be consequences. The American people deserve better than this. and I hope to see more accountability next Congress once Republicans take control of the House. That means that we will have new chairmen of the various committees. and they will call people like Secretary Mayorkas before those committees and hold them accountable. But until that happens. I dont expect things to get much better. because if the Biden administration hasnt been motivated to get off the dime and actually do something about this chaos and lawlessness at the border. I dont know what it will take to change their minds. But sometimes when public officials dont do what they are supposed to do and you cant change their minds. sometimes you need to change who those public officials are. Unfortunately. we may have to wait until the next election to do that. Immigration enforcement is a bigger job today than it was a few years ago. and I am afraid it is getting ready to become even more challenging. Just last month. the DC district court judge vacated the Center For Disease Controls title 42 order. and the judge granted a 5- week stay which will expire here in less than 3 weeks. Title 42--just to remind everybody--is a pandemic-related order designed to protect public health. It is not really an immigration order. but it is a public health order. So when people are coming across the border untested and unvaccinated. we recognize that is a potential to spread even more of the coronavirus. And so Border Patrol has told me as long ago as about a year ago that they have been able to expel some people. particularly adult males. from coming across the border using the title 42 authority. But that is getting ready to go away in 5 weeks--or less than 3 weeks now. And we have not heard any plan out of the Biden administration for how they are going to do the job without that authority. because they simply refuse to use any other authorities. like expedited removal. in order to discourage people from illegally entering the country. Back when I sat down with some of the leaders of the Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol. about a year ago now. they told me that once title 42 goes away. unless there is another alternative plan for controlling peoples access to the border. they will lose control completely. At this point. title 42 is one of the few remaining tools we have to prevent even more chaos at the border. Of the more than 230.000 encounters at the southern border in October. 230.000 migrants came to the border. more than 78.000 were removed under title 42. You might ask what happened to the rest of them. Well. they were ushered into the country. perhaps never to be heard from again. based on weak asylum claims or other refusals by the Biden administration simply to enforce our immigration laws. But 78.000 is not inconsequential. That is 78.000 people the Border Patrol didnt have to process. feed or house. or take care of. But once title 42 is gone. that will all change. And the consequences will be dire. It has been 2 weeks since the Federal judge struck down title 42. and I have yet to hear a peep out of the Biden administration what they will do to address these consequences. A few weeks ago. President Biden held a post-election press conference and was asked what he intends to do differently over the next 2 years. given the fact that 75 percent of the voters say the country is headed in the wrong direction. He said: Nothing. He intends to do nothing differently. Three out of four Americans believe the country is heading in the wrong direction. and the President of the United States of America says: I am not going to change the direction. The Senate majority leader shared the same sentiment. calling the election results a vindication for Democrats. Given their recent comments. President Biden and Senator Schumer dont seem to recognize there is a problem at all. In fact. they seem happy with the way things are going. and they have assured us that Democrats are just going to keep moving in the same direction. So if you think this is bad--and two-thirds of the voters believe we are headed in the wrong direction--just get ready. because it is about to get worse. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."},{"1":"1.172021e+13","2":"2021","3":"H","4":"Ms. SPEIER","5":"134","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Madam Speaker. I thank the gentlewoman and dear friend. Ms. Frankel.

That is great. but 90 percent of those jobs are going to men. Meanwhile. the pandemic has created an environment where 1.6 million women have left the workforce. That is the lowest participation of women in the workforce since 1988. We are going back. We are not going forward. unless we have the Build Back Better plan. which is going to provide the infrastructure for childcare and pre-K and the opportunity for women to get back to work.

I rise to honor the life and legacy of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The Nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. who died Friday night. She died on the eve of the Jewish new year. Rosh Hashanah. She was the first Jewish woman on the U.S. Supreme Court. Rabbis tell us a very interesting thing about individuals who die right before the new year. They say and they suggest that these are very righteous people who die at the very end of the year because they were needed until the very end. Under Jewish tradition. those who die on the new year holiday are considered tzadik. a title given to the righteous and saintly. Certainly Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was entitled to this honor. being righteous and saintly. At her confirmation hearing. Justice Ginsburg talked about her immigrant experience. You see. her father was a Jewish immigrant. and her mother was barely a second-generation American. So she talked about American values. and then she said: What has become of me could only happen in America. Then she spent her entire career protecting those values that make America the great Nation it is and the reason why people come here in order to reach their full potential. It guided her well in her public service. Justice Ginsburg was both an inspiration and a trailblazer in every sense of the word. After breaking through the countless barriers thrown in her path. she redefined what is meant to be both a thoughtful jurist and a dedicated public servant. Let me just briefly go over some of her incredible accomplishments: first in her undergraduate class at Cornell University. first female member of the Harvard Law Journal. graduating first in her class at Columbia Law School. first female professor at Columbia University to earn tenure. Justice Ginsburg directed the ACLU Womens Rights Project and argued six landmark cases before the Supreme Court. winning five of those cases. These cases protected not only the rights of women but those of many men who faced discrimination as well. As the National Womens Law Center wrote about Justice Ginsburgs death. they said: [Her passing] is cause for us to pause and honor the unparalleled mark she has left on this country. From co- founding the ACLUs Womens Rights Project. to bringing the first case striking down a law that discriminated against women. to building the case that defined the standard for sex discrimination cases. Ginsburg was a visionary who revolutionized the gender equality movement--and the law-- long before becoming a Supreme Court Justice. For our country. Ginsburgs ethos was greater than just the law. She was an icon and a living symbol of a north star. so we must unite and do for her what she did for us--fight for what is right. As a litigator. Judge Ginsburg helped to shape the law. convincing the Supreme Court that equal protection of the law under the 14th Amendment applied not only to racial discrimination but to gender discrimination as well. Justice Ginsburg herself knew discrimination firsthand. as she struggled to find a job after graduating law school--notwithstanding her sterling qualifications. She had that difficulty. as we all know. solely because of her gender. She experienced gender discrimination firsthand. and she did something about it not only for herself but for future generations. After serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals for for 13 years. she began a 27-year career on the U.S. Supreme Court. There are so many of her decisions that were so consequential. so visionary. expressing the right value. and her ability to express her views was unquestioned. She did that in writing majority opinions. and she is well known for doing that in writing dissenting opinions. So many of her dissenting opinions led the way for change. She was right. and she motivated change. In 1996. Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion of the Court in the finding that the all-male admissions policy at the State-supported Virginia Military Institute was unconstitutional. She said in that opinion: Generalizations about the way women are. estimates of what is appropriate for most women. no longer justify denying opportunity to women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average description. Any differential treatment. she concluded. must not create or perpetuate the legal. social. and economic inferiority of women. What a difference she made in that decision. I will always remember her dissenting opinion in the Lilly Ledbetter case because it led directly to change. Justice Ginsburg wrote in that fiery dissent: Our precedent suggests. and lower courts have overwhelmingly held. that the unlawful practice is the current payment of salaries infected by gender-based (or race-based) discrimination--a practice that occurs whenever a paycheck delivers less to a woman than to a similarly situated man. I heard one of my colleagues talk about precedent. but here we see the Court reversing precedent in order to advance discrimination against women. Her dissent led to congressional action. becoming the first piece of legislation signed by President Barack Obama. The text of this bill hung on her office wall for good reason. as it embodied her spirit. She issued a fiery dissent again in the Shelby County v. Holder case in 2013. a case decided by a 5-to-4 vote of the Supreme Court of the United States. which gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Here is what she said in that opinion: What has become of the courts usual restraint? Justice Ginsburg wrote in her dissenting opinion: The great man who led the march from Selma to Montgomery and there called for the passage of the Voting Rights Act foresaw progress. even in Alabama. The arc of the moral universe is long. he said. but it bends toward justice. if there is a steadfast commitment to see the task through to completion. That commitment has been disserved by todays decision. . . . Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet. I mentioned these cases to underscore the importance of the Supreme Court Justice in the lives of all Americans. So much is at stake in the filling of Justice Ginsburgs vacancy. It will have real consequences on all of our constituents. Let me just give you a few examples of what is likely to be taken up by the Supreme Court that could affect my constituents in Maryland and the constituents around the Nation. Your healthcare is. literally. on the line. The Affordable Care Act that President Trump has tried to repeal and the Republicans have tried to repeal in this body but have failed. they are now going to take to the Supreme Court. A hearing is scheduled this November. This is a real risk for tens of millions of Americans who depend on the law for their health coverage and other benefits. Twenty million Americans could lose their healthcare. and people with preexisting conditions could lose those protections--that is 133 million Americans--during the coronavirus pandemic. That is what is at risk. We are talking about pregnancy. cancer. diabetes. high blood pressure. behavioral health disorders. high cholesterol. asthma. chronic lung disease. heart conditions. and numerous others that have been held to be preexisting conditions. That protection is in the Affordable Care Act. That is on the line before the Supreme Court this November. That is why Americans are concerned that we follow the right process in selecting the next individual to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. If the Affordable Care Act is struck down. insurers could bring back annual and lifetime limits on coverage. adults covered by Medicaid expansion would lose vital health services. young people would be kicked off of their parents insurance. and insurers could sell skimpy plans that dont even cover essential health benefits like prescription drugs. emergency room visits. mental health and substance use. and maternity care. The Affordable Care Act increased access to care for millions who were previously uninsured or underinsured. Through Medicaid expansion. 13 million low-income Americans now have dependable. comprehensive health. In Maryland alone. over 1.3 low-income individuals depend on Medicaid. including 512.000 low-income children. 107.000 seniors. and 152.000 individuals with disabilities. That is in Maryland. We must protect the Medicaid expansion population and other uninsured and underinsured populations from the Trump administrations effort to eliminate their access to affordable care. It is at risk. This vacancy is critically important to protecting healthcare. and there are so many other issues. Womens reproductive rights--clearly at risk. Roe v. Wade--I understand it is established precedent. but look at what the Supreme Court has been willing to do in reversing precedent. We know Roe v. Wade is in the crosshairs for change by the Supreme Court. and one more Justice appointed to support that position and a womans right of choice could very well be in jeopardy. Our most vulnerable individuals are at risk as well. Let me talk about one specific group of people--some of our immigrants. On June 18. 2020. in a 5-to-4 decision written by Justice Roberts and joined by Justice Ginsburg. the Supreme Court held that the Department of Homeland Security violated the law when it rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival. DACA. Program. There are approximately 643.000 DACA recipients in the United States. and approximately 29.000 are healthcare workers. essential workers. whose service during the COVID-19 pandemic has saved lives and eased suffering. But for that 5-to-4 decision. those individuals lives could have been totally disrupted had they been ordered to leave our country. These are individuals who know no other home but the United States of America. They are our neighbors and friends--and yet a 5-to-4 decision of the Supreme Court. Justice Ginsburg will no longer be there. This next Justice could very well determine the fate of the Dreamers. LGBTQ community: In the Obergefell v. Hodges case. the Supreme Court. by a 5-to-4 decision. held the Constitution guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry. That is a 5-to-4 decision. I always expected that. in America. we would move forward in protecting individual rights under our Constitution. that. in each Congress and each session. the Supreme Court would advance those rights for individuals protection under the Constitution of the United States. The filling of this Supreme Court vacancy could very well reverse a trend of protecting rights and deny many in our community their rights. I could cite many. many other examples of what is at risk by the Supreme Court appointment. There are many reasons why we believe that we should follow the proper process in selecting the next Supreme Court Justice. so lets talk a little bit about what process we should follow. Lets talk a little bit about fairness. Lets talk about the integrity of the Senate. Lets talk about living up to our own words. Lets talk about using the same rules for Democrats that you use for Republicans. Lets talk about the fairness of the process. Now. I could spend a lot of time on the floor quoting the comments of so many of my colleagues who spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate 4 years ago on the Merrick Garland nomination by President Obama and how they spoke about the importance of listening to the voters of our Nation. how they said we didnt have the time--and. remember. Merrick Garland was in February of an election year--to do this. that we needed to withhold taking up the nomination. that it was up to the voters to act first. and that this had nothing to do with the fact that it was a Democrat in the White House. So many of our colleagues said: If there is a Republican elected in 2016 and the Senate is controlled by the Republicans. we would say the same thing. Hold off. Let the voters have a chance. Let me quote from one of our colleagues. In 2016. Senate Republicans refused to consider the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. President Obamas nominee for a Supreme Court vacancy. They would not meet with Judge Garland. hold a hearing on his nomination. or allow a vote for 293 days. Antonin Scalia died in February 2016. President Obama nominated Merrick Garland. a respected D.C. Circuit Judge with bipartisan support. in March 2016. In the case of Justice Ginsburgs vacancy in 2020. we are about 40 days away from a general election. and early and absentee voting has already begun in several states. By contrast. in 2016. the formal presidential primary elections had just begun to occur when Justice Scalia died. Our colleagues spoke up then and said: Look. 4 years ago. our Republican colleagues said not enough time. leave it up to the voters. we would do this whether it is a Democrat or Republican. Let me quote from one of our colleagues. the Republican leader. Mitch McConnell. This is his quote on the floor of the Senate. Mr. President. the next Justice could fundamentally alter the direction of the Supreme Court and have a profound impact on our country. so of course--of course the American people should have a say in the Courts direction. . . . As Chairman Grassley and I declared weeks ago and reiterated personally to President Obama. the Senate will continue to observe the Biden rule so that the American people have a voice in this momentous decision. The American people may well elect a President who decides to nominate Judge Garland for Senate consideration. The next President may also nominate someone very different. Either way. our view is this: Give the people a voice in filling this vacancy. . . . As we continue working on issues like these. the American people are perfectly capable of having their say on this issue. So [lets give] them a voice. Lets let the American people decide. Senator Mitch McConnell. We have the McConnell rule. established by the Republican leader. Lets follow the McConnell rule and let the American people pick the next President and Senate so they can weigh in on this decision just as Senator McConnell argued in 2016 with President Obamas nominee. Merrick Garland. for Justice Scalias seat. Let the Senate honor Justice Ginsburgs legacy by continuing to fight for the rights she fought for in her entire career. both as a litigator and circuit judge and. finally. as a Supreme Court Justice. Let us honor Justice Ginsburgs dying wish: My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new President is installed. I yield the floor."},{"1":"1.162019e+13","2":"2019","3":"H","4":"Ms. LEE","5":"307","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chair.

Donald Trump promised during his inaugural address to fight for the forgotten men and women of our country. but in Donald Trumps Washington. the Senate sits on its hands as the revolving door spins faster and faster. Brian Montgomery is just the latest in a line of bankers. lawyers. investors. and consultants who cashed in on their big-time public service and now want back in. Mr. Montgomery has just been confirmed to be the Commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration. the FHA. which provides taxpayer-backed insurance that helps millions of Americans buy homes they might not otherwise be able to afford. Lenders make loans to these families because the FHA gives them some protection in case the families default. Like any insurance. there are strict rules about who qualifies. Unless it is managed well. the FHA could expose taxpayers to a risk of billions of dollars in losses. Mr. Montgomery knows something about the FHA. He was the Commissioner from 2006 to 2009 while the housing market was flying high and when it all came crashing down. Since almost the day he left. he has been making buckets of money selling his knowledge to banks who broke the rules and are trying to escape the consequences. Here is what I mean. One month after leaving the FHA. Mr. Montgomery founded and became vice chairman of a new company called Collingwood Group which. according to reports. was known in the housing finance industry as a specialist in helping firms navigate FHA-related penalties and lawsuits. Who better to navigate the rules of the FHA than the guy who used to be in charge of the FHA? One of Collingwoods clients was Wells Fargo. They were in trouble for defrauding FHA. and in 2016 paid HUD a $1.2 billion fine. That is billion with a b. Wells Fargo admitted that from 2001 to 2008. it had lied to the FHA about whether certain loans were eligible for FHA insurance. Mr. Montgomery was in charge of the FHA from 2006 to 2008 and let that fraud happen. After he left. he went to the other team. giving Wells Fargo the inside scoop on how to beat the rap. Collingwood also represented U.S. Bank. In 2014. U.S. Bank paid $200 million for defrauding FHA. In its settlement. U.S. Bank admitted that from 2006 through 2011. it repeatedly certified for FHA insurance mortgage loans that did not meet HUD underwriting requirements. The taxpayers paid Mr. Montgomery to manage the FHA for 3 of those years. and he didnt stop the fraud. When he left. U.S. Bank paid him to help them get away with it. I guess it pays to be an inside guy. I have seen some amazing cases of people spinning through the revolving door. but this one might take the cake. First. Montgomery runs an agency that puts taxpayer money on the line. While there. he looks the other way as the banks submit piles of fraudulent mortgages. The government then loses millions and millions of taxpayer dollars. Then. Mr. Montgomery waltzes right out the door and 1 month later starts a company advising the same big banks on how to pay the government back as little as possible for frauds they committed on his watch. Look. he may have the best of intentions. but we can never expect the American people to trust Washington if we approve nominees like Mr. Montgomery. It is bad enough that he put taxpayer money at risk by looking the other way as the banks committed fraud and then bad enough that he got rich working for those same banks. Now the Senate is letting him go back and do it all over again? No way. It is finally time to crack down on the revolving door. Mr. President. 10 years ago. as the economy lurched toward a financial crisis. millions of American families braced for the impact. Over the next few years. almost 9 million families lost their jobs and millions more lost their homes and their savings. Giant banks--pillars of Wall Street for generations--crumbled. bringing communities across this country with it. In the aftermath of the crisis. Congress passed commonsense rules to make sure Wall Street could never again crash the economy and leave American families with the wreckage. but Donald Trump thinks that Dodd- Frank is a disaster. and he has promised to do a big number on the safeguards it created. He hired an army of bankers and bank lawyers from Wall Street to do the deed. and now Jelena McWilliams is the latest piece in the puzzle. Here is just one example. In the runup to the crisis. giant banks proved to be terrible judges of risk and ended up sucking down billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts just to survive. To fix this. Dodd- Frank directed the banking regulators to set strong capital standards that limited how much risk the big banks could load up on and required them to hold enough cushion to survive in case their bets went bad. Policymakers and regulators from both sides of the aisle agree that these financial regulations made our economy safer. Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair and former Vice Chairman Thomas Hoenig--both Republican appointees--recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal that gutting capital rules would weaken system resiliency. Current FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg--a Democrat--said that strong capital requirements were among the most important post-crisis reforms and has opposed joint efforts by the Fed and the Treasury to undermine them. Ms. McWilliams would drop that opposition. In fact. she is not even sure there was anything wrong with the capitalist standards before the crisis. That is not the only rule she would roll back. Donald Trumps Wall Street mercenaries have taken aim at a lot of critical post-crisis rules. and everything we know about Ms. McWilliams suggests she will support those efforts. Here is what is on the agenda. First. there is the Volcker rule. which prohibits bank deposits from gambling with Grandmas checking money. Banks are looking to scrap this rule. even though they are raking in literally record profits. but the FDIC has to agree before there are any changes. As soon as Ms. McWilliams is confirmed. bingo. Sorry. Grandma. Next is guidance that prevents banks from offering abusive. short- term loans similar to payday loan products. The OCC has told the banks it regulates to have at it. With Ms. McWilliams in charge. it is only a matter of time before the FDIC banks get in the game. Third. there is also the Community Reinvestment Act. the CRA. which is designed to make sure a bank serves all credit-worthy customers in its community. regardless of the color of their skin. Lending discrimination is rampant in America. even though 98 percent of banks pass their CRA exams. but banks and the Trump appointees they send to Washington want to make the test for passing even easier. Under Ms. McWilliams. the FDIC evidently will not stand in the way. I could go on and on. but here is the thing. It is not just that I disagree with Ms. McWilliams or think her actions will make consumers and our economy less safe. it is that Senate Republicans are stacking the deck to allow Ms. McWilliams to make these decisions without any discussion. The five-member FDIC Board is supposed to be split between Republicans and Democrats. but the Senate is moving to confirm Ms. McWilliams before the White House has even nominated a Democratic Vice Chair for the agency. If Ms. McWilliams moves forward. the FDIC will be under complete Republican control for an indefinite amount of time. Democrats should oppose the McWilliams nomination on this basis alone. Ms. McWilliams is the latest Trump appointee who thinks the biggest problem with our financial rules is that the government is just too darn hard on the banks. Most Americans dont feel that way. They want tougher rules on Wall Street. not weaker ones. We should listen to them because they are the ones who pay the price when things go wrong on Wall Street. I urge my colleagues to vote no. I yield the floor."},{"1":"1.152017e+13","2":"2017","3":"H","4":"Mr. McCARTHY","5":"129","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. Greg Gianforte is a family man and a businessman.

We call it the 21st Century Cures Act. and it includes three mental health reform acts--the most significant reforms in mental health programs in 10 years. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks the more than 200 organizations from all across the country supporting the 21st Century Cures legislation. Why would the majority leader say it is the most important legislation the Senate might act on--because we do a lot of important stuff around here. whether it is Defense authorization. whether it is cyber security. whether it is the bill to fix No Child Left Behind that we passed in a bipartisan way last December. I think it is because this legislation will affect virtually every American family because we are entering the most exciting period of medical research in our country. That is the first part of it. The second part. which has to do with mental health. affects so many families. We know that about one out of every five adult Americans suffers from some form of mental illness. This concentrates a large amount of money we actually spend on mental health programs every year from the Federal Government and spends it in a more effective way to actually help people. In the next few minutes. I would like to acquaint the Senate again with how we have gone about this and remind Senators of how many of us have had a hand in this legislation. It is a remarkable 2 years of work that has involved many. many. many hearings. dozens of meetings. and that has been done in a large committee of 22 Senators of very different points of view in a largely bipartisan way. I will summarize. The first thing I would mention. the legislation includes $6.3 billion of funding and $1 billion of that is for State opioid grants. Whether it is Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island or Senator Ayotte and Senator Portman. probably most Senators of this body have seen on the front pages of their newspapers the tragedies of opioid abuse. I know that is true in Tennessee. This bill helps in two ways. The most immediate way is to provide State grants--Federal dollars to go to States--over the next 2 years to help States fight opioid abuse. The other way it helps. when we get to the part about 21st Century Cures. is that Dr. Francis Collins. head of the National Institutes of Health--Dr. Collins calls it the National Institutes of Hope--says that one of the groundbreaking discoveries we expect to happen in this country is a non-addictive pain medicine. The problem with opioids is. they are addictive. Now. people need it. If you have a back surgery or if you have terrible pain. opioids can help people. We know that. but it is addictive and it is causing problems. What if we had non- addictive pain medicine? So this bill helps that in two ways. There is other funding in this legislation: $4.8 billion to the National Institutes of Health. The first 1.8 billion of that is for Cancer Moonshot. This is Vice President Bidens initiative. He is motivated for many reasons by it. His son died of cancer. Many of us have family members or friends with cancer. There are startling discoveries going on in cancer today. This is $1.8 billion in support of the Vice Presidents Cancer Moonshot. Then there is $1.4 billion for the Precision Medicine Initiative. This is one of President Obamas most important initiatives. I know he has said that very realistically he expects it to happen anyway. but he would like to move it along. This helps move it along. What this means is that if the Senator from Oklahoma and I each have a disease. that because of our genetic background. the medicine we might get for that disease should be different. If we know that genetic difference between the two of us. the doctor can prescribe for it. That is called personalized medicine or precision medicine. Then there is $1.6 billion for the BRAIN Initiative. This includes groundbreaking research in Alzheimers. for example. I talked to one drug manufacturer that has spent more than $1 billion trying to develop a medicine that will help identify Alzheimers before it shows symptoms and then another medicine that will slow the progression of Alzheimers. Imagine what could happen in our country if. for the tens of millions of Americans who are going to suffer with Alzheimers. we could find that out before they actually have the symptoms and we can then slow down the progression of Alzheimers. Think of the suffering that would help avoid. Think of the billions of dollars it would save. This is for that kind of research. Dr. Collins says that during this next 10 years. he expects that we will be able to identify individuals at high risk for Alzheimers before any symptoms appear and provide them with effective medicines to slow or prevent the disease. It also includes $500 million for the Food and Drug Administration to help pay for the extra work we are giving the FDA. One Senator was on the floor talking about this bill and suggested this isnt enough money. Lets talk about money just a minute. The United States spends more on biomedical research and development than Europe. Japan. and China--almost as much as those three put together. There has nevertheless been a real need for increased funding for the kinds of things I just mentioned. but the way we do things here is. we have authorization bills. which this is. where we decide what our policies and our programs are going to be. Some of us are on those committees--like the committee I chair. and of which Senator Murray of Washington is the ranking Democrat. the Health. Education. Labor. and Pensions Committee in this case. Then we have Appropriations Committees that decide how much we can afford to spend on that. We do that separately. Last year. this Congress. a Republican majority. I would point out-- but Senator Blunt. chairman of the Appropriations Committee for the Senate. would quickly give Senator Murray. the ranking Democrat. full credit--added $2 billion to the National Institutes of Health budget for 1 year. That means $20 billion over 10 years. This year. the same Republican Congress. with the cooperation of the Democratic Members. added another $2 billion to the National Institutes of Health budget. That is another $20 billion over 10 years. The Cures legislation that I have just described is another $5 billion. So that--20. 20. and 5--adds up to 45 billion new dollars approved. The first $20 billion is law. the second $20 billion has just been approved by the Appropriations Committees--hopefully it will become law--and the $5 billion I just described. Now. that is real money. It is unusual to find an appropriations bill stuck on an authorization bill. but we have done it this time because this is an unusual opportunity. and we have done it in a way that Speaker Ryan and the House of Representatives believe is fiscally responsible. That means it doesnt add any new mandatory spending. That kind of spending has the budget going through the roof so it doesnt do that. It means it is paid for. That means we have reduced other spending to pay for it. When we look at the entire budget. it doesnt add a penny to the entire budget--we call it the discretionary plus the mandatory part--because it is paid for by reducing other spending. We have set priorities. we have done our job. and the Appropriations Committee has done its job in consecutive years. approving $20 billion more over 10 years for the National Institutes of Health and will add another 5 here just to the National Institutes of Health. Lets talk about the bipartisan nature of this bill. I am going to go through this fairly quickly. but for those watching. I think it is important to see this because sometimes when bills are popular--and I think this one will be popular. Everyone says: Well. that is easy. Tomorrow. the House of Representatives will vote on the 21st Century Cures bill. It includes the mental health bill--that I will describe in just a minute. I think it will be on suspension. which means they expect a big vote over there. I expect a big vote over here because I dont expect many Senators would want to vote no on a $1 billion grant program that will fight opioid abuse in their home State. I dont think there will be a lot of Senators who want to vote no on more money to fight cancer and to help the Vice President with the Cancer Moonshot. I suspect there will be a lot of Senators who want to vote yes to help the President advance his precision medicine legacy. I know there are families affected by Alzheimers all over the country who hope Senators vote yes on the BRAIN Initiative. I imagine we will get a big vote when it comes up next Monday and Tuesday. after the House passes it tomorrow. but as we put this bill together. there was plenty of controversy. there was plenty of conflict. but virtually everything we did was bipartisan. The money I just described is certainly bipartisan--the Presidents initiative. the Vice Presidents initiative. the opioid initiative. That is bipartisan. but look at the bills we are talking about. Here is one called the Advanced Targeted Therapies. which allows researchers to use their own data from previously approved therapies to help find a faster treatment for serious genetic diseases--Senator Bennet. Democrat. Senator Warren. Democrat. Senator Burr. Republican. Senator Hatch. Republican--and it passed by voice vote. I am very quickly going to go through 19 different bills that are the core of the 21st Century Cures legislation. They came out of our committee which has 22 Members. and the largest number of recorded votes against any one of those 19 bills was two because every single one of these bills had a Democratic sponsor and a Republican sponsor. except for one. and that was Senator Murrays bill. and she is the ranking Democrat on our committee. So dont let anyone suggest that a bill that has $6.3 billion of appropriations. that include Democratic priorities and bipartisan priorities. and the core of it is 19 bills of FDA and NIH reform that has a Democratic sponsor for every single bill and that was approved by a 22-member committee and only had two recorded votes against it--was the most that was against it--dont let anybody say this is not a bipartisan bill. Anyone who says that simply hasnt spent the time to be involved in the process. Lets go to the next one. Burr and Franken. Republican and Democrat. FDA Device Accountability. It will bring innovative devices like artificial knees and insulin pumps to patients more quickly by getting rid of unnecessary regulations. One of the major things we need to do--and we do it in this bill--is to bring cures and discoveries through the regulatory process more quickly and at less cost. All of us are concerned about the price of drugs. One factor contributing to that cost is that it takes a billion dollars and 13 or 15 years to take a new discovery through the process. We would like to shorten that process as long as we can do it in a way that ensures that it is safe. The next one is called the Next Generation Researchers Act--Senator Baldwin. Democrat. Senator Collins. Republican. It improves opportunities for our young researchers. It was passed by voice vote. That means there was no objection. The next one is called the Enhancing Rehabilitation Research at the National Institutes of Health--Kirk. Republican. Bennet. Democrat. Hatch. Republican. Murkowski. Republican. Republicans Isakson and Collins. Enhancing Rehabilitation Research was passed by voice vote. Neurological Diseases Research. Here we have Isakson and Murphy. Republican and Democrat. advancing Research for Neurological Diseases. The next one has do with superbugs and protecting patients. You know about these. You get an infection. and you take a medicine to treat it. but the medicine doesnt work because the infection is a superbug. This bill will clarify that the FDA requires cleaning and validation data for reusable medical devices. In other words. this will make it less likely that will be a problem. That is Senator Murrays bill. Improving Health IT. This is about electronic health records. The government has spent a huge amount of money on that. over $32 billion. including hospitals and doctors to adopt electronic medical records. It is very important to precision medicine. to personalized medicine. because if you cant use all this data. a doctor is not going to prescribe something for the Senator from Oklahoma that is different from something for the Senator from Tennessee. We found that the electronic medical records system was a mess. We had six hearings on it. and we worked with the Obama administration because they could do some things to fix it and we could do some things to fix it. I thank Secretary Burwell in the Obama administration--I thank her and Andy Slavitt at CMS for the efforts they have made to do what they could do. And these are the things that we could do. Senator Murray was involved. Senator Cassidy. Senator Whitehouse. Senator Hatch. Senator Bennet. It was a bipartisan effort to reduce physician documentation burden--electronic health records to make it more interoperable and to get this system moving again. Advancing Breakthrough Medical Devices. One of the great successes we have had in legislation was a few years ago when Senator Bennet and Senator Burr. among others. introduced a bill and made it law that brought breakthrough medicines through the Food and Drug Administration more rapidly. More than 49 have been approved and 464 requests for breakthrough designation in about 4 or 5 years. We are applying that same breakthrough strategy to medical devices. Of course. we have bipartisan support for that. The Advancing Hope Act. If you are a parent of a child with a rare disease. such as brain cancer. this increases the opportunity that the drugs will help. Medical Electronic Data Technology. We had Senator Bennet. Democrat. Senator Hatch. Republican. Medical Countermeasure Innovation Act. This is very important. Senators Burr and Casey have been real leaders in dealing with medical countermeasures. These are in case there is a bioterror attack. anthrax--some kind of man-made or naturally-occurring problem like that. Are we ready to deal with that? This helps to do that. There are just a few more. Some will say: Why are you going on for so long? Because I would like for people to know when it happens that this Senate is capable of taking a great big. complex subject. and Democrats and Republicans are capable of working together to produce a result that deserves a big vote. The Combination Products Innovation Act. This helps to bring to the market a products that are made up of medical devices and medicines. There is a bill by Wicker. Bennet. Collins. Klobuchar. Isakson. and Franken on Patient Focused Impact Assessment. There is one to modernize the FDA workforce. Dr. Califf told us that his biggest problem at the FDA is that he cant hire all the people he needs to deal with all of the exciting things going on. This gives him new authority to do that. Everybody thinks that would be an important thing to do. It was approved by voice vote. Advancing Precision Medicine. This is legislation that I introduced and supported the Presidents Precision Medicine Initiative. which I have talked about before. There is other legislation that went through. The point of all of this is that 19 different bills are the core of this 21st Century Cures Act. The most recorded number of votes against this bill was two. and every single one was sponsored by a Democrat as well as a Republican. except for one. which was Senator Murrays bill. She is the ranking Democrat on the committee. In conclusion. we are fortunate to be able to add to the bill the Mental Health Reform Act. Actually. we include three mental health bills. and together they make up the most significant reform of mental health programs that we have had in more than a decade. I want to give particular credit to Senator Murphy. Democrat. and to Senator Cassidy. Republican. for working together through some real landmines to get this to a place where it can pass the House almost unanimously and where it will be a part of the bill that we will vote on next week. I want to thank the majority whip. Senator Cornyn. who also added an important judicial part to this legislation and helped us navigate some difficult issues. In other words. these Senators showed that they know how to legislate. They could have stood up and made a speech. They could have insisted on doing things exactly their way. but they said to look for the area where we might agree on 80 percent of the policy and lets agree that. This is one of those bills. Look at the number of Republicans and Democrats who have passed that. Here is the second mental health bill we are talking about. You can see the number of Senators. I have taken some time to go through the legislation that will be coming to the Senate early next week and that will be voted on tomorrow in the House of Representatives. I do think it likely represents. as the majority leader has suggested. the most important piece of legislation that we could act on this year. Because it affects virtually every American family. Forbes magazine reported that 78 percent of the American people favored Congress taking action on medical innovation because they have heard people like Dr. Francis Collins. the head of the National Institutes of Health. talk about within the next 10 years having a Zika vaccine and HIV/AIDS vaccine. identifying Alzheimers before symptoms appear and slow its progression. an artificial pancreas for those with diabetes. and a non-addictive type of pain medicine. These are magnificent opportunities for us. We have strong leadership at the National Institutes of Health. We have put our money where our mouth is. It is true that we will have to approve it every year. and it is true that we had to reduce other spending in order to have this spending. but that is the way we are supposed to do things. What we have done is take a bipartisan core of bills. we worked hard for two years in a bipartisan way and produced a result that had very few no votes along the way. It includes Democratic priorities as well as Republican priorities. It has the avid interest of the Democratic President of the United States. the Democratic Vice President of the United States. It is a part of the agenda forward in health care for the Republican Speaker of the House. and the Republican majority leader in the Senate says it is the most important bill we are going to act on. I would think that would get a big vote tomorrow in the House. and I would think it deserves a big vote in the U.S. Senate next week. It has been my privilege to work with Senator Murray and the other members of the Committee on Health. Education. and Labor to produce the bill. I yield the floor.

Members of this Chamber and the House have been reviewing the text of both pieces of legislation. and I am happy to report that the House of Representatives has now given a resounding bipartisan vote on the tax relief bill. with 318 Members of the House of Representatives voting to support it. The House. we are told. will move on the Omnibus appropriations bill tomorrow morning. and then we will take up both bills tomorrow morning in the Senate. I want to just remember and recall for anybody listening that the appropriations process did not have to end up this way. As a matter of fact. after having passed the first budget that Congress has had since 2009. that then authorized the Appropriations Committee to begin the process of considering and passing 12 separate appropriations bills. Once they are voted out of committee. we will bring them to the floor. where they are open for amendment and debate in a completely transparent process. where people can understand the details of the legislation. It didnt turn out that way because our Democratic colleagues filibustered these individual appropriations bills. thereby leaving us with no alternative but to consider this massive Omnibus appropriations bill. I am tempted to call this omnibus bill an ominous bill. but I am not sure that is pejorative enough. It is not the right way to do business. I am disappointed. I am disappointed in our colleagues across the aisle who forced us to do business this way with them. but I hope next year we can have a regular and open appropriations process. one that will serve the American people far better. I am by no means happy with the way this year-end funding bill has come together. after having been hijacked. held up. and effectively shut down. but if this sounds familiar. this looks a lot like the strategy they employed when they were in the majority preceding the election of just a year ago. Do you know what happened? Well. it didnt work very well because they ended up losing their majority. Needless to say. the American people actually want us to do our jobs. to look out for their interests. and to make sure we pass legislation that is thoroughly considered. transparent. and then we could be held accountable for the votes we have made. Unfortunately. this omnibus appropriation process undercuts those principles. and as I said a moment ago. it is not a good way--it is a terrible way--to have to do business. But I am happy and proud of the fact that in virtually every other area we have undertaken--following the budget. the multiyear highway bill. the trade promotion authority legislation. the Defense authorization bill that was led by our colleague from Arizona. the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act that passed 99 to 0--as I was talking about with the Senator from Tennessee. it is clear we know how to work together on a bipartisan basis. disagreeing on some issues but finding common ground where we can. and the American people end up being the winner. Dysfunction and shutdowns do not work. That is not why most of us came here. Most of us came here to try to make this institution and the country and conditions for our constituents a little bit better. one step at a time. In this Omnibus appropriations bill there is an issue I want to highlight. and that is a clear win for progrowth and one that will foster. not hinder. job creation. and that is lifting the decades old ban on exporting crude oil produced here in America. This month actually marks 40 years since the United States implemented a ban on the export of crude oil. a policy that was put into place as a precaution to protect the United States from disruption in the global oil supply. But as we all know. the world looks a lot different than it did back then. The shale revolution has helped the geopolitical energy landscape turn in favor of the United States. and we have an abundance of oil and natural gas available. not only for our use here domestically but to export to our friends and allies around the world. By doing away with this antiquated policy and allowing our domestic production to reach global markets. we can kick start the U.S. economy and provide a real opportunity for job creation in the country. Lifting the ban would not just be beneficial to people working in the domestic energy sector because the domestic energy production involves many different sectors--construction. shipping. technology. By allowing more export of our crude. we have the potential to create thousands of more jobs deep into the supply chain in a variety of sectors and across a multitude of States. In fact. one study estimated that for every new production job in the oil field it translates into three additional jobs in the supply chain and another six in the broader economy. So we are talking about a major opportunity for job creation throughout our country. Doing away with this outdated protectionist policy also gives the United States an opportunity to promote stronger relationships with our allies and partners around the world. Today many of our allies in Europe. including some of our NATO allies. rely on countries such as Iran and Russia for their energy needs. Our allies dependence on our adversaries for basic needs such as heating. electricity. and fuel creates a real vulnerability that exists for the United States. as their ally and partner. By lifting the ban. the United States can help offer our friends a chance to diversify their energy supplies and enhance their energy security and avoid giving people such as Vladimir Putin the opportunity to use oil and gas and energy as a weapon. Lifting the crude oil export ban will strengthen our economy. It will actually save Americans on their gasoline prices at the pump by increasing supply. and it will help our friends and allies around the world. So it is a big win for the American people. whether or not you work directly in the industry. Finally. I would say--and I know the Senator from Arizona is waiting to speak. so I will be brief--that I am happy to see that the omnibus also includes several bipartisan priority items that will benefit my constituents in Texas. For example. for years I have worked alongside of Congressman Filemon Vela. a Democrat from South Texas. to put pressure on Mexico to fulfill its commitment to deliver water to South Texas as outlined and required in a 1944 treaty. Now this is incredibly important for a wide swath of folks whose access to water is not always assured. This bill includes language that reinforces that commitment and includes a measure that requires the State Department to assess the impact of Mexicos water debt on Texas and the rest of the United States. This bill also renews an innovative port of entry partnership program modeled after the Cross-Border Trade Enhancement Act. This. too. is bipartisan legislation in this case. which I have introduced along with Congressman Henry Cuellar. another South Texas Democrat. earlier this year. Specifically. it provides new opportunities for border communities and businesses to improve staffing levels and upgrade infrastructure at our international border crossings to help move people and goods across our border more safely and efficiently. Obviously. with 6 million jobs in the United States dependent on cross- border commercial traffic and trade between the United States and Mexico. this is really important. This omnibus legislation also includes a provision to fully repeal the country-of-origin labeling regulations known as COOL. This has been a real problem for our livestock producers in Texas and in the United States. By repealing these costly food labeling mandates. the United States will avoid a trade war with Canada and Mexico. two of our largest export and trading partners. and will help Texas farmers. ranchers. and manufacturers back home in my State and across the country. In terms of national priorities. the omnibus bill increases resources for our military. thanks to the leadership of people such as the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. This bill will increase resources for our Active-Duty military to make sure that those deployed around the world. as well as those serving stateside. have what they need to get the jobs done that they volunteered to do. This legislation also blocks overreach by the Environmental Protection Agency by providing no new or expanded funding for its programs--the lowest level of funding since 2008. Finally. this bill prioritizes our veterans and helps ensure they are better able to receive the care and benefits they deserve in a timely manner. This legislation also includes the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act. which includes the permanent extension of State and local sales tax deductions. something that amounts to more than $1 billion in annual tax relief for Texans. This will ensure that Texans are on a level playing field with those who deduct their State income tax. because we dont have an income tax and never will. That is something that I can say that Texas will never have. As I said. it never will. This also rolls back several of President Obamas ObamaCare taxes and can provide relief to folks all over the country being crushed by the Presidents failed. unpopular health care law. So while no legislation is perfect. and indeed this process is the antithesis of perfect--it is the wrong way to do business--this is the hand we have been dealt by the filibusters of the appropriations bills by our Democratic colleagues. So we are doing the best we can with the hand that we have been dealt. In the end. nothing passes Congress and gets signed into law by the President without some level of bipartisan cooperation in both Chambers of Congress and working together with the executive branch. This legislation does include several significant wins for the American people.

Of that. 98 percent can be found in our oceans. which makes it unusable for drinking due to the salt content. Only about 2 percent of the worlds water is fresh and. once polar ice caps and glaciers are subtracted. it is a very small percentage that is available for human consumption. Here in the United States we are blessed with. and rely on. an abundance of available clean drinking water. However. even here. mechanical failures. natural disasters. and remoteness of location. can diminish the availability of this vital resource. I rise today to recognize HydroPhoton. located in Blue Hill. ME. a company that has identified this problem and works diligently to supply innovative. accessible solutions. By harnessing and shrinking the ultraviolet UVtechnology used by many municipal water treatment plants. HydroPhoton founder Miles Maiden created the SteriPEN which offers the same safe. efficient water purification used by the treatment plants in a portable. personal device. The SteriPEN. originally patented in 1999. was the first portable UV water purifier on the market. The product kills viruses. bacteria. and protozoa by emitting UV light that is absorbed by the microbes. preventing their reproduction. With this compact purifier. users are able to have safe drinking water anywhere. A company conscious of the need to preserve and protect our natural beauty and resources seems right at home in my home State where we are blessed with serene mountains and foothills. dense untouched wilderness. and a shoreline both beautiful and bountiful. HydroPhoton is dedicated to the preservation and enjoyment of our natural splendors and with the clean water supplied by their SteriPEN. they are making it easier and safer for all to enjoy the great outdoors not only in Maine but around the world. Not only useful to the active outdoorsmen. the SteriPEN finds use in a vast array of situations and locations. One example is the recent hurricane Sandy that had devastating affects along the northeastern coast. HydroPhoton recognized the necessity of clean water in such dire situations and selflessly stepped up to help. donating SteriPENs to those affected by the storm in New York and New Jersey. For their inventiveness. dedication. and compassion for supplying an element so basic to human life. HydroPhoton is truly a remarkable company. I am proud to extend my congratulations on their success and offer my best wishes for the future.*"},{"1":"1.120080e+09","2":"2011","3":"H","4":"Ms. KAPTUR","5":"257","6":"Yes","7":"Yes","8":"I thank my dear friend and colleague Congressman DICKS.

This bill demonstrates the Appropriations Committee is still one of the few that properly functions in this institution. and I cant thank enough Chairman HAL ROGERS and Ranking Member NORM DICKS for their bipartisan leadership and hard work. along with their staff. to bring this House to regular order. This legislation includes vital funding for the defense of our Nation and our domestic imperative. The bill includes support for our Great Lakes ports. as in Cleveland. Lorain.

It also includes environmental restoration funding needed for the Great Lakes to allow economic revitalization as we create more maritime jobs and nature tourism.

I went through that for the financial news from the crash of the stock market in 1929 October on up until the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Now. people who were lined up for jobs. who were in soup lines. the advertisings and the stories told me things. By the time I got to December 7. 1941 and I had prepared to write this paper in support of FDR. I sat back and looked at the ceiling. I can still remember all of those wooden rods with the papers hanging on them. and I said. Huh. You know. FDR did something. He established the principle that the Federal Government had a responsibility for the standard of living of its citizens. That crossed the line from free enterprise and free market. and it raced us down this path toward a socialized economy. The lesson I saw was dont do that because it broadened and. perhaps. deepened the trough that the Great Depression was in. Barack Obama sees that as the salvation to a calamity. and now hes delivering to us the new New Deal. The old deal was a bad deal. The new New Deal is a far worse deal. and that comes from simple economics. from starting and operating a business for 28 years. from watching people. from reading history. and from wondering where in the world they got a lesson that would support the proposal thats out here in front of this Congressin the House and in the Senate.

What he does is of the $3.5 billion that was reserved for infrastructure in the $35 billion. he is doubling that amount to $7 billion of the $35 billion for infrastructure. I think that is a wise thing to do because I frankly think the infrastructure projects are the most stimulative. We know for every $1 billion spent on highways and bridges. 45.000 jobs are created. and those are jobs in America.

I rise in strong support of H. Res. 855. which would amend H.R. 797. the Dr. James Allen Veterans Vision Equity Act. as amended by the other body. I would like to thank my colleagues. Chairman FILNER. Ranking Member BUYER. Mr. BOOZMAN of Arkansas and Ms. BALDWIN of Wisconsin. for their efforts on this bill. On March 21 of this year. this body passed H.R. 797 with a unanimous vote of 4240. and I am pleased to support it. The first title of this resolution would allow veterans who receive veterans disability compensation for impairment of vision in one eye to be eligible to receive additional disability compensation for impairment of vision in the eye that is not service connected. This eligibility includes situations where the impairment in each eye is to a visual acuity of 20/200 or less. or of a peripheral field loss of 20 degrees or less. This is the same definition of legal blindness adopted by all 50 States and the Social Security Administration. Title II of H.R. 797 incorporates several sections of H.R. 2696. the Veterans Dignified Burial Assistance Act of 2007. which I introduced in June to improve VA burial benefits and State veterans cemeteries. From time to time. Mr. Speaker. a State locates the remains of veterans who were not interred at the time of their death for various reasons. When States inter these veterans. they cannot be reimbursed by VA because of the time limit on reimbursement costs. This legislation would repeal this limitation and helps ensure that all veterans will receive a proper interment with the honor and respect that they have earned. Title II would also authorize the Secretary of the VA to make additional grants to States for improving and expanding State veteran cemeteries. States would be required to submit an application to the Secretary for this funding. of which the aggregate amount authorized for all State grants is $5 million. The final provision of title II would provide families with the option of placing a medallion on a deceased veterans grave denoting veteran status. in lieu of a VA headstone for graves already marked by a private marker. Mr. Speaker. many private cemeteries do not allow a second marker on a grave site because it complicates routine maintenance. Therefore. a medallion would identify a veterans grave in a manner that would be universally acceptable and would meet the familys desire to honor the deceased veteran and will be one more reminder to everybody of the sacrifices made by veterans. This provision is very similar to an amendment that I offered at the full committee markup of H.R. 797. and Im very pleased to support it again now. While not the specific intent of the provision. veterans families may benefit financially from this measure. Currently. VA offers second markers for veterans graves that already have a privately procured marker. While there is no cost for the markers. mounting of these second markers is at the familys expense. usually several times the cost of the stone itself. Since the new medallion could be applied directly to the current marker with an industrialgrade adhesive. families will be able to apply the medallion on their own. allowing them to avoid significant mounting costs. Mr. Speaker. title III of the resolution extends the use of the New Hires Act and would save the government money by allowing the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding unemployment compensation data in order to determine eligibility for VA needsbased pension benefits. The Congressional Budget Office informally estimates that this section of the resolution would save the taxpayers $30 million over 10 years. I would note that this savings funds the vision. burial and work study provisions in this bill. Also included in title III is a provision that extends work study jobs at VA through June 2009. Current law allows work study recipients to perform a variety of duties throughout the VA. as well as veteranrelated paperwork at their schools. Congress extended the provision for 6 months in PL 109461 to prevent canceling benefits in the middle of the school year. Im pleased that were able to extend this provision even further in this bill.

I support this trade initiative. because its good for America and good for the people of Washington State in a number of important ways. First. Australia is an important ally of the U.S. in an increasingly unstable world. Many Australian troops fought sidebyside American soldiers in the Vietnam War. in Afghanistan. and are providing resources to Americans in a part of the world where we increasingly need them. Second. Australia has a long history of importing many American productsfrom agricultural goods grown in Washington. like apples and wheat. to products manufactured in Washington. like electronics and airplanes. We enjoy a sizable trade surplus with Australia and since this agreement commits Australia to immediately remove tariffs on nearly every U.S. export to Australia. it will instantly provide further market access for products that come from the United States. In addition. Australia invests significantly in the United States. directly employing thousands and thousands of American jobs. Third. Australia exports many products that Americans enjoylike fine wines and many agricultural products. Since this agreement requires the U.S. to remove many of our tariffs on Australian goods. they immediately become more affordable to American consumers. Although I support this agreement. I remain deeply concemed about the direction that the Bush Administration is taking this country. particularly with regard to our economy and our trade policy. which profoundly affects the ability of our country to maintain and create good paying jobs. Americas best export has always been the democratic values that we hold dear. While capitalism and open markets may boost trade flows. democratic values must also be a centerpiece of U.S. trade policy. Regretfully. this agreement continues to embody a shortsighted approach toward intemational trade that the Bush Administration has employed for the last 4 years. The USAFTA fails to lock in international labor and environment standards. It only requires the United States and Australia to continue to enforce their own labor and environment laws. This approach. if employed in future trade agreements with less developed countries. would do little to raise living standards in countries whose labor and environmental laws do not meet intemational standards. Furthermore. this approach would force American workers to compete on an uneven playing field. I do not think that is a direction that our country should go. Today. however. the Congress considered liberalizing trade with Australia. a country that has welldeveloped labor and environmental laws. and a good track record for enforcing these laws. so I will not let Perfect be the enemy of Good. Our international assistance and trade programs should aim to raise living conditions here and abroad. Ultimately. I believe that the USAFTA advances these interests."},{"1":"1.080059e+09","2":"2003","3":"H","4":"JACKSON LEE","5":"451","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in response to the troubling situation of unrest in our ally nation of Liberia. Because of the rich history of its birth in 1820 with the valiant acts of freed American slaves in founding the capital of Christopolis. now Monrovia. we certainly have a stake in the need for restoring peace. Since the end of the sevenyear civil war that claimed the lives of over 250.000 people. more than 1.3 million residents have had to flee the country for refuge in neighboring countries. many of which have already reached the end of their meager resources. The series of events in Liberia presents a harsh irony in light of yesterdays events: we celebrated a Constitutional victory in the Grutter v. Bollinger decision that came out of the highest court in the nation. Similarly ironic. on that same day. we saluted the Honorable Mayor Maynard Jackson. Jr.. one of the most charismatic civic leaders of all time in his departure at age 65. This ironic juxtaposition of emotions reminds us that no matter how far we think weve gotten. there is always distance to be traveled in the work of making peace in the world. The U.N. High Court indictment of Liberian President Charles Taylor on charges of crimes against humanity. largely stemming from his participaion in the civil war in Sierra Leone. has created a panic in Monrovia. A Liberian woman stated that We are all tired of Charles Taylor. but we are afraid that his arrest in Ghana will create chaos. We in the United States now know the feeling of panic as we check the terror threat on a daily basistodays threat level being Yellow. or heightened. People shouldnt have to live in fear. The economic effect of the renewed arms embargo. ban on dealing in rough diamonds. and airline restrictions on Liberia will be substantial for the citizens and business community. However. the human rights abuses such as summary executions. recruitment of child soldiers. sexual violence. looting of civilian property. and forced labor must end now. The mass evacuation aboard the French vessel Orage of the hundreds of foreigners. including Americans. holding dual U.S. and Liberian citizenship. Europeans. Lebanese. Ivorian and Indian nationals. Egyptians. and some Africans represents a departure from our goal of uniting our international community in peace. It is a moral imperative that we end the chaos caused by anarchy and criminal behavior. The Ceasefire Agreement between the Republic of Liberia. the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LUR) groups. and the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL) is a start. but our help is imperative. We must make our voices heard and incite action from our colleagues in order to restore peace."},{"1":"1.070168e+09","2":"2002","3":"H","4":"McCARTHY","5":"568","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Madam Speaker. as we begin National Fire Prevention Week. I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 476. a resolution paying tribute to firefighters who have died in the line of duty. and recognizing the importance of the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation which assists families of firefighters killed on the job. On September 11. 2001. the country watched brave firefighters from New York and around the country risk their lives to save others. Firefighters have a special dedication to their jobs. community and fellow man. They willingly put their lives at risk to save the life of someone unknown to them. To do this. they train hard physically. mentally and emotionallythey are the consummate professionals. They are fearless men and women. who face death with each call. In fact. approximately 100 firefighters die each year battling what they refer to as the dragon. As the name implies. the dragon is a firefighters vernacular for a fire. The dragon does not discriminate when it comes to who or what it destroys. man. woman. child or firefighter. Dutyrelated incidents include structural fires. wild land fires. vehicle fires. hazardous material fires. rescues and responding to the scene of an emergency. From 19812001. New York lists the highest number of firefighters in the country who were lost in the line of duty. New York is at the very top of an extremely unfortunate list. Last year alone there were 347 dedicated firefighters who died in the World Trade Center disaster. Overall. the dragon kills about 4.500 people per year. more than all natural disasters combined. Another 27.000 people are injured. not to mention the emotional and financial injuries incurred by the families of fallen firefighters. The families of firefighters live a life of uncertainty as to whether their loved one will come home each day after work. When a family receives the dreaded news that their loved one will not be returning home chaos sets in. and these survivors desperately need support. As part of an effort to remember Americas fallen firefighters and to provide assistance to their survivors. Congress created the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation (NFFF) in 1992. The foundation is a nonprofit organization located in Maryland which receives funding from private donations from individuals. organizations. corporations and foundations. as well as federal grant money. NFFF provides resources to families of fallen firefighters. such as a grieving network. special scholarships. and important information to families regarding federal. state. and local benefits. These benefits include lump sum death payments. workers compensation. funeral benefits. pensions and retirement programs and private support. NFFF also provides services such as regional training sessions to help fire departments handle a line of duty death. and an Annual National Tribute which honors survivors of firefighters who died in the previous year. This years ceremony is scheduled for October 5 and 6. and will honor 445 firefighters. including those killed at the World Trade Center. Last September. the entire world watched with bated breath as firefighters unselfishly and effectively did their jobs. These acts of honor and bravery were in sharp contrast to the cowardly acts of violence perpetrated on America. Our lives depend on firefighters and we are beholden to them for so very much. I support this Resolution which reminds us all of what a difficult job firefighters have. and the sacrifices their families make. I am proud to honor the lives lost. the thousands of firefighters who continue to work tirelessly and bravely. as well as their families."},{"1":"1.070089e+09","2":"2001","3":"H","4":"SHERMAN","5":"170","6":"Yes","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. over the last decades. we have moved from the largest creditor Nation to the largest debtor Nation in the world. We now run a trade deficit of nearly half a trillion dollars every year. The dollar is on the road to crashing sometime in the next decade or so. and this bill makes it all more certain and makes it happen faster. It provides access to the American markets to those with the very lowest labor standards and the lowest environmental standards. It will pressure us to see our trade deficit even get larger. or to cut our own environmental standards. labor standards and wage rates in order to compete. It deprives us of the opportunity to demand trade bills that are fair and to involve Congress in making sure that the trade bills do not simply increase trade. but increase exports more than imports. The nonlegal barriers imposed. particularly by China. but other countries as well. will ensure large trade deficits if we pass Fast Track now."},{"1":"1.060171e+09","2":"2000","3":"S","4":"KENNEDY","5":"1350","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. pay discrimination against women continues to be a serious problem in our society. The wage gap now costs Americas families $200 billion a year. Nearly twothirds of working women report that they provide half or more of their familys income. and nearly one in five U.S. families is headed by a single woman. Yet single mothers continue to earn the lowest average rate of pay. Although the Equal Pay Act was signed into law 37 years ago. the wage gap today continues to plague American families. and wage discrimination continues to be a serious and pervasive problem in workplaces across the country. In spite of the Equal Pay Act. women still earn only 73 cents for every dollar earned by men. And the pay disparities between white men and women of color are even more disturbing. African American women earn just 63 cents. and Latinas earn only 53 cents for every dollar earned by white men. And men of color suffer from pay inequality as well. These disparities translate into large costs in lost wages and lost opportunity. The average working woman loses $4.200 in income annually. and suffers a loss of $420.000 over her career. In Massachusetts. women earn an average of $512 weekly. compared to $640 earned by men for the same period of time. This gender gap has a longterm impact. since lower wages and lower lifetime earnings lead to lower pension benefits in retirement. The median pension benefit received by new female retirees is less than half that of benefits received by men. Women are entitled to the same paychecks as male colleagues who perform the same or comparable work. Without this guarantee. women are less able to provide an economic safety net for themselves and their families. If married women were paid the same wages as men in comparable positions. their family incomes would rise by nearly 6 percent. and their families poverty rates would fall. If single women earned as much as men in comparable positions. their incomes would rise by 13 percent. and their poverty rates would be reduced as well. These figures demonstrate the severe effect of pay disparities on the lives of women and their families. Equal pay helps men as well as women. One of the major causes of pay inequity is sex segregation in the workplace. Jobs traditionally held by men. such as jobs which involve heavy lifting or truck driving. are compensated more highly than jobs traditionally held by women. which often involve caretaking or nurturing activities. Both men and women in jobs predominantly held by womensuch as sales. service. nursing. child care. teaching and clerical positionssuffer the effects of pay bias. As the percentage of women within an occupation increases. the wages for that job decrease. Women and men alike will receive significant gains in earnings if they are paid the same wages as comparable workers in jobs that are not predominantly female. Men and women who work in predominantly female occupations earn less than comparable workers in other occupations. Women would gain $89 billion a year. and men would gain $25 billion from pay equity increases in femaledominated jobs. The 4 million men who work in predominately female occupations lose. on average. over $6200 each year. The increase in payroll costs that would result from these wage adjustments would be only 3.7 percent of total hourly payroll costs throughout the economy. Some argue that these differences in pay are based on different levels of education. years in the workforce and similar factors. But. these factors alone do not explain away the wage gap. Studies have found substantial pay differences between men and women working in the same narrowly defined occupations and establishments. Studies of discrimination in hiring offer additional evidence on the gender pay gap. Educational advancement hasnt solved this problem. Although women have now surpassed men in the percentage of those earning a college or advanced degree. collegeeducated women earn almost $14.000 less than college educated men. A black woman with a masters degree earns almost $10.000 less annually than a collegeeducated white male. A collegeeducated Hispanic female makes only $727 more than a white male with a high school degree. These disparities in compensation for men and women can be explained by one factorblatant discrimination. Consider the story of Sarah Foulger. who served as pastor of a church in Maine for more than 10 years. For the last 5 of those years. she asked for a pay raise. and every year she was told the increase had to be delayed or reduced. Within weeks of her departure. the church was able to significantly increase the salary of the male pastor hired to replace her. After 17 years of her ministry. she earned less than $7.000 in pension credits. The third of her salary that was missingmultiplied by just 4 years of being underpaid -would have added up to enough money to pay for a State college education for one of her children. Gender and racebased wage discrimination is also present on Capitol Hill. and it is glaring and embarrassing for all of us. Women custodial workers in the House and Senate Office Buildings have been underpaid for years. and have finally brought suit against the Architect of the Capitol. Even though the women custodians perform essentially the same work under the same job conditions as male workers. they are paid almost a dollar less an hour. But there are some successes. Nancy Hopkins is a molecular biologist and professor at M.I.T. When she learned that she was making less than her male colleagues. she took the issue to the administration. M.I.Ts top officials responded by issuing a report acknowledging that its female professors suffered from pervasive. if unintentional. discrimination. The report documented discrimination in hiring. awards. promotions. membership on important committees. and allocation of important resources such as laboratory space and research funding. Eastman Kodak Company provides another significant example. After an internal study of its compensation practices. Kodak voluntarily agreed to pay $13 million in back pay to 2.000 female and minority employees who had been underpaid because of their race or gender. Kodak continues to work to improve the number of women and minorities in midlevel and seniorlevel management positions. The plight of these women who work hard and are denied fair compensation is unacceptable. The disparities are particularly alarming because they persist almost 40 years after the Equal Pay Act was enacted. and at a time when our nation is experiencing unprecedented prosperity. when women are entering the workforce in record numbers. and when women are spending less time at home with their children. and more time at work. Businesses and other private institutions across the country also have a responsibility to do more to correct this injustice. I commend M.I.T. for the impressive example it has set by acknowledging that women professors suffer from pervasive pay discrimination and by making a clear commitment to correct it. And I commend Eastman Kodak for its efforts to address the wage gap in response to NAACP concerns. by launching an investigation and providing raises for 12 percent of its female and 33 percent of its black employees. More businesses and organizations need to follow these leads. Congress must do more to solve this unconscionable problem. Our goal is not just to reduce the pay gap. but to eliminate it entirely. Senator DASCHLES Paycheck Fairness Act is a needed step to correct this injustice in pay. It will provide more effective remedies for women denied equal pay for equal work. And Senator HARKINS Fair Pay Act will prohibit wage discrimination based on sex. race. or national origin for employees in equivalent jobs in the same workplace. Congress should pass both the Paycheck Fairness Act and The Fair Pay Act. These bills are necessary steps to eliminate the disparity between the earning power of men and women. Its the right thing to doand the fair thing to dofor working families. At a time when our economy is more prosperous than ever. when unemployment is at a 30 year low. and when women are entering the labor force at an all time high. there is no excuse for discrimination that cheats women out of their fair pay."},{"1":"1.060108e+09","2":"1999","3":"H","4":"SESSIONS","5":"1452","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the gentleman from California yielding. I heard the debate going on. and I came out of my office. Not only are the colleagues who are here. like the gentleman from Arizona and the gentleman from Colorado are here. trying to talk about what is going on. because just a few feet from this House floor. our negotiators are busy trying to hammer out a deal that. once again. is good not just for the American worker and not just for the American family. but for the taxpayer. It is the taxpayer that we. as Republicans. must remember the most. That is what brought me to Washington. D.C.. in 1994 when I ran for Congress. I signed that wonderful document called the Contract With America. And the Contract with America was a document for all Americans and mostly the taxpayers to see that one party was going to stand up and talk about the things that were important for generation after generation. The things that we talked about in the Contract with America essentially boil themselves down to these few points: number one. we were going to balance the budget. We were going to do something that had not been done in Washington since we first placed a man on the Moon in 1969. We were not only going to balance the budget. but we were going to make sure that we took power away from Washington. D.C.. and placed it back at home. placed it back at home where people. like myself. as a nonMember of Congress. a person who got up and went to work every day had a wife. a family. kids lived in a neighborhood. went to church. and worked not only in my neighborhood but all across their communities to make things better. and we decided that we were going to let people at home make decisions. And lastly. we decided that we were going to take the power that resided in Congress and open it up to people. We did away with things like term limits for committee chairmen. We did things like not allowing proxy voting in committees. So we have done so much that has brought not only good government to Washington. D.C.. but also did it for the taxpayer. Now. where have we come? Well. where we have come now since that Contract with America is that we have balanced the budget now three times. We did it first in 1997. then 1998. and then in 1999. But as we Republicans recognize. and I think Democrats know it. too. that we recognize that we. with a straight face. could not say we know we completely balanced the budget. And the reason why is because we were spending Social Security. we were taking the excess money that came in that people gave to Washington. D.C.. for their future and for their future retirement. for the retirement of not only themselves but their families. and we for the first time in 1999. not by accident but certainly not because we did it on purpose. because it was not the law. we stated that we were not going to spend Americas retirement future. And so we did not. And for the first time in 39 years. the Republican Congress did not spend one penny of Social Security. What we are attempting to do tonight is not only to duplicate that but to do it on purpose. because we told the American people we were going to do that. This is what responsibility is all about. Tonight we are dealing with a circumstance where the President of the United States says. oh. I now believe you. I want to be on your side. In January of this year he said 60 percent of Social Security was good enough. if there was a surplus. Sixty percent of Social Security would be set aside. but 40 percent would go to spending. new government programs. new spending. Now he has changed his tune. I say. thank you. Mr. President. Thank you for joining Republicans on doing things that are important to our money. this is our retirement. It does not belong to Washington. D.C. But what is happening in this endeavor? Now the President and Democrats want more and more and more and more spending. Just last week the White House. in the foreign aid bill. demanded $800 million more for foreign aid. $104 million more for Russia. It just goes on and on and on. So we know what we have got to do. We have got to make sure that we keep this line. as it implies on the chart. of going up to where we have a surplus. Because this surplus will not only go to pay down the debt. but it will also go to make sure that we have the opportunity to give money back to people who earned it. I want to show my colleagues one other thing. if I can. This is an example of how much money we owe back to Social Security before we can begin the process of building a surplus there. We have to be able to pay back $638 billion. Now. our President and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will say. look. it really does not matter. You know. $800 million here. $800 million there. it is really not a big deal. The President wants $4.5 billion more. Well. I will say. and I believe that I would gain concurrence from my colleagues who are here tonight. every single dollar counts. The most important part of what we are attempting to get across now is it is not just the dollars. it is the cents. it is the pennies. and it is this cent or common sense that we are talking about. Waste. fraud. and abuse consumes over $200 billion a year. documented by the Government Accounting Office. $200 billion a year. So that is why I think. for the first time ever. the Congress of the United States challenged an administration and said. Mr. President. we are willing to cut our own pay by 1 percent. We are willing to cut our own spending 1 percent. But. Mr. President. we want and expect you. too. to do the responsible thing. and that is to find one penny from discretionary spending. We are not talking about Social Security. we are not talking about Medicare. we are not talking about Medicaid. What we are talking about is one penny out of every dollar that you would have control over to where you would say. we are going to look internally to ourselves. we are going to look internally to the Government that is fraught with waste. fraud. and abuse. we are going to consider it a challenge. a challenge for employees of the Government and a challenge for those people who are administrators. who may be secretaries. who may be Cabinet officials. to look deep within themselves and to challenge each and every one of their employees. The same thing that happened when I was in the private sector just a few years ago. I spent 16 years for a corporation in this country. never missed a day of work. and I was challenged as an employee of that company virtually every single year not only to find what we knew was abuse and waste but what we knew would be a challenge to run our company the way we as employees thought it should be run. That is where this government is missing out. That is what this President is missing out. an opportunity and a challenge to every single government worker for maybe the first time in their career. Can you imagine an employee that may have been with the Government for 40 years. their entire career. never once challenged and then the first time a challenge from the Congress of the United States come forward where Members of Congress were willing to take their own pay cut and the chief executive of that country said. no. we cannot live up to that challenge because there is not enough money? Well. I will submit tonight that the retirement security of every single American. of every single generation is far more important than the $800 million that we added in. and it is far more important than all the shenanigans that go on in Washington. D.C. That is why we are here tonight. We are here to make sure that no means no. Mr. President. you cannot have our retirement. One hundred percent is far greater than 60 percent. and it belongs to people back home. It does not belong to you. Mr. President. It belongs to the people who produced it.

I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. last month we marked the 40th anniversary of the beginning of the space age by recalling that day in 1957 when the Soviet Union orbited Sputnik. the worlds first manmade satellite. We have accomplished a great deal in the last 40 years. largely through Federal spending. Because of that history. which is a history of the Federal Governments success in the space endeavor. we sometimes think that only the Government is capable of accomplishing missions in space. As a result. Federal laws and policies are designed around space activities run by the Government for the Government. However. according to a recent study by the investment firm Spacevest and an accounting firm. that is KPMG Peat Marwick. global revenues from commercial space business now exceeds global revenues generated by Government outlays. This is good news. for several reasons. It gives us a broader industrial base to support Federal space missions. lowering costs to taxpayers in the process. Second. it means that the American people are gaining access to a wide range of new spacerelated goods and services. Third. it means that the country is creating hightechnology. highpaying aerospace jobs that are no longer dependent on Government spending for their existence. Finally. and perhaps most importantly. it means that our future in space is not bound by the Governments ability to spend money. The spirit of American enterprise will take us to the stars. One problem that we still face is the fact that Government laws. policies. and regulations have not caught up with the way space is developing In the private sector As a result. sometimes the Government inadvertently hinders commercial space activity. We need to change that so that the American business community can lead the way for the entire planet into space. Fortunately. there has been bipartisan agreement that commercial space is and should be a vital part of Americas space enterprise. Most recently. the Clinton administration has adopted several policies regarding space launch. remote sensing. and spacebased navigation which help promote the national interest in commercial space. We have introduced H.R. 1702 this year to capitalize on those policies and to incorporate some of the lessons we learned about commercial space over the last few years into law. The bill meets an urgent as well as nearterm need to establish a regulatory framework that will allow commercial entities to reenter spacecraft and payloads from space to Earth. Basically. what we are talking about here is allowing companies who are investing in reusable launch vehicles to legally operate this new type of exciting spacecraft that we believe will be the basis of our whole space exploration utilization effort in the years ahead. The bill improves the legal framework for commercial remote sensing by requiring that license applications be examined by Secretaries of Defense and State to ensure their consistency with U.S. national security and international obligations. However. we are also giving the Government hard deadlines to act upon these applications. In business. time is money and it can make the difference between success or failure. The past failures of Federal departments to coordinate implementation of the Land Remote Sensing Policy Act in a timely fashion have made it difficult for U.S. companies to retake the international lead in commercial remote sensing from a multitude of other countries. Finally. the bill we are discussing today requires the Government to purchase commercial space launch services instead of relying on burdensome procurement rules in the purchase of rockets themselves. Mr. Speaker. the Commercial Space Act of 1997 is a culmination of 2 years of extensive bipartisan consultation and cooperation. It would not have been possible to bring this bill to the floor today without the real dedication and commitment by Members of both sides of the aisle and. I might say. on both sides of the aisle in the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics. There are three significant changes in the bill. By working together. we have come up with these changes to meet the request by committee members since our markup. We add today a new section on shuttle privatization. which contains the same language as the Civilian Space Authorization Act the House passed this April. In it we direct NASA to prepare for the potential privatization of the space shuttle system. In the bills amendments to the Commerce Space Launch Act. the language addressing launch not an export has been modified to underscore the intent of the original language in the Commercial Space Launch Act of 1984. The committee intends that payloads launched pursuant to foreign trade zone procedures be considered as exports only for the purpose of customs entry procedures so that such payloads will be in complete compliance with the duty deferral program. The third change. which we made at the request. I might add. of ranking member. the gentleman from California . is to add an exception to the bills mandate that the Federal Government purchase launch services from U.S. commercial providers. We allow for an exception for reasons of foreign policy purposes but with a requirement that Congress pass a law in order to approve the exception. Mr. Speaker. I am proud to say that this bill is also a product of excessive consultation and cooperation with the Clinton administration. This bill moved through the committee. and as it did. it attracted the attention of various bureaucrats. departments. and agencies. During the markup. we have made over three dozen changes at the request of these agencies and will make several more today. In most cases. these changes improve the bill and we are happy and were happy to make them. In particular. the provisions that cause the administration the most concern have been changed. For example. we deleted a requirement that the Defense Department and State Department publish lists of national security concerns and international obligations. We also added a reference to the international policies that exist in current law. The other changes to this section include the promotion of greater access to remote sensing by scientific researchers and educators. making the current regulations for this growing industry consistent with the national security and foreign policy considerations of the United States. streamlining the application procedures for a commercial license so that the needs of the Government are addressed while ensuring that agencies are responsive to the highly competitive environment in the commercial sector. In the sections on space science and Earth science data buys. we modified proposed language to include consideration of the data requirements of scientific researchers and other Federal agencies beyond NASA. Finally. we made a change in the section on acquisition of commercial space transportation services to accommodate the Defense Department. Unfortunately. it has become clear that some Federal departments do not agree with either the Presidents own policy supporting commercial space development or the intent of Congress as expressed in previous laws supporting space enterprise. Those departments have asked us to make changes that have no other purpose than to fight bureaucratic turf battles or to enhance their own selfimportance. We have rejected such changes. Departments and agencies work for the American people. who have made it clear they want goods and services and the jobs of commercial space development is here and has been created here and to have these things done here instead of going overseas because of bureaucratic impediments. These continued efforts by the entrenched Government bureaucrats to enhance their own power and. basically. these things conflict with the American people and our own national interest. and that national interest is that we lead the world in new space enterprise and industry. As this bill moves through the Senate. we need to challenge our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol to be on guard against scare tactics by bureaucrats and by bureaucracies attempting to enhance their own power by changing this bill. We must also challenge the President and Vice President. who have developed very sound policies that this bill supports. But we like them and we want to make sure they stick to their guns. We must challenge the White House to impose order on the interagency process and to reject the special pleas of bureaucratic interest to change the bill in order to enhance certain bureaucrats own authority. If the White House is serious about its public pronouncements on space policy. and I believe the White House is sincere in this. then it needs to bring all Federal agencies into line with the goals of the American people rather than subverting those goals to accommodate different power bureaucrats here in Washington. DC. With the Presidents support and with the discipline to reject the pleas from special interests. especially those within Government. to modify this bill further. we can give the American people sound. bipartisan legislation that will help build a better future and ensure that America remains the No. 1. power in space and especially the No. 1 space commercial power. I would ask all of my colleagues in the House on both sides of the aisle to join us in this effort. Finally. I would like to thank the gentleman from Alabama for the hard work that he has put in. This has truly been a bipartisan effort. and I congratulate him for the hard work he has put in and thank him for that. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time."},{"1":"1.040266e+09","2":"1996","3":"S","4":"HARKIN","5":"512","6":"Yes","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. again. I would just point out under the amendment of my colleague from Iowa. money that would go to pay for the ocean freight differential would still come out of the Agriculture budget. out of food aid. That is what I am basically opposed to. having it come out of Agriculture. It is a 6percent limitation that my colleague has in his amendment. but any higher costs of U.S.-flag ships would still come out of Agriculture. I do not think it ought to. I think the money for the ocean freight differential ought to come out of the Department of Transportation. That is what my amendment does. Again. I hear all of these comparisons of shipping rates. My friend from Colorado. and of course my esteemed colleague from Iowa. have all these comparisons. but these are based on artificially low foreign rates subsidized by foreign governments. or rates for ships that operate without having to comply with the operating standards that apply to U.S.-flag vessels. So these kinds of comparisons may seem appealing. but they do not reflect a fair or accurate representation of the factors involved in the rates charged by U.S. ships. For example. our people are paid higher wages. our ships have to follow stronger and stricter environmental standards and our ships have to meet stricter working conditions and occupational health and safety requirements. None of these considerations is taken into account by the amendment of my colleague from Iowa. I keep pointing out that workers on U.S.-flag ships. U.S. citizens. pay Federal. State and local taxes. In fact. I am informed that existing Federal and State income tax requirements alone nearly double the cost of U.S.-citizen crews to U.S.flag operators. Well. where do they pay those taxes? They pay those taxes here in America. Mr. President. let me also point out that there currently are limitations in place on the rates that U.S.-flag vessels may charge for hauling cargo preference shipments. For nondefense cargoes. for example. by law preference is given to U.S.-flag vessels only when such vessels are available at fair and reasonable rates. which are determined by an OMBapproved method based on detailed cost information submitted by American flagship operators. If U.S.-flag vessels are not available at fair and reasonable rates. they are not awarded the cargo. and foreign vessels may be used. In summary. I again point out that what my amendment seeks to do is to shift any higher costs of using U.S.-flag ships out of Agriculture to the Department of Transportation where it rightly belongs. I do. however. strongly support keeping U.S. jobs here in this country. I strongly support making sure that we support a maritime industry in this country and make sure it is there for us when we need it in periods of national emergency. I ask support for my amendment to shift those costs to DOT.

I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I want to stress that in section 7 there is no authorization for acquisition of this land. This is a study area only. In my statement earlier I talked about one of the key importances of this acreage being its importance for the restoration of the salmon fisheries of northern California and the Pacific Northwest. Nearly 8.400 fulltime jobs in the region depend on this particular resource. $70 million in annual revenue to the State of California from the salmon fisheries. $150 million from the salmon resource for the Pacific Northwest. Mr. Chairman. the coho fishery in and of itself. and this is one of the remaining last areas. this Elk River area. for the spawning of coho salmon. has historically generated $60 million a year in revenues. Mr. Chairman. the drainages which are contained in the 44.000 acres and contained within the study area. Salmon Creek. Elk River. and Yager Creek. contain significant populations of coho salmon. chinook salmon. cutthroat trout. and steelhead. which are of primary importance. not only to the commercial fisheries. but to sport fishery as well. The drainages within this study area and within the 44.000 acres block of the Headwaters Forest contain the spawning grounds for up to 10 percent of the remaining wild salmon population in the State of California. Mr. Chairman. during the hearings on this bill. Dr. Peter Moyle. who is a renowned fisheries biologist from the University of California at Davis. discussed the importance of this acreage. of the 44.000 acres. and of the remaining acreage. as a protector for the future health of the spawning populations of coho salmon. Mr. Chairman. this particular drainage is one of the very few remaining on the west coast which has a genetic pool for coho salmon which has not been contaminated by hatchery fish. There have been no hatcheries built on this river which have in any way compromised the health of this coho population. Again. Mr. Chairman. what this amendment does is it takes out of the bill the possibility of a study of this area for its overall importance for the coho salmon fishery."},{"1":"1.030069e+09","2":"1993","3":"S","4":"MURKOWSKI","5":"615","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Madam President. the hour is late. and I will be brief in my statement. I rise in opposition to the amendment of my good friend from Illinois. There is an effort here to make a certain presumption that somehow the business of dealing in guns is like dealing in drugs or some other inappropriate activity. I happen to come from a western state. In the State of Alaska we have a number of firms that deal in guns. a legitimate businesshardware stores. sporting goods stores. Most of these individuals are conservationists. as a consequence of their commitment toward the renewability of the natural game resources of our State in which we are very rich. What the proposal of my good friend from Illinois results in is simply increasing the cost of business by increasing the licensing fee from its current figure in the area of $10 to approximately $300. So as a consequence. for those dealers. they are simply going to have to eat that additional cost of doing business. But it does not address the concern we all have. and that is what to do about criminals who have guns. what to do about our children who obtain guns either from their parents as a consequence of lack of parental supervision in some cases. a lack of taking the time to train a young person with regard to the reality that a gun is not a toy. or those who obtain guns from other children. steal them. get them from criminals. And of course guns. knifes. automobiles. what have you. all are weapons of destruction in the hands of irresponsible people. I would be inclined to look toward some type of activity which would address this cancer on our country relative to the reality that we find. indeed. guns are used more often than perhaps any other weapon in crimes. But to simply increase the taxation on our gun dealers does not achieve that. This simply generates an increase in fees. And to extend the time of the debate under the guise that somehow we are going to address the problem of criminal activity in the State. that those who have and use guns in criminal acts are going to be somehow reduced by increasing the penalty for selling guns I think bears no reflection on reality. I would be happy to debate the merits of that statement further. because I think we have to recognize that while there are some unscrupulous dealers in firearms. most are legitimate business persons and take pride in their business activity and the manner in which they serve the public and their customers. I recognize that may be distasteful in the minds of some. but we have such gun dealers in this country. That somehow this is less than a responsible business is simply not the case. I think all my colleagues would reflect on the reality that. indeed. the vast majority. 99 and 99/100ths percent of these people are legitimate. But like in all groups we have the exceptions. So in conclusion. I would say to my good friend from Illinois. if there were a methodology to suggest that somehow this increase of fees would reduce the criminal activity associated with the commission of crimes. I would be the first one to come on board. But I simply cannot see that we are doing anything more than forcing the increased cost of business on gun dealers to generate a modest amount of revenue that probably in most part will be taken up in the process of administering the oversight associated with this activity. This is not where the problem is. Madam President. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor."},{"1":"1.020218e+09","2":"1992","3":"S","4":"MITCHELL","5":"782","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. President. this conference report has been cleared. I do not believe there is any opposition to it. Accordingly. it is not my intention to request a rollcall vote. I will make a brief statement. and I believe Senator BAUCUS and Senator CHAFEE. and perhaps others. may wish to make a brief statement. but I do not anticipate that consideration of this matter will last more than 10 or 15 minutes. and then we will return to the consideration of the tax bill after enacting this. I do want to describe briefly the background and substance of this legislation. My work on this issue began several years ago as the State of Maine struggled to. enforce Federal compliance with hazardous waste requirements. I believe that the law as it existed then. was clear. but there were disagreeing court opinions. The uncertainty created by this division ham-. pered enforcement. I became convinced that statutory. clarification was the only option. So more than 3 years ago. I introduced the first Senate legislation to make it clear that Federal facilities are not above the law and must comply with the law governing hazardous waste. The conference report we adopt today ratifies this important principle. The principle is important because. without it. there is only voluntary compliance. History demonstrates that voluntary compliance does not work. Each report. that reviews Federal compliance with hazardous waste requirements reveals widespread noncompliance. For example. in 1986. the General Accounting Office found that almost half of all waste handlers were out of compliance with the law. In 1989. the Comptroller General of the United States testified that there is widespread contamination at Department of Energy sites. and that some sites may be irreversibly contaminated. and DOE may have to place them in longterm institutional care. In 1991. the Office of Technology Assessment stated that: The waste and contamination problems at the DOE Weapons Complex are serious and complicated. and many public concerns about potential health and environmental impacts have not yet been addressed. * * * Many sites may never be returned to a condition suitable for unrestricted public access. The most recent EPA data indicate that over half of the Federal facilities are not in compliance with hazardous waste requirements. Enforcement of this law should lead to greater Federal compliance. The legislation will return to the States the enforcement tools we thought we had given them in 1976. A waiver of sovereign immunity moves us from the disorder of Federal noncompliance to a forum in which all entities are subject to the same law and to full enforcement action. I would have been comfortable with a simple clarification that sovereign immunity is waived. but the Departments of Defense and Energy claim that they cannot comply with the law as now written. We. therefore. responded to the administrations repeated requests that Federal agencies be given special consideration in four separate areas: First. the conference agreement responds to the administrations request by providing 3 years for the Department of Energy to reach compliance agreements with States in which there are DOE facilities on mixed waste storage and treatment. During this 3year period. which the Department of Energy said was necessary and adequate. DOE and other Federal agencies will not be subject to the clarified waiver of. sovereign immunity. . . .  .) I expect. however. that DOE will be. diligent in pursuing. compliance agree-. ments. All parties to thisppocesk will need to work cooperatively to make.. this legislation work effectively. I have confidence that - this can and willbe done. .. 1. .� .!

My visits to many Indian reservations have made me all to well aware of the unacceptable living conditions that result from the lack of economic growth and opportunity. That is why I have introduced S. 383. the Indian Economic Development Act. to address the unique causes of poverty in Indian country. Obviously. the need for economic opportunity goes beyond the reservation. I have also visited many urban and rural areas across our country that are mired in poverty. These areas need our attention and help.

This bill embodies an incentiveoriented. freemarket approach to reduce poverty in the most economically depressed areas of the United States. I feel that the freemarket approach will better serve the Nations poor than Federal central planning or subsidies. Federal central planning and subsidies do not promote economic growth. They do not provide the means for longterm economic and social improvement. The economically depressed areas of our Nation need the greatest antipoverty measure knowncapitalism. The incentives provided by this package will encourage and reward the entrepreneurial behavior needed for economic growth. Enterprise zones will attract venture capital to the most economically depressed areas for small business startups and expansion of existing businesses. Reduced effective tax rates will provide a powerful incentive to work. This will help the poor leave welfare for selfsufficiency. Attracting and promoting business opportunities are the keys to economic growth and prosperity. Enterprise zones will provide the poorest communities with the economic opportunity for a prosperous future. Given the opportunity. I have no doubt that the poorest Americans can be successful as entrepreneurs. productive employees. and taxpaying contributors to their society. We need to give the poor the opportunity to change their lives. I feel this legislation will provide the incentives needed for economic growth and opportunity. This legislation will provide opportunity to 50 competitively designated enterprise zones through a package of new tax and regulatory incentives. Furthermore. this legislation will require local. State. and the Federal governments to work together to craft unique incentive packages. For example. this legislation requires local and State governments to jointly request zone designation. This joint request must include a course of action. The course of action will outline a localFederal strategy which encourages local residents and organizations to be the sources of economic growth. Thus. Mr. President. I feel the Enterprise Zone JobsCreation Act of 1991 deserves our support. The combination of tax incentives. regulatory flexibility. and localFederal cooperation can help the poorest Americans be successful and prosperous citizens. All they need is opportunity. This legislation will provide the opportunity that will help change the lives of thousands of poor Americans.*"},{"1":"1.010172e+09","2":"1990","3":"H","4":"HOAGLAND","5":"968","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Chairman. we are here today to debate a bill that comes to us from the U.S. Senate where this bill originated. where it was passed last fall by voice vote. and where it had come out of committee unanimously. This is a bill to protect a beautiful national treasure in my State of Nebraska. It has bipartisan support here in the House of Representatives. and it should be a noncontroversial bill. The main thrust of the bill is to pro. tect 76 miles of the Niobrara River in north central Nebraska as a scenic river. to make it part of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System. which is a tremendous and valuable designation for the State of Nebraska if we can get this done. Nebraska has never before had that privilege. It also designates stretches of the Niobrara and Missouri Rivers as recreational rivers. and authorizes a study of a Buffalo Prairie National Park proposal. The Niobrara River has been called by biologists and others as the biological crossroads of America. I am not a biolog.t nor a scientist. I am not a schoolteacher. I do not know a whole lot about these things. but I think it is worth taking a little bit of time to point out some of the unique ecological features of this area. In that connection we have had this chart prepared to enable Members to see exactly what we are talking about. What I would like to do is refer to this chart and try to describe why this is such a unique area. Please bear with me. because I do not have a whole lot of scientific grounding in this area. but I would like to point out a few things. We see here a crosssection of the Niobrara River Valley. This is the north side of the crosssection of the valley. This is the south side over here. What we see is eastern and western woodlands overlapping. We see here on the north side of the valley a Ponderosa pine forest that extends on down from the Black Hills of South Dakota. We are told by the scientists and the biologists. and so forth. that this is one of the furthest extensions of this range of Ponderosa woodlands. On the south side of the river we have Sand Hills Prairie over here. You can see there is Sand Hills brush and Sand Hills vegatation on top of the sand dunes that compose the great Sands Hills of Nebraska. We have the Sand Hills Prairie again at the extension of the range south of the river. As a result of that. we have plant and wildlife and animals from all of these various ecological areas that are coming together in the Niobrara River Valley. Just a few years ago a scientist. John Farrar. wrote in Arbor Day Magazine that nowhere else do eastern and western woodlands overlap so dramatically. On the east side of the river we have deciduous forests. as I indicated earlier. of slippery elm and ash and linden and ironwood. along with honeysuckle and black walnut. kinds of trees and vegetation that extend across our arid Great Plains In Nebraska to the south. to the east. and to the west. On the other hand. north of the river we have these Ponderosa forests that I talked about. with all of the accompanying bird life and wildlife and plant life that is characteristic of that forest. We also have a situation where there are a lot of endangered species that are found along this river valley. Those include the whooping crane. bald eagles winter here. The river provides nesting habitat for the endangered interior least tern and the federally threatened piping plover. So It is a uniquely diverse ecological area. again with forms of vegetation. with forms of animal life. with forest that are right up at the edge and the fringe of their ecological area. The Niobrara River also has a unique place in the history of Nebraska. William Clark wrote about this river during his 1804 Lewis and Clark Expedition. and that great American author. Marie Sandoz. grew up along the Niobrara and describes it in her novels. Thousands of Nebraskans. indeed thousands of Americans. recognize the Niobrara as a unique and beautiful national treasure. Canoers. campers. hikers. fishermen. fisherwomen alike. flock to north central Nebraska every year to enjoy this magnificent resource. According to Backpacker magazine. it is 1 of the 10 best canoeing rivers in the country. Outside magazine lists the Niobrara as one of the nationwide special camping areas. So this really is a remarkable river. an area that needs to be preserved for Nebraskans. for Americans. and for future generations. When we debated this bill earlier on the floor of the House. during a debate on the rule. I pointed out at length at that time about how this proposal to designate the Niobrara came from landowners along the Niobrara. that they generated that proposal themselves in 1980. that they worked with a lot of their fellow landowners. that they went to Senator EXON in the spring of 1985. and that this indeed is a propooal that comes from the people and from the landowners along the river Itself. S. 280 that we are debating today. as introduced in the Senate and passed by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources unanimously. and in a voice vote in the Senate last year. is a bill that will protect the Niobrara. and that protection today is in our hands. It is in our hands here in the House of Representatives. Mr. Chairman. I would implore Members on both sides of the aisle not to let down those local residents. those Nebraskans everywhere who have asked us to preserve this very special and very precious piece of America."},{"1":"1.010076e+09","2":"1989","3":"S","4":"McCAIN","5":"904","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. I would like to take this opportunity to address a couple of the health provisions in this years Labor. HHS appropriations bill. There is a lot in this section of the bill that I cannot only support. but that I have been working for for some time. There are many provisions in this bill in the area of rural health. I have had the pleasure of serving my colleagues for the last couple of years on the steering committee of the Senate Rural Health Caucus. As such. I have been fighting hard to assure that more attention. and resources. be focused in the area of rural health. First. a couple of years ago. I joined with several of my colleagues in urging the administration to create an Office of Rural Health Policy within the Department of Health and Human Services. I am pleased that the committee has provided sufficient money to continue the activities of this office. Second. I worked with several of my colleagues to establish a grant program to create. through a competitive award process. several national centers on rural health policy across the country. I am proud to say that the University of Arizona was awarded the Rural Health Research Center for the Southwest region. They are doing a great Job. and coming up with some information that I know will be very helpful to policymakers as we seek to make forwardthinking rural health policy. I am pleased to see that the committee has provided continuation funding for this important program. as well as deciding to fund several more centers. Third. I have been very supportive of the rural health care transition grant program. and am pleased to see that the committee has decided to both continue and expand this important program. Fourth. one group of providers that often go unrecognized. but do an incredible job in my Stateproviding health care to a very needy segment of my States populationis the community and migrant health centers. I appreciate the fine job that they do on such a shoestring budget. and am pleased to see that the committee has proposed to increase their funding. Fifth. and last in the area of rural health. one of the organizations that has been doing a great service in the area of rural health in my State of Arizona is the Area Health Education Center Program. I believe this is one of the promising programs. in terms of exposing young medical students to rural practice. and am pleased to see that the committee has been so generous in its funding for this program. There are certainly a lot of other good parts of this bill. with regard to rural health that I have not mentioned. but I particularly wanted to highlight these I have just mentioned. With regard to our important national research agenda. I am pleased to see the committees action in this area. Health research must be an important priority. and this bill is evidence that it is. There is one area of health research that I would like to focus particular attention on. and that is the area of mental health research for rural and native American populations. As some of my colleagues know. the Senate Indian Affairs Committee is about to consider a piece of legislation I have in the area of native American mental health. This program would provide for a demonstration program for the testing of native American based and developed alternatives to meeting the mental health needs of their population. This would assist us. and the IHS. to determine what longterm restructuring ought to occur in the IHS mental health system. I am very supportive of this bills provision in the area of rural and native American mental health research. It is very forward thinking. and is much in line with the bill that I have proposed. which will be considered in the Indian Affairs Committee on October 6. Perhaps some of this money could go toward the research/demonstration program under S. 1270. I would also like to touch. for a moment. on the issue of AIDS. I am pleased to see that the committee has provided a solid level of funding for AIDS research. and particularly the pediatric AIDS initiativesan area that I have worked on in the past with Senators ME:TZENBAUM and HATCH. In my opinion. there is no segment of the population facing this illness that has less say about it than children who contract this illness. It is imperative that we do everything we can to address this situation. I am concerned. however. about the inflexibility that this bill provides to the Public Health Service from being able to move money with the various health budgets to address the AIDS crisis. as the needs may shift. I think this is a serious mistake. I would like to conclude my remarks by addressing an important component of the health care delivery systemthat is. nursing care. As we all know. there is a severe shortage of nurses in our country. This shortage is having real consequences in access to care in my State. as well as others. I am pleased to see that the committee has seen the importance of addressing this critical issue. and has proposed that there be an increase in the effort put toward nursing research. and nursing education and training programs. Let me say. I am fully supportive of this focus.*"},{"1":"1.000225e+09","2":"1988","3":"S","4":"GORE","5":"951","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. President. I would like to express my support for this legislation and applaud the Agriculture Committee. under the guidance of Senator LEAHY. for their thorough and expeditious work in producing this legislation. The drought of 1988 has been especially severe in Tennessee. Not only have we received less than 55 percent of our average rainfall. we began this growing season in a raindeficit situation. For some parts of Tennessee. this is the third straight year of drought. Many farmers in Tennessee and across the Nation thought this would be the first year since the early 1980s to make a substantial profit on their crop. Excess supplies were dwindling and prices were rising. However. because of the drought. even our most efficient farmers will suffer economically this year. Tennessee farmers are hardworking and independent. They would rather the rains come and be able to grow a healthy. highyield crop. However. this year the drought has not given our farmers a fair chance and we need this legislation if our farmers are to survive. In Tennessee. the drought has not been selective. All farmers in drought areas across the State have been adversely affected. Row crop farmers are seeing their plants stunted in the field. Without rain. plants that have come up have simply stopped growing. Corn is tassling before any appreciable feed is produced on the cob. Soybeans. tobacco and other crops are permanently damaged in the field. and it Is too late to replant. Dairy farmers are losing production because of the heat and the lack of feed for their herds. Moreover. dairy farmers and livestock growers are seeing their feed costs double. At the same time. those that usually are able to produce a substantial amount of their feed are being forced to buy feed at the marketplace at inflated prices. Many livestock growers simply cannot afford to maintain a herd under these stressful conditions and are being forced to sell their herds onto an already saturated market at depressed prices. Also. soil erosion on cultivated land has increased as our topsoil is so dry that it is blowing away. Water sources. such as ponds and wells have been damaged under the stress of drought. We are actually losing a greater percentage of the rain that is falling to runoff because so much vegetative cover has died. Next year our farmers in droughtstricken areas will have to make extensive land improvements to repair the conservation damage caused by the drought. The assistance in this legislation will be of great help to the droughtaffected farmers in Tennessee and across the Nation. Farmers of program and nonprogram crops who have lost more than 35 percent of their expected returns will be reimbursed at a rate of 65 cents on the dollar for those losses greater than 35 percent. Producers of program crops that have a targetprice system of payment will not be required to repay advanced deficiency payments. The Secretary of Agriculture is directed to make a report to Congress on the feasibility of instituting a marketing loan program for soybeans. FmHA borrowers who have been affected by the drought will receive special consideration by the Secretary of Agriculture in any attempt to collect delinquent debt. Those farmers who have had to utilize their conservation land for haying or grazing will be able to use a portion of their Federal land payments to make conservation improvements on their land. Existing feed programs for livestock and dairy farmers will be expanded to include more feeders. Dairy support prices will not be cut in January 1989. as would have been possible otherwise. I applaud these efforts. but as a livestock farmer myself. I caution my colleagues not to be too quick to consider the problems of this drought solved. We will be suffering the effects of this drought for at least another 15 months. Foundation herds. both cattle and hogs. are being sold for slaughter. It will take time for these herds to be rebuilt. Dairy farmers and hog and cattle producers who grow their own sileage will suffer the effects of this drought until they are able to harvest next years corn crop in the fall of 1989. Many farmers will be forced to reseed their droughtstressed hay and pasture land to reestablish their average yields. The effects of these hardships will show on farm income balance sheets. in reduced economic activity across rural America and on the grocery store shelves. Finally. Mr. President. I believe this bill is a good assistance package for our farmers who have suffered because of the drought. However. I believe in the future we must look deeper into this problem to identify the causes of drought. Our weather patterns are changing. The 1980s have already accounted for four of the warmest years in the history of global measurements. It appears that 1988 will be the fifth. and threatens to be the warmest ever. In studying the trend. we must not overlook the effect our actions have on our changing global environment. Carbon dioxide emissions are increasing. as are chorofluorocarbons. methane. nitrous oxide. and other greenhouse gases. Meanwhile. worldwide deforestation continues to have an adverse impact on our atmosphere. If we are to understand global environmental problems. such as the drought. we must begin to view the Earth as a dynamic system of interacting variables. It is not enough to study the oceans. the atmosphere and the solid Earth separately. We must begin to study these problems jointly. I believe we may find in the future that droughts are predictable and that actions can be taken to avoid their worst problems. Mr. President. I applaud this bill. It will bring muchneeded assistance to the farmers of Tennessee. I urge my colleagues to vote for its passage."},{"1":"1.000110e+09","2":"1987","3":"H","4":"HUGHES","5":"561","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 940. the Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act. This legislation represents a major step forward for our country in coming to grips with the growing plastic pollution problem we have created in our oceans. I congratulate my colleague. chairman STUDDS and the leadership of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries on this initiative. We are polluting our waters with all kinds of wastes. particularly plastic waste. and from a variety of sources. Plastic garbage is being dumped overboard by ships. fishing nets are left to ghost fish. sewage outlets are releasing plastic tampon applicators and condoms. and beach goers are leaving their plastic cups. sandwich bags. and other trash along the shore. The Navy alone. estimates that it generates 3 pounds of plastic waste per person on their vessels per day. Some 5 tons of plastic waste dumpted daily by the Navy symbolizes what a throwaway society we have become. Unfortunately. what we are throwing away is trash that persists in our waters and is becoming a major source of death for marine mammals who become entangled in sixpack rings and ingest plastic bags and other debris. Clearly. this problem is global in scope. H.R. 940 recognizes this by providing for the implementation of annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. To date. 28 nations representing approximately 48 percent of the worlds shipping tonnage have ratified. The speedy enactment of this legislation would bring the total shipping tonnage to over 50 percent and allow for the treaty to come into effect internationally. At the local level. H.R. 940 will require the EPA to conduct a comprehensive study that will identify the various types of plastic materials entering the ocean from .andbased sources and recommend ways to reduce the production. sale and disposal of such plastics. The report will focus particularly on hospital waste. such as that which washed up along the New Jersey shore this past summer. In addition. the bill includes an amendment I offered with Congressmen HOWARD and SAXTON in committee to require a New York bight plastics study. This study will specifically address the plastic debris problem that has plagued New Jersey beaches. coastal waters. marine life and the environment. You may recall a recent incident when a slick of plastic trash 2 miles long and 50 miles wide concentrated in a tide right off the shore of my home town of Ocean City. NJ. Just this past summer. the Department of Environmental Protection had to close parts of New Jerseys beaches 14 times due to large amounts of plastic floatables. raw sewage. medical waste. wood. and other garbage degrading the water quality and making it hazardous and unsightly to swim in the ocean. We must stop this damage to our environment.

I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. I want to take this opportunity to commend my chairman. the gentleman from Texas. for his efforts to properly address the difficulties that American farmers face in agricultural trade. Through all of last year. the Agriculture Committee worked in a bipartisan manner to remedy many of these difficulties in the 1985 farm bill. Now. before those remedies have even been fully implemented. we are presented with this socalled Trade Reform Act that politicizes our formerly bipartisan trade policy and singles out the American farmer to bear the brunt of this misguided and highly political bill. This year the Agriculture Committee was awaiting the recommendations of the congressionally created agriculture export commission that has been working for 18 months to identify areas of needed reform. The committee intended to develop comprehensive agricultural trade legislation later this year. Suddenly. the orderly work of the committee was disrupted by a demand from the majority leadership to immediately submit agricultural sections for the bill now under consideration. It was also made clear that this omnibus trade bill would be the only trade vehicle for the rest of this Congress. As a result. the Agriculture Committee was forced to abandon its plans for a carefully considered agricultural trade bill this year and hurriedly throw together a jumble of ideas with almost no debate and without being able to consider the final report of the agriculture export commission. While most of the ideas contained in title VI of H.R. 4800 are acceptable. we dont have any idea what important proposals for enhancing farm exports we have missed in pursuit of this omnibus bill. The real danger for American farmers in H.R. 4800 lies beyond the agricultural title. In a shortsighted effort to placate every political segment of the population involved in trade. the majority has stirred up a witchs brew of protectionism that is certain to ignite a trade war. And the first victim of that trade war is going to be the American farmer. Already scrambling to retain his share of agricultural exports in a world glutted with excess food exports. the American farmer will be forced to stand by helplessly as his best markets are destroyed by the trade war brought on by the majoritys trade reform. It may be politically satisfying for some domestic constituencies to create arbitrary. automatic retaliation standards to be used against our competitors or to set ourselves up as selfappointed referees of other countries labor policies. but such acts will spell the end of American farm exports. The countries targeted by the majoritys bill are the American farmers best overseas customers. The majority may be able to score political points with this bill. but they are going to drive American farmers off the land. There is no question that the American farmer has been battered in the competition for export markets in recent years. He has borne the burden of embargoes. world recession and an overvalued dollar. Through a series of channels progress has been made to revitalize our farm export trade. In the farm bill Congress put into place new policies and programs that are setting the stage for new growth in U.S. agricultural exports. The administration is implementing those programs and taking action to fight unfair trade practices where they exist. The world trading community is about to enter into a new round of trade talks that may finally resolve many of the major disputes in agricultural trade. Just as we are on the verge of accomplishing something positive for the farmer. the majoritys bill would destroy all that effort. Those of us who represent rural and farming areas should carefully weigh the impact of H.R. 4800 on the farms and small towns of our districts before supporting this bill. Instead of creating a tool to repair the problems in American trade policy. the majority has fashioned a loaded gun pointed directly at the head of the American farmer. Those who care about the fate of the farmer must join me in opposing this ominous trade bill. Mr. Chairman.

I appreciate his insight. but the fact of the matter is that the sites that I am talking about that are on the national priority list happen to be. for instance.

The consequence has been that the burden has fallen almost solely on the local governments in those instances. If the State or the National Government spent the money. obviously that would take care of the problem. but we are here with the amendment because indeed that has not been the case. I would just point out to the gentleman that his concern I think is reasonable with regard to invading the fund. but under section 120 of the bill. of course. we provide for subrogation or recovery. which I think that should satisfy the concerns the gentleman has with respect to the full reimbursement."},{"1":"9.802476e+08","2":"1984","3":"S","4":"ROTH","5":"588","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. I am pleased to support House Joint Resolution 600. which authorizes a comprehensive review of agricultural trade and export policy. Senate action on this proposal today will permit this effort to get underway promptly and to make a positive contribution to the deliberations on the 1985 farm bill. I commend Senator DOLE for the leadership he has provided in introducing this legislation. and I want to thank Senator PERCY for the excellent hearing on this matter that he chaired recently before the Committee on Governmental Affairs. It was clear in the testimony offered before the committee last week that this proposal enjoys broad support within the farm community. Farmers see this as not just another ineffective blue ribbon panel. Rather it is viewed as a significant opportunity to contribute to legislation that will be before the Congress next year and to help us remain competitive in agricultural exports in the coming decade and beyond. It is this dual nature of the resolution mandate that is particularly appealing. The 1985 farm bill is likely to be watershed legislation for the American agriculture community. The findings and recommendations generated by the Resolution 319 review will focus the issues in the farm bill and will help to ensure that the final legislation advances the interests of all farmers. Additionally. however. we in this country must take a serious look at the longterm future of agricultural exports and the manner in which Government policies affect our farm export performance. The relationship between domestic farm support programs and export policy. and the interrelationship of our patchwork quilt of export programs must be reviewed to make certain that these policies are not contradictory and ultimately selfdefeating. The neglect of these issues will jeopardize American agricultural productivity which is the envy of all the world. To address these concerns forthrightly will help ensure the continued international competitiveness of American agriculture long into the future. The mandate contained in Resolution 319 and the timing of the reports to be submitted to Congress and the President will permit this longer term review. The importance of agricultural exports can hardly be overestimated. Today about 25 percent of U.S. farm income is derived from exports and almost 2 out of every 5 acres of agricultural land is cultivated for export. Farm exports are the largest single positive aspect of our current trade balance of payments. Every $1 billion in farm exports is responsible for between 25.000 and 30.000 jobs in the private sector. Last year this accounted for more that 1 million jobs for people other than U.S. farmers. My home State of Delaware clearly exemplifies the importance of agriculture. In Delaware. agriculture is a principle employer and is essential to the health of the States economy. The Delaware corn. soybean. and poultry industries all are enhanced when world markets are enhanced. Despite this importance of agriculture. however. the strength of U.S. agricultural exports by no means is assured. In fiscal year 1982 our agricultural exports fell almost $5 billion below the 1981 level to $39.1 billion. In fiscal year 1983 a further decline occurred. bringing the level of U.S. agricultural exports to $34.8 billion. While recent data are somewhat more encouraging. the vulnerability of U.S. farm exports is clear. The study called for in Senator DOLEs proposal can help to assure strong export performance for agriculture in the future. By sorting out our confusing mosaic of agricultural export policies. this proposal will make a significant contribution to the competitiveness of U.S. farm exports and to the health of domestic agriculture. I urge prompt Senate approval of this resolution."},{"1":"9.800212e+08","2":"1983","3":"H","4":"ROYBAL","5":"444","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. during the debate last year on the fiscal year 1983 budget resolution. I made a statement asserting that in our zeal to outpennypinch the Republicans. many of us had lost sight of the great principles on which our party was built. I am pleased to be able to stand before you today and state that we seem to be regaining our sight. This budget resolution is not perfectIn fact. there are a number of elements in it that I would not ordinarily support. Many of us. I think. would favor greater reductions in military spending. and a greater commitment to the domestic programs that have been battered by the administration for the past 2 years. However. as a realistic assessment of the conditions and attitudes which prevail in America today. this budget is a solid. responsible document worthy of our full support. Finally. we are working for a return to some balance in our fiscal policies. This budget calls for consistently lower deficits than does the Presidents. and it does not rely on the slashing of worthwhile programs to achieve the reductions. Nor does it fail to address the ways in which increases will be funded. Implicit in this resolution is recognition of the folly of some of the tax measures we have let slip through Congress in recent years. We all know that the first tax cut package degenerated into nothing more than a bidding war to see who could give away more tax breaksus or them. It is about time we started to correct some of those previous provisions. I am pleased that this budget resolution is paving the way for some basic tax reforms. Let us stop depending on the lower and middle income classes to bear the brunt of our economic program. It is also about time we started to deal. in the budget. with the current economic conditions in this country. This resolution includes funds to accommodate the jobs bill we just passed. funds to provide additional unemployment benefits. and funds to meet the basic needs of the millions of Americans who are out of work. This budget also attempts to deal realistically with the special needs we must meet to assure complete economic recovery and future growth. It provides increased funds for employment and training. education. and research and developmentall areas that are vital to the health and preparedness of this Nation. and all areas that have been neglected in recent years.

Furthermore. those who are caught in the situation where they must relocate because of their jobs or because they are in the military face most distressing circumstances. The only people today who can handle that situation are people associated with large firms that offer relocation assistance as a benefit of employment. with the f irm taking over the employees house when a move is required. The consequence of that. interestingly enough. as testimony received in the course of the six Maryland hearings underscored. is to place small business at an even greater disadvantage with the large concerns: small business companies are not able to offer that benefit. As a consequence. they have difficulty in competing for talent. In the farming sector. it is clear that young people cannot get into farming today. In fact. one witness said the only way a young person can enter farming is either to inherit the farm or marry into it. The purchase of farm equipment is obviously being deferred even though the farmer calculates that the addition of such equipment will make him a more effective and efficient producer. thereby increasing his productivity. Yet. when he confronts the high interest rates that are associated with acquiring the equipment. he is simply not able to go forward. Mr. President. these are only some of the more serious and striking distortions in business and community patterns which were brought out during the course of these hearings. It is clear that unless interest rates are brought down to a level where productive enterprises can carry on their businesses. our economy is going to lose a whole range of economic enterprises of proven efficiency and productivity. The witnesses we heard from were invariably the leading business peoue in their fields. these were people who have been productive and effective economic contributors for a sustained period of time. The message from all of them was that they clearly cannot handle the situation with which they are now confronted. If the admnistration. first of all. were to urge the Federal Reserve to move to a more reasonable policyand. for the moment. they are not doing that. Since 2 weeks ago. Chairman Volcker announced that the Federal Reserve would continue its current polices and immediately thereafter the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. Murray Weidenbaum. said that the Fed is following the policy which the administration supportsthe same assertion that Mr. Volcker made in the course of questions and answers on one of the Sunday talk shows. Mr. President. it seems to me that the administration. as a start. has to make clear to the Federal Reserve that the Fed policy of unprecedented high interest rates is proving to be counterproductive. The policy is not succeeding in the effort to check inflation. It is. in fact. contributing to the inflation. As I said earlier. the high interest rates themselves have become a factor in the high costs reflected in the Consumer Price Index. and the high interest rates. by provoking a deep recession in certain sectors of the economy. by provoking this economic downturn and bringing economic activity to a halt. are throwing out of work people who could otherwise be productive. People who could produce goods and services which the economy needs and wants cease to be independent. Instead of earning and paying taxes. they become dependent and start drawing cut of the Treasury. It makes absolutely no sense to shift people from working and producing. supporting themselves and their families. contributing their share to the National. State. and local budgets. and have them jobless and drawi.ng out of the National Treasury. The jump in interest costs has had an enormous impact on State and local governments. which is reflected in turn in the tax burden carried at the State and local level. It is reflected by the inability of State and local governments to develop the economic infrastructure needed for the development of the private sector if we are going to have economic vitality and job creation. Mr. President. I join with others in underscoring the enormous importance of addressing this interest rate problem and urging a prompt change in policy. I thank the majority leader for his consideration in yielding me additional time."},{"1":"9.603201e+08","2":"1980","3":"H","4":"DICKS","5":"68","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Chairman.

I am opposed to this legislation. because of the potential it presents for abundant abuse of Federal employees through political coercion. and because I believe the public expects and deserves a nonpartisan career civil service. The Hatch Act serves to prevent political extortion of employees who administer Federal programs and thereby protects the civil service from corrupt practices of overzealous politicians. While times has certainly changed since the 1930s. for example. the Federal work force of classified career civil servants is nearly 10 times as large. the need to insulate the civil service from partisan politics is as compelling today as it was in 1939. if not more so. Today. we have close to 3 million Federal employees. over 90 percent of whom are covered by legal prohibitions on partisan political activities. They take pride in their work. The public views their work as being impartial execution of the laws. These employees know. we know. and the public knows. that no career civil service employee is required to be a political activist or help get out the vote on election day in order to keep or get a Government job. If the rankandfile Federal worker fears anything. it is political coercion and discrimination. It is my feeling this fear far outweighs any desire for a chance to run for partisan office or raise money for political campaigns. In my own district I have personally interviewed many Federal workers to solicit their opinions on this bill. By an overwhelming margin they want the law left alone. because they want the protection and the security it offers. I understand that within the last 2 hours WMAL radio right here in Washington announced the results of a poll that they had conducted in the Washington area. Their response from hundreds and hundreds of Federal employees in that poll reflects a 10to1 majority who are opposed to H.R. 10. Even employee union groups who support this bill. the National Federation of Federal Empolyees. for example. wanted more protection for employees from illegal solicitations of political contributions by their supervisors. The sheer numbers of and the unique status of civil service workers makes them easy marks for unethical politicians and political organizers. Even though only a few. if any. Federal employees would exercise the maximum emancipation this bill calls for. every Federal employeeno matter how anonymous his particular job. no matter how insignificant some may think he or she iswould feel the impact of this bill on the job. Employees as well as Government programs would come to be labeled politIcally. the appearance of favoritism based upon political affiliation would be commonplace. Decisions having preferential or adverse impact on anyone would be perceived as being politically motivated. The impact of this bill will go far beyond the confines of the Federal bureaucracy. and the public will be left to suffer. If we do not think the public trusts our Government today. just imagine what it will be like when Federal employees are branded because of the political activities of a few. There are several aspects of this bill which concern me very much. not only as a member of both the Subcommittee on Civil Service and the full committee. but also as a citizen who respects the rights of all other citizens to think and vote as they please. The bill purports to encourage more voluntary political activity. But when we tried to change the policy statement of the billsection 7321to guarantee that all Federal employees will have the right to exercise their freedomofchoice and refrain from political activities. our attempts fell on deaf ears. I was especially dismayed when a simple guarantee of freedomofchoice was cast aside. because to me it presented an avenue of employee protection from coercion. Another aspect of the bill I think all the Members should be aware of. is the very narrowly drawn definition of restricted position. for which partisan political activities would still be prevented. Under the bills provisions. we are going to be left with only a very few restricted positions in the Federal Government. and the process by which they might become restricted is very complicated indeed. Under these provisions. no one has any clear idea of how many restricted position possibilities there are. One thing is clear. however. there are no blanket restrictions for FBI agents. U.S. Treasury agents. the CIA. or the IRS. Not too many Government investigators. inspectors. law enforcement officers. auditors. contracting officers or purchasing agents will be determined to be in restricted positions. They will not exercise the sort of authority over other employees that the bill calls for. What this means. for example. is that an Internal Revenue Service auditor who calls in a taxpayer for an audit of his tax return would not be restricted from partisan politics. This is because the taxpayer who is to be called in for an audit is selected by a computer. or the basis of mathematical calculations. and the individual auditor. while he has almost total decision authority over the taxpayer. does not have binding decision authority over other IRS employees. Another example of where the bills restricted position definition will be rendered meaningless is in the Occupational Safety and Health Administration within the Department of Labor. OSHA. which is not a small town in Wisconsin. has many employees who conduct investigations and Inspections of private business firms to determine the status of compliance with Government standards and regulations. It is highly likely that these OSHA inspectors. although they can bring the full legal and bureaucratic wrath of the Federal Government down on a small businessman. will still be able to play partisan politics because they would not occupy positions considered restricted under the bill. The examples of this kind of doubletalk are replete. when one looks at the hundreds of investigators and inspectors of various kinds working for the Government. The Environmental Protection Agency. the Wage and Hour Division. the Postal Service. Housing and Urban Development. Farmers Home Administration. the list could go on and on."},{"1":"9.402251e+08","2":"1976","3":"S","4":"HANSEN","5":"464","6":"Yes","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. the situation we are trying to address is brought about by the fact that about 2 percent of the livestock. the cattle. that are raised in the United States today graze at some time during their lives upon the publiclyowned lands of the United States. We are not talking about a lot of cattle in terms of total numbers but. nevertheless. that 2 percent is important to the continuing welfare of many. many small communities and counties and. indeed. States of the West. The fact is also that the grower. the breeder of cattle has been in a very difficult situation. But the fact is they have been going out of business. When this happens. the jobs that were provided by those ranching operations suddenly vanish. The support that goes to communities dries up. The tax base is eroded as poorer uses have to be made of these ranch properties. The absence of the livestock from the tax rolls hurts schools. hurts communities. hurts businesses throughout the West. This formula. I grant and agree with my good friend from Colorado. is not easily understood unless you are familiar with the livestock business. and if you are. as BLM people are and as forest people are. it makes good sense. In fact. it says simply two things: If the price of livestock increases. the grazing fees will reflect proportionately a like increase. If they drop lower the grazing fee that will be levied the next year will be lower in a proportional amount. It also takes cognizance of the fact that there is a differenceas has been pointed out by the Senator from New Mexicoin lands. That some lands are not as good as other lands. In Wyoming we have areas where it may take at least 160 acres or even as much as a section to graze one cow for 1 year. That is about the limit. There are other parts of the West where the grasses are very verdant and they are densely found growing on the land. It recognizes that that sort of difference can make the difference in how fat an animal and how much growth will take place during the grazing season. This bill is important if we want to keep people in the cow business. I am surprised at the environmental groups who were so greatly concerned about trying to keep little ranchers on the land when they wanted the strip mining. but suddenly now dry up their support and say that this does not matter. they wanted it as long as it was strip mining. but go down the drain on this one? I have to say that I hope this amendment. which has wide bipartisan support. will prevail.

Senator LAXALT. and myself. I introduce for appropriate reference a bill to provide for the suspension of annual assessment work on mining claims held by location in the United States. Section 28 of title 30 of the United States Code now requires that on each mining claim located. and until a patent has been issued. not lessthan $100 worth of labor must be performed annually or improvements worth that amount must be made each year in order to maintain the validity of the claim. The present fuels and energy shortage calls for a concerted effort by all Americans to conserve fuels. This fact and the further fact that present and growing shortages of gasoline and diesel fuels are making it more and more difficult for the holders of mining claims to perform the required annual assessment work militate in .avor of a suspension of this statutory requirement. The effect of this bill would be to suspend the requirements of 30 U.S.C. 28 as to all mining claims in the United States until July 1. 1980. provided that the claimant by July 1 of each year files a notice certifying his desire to continue to hold the mining claim involved. There can be little question that the energy crisis warrants congressional reexamination of existing laws mandating the expenditure of fuels. Where it is possible to relax such requirements in view of the fuel shortage then. of course. that should be done. The situation I have described is a case in point. I hope the Interior Committee and the Senate will be able to look at this situation expeditiously and approve a reasonable moratorium on the present requirement for annual assessment work."},{"1":"9.303493e+08","2":"1974","3":"S","4":"BAYH","5":"532","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. last night the Senate passed H.R. 17597 to provide emergency unemployment compensation. I believe passage of this bill was one of the most important actions we have taken this year. Mr. President. unemployment in this country reached 6.5 percent in November. a 13year high. and it appears that the number of unemployed will continue to grow in the months to come. The Presidents leading economic advisers are now predicting that unemployment will exceed 7 percent by the middle of next year. and economists outside of the administration are saying that 8 percent is a more realistic figure. That is why I was amazed to see that our President again last week repeated that he was not alarmed by the state of the economy and said that we were not facing a crisis. Mr. President. if the specter of 8 percent unemployment coupled with double digit inflation is not an economic crisis. we will never see one. Yet the President refuses to take the decisive action needed to get the economy moving again and to control inflation. We in Congress are left with the responsibility of taking the initiative. I was very happy last Thursday when the Senate passed the public service employment bill. That bill will provide over 500.000 jobs in the public sector and it will also expand coverage of our unemployment compensation system. It marked only the first step in our effort. however. and it will not provide a complete solution of our unemployment problem. It was necessary that we also promptly enact the provisions for emergency benefits contained in H.R. 17597 in order to provide further aid for those who are unable to find work. This bill does two things. First. it reforms the triggering mechanism which initiates the already existing extended unemployment benefits program. Secondly. it provides an additional 13 weeks of emergency benefits after a worker has run out of his 26 weeks of regular benefits and 13 weeks of extended benefits. What this means is that as of January of next year unemployment benefits can be paid under both the extended and emergency programs in all States. Though this bill is extremely important. it must be kept in mind that it is an emergency. stopgap measure. There are many basic flaws in our modern unemployment compensation system which are not touched by this measure. and I believe that it will be essential for us to pass further legislation next year to give the whole system a thorough overhaul. But for now. no matter what the President says. we are faced with a crisis. and it was necessary that we act immediately to extend the benefits available to the unemployed. Mr. President. I think that the manner in which Congress has so expeditiously acted with this and other unemployment legislation is very significant. We have been left by default with the responsibility of formulating an effective economic policy for the Nation. Our action on unemployment benefits and public services employment gives a clear indication that we can and will exercise that responsibility. Congress must pass those programs needed to put our Nation on a different economic course.

I say it is not time to debate about the poor fellow who cannot get off the farm. He can get off quite easily and we may be the ones who take him off.

But my friends who say they are now in opposition to funding the program know perfectly well that that is not the way to combat this kind of problem. that is not the way to meet this kind of problem. that is not the way to solve this kind of problem. We went through all of this at great length in the committee. Keep in mind what we are talking about. When Congress passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act. I am sure this was not done with tongue in cheek or anything like that. This is a basic. organic law. We passed this act with the expectation that it would be enforced. This is the Occupational Safety and Health Act. The act must be enforced. which makes a lot of people unhappy. No matter whether you are talking about a traffic light or a piece of legislation like this. a lot of people get unhappy. A lot of things have happened that were wrong. There is no question about that. Somebody always goofs a little here and there on something like thisso farreaching. and new. and of such major import. But this is not the way to proceed: Lets cut out the money and put handcuffs on those clowns downtown. That is not the way to do it. Mr. Chairman. this act covers approximately 60 million employees and almost 5 million establishments throughout the entire Nation. The amount in the bill provides for only a little over 1.000 jobs to enforce the bills requirements relating to 60 million workers in 5 million places. Just about 1.000. That is what? One for every 4.000plus establishments in the country. one inspector for about 4.000 places. Good heavens. Reduction in enforcement? Why. the amendment would defeat the entire purpose of the act and. by the way. that would be to the detriment not only of the employees but of society at large. who must pay the costs of these thousands and thousands of preventable occupational injuries. illnesses. and deaths. That is what this bill is for. The entire society is involved. not merely the businessman. There is no question several somebodies have made mistakes and we have had the tobeexpected reactions. I have seen the mail. There is no doubt about this. We went into this thing in the hearings with these people and I took these people apart and so did the rest of the committee. We knocked their brains out for the very reasons the gentlemen who support this amendment are talking about. I think every Member of this House has received these complaints about overly zealous enforcement activities. We know about that. But to the extent there is a problem. the committee feels that this is one that can be worked out with better training and supervision of the Departments compliance officers. Do not forget this. Also. every Member of this House has seen and has heard allegations on the part of organized labor on this. They say that the budget does not provide half enough inspectors to do a proper job of enforcing this act. There is no question about that. This. of course. should be defeated. This is not the way to improve the enforcement of this actobviously."},{"1":"9.201070e+08","2":"1971","3":"H","4":"BRADEMAS","5":"936","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. I shall withhold the request. Mr. Chairman. the Select Education Subcommittee. which I have the honor to chair. unanimously and favorably voted to report this bill to the full Committee on Education and Labor. The judgment of the subcommittee was upheld in full committee action this past Thursday. September 23. when it ordered the bill to be reported to the House by a vote of 28 to 3 to 1. The favorable committee vote was the result of nearly 3 years of effort on the part of a bipartisan group of Congressmen: OGDEN REID. Republican. of New York. the ranking minority member of my subcommittee. PATSY MINx. Democrat. of Hawaii. LLOYD MEEDS. of Washington. ORVAL HANSEN. Republican. of Idaho. JOHN DELLENBACK. Republican. of Oregon. and SHIRLEY CHISHOLM. Democrat of New York. together with ALBERT QuIE. of Minnesota. the ranking minority member of the full committee. are the ones who have worked the hardest In moving us along. In the last Congress our subcommittee conducted 18 days of hearings on this legislation. the most extensive consideration preschool legislation has received from any committee of either the House or the Senate. We also held 3 more days of hearings this year on the bill we had already considered so extensively in 1970. That we have such wide sponsorship in the House and that the Senate has already acted favorably on a similar bill. led by Senators MONDALE of Minnesota and JAvrrs of New York and BAYH of my own State of Indianathat there is such broad interest in this legislation means. I think. that America is beginning to come of age. in our appreciation of the fact that what happens to children in the first 5 years of life. to use the Presidents phrase. can have an immense impact on the rest of their lives. Indeed. child psychologists like Benjamin Bloom of the University of Chicago. have observed that as much as 50 percent of the development of human intelligence takes place before the age of 5. I think the fact that Congress has already observed some of the successes. fitful and uneven as they are. of Headstart has helped the effort to extend the benefits of Headstarttype programs to all children of preschool age in the United States. It is. I hope you will appreciate. significant that we speak of the comprehensive child development bill. We do not talk of a preschool bill or of a daycare center bill. Why not? First. the phrase comprehensive. applies to the wide range of services to be afforded under the bill. they include not only cognitive or educational or instructional services. they also go to nutritional and health services and indeed. the entire range of services that have to do with the development of a child. Second. our committee has taken very seriously the findings of the Coleman Report that poor children develop much more rapidly when they participate in programs with children of middleincome backgrounds than when they are segregated by family income. This is not a function of race. poor black children in classes with middleclass black children progress more rapidly than do poor black children segregated by socioeconomic background. There is another fundamental aspect of this legislation. If you look at statistics on working mothers in the United States. you will appreciate a further reason we believe this legislation is so significant. There are today some 8 million preschool children below the age of 6 in the United States whose mothers work. yet. daycare services are available to less than 700.000 of these children. And this problem will be immensely compounded in the coming years because the United States estimates are that by 1980. there will be close to 7.6 million working mothers with children under 6 years of age. This means an increase of 43 percent between 1970 and 1980. a fact with immense implications for the development of very young children in our country. Now let me briefly outline the key features of the comprehensive child development bill I am submitting to the House today. First. participation in the programs provided will be voluntary. Nobody wants to command mothers and fathers to have their children participate in these programs. Second. the amendment provides throughout the process for participation by parents both through local policy councils composed of parents who will decide from among the applications which ones to approve and by actual parental participation in the planning and conduct of programs established. Third. the amendment assures that. although we open the program to children of poor and middle- and upperincome backgrounds. priority will be given to the needs of disadvantaged children. In this connection I would point out that although the program will be open to children and families of all income groups. the children of families of four whose family income is above the lower living standard budget. which is presently $6.960. will be charged a fee on a sliding scale basis. depending upon their income. with no fee to be charged for children below that level. The bill would establish also by statute what has heretofore been established by Executive order in the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. namely an Office of Child Development with the responsibility for coordinating all federally supported child development programs. The bill authorizes funds for construction of daycare facilities and provides for the training of professional and paraprofessional people for child development personnel. These are just the major features of the legislation. which I suggest to the House establishes a crucially important framework for services to children in our country. I believe it is also fair to point out that this bill has been put together almost entirely on the part of initiatives within the Congress."},{"1":"9.103034e+08","2":"1970","3":"S","4":"HRUSKA","5":"782","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. we are desperately in need of legislation to help insure the safety and health of industrial workers. For too long their needs have been inadequately provided for in this respect. The grim statistics speak for themselves. we cannot afford 14.500 fatalities a year. 2.2 million disabilities. The economic impact Is tremendous. but even more horrible is the human suffering of the men and women involved. and of their families and their communities. The situation cries out for solution. It is our strong duty to heed that cry and provide relief in this session o.f Congress. But. it is also our duty to provide responsible legislation. The program we authorize must be one that can be administered. it must also be one which provides for due process and is in accord with orderly and accustomed practice. Mr. President. S. 2193 does not meet these criteria. If it is approved in the form in which it was reported. we will not have acted responsibly in this critical matter. It is my view. Mr. President. that the Senate should have accepted the amendment offered yesterday by Mr. DoMINIcK. That amendment would have allowed us to achieve the objectives we all seek. without the critical faults of S. 2193. It is my hope that the Senate will. erase the most important deficiencies of the committee bill. The major faults of S. 2193 are these: First. The Secretary of Labor is made responsible for making. promulgating and enforcing health and safety standards. He is required to be at one and the same time. rulemaker. Investigator. judge. and jury. Mr. President. the Secretary of Labor himself recognizes the impropriety of such an arrangement. He does not believe that such a range of responsibility should be vested in an executive department. and has asked for a more reasonable process. The. President of the United States does not want this authority totally vested in one of his Cabinet officers. and has indicated his preference for S. 4404. the substance of which was included in the amendment which was before us yesterday. Second. S. 2193. in my view. violates due process. The bill calls for heavy fines without providing the normal and accepted safeguards common to such penalties. The entire process is an administrative one. and is only appealable to a judicial or independent body as a last resort. It is important to note that the circuit court of appealswhich hears appeals from the Secretarys decisionsis required to accept the Secretarys findings of fact as conclusive. if they are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. Mr. President. we have available to us a good and proper alternative. It is contained in the Dominick substitute amendment. Instead of making the Secretary of Labor responsible for setting standards. these should be the province of an Occupational and Health Board. composed of specially chosen members competent to handle the complex medical and technical problems involved. The problem involves not only the conventional labor and manpower matters. but requires expertise on the health aspects as well. Instead of combining legislative. enforcement and judicial functions. the legislation should recognize the essential differences involved and separate them. A National Occupational Safety and Health Board. an independent agency should determine and promulgate appropriate safety rules. This Board. which would consist of five members chosen on the basis of their training and experience. would be better able to determine the safety needs of the various industries. Such a Board would improve the quality of the rules and relieve the Secretary of this duty to both make rules and enforce them. It would greatly improve the bill. Instead of violating due process of law. the legislation should explicitly recognize its requirements. Under the committee bill. as I have said. the Secretary makes the rules. investigates and prosecutes violations. and is the judge. I believe that these contradictory duties should be changed. An elementary concept demands that these functions be separated. In addition to relieving the Secertary of his rulemaking duties. we should likewise vest the quasijudicial functions in a separate. an independent agency. The amendment of the Senator from New York. No. 1061. which the Senate adopted today. will accomplish this by creating a separate board of appeals to hear contested cases. This amendment. which I supported. is similar to the provision of the administration substitute. and its adoption substantially improves this legislation. Mr. President. I said earlier that we desperately need legislation in this area and I hold to that conclusion. The bill. as amended. is now a more acceptable and workable piece of legislation. It is my hope that additional amendment. and revision will occur to make it the really effective and useful instrument it can truly be."},{"1":"9.101026e+08","2":"1969","3":"H","4":"EDWARDS","5":"988","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. those of us. who are in the words of our Vice President. an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals. have. I believe a duty to report to this House and the Nation on the recent Vietnam moratorium. I can claim no role in organizing this massive demonstration in favor of peace in Vietnam. but I have been a critic of the war in Vietnam for some time. If there are. to use again Mr. AGNEWs words hardcore dissidents among the protestors. I must be included in that group at least in the case of the Vietnam war. However. I welcome the Vice Presidents remarks for I believe they put that recent demonstration of unity against the war in its proper perspectivea perspective of truth versus a false image. Those of us who took part in that demonstration know the truth. those who watched the demonstrations on television or read about them in the newspapers know the truth. Mr. AGNEW warned of wilder. more violent antiwar demonstrations. but I ask Mr. AGNEW what wildness and what violence? There was neither in the demonstrations in which I took part. Violence and wildness were absent across the Nation. Mr. AGNEW. or his speech writers. were looking through a flawed glass darkly and failed to see the truth shine through. I would hope that the Vice President will not demean further his high office by name calling. or by half truths. or lack of truth in his statements. All of us have the right to question the views of others. to debate the issues. but we do not. I believe. have the right to turn debate into personal attacks. or into hair pulling political screaming matches. Let us speak our views. but respect the right of others to disagree. In this respect I would like to report what I saw during the Vietnam moratorium. and I hope my vision is a little more clear than that of the Vice President. I saw thousands of people. young. old. middle aged including the socalled forgotten American. making known through the right of assembly and of free speech his and her views in opposition to the Vietnam war. I saw them use these rights peacefully and effectively. I saw the students. much damned these days. put their hearts and souls into this effort to bring peace to Vietnam and to bring our soldiers home. It was raining in California on moratorium day. a heavy rain of the kind the chamber of commerce likes to ignore. Even so. 4.000 Stanford University students sat in that downpour and listened to a parade of speakers. Earlier 1.300 students and 1.200 citizens rang 100.000 doorbells and handed out leaflets to residents of Palo Alto. Atherton. Menlo Park. Sunnyvale. Mountain View. and Los Altos. One hundred students rode Southern Pacific commuter trains passing out leaflets and talking to riders. In San Jose thousands of students participated in ceremonies at San Jose State College and Foothill and West Valley Colleges. Hundreds joined in at the University of Santa Clara. I looked at those faces as they listened. and they were not all students. Businessmen. government workers. bluecollar employees. housewives. and senior citizens were all represented. One could not classify these men and women. except to say they represented all of America. My speech was directed to the students and in addressing them I commented: John F. Kennedy told us the torch had been passed to a new generation. Today I join him in passing that torch to you. In a few short years those of you who are under 30 will make up the majority not the minority. in this nation. Some fear you. I am not one of them. You bring me hope. hope for a world far better than my generation has been able to create. I repeat those words now. for they express my view not. only of the Etudents. but of all of those who joined in the Vietnam moratorium. We should not fear citizen participation in the great debates of todays world. We should welcome them. In this respect I welcome the Vice Presidents words and views. identical I presume with the views. if not the words of the President. They clearly define the lines of the debate and the intentions of the administration. As in the days of old the President will take the high road. the Vice President the low road. but both roads go in the same direction. I would go in another direction. And in the end I pray that we will be joined by the President and the Vice President. not because peace in Vietnam is the overriding will of the people. but because it is right. But for those who are interested in response to the Vietnam moratorium. to the will of the people. I would like to share Mondays mail. We received 235 letters on the moratorium Monday morning. Of those letters. 232 were in favor of the moratorium. To be fair. I also should include one editorial against the moratorium in the San Jose Mercury. I believe. however. the letters indicate the feeling in my congressional district. perhaps weighted to the promoratorium side. but certainly in favor of our ending our involvement in the Vietnam vwar. I believe the polls can be read in the same way. The division in this country today is not over peace in Vietnam. but on how to end American involvement in that war. It has to be ended. Let us look again at the moratorium. It represents the brighter side of our Republic. It represents the people of this Nation asking for a redress of grievances. It represents our strivings for peace. and it announces our unity. There will be an end to the Vietnam war. and it will come in part because of the efforts of those of us who participated in the moratorium. We all pray for that day of peace."},{"1":"9.002095e+08","2":"1968","3":"S","4":"FANNIN","5":"953","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. since Monday morning representatives of companies and unions involved in the 8month copper industry dispute have been meeting at the White House. There has been no appreciable progress. at least to those of us not directly involved in the talks. This is a sad situation and it cannot continue. The suffering is too great. the costs are too high. and the penalties exacted from those least able to bear them are insurmountable. Mr. President. I have deliberately remained silent after the President intervened in this matter. to give the administration an opportunity to achieve a just settlement. fair to both sides. But the time has come to speak out again. because the administration is stalling. The executive branch is not doing everything it can to seek a settlement. I fear the President has been intimidated by the threats of arrogant union leaders. Let me cite an example: A story in the Baltimore Sun of February 29 says in part: The chief union negotiator in the nationwide copper strike threatened the Johnson Administration last night with the loss of labor support in the November elections. Joseph P. Molony. vice president of the United Steelworkers of America. told some 500 striking copper workers here if our friends in Washington are neutral in the strike then Ill be neutral next November. Remember. he told the strikers. the hottest corner in hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of crisis. Can one imagine the outcry that would go up if a spokesman for management spoke to the President in those terms. The roar would be deafening and the demand for an adequate rebuke for the offender would rise from the Congress. from editorial writers. TV and radio commentators. the pulpitsfrom every source with voices to be heard. But little attention is paid to the tongue lashing which a vice president of a labor union gives the President himself. Instead. as if Mr. Molony had pressed a button. comes forth the announcement from the White House that a roundtheclock bargaining session on copper will begin. The spokesmen for big labor have tremendous political power. which the Congress and Government have given them. I hope. Mr. President. that the abusive and corrosive language heaped upon the President of this great Nation by the unions chief negotiator is not responsible for the present impasse that apparently exists in the copper talks. But whatever the facts of that situation may be there is another matter which has already occupied the attention of this body. and particularly of the distinguished majority leader and myself. Just to briefly recite the facts of this case. Kennecott Copper Co.. one of the four major producers involved in this dispute. filed a charge with NLRB on October 18. 1967. This action specifically charged the steelworkers and other unions with insisting on nonmandatory conditions of bargaining and thus committing an unfair labor practice by refusing to bargain. I received information that the NLRBs general counsel had decided to file a complaint against the union. after some 4 months of studying the case. and hopefully this would open the way for some kind of bargaining to resume. Regretfully. I must inform the Senate that apparently this has not been done. An additional 10 days have elapsed and all the information I have indicates that the NLRB is still dragging its feet and no complaint has been filed. Of course I can understand why the unions do not want a complaint to be filed. because CXIV---371Part 5 under the TaftHartley Act when a complaint has been filed a temporary restraining order may be issued and the offending parties. in this instance the unions. can be held in contempt of court if they continue to insist on a nonmandatory condition of bargaining. I say I can understand the position. Mr. President. but I cannot understand the failure of. this administration simply to insist that the law be enforced. The President can insist on enforcement. and he should do ittoday. May I say that I am increasingly concerned that the White House manages to get involved in practically every important labor dispute. Then when the chips are down the union leadership. feeling that the President will ultimately come to their aid and bail them out. insists on higher and higher wage settlements that lead to higher and higher prices. This process is not the free and uncoerced bargaining that we are trying to protect in this country. And I may point out that it will ultimately be as detrimental to the labor movement as it appears presently to be to management. Someone has described inflation as. That empty feeling when you reach in your pocket to pay your bills. Mr. President. I think each Member of the Senate should realize that their constituents are going to be affected by the settlement that must come in this basic industry soon. Everyone who buys an automobile. everyone who buys a refrigerator. an air conditioner. a toaster. an electric iron. anything utilizing an electric motor. will find that all these products cost more. We have suffered a fantastic cost in our balance of payments. a tremendous problem with tax revenues. and the economic hardships imposed upon families is incalculable. It is past the time that this administration faced up to the hard choice with which it is confronted and uses every legal means to achieve a settlement for the good of all the people. consumers. workers. and producers. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that a series of three articles appearing in the Arizona Republic detailing the situation in the copperproducing States. a labor column by Mr. Victor Riesel. and a special report from CBSTV on copper. be printed at this point in the RECORD."},{"1":"9.001356e+08","2":"1967","3":"H","4":"UDALL","5":"266","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Chairman. this bill is a longoverdue step in my judgment to protect the American consumer and particularly to protect the older people of this country.

Each agency considers the wage board program it administers to be proper and that other Government agencies should consider adjusting their practices to meet its particular system. Further. it is evident that the creation of a uniform wage board program. governmentwide. to insure that all employees are properly compensated based upon prevailing rates for the work that they are performing. regardless of agency. can only be accomplished through the legislative process. Using the Classification Act of 1949. as an analogy. the Government has recognized that white collar workers have assurance of uniformity and consistency in their wage rates because of enactment of the bill. Further. under the Classification Act General Schedule employees also receive additional stepincreases because of longevity of service in a given position and grade level. This. however. is not afforded a substantial number of employees identified as the blue collar workers. We believe that such inequity should be rectified at the earliest possible date. The proposed bill would eliminate many of the current inequities now practiced by the various Government departments and agencies. Further. it would insure uniformity in the treatment of all Government employees with respect to the adequate pay rates for their work and would eliminate substantially all if not all of the discrepancies now being followed in the administration of the wage board program by the Government departments and agencies. Some of the key features of the proposed bill are as follows: It will provide for a uniform night differential of 10 percent above the day rate for wage board personnel identical to that now followed for Classification Act personnel. The present practice followed by the agencies ranges from a pay adjustment of 3 to 4 cents per hour to a 10 percent of the wage rate for night work by one agency. It will reduce the number of wage board survey areas now being utilized under the different systems in use. It will also insure that wage survey areas are extended to include a major metropolitan area within the wage survey area to insure that there is adequate coverage of comparable work. thus insuring the proper pay rate for Government workers to that established in the private sector. Under the present system. geographical areas are changed at the discretion of individual departments and does not always reflect comparability of work and pay rates. This bill will provide the various employee organizations equal representation in the development and administration of the wage board program. This no doubt will nullify If not completely reduce the large number of complaints about inequities of pay rates. the lack of representation. or participation from the local level to the national level as stated by these organizations. The present system only permits employee organizations to make suggestions and recommendations which can be accepted or disregarded at will of the local wage committees and their respective departments. The bill will Insure the development of uniform position classification standards. governmentwlde. and will insure that the application of such standards. regardless of department. is being followed. This is considered absolutely essential. otherwise classification standards as now developed are not consistent and are not comparable across department lines. Further. departments now follow a practice of adjusting classification standards for their own respective department without considering the impact on other classification standards administered by different departments. These changes frequently lead to differences in grade levels for comparable positions between departments and correspondingly reflect differences in rates of pay for the same class of work. This bill will insure uniformity In the rates of pay authorized for specific positions where the same class of work is being performed in a given locale regardless of department or agency. There is no uniformity or consistency in the current system of wage board administration between the several government departments. If we are to follow the principle of equal pay for equal work it is mandatory to uniformity of pay rates across government department lines be followed. This is only possible through enactment of this bill. There are a number of existing examples whereby the same position involving substantially the same duties and responsibilities is now allocated at different grade levels ranging to three or four grades depending upon the particular department or agency administering its program. This leads to inequity in pay and extreme difficulty in any attempt to resolve such discrepancies because each department at present is insisting that its program is correct and should be strictly followed."},{"1":"8.900088e+08","2":"1965","3":"H","4":"DOWDY","5":"526","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. the purpose of this bill. H.R. 1007. is to stop a practice which has developed in relation to the use of garnishment laws in a way which enables a creditor to do indirectly what he is not permitted to do directly in his own jurisdiction. This practice involves the filing in the District of Columbia of an action for garnishment against an employer who also has a business in Maryland so as to secure payment by attachment of wages from an employee who is not a resident of the District. The object of such practice is to escape the limitations in States outside the District. regarding exemptions from garnishment in favor of employees. This bill is designed to assure that where an action in such a case is brought in the District of Columbia. the nonresident defendant involved will be entitled to the same exemptions as are provided by law in the State in which the said defendant may reside. Maryland law. for example. provides for an exemption from attachment of wages and salaries in the amount of $100 for each pay period. In a month. or 41/3 weeks. this exemption would aggregate $433. Your committee has been informed that some persons in the debt collection business have found that the District of Columbia garnishment law provides a lower exemption. namely. 90 percent of the first $200 per month of wages. 80 percent of the next $300 per month. and 50 percent of all above $500 per month. In the case of a worker earning a wage of $100 per week. or $433 per month. therefore. an employees entire salary would be exempt from attachment in Maryland. but in the District of Columbia only $366.40 per month would be exempt. leaving $66.60 per month subject to garnishment. Accordingly. your committee. in hearings. was advised that Baltimore creditors. with claims against employees living and working in Baltimore. have in several instances determined that the employers also have places of business in the District of Columbia and hence are subject to service of garnishment or attachment process in the District. and accordingly have brought their claims to Washington and filed suits here. laying an attachment against the wages of the employee debtor in the hands of the employer. thus escaping the exemption from attachment provided by Maryland laws. This same procedure could conceivably be adopted by collection agencies from any State if the employer maintains a place of business in the District. so that he would be subject to the service of garnishment process here. This committee is of the opinion that it was never intended that District of Columbia law should serve as a collection medium against employees who live elsewhere. work elsewhere. and may even never have been In the District of Columbia. This bill is Intended to so amend the District of Columbia law as to terminate this practice by granting to nonresidents of the District the exemptions from garnishment and attachment of wages afforded by their local State laws. This bill is identical to H.R. 7882 of the 88th Congress. which was amended to meet with suggestions made by the District of Columbia Board of Commissioners and which passed the House on October 14. 1963H.R. 836."},{"1":"8.802578e+08","2":"1964","3":"H","4":"McINTIRE","5":"212","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Chairman.

I introduce. for myself and Senators KUCHEL. METCALF. and ENGLE. a proposed Water Resources Planning Act and request that it lie on the desk for 3 days to permit any Senators who desire to do so to cosponsor it. There is already pending S. 2. a water resources research bill. This bill. which deals with river basin planning. should not be confused with the research measure. The original draft of the bill I now introduce was sent to Congress by President Kennedy on July 13. 1961. On the following day it was introduced and became S. 2246 of the 87th Congress. On July 26. and again on August 16. 1961. the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the Committee on Public Works held joint hearings on the Presidents proposal. At that time. the Interstate Conference on Water Problems of the Council of State Governments had not completed a survey of State views on the proposed planning bill. The Interior and Insular Affairs Committee consequently held a further hearing on the message on March 2. 1962. The interstate conference then presented an extensive redraft of the proposed legis!ation. Some felt that the revisions would amount to a surrender of Federal prerogatives in the water field. to which there was considerable objection. Some members despaired of ever being able to reconcile State and Federal views and achieving comprehensive planning of the Nations major river basins by the Federal Government and the States. I hope that this is now on the way to being done. The bill was originally proposed by President Kennedy in response to recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on National Water Resources: The first recommendation of the select committee read: 1. The Federal Government. in cooperation with the States. should prepare and keep up to date plans for comprehensive water development and management for all major river basins of the United States. Such plans should take Into account the prospective demands for all purposes served through water development giving full recognition to nonrevenueyielding purposes such as streamflow regulation. outdoor recreation. and preservation and propagation of fish and wildlife. and keeping in mind the ultimate need for optimum development of all water resources. All practicable means of meeting demands should be considered. The executive branch is requested to submit plans to the Congress in January 1962. for undertaking and completing such studies In all basins by 1970. Once prepared. the reports should be brought up to date periodically. Reports on individual projects submitted to the Congress for authorization should specify how the project fits into the comprehensive longrange program. and the range of alternative purposes that might be served by the resources needed for the recommended projects. The second recommendation of the select committee was for a 10year program of aid to States to stimulate more active participation by the States in planning. development. and management of our water resources. A minimum program of $5 million annually in grants to the States for 10 yearsthe funds to be matched by the Stateswas recommended. The fourth recommendation of the select committee was for preparation of a biennial assessment of the water supplydemand outlook for each of the water resource regions of the Nation. The executive branch was requested to submit the first such report during January 1963. The Presidents water resources planning proposal was designed to meet all three of the recommendations I have summarized. Title I of the bill authorized the establishment of a Federal Water Resources Council composed of the Secretaries of Interior. Agriculture. Army. and Health. Education. and Welfare. It is to be the Councils functions to coordinate Federal river basin planning operations and to prepare the biennial supplydemand assessment. as well as to review basin plans when completed. CIX273 Title II of the Presidents bill was a proposal to authorize him to establish river basin planning commissions which would include representatives of affected States appointed by the President. Governors were extended the privilege of nominating persons for appointment as State representatives. The bill was and is a nonpartisan proposal. To illustrate this fact. I point out that this title. title II. recommended to the Congress by President Kennedy. was first transmitted to us as a separate bill by the Eisenhower administration on Januay 16. 1961. In his last budget message to the Congress. President Eisenhower discussed the need for coordinated planning of water resources to assure optimum development. Subsequently. on January 16. 1961. the Director of the Bureau of the Budget. then Mr. Maurice H. Stans. transmitted to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House. a draft bill to implement President Eisenhowers recommendation by authorizing Presidential establishment of the river basin planning commissions. It was that draft bill which subsequently became title II of President Kennedys bill. Title III of President Kennedys water resources planning measure provided for the 10 year. $5 million matching fund for water resources planning by the States which the Select Committee on National Water Resources recommended. The title is essentially identical to measures which both the late Senator Robert S. Kerr and I introduced in the 87th Congress. President Kennedy continues to urge the enactment of legislation to achieve optimum river basin planning and development. In his budget message in January. the President said: Major emphasis Is being given within the Federal Government to coordinated planning of river basin development and research on water resources. In addition. legislation Is again recommended to provide for comprehensive and coordinated water resources planning by Federal and State agencies and to authorize limited grants to strengthen State planning. There has been little or no opposition to titles I and III of the Presidents bill. providing for the establishment of a Federal Water Resources Council composed of four Secretaries whose departments have major water resource programs. and authorizing State aid. They have been little changed in the revision I have just introduced. Opposition to the other title of the bill. title II. has been directed at the nature and mechanics for establishing the individual river basin planning commissions rather than at the basic idea of creating commissions or getting at the planning job. The President proposed. as his predecessor had proposed. that the commissions be established and appointed by the Federal Chief Executive when one or more States in a basin requested the establishment of a commission. The States objected. among other things. to establishment of a river basin planning commission at the request of only one State. they contended that twothirds of the States involved should participate in any such request before a commission could be established. The States objected also to appointment of the States representatives on the commissions by the President. and the consequent Federal nature of the commissions. they insisted on the right to appoint their own representatives who would have no master but the State that each represented. The States also sought language which would recognize their primary interest in water resources. The matter of State versus Federal rights in water resources is a dispute nearly as old as our Nation itself. It is still unsettled. States and the Federal Government have argued about it. carried lawsuits to the Supreme Court about it. and made it an issue in political campaigns. Few Congresses in recent decades have failed to have hearings on bills proposing a settlement. None has been enacted. During the hearings on the Presidents planning bill last year. I challenged one of the witnesses to name an instance where this longstanding dispute has actually held up a water project. The instance is yet to be cited. At my direction. a revision of the Water Resources Planning Act has been worked out with the representatives of the Interstate Conference on Water Problems of the Council of State Governments which is intended to preserve the status quo in regard to water rights. to let the debate over State versus Federal rights proceed without any disturbance whatsoever. but at the same time to let State and Federal planners proceed to work out together muchneeded. comprehensive development plans. The revision. which is the bill I have just introduced. proceeds on the basis of two fundamentals. stated in the bill. First. that nothing in the act is to be construed as either expanding or diminishing either Federal or State jurisdiction. responsibilities or rights in respect to water. Second. it is recognized that in any instance where necessary agreement cannot be reached on the establishment of a river basin planning commission under the provisions of the act. the Federal Government may. if it considers such planning needed. proceed itself by any of the conventional. alternative methods now followed. or in a new and proper way. to plan for the development of a river which is of Federal concern. Similarly. if a FederalState commission set up under the provisions of the bill should disagree and be unable to report a development plan. other means of planning could be substituted. As revised. the bill provides that a river basin planning commission may be established by the President when the Federal Water Resources Council and onehalf the States involved agree to it. The President will appoint a chairman. Representatives will be appointed by Federal agencies concerned. The American section of any international commission which may be involved will also have a representative. The States will appoint their own representatives to the commissions. Any interstate compact compact commission involved may name its own representative. To assure that neither Federal nor States rights will be overridden in the planning. the revised bill provides that there shall be two and only two votes in each commission. The chairman. appointed by the President. will cast one vote for the Federal agencies. The vice chairman. elected by the State representatives. will cast one vote at the instruction of the States. Planning thus must be either by agreement or by the presentation of alternative plans to the President and Congress. and to the States involved. Planning decisions will not become a matter of whether the Federal Government or the States have the most representatives on a particular commission. It will be by agreement. or the final decision will be referred to the governments involved. If a commission is entirely unable to agree on a plan. then another means of planning will have to be substituted. To those of us in political life. where issues are all finally settled by vote. this arrangement for equal FederalState voting may appear impractical. Stalemates are not impossible. But they are not likely. for the planning process is one of arriving at a consensus based on factsof devising engineering works and management plans for water which will yield the greatest benefits to the area involved. If studies are done thoroughly. then the facts make the decisionsnot philosophical points of view. Both the differing nature of the planning process from the political process. and our experiences with planning commissions in the past. are assurance that stalemates will be rare and. if they occur. the alternatives can be submitted in the final report of a commission and the choice can be made by the Congress and the States involved. The commissions will be entities of themselvesnot Federal commissions or State commissions. but FederalState partnerships with Individual identity much as Interstate Compact Commissions are entities in their own right. Copy of the draft of the bill has been submitted to the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations. chaired by Mr. Frank Bane and including Senators MUNDT. ERVIN. and MUSKIE from this body. for it could become a significant new pattern for FederalState relationships in more than the water resources planning field. A report on the proposal is expected from that Commission. Observers for the executive branch of the Government have been present at all meetings between the committee staff and representatives of the State governments. The measure as revised will now be sent to the executive agencies for their review and recommendations. There will be further hearings. Doubtless we will have suggestions for further revision. and suggestions to restore the original Federal nature of the commissions. To the extremists in the StateFederal water rights issue. who would prefer to waste our water resources than to concede a drop of authority or jurisdiction to their antagonist. I would like to say they are hopelessly behind the times. The Federal Government has responsibilities and authorities in the water field. and so do the States. And we cannot do comprehensive water resources planning without involving both State and Federal prerogatives. Water within a river basin cannot be separated into State water and Federal water which are planned separately. I have not heard it contended yet that States cannot regulate withdrawals of ground water under nonFederal lands within their borders. It is admitted that in many watershort areas of the Nation we must have conjunctive surface water and ground water management if we are to have comprehensive management for optimum benefits. Translated into political terms. that means we are also going to have to have conjunctive FederalState planning and management of water resources. or we will fall far short of the optimum benefit goals that we seek. Here in the Congress of the United States we legislate in very much the same fashion as is proposed in the new. revised river basin planning commissions. The House and the Senate either agree on legislation. or there is no legislation. As total entities. the House of Representatives has one voice and the Senate has one voice in this Congress. Sometimes we fume considerably about it. but almost every year we pass necessary appropriations and get the other essential legislation passed. In my judgment. the FederalState water commissions. realizing the necessity for water planning. also will get the job done. Their task will be much more of an engineering nature. with fewer philosophical and political issues to resolve. than the decisions we manage to make regularly between the House and Senate. There is assurance that State governments will vigorously support the measure as revised. The Interstate Conference on Water Problems of the Council of State Governments. meeting in Chicago in December. approved the nearlycompleted work of the consulting group and directed their representatives to continue * * * their work aiming toward passage of a bill. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have the full text of the conference resolution printed in the RECORD at this point."},{"1":"8.701645e+08","2":"1962","3":"H","4":"CURTIS","5":"90","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"The gentleman is correct.

In this respect it is thus a great improvement over the limited number of areas which would have benefited under the original bill considered by the Senate last year. This bill is also a great improvement in terms of the formula under which funds would be supplied to New York State. Whereas most Federal programs are rigged in such a way as to give my State very much the short end of the stick. this bill provides a much more equitable means of apportioning funds. it gives my State a much better break than usual. Mr. President. we are enjoying the greatest prosperity in our history. Every index of economic activity is up. Employment is up. It does remain a fact that there are certain areas where there are pockets of unemployment. pockets of poverty. in this country. I believe it to be a legitimate and necessary function of government and a matter of both local and national concern if there is any single man or woman who wants a jobwho is ready. able. and willing to workwho cannot find employment. I feel strongly that we should act to provide needed relief to these critical areas of our country. I have toured through my own State in some of these areas and have witnessed at first hand the need for assistance. which is very real and very pressing. The most significant and fundamental problem which arises is the human suffering which results from having large numbers of persons out of work in limited areas of chronic economic difficulty. The dignity and. in fact. the physical wellbeing of the affected workers and their families are the real test of the need for this proposed legislation. In a related sense. Mr. President. this measure is sound because it does not in any way contemplate that affected areas should become wards of the Federal Government. I could not for a moment dream of such an arrangement. nor would the communities involved. We need above all to get these areas over the humpto give them the technical assistance and loanable funds which will enable them to revitalize and revive their ailing economies. It is clearly both preferable and more economical to provide helpful loans than it is to pass out public relief checks in these depressed areas. Of course. this bill is no panacea. It merely provides for a little wherewithal by means of which these areas can and should be better able to help themselves. It also contains protections against the pirating of industries between States. This is very important and is another reason why this legislation is a very definite improvement over the original bill submitted to us for action. Mr. President. the doctor has been diagnosing the disease for many months. He has a pretty good idea as to the type of medicine which will help. But he knows that the real and longrun cure depends in the final analysis upon the spirit and desire of the patient. I believe the measure before us represents a proper vehicle for promoting the economic wellbeing this Nation needs. It represents a way to do it in line with the proper diagnoses which have been made. This measure is a moderate but substantial means for the Federal Government to live up to its national responsibilities to eliminate those pockets of unemployment where joblessness has become chronic and depressing. It is not a budgetbusting measure. It does meet the human and economic realities of this problem. I regret we are going through the motions through which we are going. I see no great purpose to be served by this. because it is obvious there are not sufficient votes to override the veto. For this reason. I am far more concerned about further action on legislation in this field this year than I am about todays vote. I hope the relevant committees of Congress will now get down to work. taking the administrations new bill as the basis for action. What we need Is a sound and effective measure that can be passed. that will be signed into law. and that will go into effect very shortly to help these tragic areas of chronic unemployment."},{"1":"8.601326e+08","2":"1959","3":"H","4":"LANE","5":"992","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I. too. want to join my colleagues here this afternoon in extending congratulations to the gentleman from Massachusetts for bringing this very. very important subject matter to the attention of the Congress. I personally know that it is a matter that he has been interested in for some period of time. I realize that day after day he has worked untiringly and unceasingly on this matter here in the Halls of Congress and with the various agencies of Government to see whether or not he could do something to bring about some relief to these employees. As I understand it. Mr. Speaker. there are 17.000 of these skilled craftsmen employed along our Atlantic seaboard. and the greater part of themnumbering 11.000 or thereaboutsare employed in the district so well represented by the gentleman from Massachusetts who is speaking from the well of the House. There are about 11.000 craftsmen who are specialists in all fields and in many particular lines of work or occupations. Men. no doubt. who have given their all to the service of the Bethlehem shipyard all these years. I know full well they are the best that can be hired because of the fact they have been in the employ of this giant corporation all these years. I am satisfied that with their efficiency program and whatnot. if they did not render valuable service to their employers they would have long ago lost their employment and their work and labor with Bethlehem Steel. But I know also. Mr. Speaker. that these same men not only contributed these skills down through these later years. but they were the ones who contributed so much toward the winning of World War II and the Korean conflict when we sought their services for the defense of our country during World War II and the Korean conflict. There are 11.000 of them who no doubt are interested in the Bethlehem Steel Co.. having been employed all these years. whose families are interested in this particular corporation. It is a sad thing to know now. Mr. Speaker. that through information coming to us through the gentleman from Massachusetts in the well of the House. our colleague. that the company has refused to renew the contract that expired on July 31 of this year. True enough. they are willing to come to some terms. and those terms. as were so well stated by a previous speaker. are unreasonable. uncertain. and unjust. They ask these employees to waive their seniority. whether it is 25. 30. or 35 years of valuable service to that company. I say it is unfair and unjust. After all. we in the Congress believe in seniority and practice it among ourselves and our employees. The seniority rule obtains in our committees. Seniority is something that is historical in this country. and we all know it has been in vogue in these corporations. I doubt if any competitor corporations of Bethelem have seen fit to ask their employees or their union members to waive seniority rights. Not only does Bethlehem Steel wish them to waive their seniority rights. but as I am informed by the gentleman. they also want craftsmen to waive their particular type of work so that an expert skilled machinist could be put on as a laborer or put on as an elevator operator. That to me means a reduction in salary. reduction in wages. That means to me that a skilled workman is going to lose face. he is going to be put on something unskilled and be paid unskilled wages rather than those he has been entitled to and enjoyed all these years. That is discouragement. of course. to an employee. I know the gentleman is aware that the House Committee on Armed Services of the Congressand I see two of our able colleagues of that committee here now. the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. RivzRsl and the gentleman from Massachusetts . Both of long standing on this very important committee of Congress. in 1954 had a subcommittee that investigated a like subject matter. That committee brought about favorable results to both management and labor. I suppose the gentleman from Massachusetts who is leading the fight on this very. very important subject matter that is so acute should have immediate action. It is hopeful that perhaps again if no other committee here in the Congress takes action that this Committee on Armed Services will have a subcommittee look into this controversy and bring about favorable results as the previous investigation did in 1954. So I just want to say in conclusion that I heartily agree with my colleague from Massachusetts and compliment and congratulate him again. This is a very. very important subject matter. These men are now working under duress and under compulsion. They are refused a contract. They are asked to take demotions. They are ordered to take reductions in salary because management says they must do so in order to meet competition. I do not know of any other concern that is competing with them. that is carrying out such a program with their personnel. But I do say that Bethlehem SteelBethlehem Shipbuilding Corp.. ratherowes something to the people. After all. throughout the years since World War II we in the Congress here have appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars for defense. a goodly part of which has gone to the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp. Of course. it inured to the benefit of the employees. it inured to management. it inured to the benefit of those who invested their money in the company. and that is as it should be. But again I express the hope that something can and should be done forthwith that will be beneficial not only to management but also beneficial to the employees so they can carry on in the way to which they have been accustomed all these years. Again I wish to compliment and congratulate the gentleman again for his able presentation of this situation to the Congress."},{"1":"8.502260e+08","2":"1958","3":"S","4":"COOPER","5":"517","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I thank the Senator. I have had some experience with this matter. In 1947 and 1948 I was a Member of the Senate when it passed the TaftHartley Act. I voted for it. In 11953 and 1954. I was a member of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare after the death of Senator Taft. The committee considered amendments to the TaftHartley Act. The amendments were reported to the Senate and were promptly recommitted. But the atmosphere has changed somewhat. .Mr. George Meany. a very outstanding labor leader and statesman. was before the committee. and in response to questions directed to him by the Senator from New York and myself he said it is now the position of the AFLCIO that they do not favor the repeal of the TaftHartley Act. but they now take the position. which many of us have held for a long time. that the question is one of revision. I was glad to hear Mr. Meany make that statement. Based on the experience I have had in the committee. it has become evident that it is not possible to have legislation enacted unless there is some agreement. some effort from both sides of the body. I pay tribute to the senior Senator from California [Mr. KNOWLANDI. While I voted against his amendments when we were considering the welfare and pension bill because I believed hearings should be held. I doubt if we would have this labor bill before us today if it had not been for the fact that the Senator from California had offered amendments to the welfare and pension bill. and was able to secure the commitment that a labor bill would be reported and voted on. I would say also that the Senator from Massachusetts . has discharged his duty faithfully. honestly. and fairly in the committee. and further. he has brought great knowledge and courage to the difficult issues involved. I believe now that sections 1. 2. 3. and 4 which deal with union democracy. are adequate. are good sections. We have gone far toward making an advance in that field. I do not take a rigid position. I do not say I will not vote for any amendment. But my desire and my intention are to consider amendments which deal with the subject of union democracy. I do not intend to vote for certain amendments. even though some of them. standing by themselves. are justified. because I believe that ii we go far. beyond the field of union democracy. we will have a bill which will not pass. and nothing will be done. An advance was made this year in the enactment of the welfare and pension fund bill through the efforts of the Senator from New York [Mr. IvrEs] and the Senator from Massachusetts . We now have the opportunity to assist the unions. union employees. protect union funds. and to encourage advances in the field of union democracy to see this done. Speaking for myself. I do not intend to do a futile thing. destroy the chance to make an advance by voting for amendments about which we cannot agree at this session of Congress."},{"1":"8.500089e+08","2":"1957","3":"S","4":"ELLENDER","5":"1260","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I thank the Senator for his observations. Despite the recent boasts of Russian leaders. the Soviet Union is having extreme difficulty in producing sufficient foodstuffs to properly feed its people. Russian dietary standards are far below our own. The majority of Russian people with whom I spokeand this includes Russian men on the streetwere plump and heavyset and apparently relied almost entirely upon starchy foods for nourishment. Grain. potatoes. root crops. such as turnips. beets and radishes. form the bulk of their diet. Fats and oils come principally from sunflower seed and cottonseed. Meat is scarce and very expensive. For the past 2 or 3 years. Russian leadership has been engaged in opening new lands in the south central part of the U. S. S. R. to agriculture. Settlers are encouraged to go there and farm. The area is semiarid and the soil is held together by a layer of virgin grasses. About 60 million acres have been put to the plow and more is being plowed. One grain crop of consequence can be grown every 4 or 5 years. This year a banner crop was produced. I predict that after the land is plowed for 3 or 4 successive years. it will blow away and create a dust bowl that will make our own look insignificant. There is quite a stretch of land at the base of the Caucasus Mountains that is irrigated by water that comes down mountain streams which are fed from melting snows. Cotton. fruit. some vegetables. watermelons. and cantaloups are grown in abundance. Between seven and eight million bales of cotton are produced annually. The Kuban areacomparatively new lands. located between the Caspian and Black Seasis very fertile. The rainfall is about 25 to 28 inches. One is reminded of Iowa. Illinois. and Indiana lands. It is my belief that much corn and livestock could be produced here under proper guidance. It could be made to rival some of our own areas. These developments. coupled with a more efficient use of the manpower available to the Soviet Union. plus an increased availability of modern farming equipment. could result in vast increases in Russian agricultural production. The Soviet. however. will continue to be plagued by a relatively short growing season. and climatic conditions which preclude the largescale production of what we have come to regard as basic agricultural staples. I was disappointed not to find a wider variety of crops grown in the Ukraine. That oncefertile area is deteriorating. Only onefifth of the land lies fallow each year. I saw many fields with weeds as thick as the planted grain. Russian agriculture suffers tremendously from the concentration of produc. tion in either collective or state farms. Many of the Russian farmers have no desire to increase production or become more efficient. since they have lost their identity as individual entrepreneurs. The old saying. Whats everybodys business is nobodys business can be successfully applied to the collective farms. As to Russian Industry. I saw some modern processes. such as a most unique shoe production line. along with great evidence of expansion. but for the most part. Russian industry seems to be crude and backward when compared with our own. I saw only five different models of passenger cars. two models of passenger buses. one for short and the other long haul. two models of refrigerators. one standard model of trucks. I do not desire to leave the impression that this status may long remain. for great efforts are being made to modernize Russian industry. and to expand production. particularly in the area of heavy industry. Dams. both for navigation and power gcneration. are being constructed. More factories are rising. The industrial base is being widened. and within the next 5 to 10 years. Russia will undoubtedly become a mighty industrial power. That will come about by the increasing demand for more and more consumer goods. I was much impressed with hydroelectric power development in Russia. particularly on the Volga River. At Stalingrad. 21 turbines will be constructed to produce 2.350.000 kilowatthours per hour. Eight power facilities will be built on that great river which will produce. I was told. 65 billion kilowatthours per year. Two rivers that now flow into the Arctic Ocean will be directed to the Volga so as to increase its capacity. I visited a huge electrical manufacturing plant in Kharkov. I saw under construction a turbine that was larger in diameter than any I have ever seen in the United States. I doubt that we have sufficient water capacity to engage such a huge turbine economically. I was not in Russia during the school months. However. I did have occasion to talk to Russians in almost all walks of life. The Soviets are placing great emphasis upon educational training. A modified form of merit system is in effect. with students selected for certain training on the basis of ability and aptitude. they attend college at Government expense. subsidies are paid to scholars. particularly in the technological fields and in both theoretical and applied sciences. I was informed. Too. Russian children are being exposed to a universal educational system. In cities of 10.000 and more. from the 1st to the 10th grades is a must and in all other areas. from the 1st to the 7th is compulsory. While the Russian school curriculum is spiced heavily with Communist doctrine. the Soviet leadership has not yet found a way to communize such basic principles as the chemical composition of water or the Pythagorean theorum in geometery. I am firmly convinced that it is the Russian educational system that offers the greatest hope for ultimate Russian freedom. The people are beginning to think for themselves. and as time goes on. it will be more and more difficult for the leaders to keep them in line. I found that. as a whole. the educated Russians I spoke with were extremely curious about our mode of life in the United States. andeven more importantdemonstrated a desire if not a compelling urge to go behind catchy Red slogans. and to do their own thinking. I have no doubt that the Russians of today are better off than they have ever been. Most of them seem satisfied for the reason that they know no better way of life than that which they are now enjoying. Joseph Stalin grew to power In the midst of ignorance and poverty. I am convinced that because of the changed conditions in Russia the people will not permit another despot to assume such powers as those exercised by Stalin. As more Russians become educated. they will become less and less prone to accept at face value the propagandaloaded description of life in the United States which the Red propaganda system dins insistently into their ears. The Russian people are curious by nature. they are becoming increasingly more curious about Americans. about life in America. and about the freedoms we enjoy. During my stay in Russia. I visited the Crimea. where former royal palaces have been turned into worker hotels and resorts. People gathered around me in the street. at the hotels. and on the boardwalks. eager to feel the quality of my clothing. to see the kind of leather from which my shoes were made. and to hear me speakthrough our interpreterof life in America. They were astounded to learn that American workers are not starving in the streets of New York. and that Negroes are not lynched by the hundreds in the deep South. A good many of the questions which were propounded to me were along the propaganda line and came from newspapers such as Izvestia and Pravda."},{"1":"8.401293e+08","2":"1956","3":"H","4":"SISK","5":"345","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Chairman. I come from a portion of California that does not necessarily associate me with either southern California or northern California. since it happens that my home and my district are in almost the geographical center of that great State.

As a member of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and of the Subcommittee on Irrigation and Reclamation that considered this bill over a period of many. many weeks.

The members of the committee who opposed it objected only to sections 5 and 6 and supported sections 1. 2. 3. and 4. Section 1 would restore the maximum spouses benefit under the Railroad Retirement Act to the same level enjoyed by spouses under the social security program. Congress. in 1951. originally intended the two to be equal. but recent changes in social security made this section necessary. -Under this amendment. the two spouses benefits will remain the same without further congressional action. Eightytwo thousand wives now receiving the maximum of $40 a month will receive added benefits of nearly $15 a month. 2.500 other wives will receive smaller increases. as will an estimated 1.500 widows. There is no objection to this section. Section 2 continues the policy adopted by the last session of Congress to eliminate restrictions on benefits payable to those under the railroad retirement program who are also eligible for Social security benefits. In 1953 Congress eliminated this restriction on retirement benefitsthis section will eliminate it on survivors benefits. enabling a survivor to receive full benefit to which he is entitled under both acts. Approximately 5.500 widows and 300 children and parents would receive additional benefits of approximately $20 a month. There is no objection to this section. Sections 3 and 4 are purely technical amendments. Section 3 clarifies the definition of maximum amounts of creditable earnings for survivors benefits calculations. a clarification made necessary by the 1954 social security amendments increasing this figure to $4.200 a year. Section 4 makes it clear that railroad retirement and unemployment benefits are still exempt from Federal or State taxation. garnishment and attachment. a clarification made necessary by an inadvertent oversight in last years new tax law and doubts raised in several States. There are no objections to these two sections. The only parts of this bill about which there is any question whatsoever are sections 5 and 6. These sections provide that all positions in the Railroad Retirement Board to which appointments are governed by sections 10 (b) (4) of the retirement act and 12 (1) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act shall be under civil service protection. without removal or transfer to the schedule A. B. or C categories. where they would be vulnerable to arbitrary removal and political replacement. These two provisions of the bill are the result of certain actions which have occurred since January 1953. which have caused those who participate in the railroad retirement fund and the unemployment compensation fund to fear that there might be appointments to the Board based not on experience or on capability. but on political background. Therefore. for this reason. it is proposed to insure that all members of the Board are given the security to which they are entitled. The question has been raised by some members of the committee concerning the Boards lawyers. inasmuch as. because of a rider on an appropriation bill for the Civil Service Commission. the Commission is prevented from giving lawyers the competitive examinations this bill might require. This has been the practice since about 1942. I do not think the objection is valid. The retirement fund is a special fund. The role of the Government in the administration of the fund is a very special one. It is not analogous to any other fund or agency of the Government. The fund is paid for by the carriers and by the men and women who work for the railroad systems. There is no question of policy involved. no suggestion that merely because a Republican administration should take over. the fund should be administered in a Republican way. or that if a Democratic administration should take over. the fund should be administered in a Democratic way. Rather. it is a purely administrative job which requires special technicians concerned with a single industry. It should be unaffected by changes in administrations. Administrative expenses involved. which amount to approximately $6 million. or less than 1 percent. are all paid for by the carriers and the workers in the system. It seems to me they should not be subjected to the harassment which would inevitably come to them if they felt that certain positions in the Board would be subject to political pressure. This bill would remove that concern from them. As I say. Mr. President. the bill was reported favorably by a majority of the Railroad Retirement Subcommittee and by a majority of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare under the leadership of our beloved chairman. the Senator from Alabama IMr. HILL]. who introduced the bill. along with 28 cosponsors. representing both parties.

Gen. Edward H. Brooks. commanding general. Second Army. at A. P. Hill Military Reservation in Virginia on a hunting lodge. I said it was taxpayers money that is being wasted. The United Press got a story from Fort Meade saying a spokesman of Brooks asserted: There is no hunting lodge at A. P. Hill. There has been no construction work there since the war. Brooks does not own a hunting lodge. He has not spent $27.000 or any taxpayers money on a hunting lodge either for his own use or for the use of other officers or persons. He has a sergeant as driver for his official car which is used only for Government business. Mr. Speaker. when I was informed of this $27.000 of the taxpayers money being wasted. it came through a friend of mine. a boy whom I trust implicitly. I know his reputation for truth and veracity. and. as far as I was concerned. he did not have to be under oath for me to believe him. So I related the information he gave me here on the floor because I thought the American people. the taxpayers. who are suffering from high taxes. should know how General Brooks was wasting their money. The general came back. of course. through a spokesman. and denied it. That afternoon I put in a longdistance call to my friend to verify the facts he told me. He said what he had told me was true. that he had been at the lodge. I cannot mention the boys name. He is still in the Army. He would be railroaded right straight to Korea if I were to mention his name. A case like that happened this morning to a boy I defended in a courtmartial case. He was shipped out of Fort Meade this morning. but he has just 25 days left in the Army. thank goodness. under General Brooks. So not only to verify this boys word and to try to find out the truth of the matter. yesterday morning I got in my car and drove the seventyodd miles down to A. P. Hill to see for myself if there was a hunting lodge there. whether there had been any new construction since the war. whether there was a sargeant or anyone else down there and a house boy taking care of the place. Since General Brooks spokesman said there was no lodge there or that any money had been spent. I wanted to find out. I thought we were entitled to know. Mr. Speaker. when I got to Bowling Green. Va.. I asked a civilian. Where is the officers club here on A. P. Hill Reservation? He said. There is no officers club here. There are only three officers down here. But. he said General Brooks has a private hunting lodge here. and he told me where it was. Then I drove on down the road. and stopped at Crabtrees. who run an Esso service station and a restaurant. I said. Mr. Crabtree. you have been here a long time. Where is the officers club down here? He caid. There is no officers club here. There are but two officers here. but General Brooks has a hunting lodge down here. and he showed me how to find the Generals lodge. I noticed right at the entrance of A. P. Hill a sign. it said. A. P. Hill Military Reservationwelcome. There were no MPs there. I drove on in. I had a taxpayer from my district with me. His name is Ernest Raspberry. from Lewis County. Tenn. Hohenwald is the name of the town. and I guess Ernest is one of the largest taxpayers there. I imagine he pays as much taxes as any man in Lewis County. So. I took him with me. I drove on and I came to a oneway road. winding through the wildernessit was beautiful. I drove about 6 miles from the headquarters. then I spotted a beautiful lake. As I wound on around the little ravines. on top of a hill I saw the most magnificent lodge I had ever seen in my life. Well. I drove on up to the lodge. I heard music inside. I knocked on the door. It was locked. Finally. a sergeant opened the door. He looked at my license tagmy car had the congressional tag onand then let me in. When I got inside. I said. SUTTON is my name. He said. Sergeant Summerfleld is mine. There was a colored private there. I said. What are you doing around here. Sergeant? He said. We are cleaning up the lodge. I said. What do you use this lodge for? Is it an officers club? He said. No. It is for private parties. We had a big one a couple of weeks ago. I said. Sergeant. may I look through? He said. I guess so. I said. When did you come down here? He said. I just got here yesterday. I said. Why did you just come here yesterday? That was the day that I made the statement of the $27.000 being expended there. He said. Well. Sergeant Graves has been the sergeant at the lodge down here. but Saturday night he had a wreck. so I was sent down here to replace him. I went through that lodge. Mr. Speaker. from top to bottom. It has nine bathrooms in it. You can imagine the size of it. Yet there is no hunting lodge down there. I asked the colored boy. How many bedrooms do you have here? About eight? He said. No. sir. I guess we have nine. because we have nine bathrooms. And there was no money spent. no $27.000. or any part of the taxpayers money. according to the spokesman for General Brooks. In the kitchen there were two brand new electric stoves. One of them a Westinghouse. I do not remember what the other one was. There were so many of them down there I could not remember which one was in the kitchen. There were two brand new refrigerators. One of them was a Crosley. the other was an International Harvester. There was new formica all over the tops of the kitchen cabinets. New inlaid linoleum on the barroom floor. I asked Sergeant Summerfield: When were these refrigerators sent here? He said. I brought this International Harvester down from Fort Meade last Thursday. I went on through this lodge. In the dining room there was beautiful walnut furniture. new. No money had been spent. though. I went on upstairs. into the attic. I thought maybe they had moved some of the furniture. I believe they had moved some of the furniture. because upstairs in the attic there were some new beds. rollaway beds that had been hidden or stored. There was no dust or cobwebs on them. Mr. Speaker. I looked behind the chimney. and what do you think I found? I found a dice board. I wonder if the taxpayers have been paying for running a gambling device at the generals lodgeat this notsupposedtobe lodge. on the A. P. Hill Reservation? So I left his lodge. with regrets. because it is so beautiful. I would love to have a retreat like that myself. If that hunting lodge did not cost $50.000. I am not standing in the well of this House today. If I had $50.000. I would gladly give it for it. with its magnificent setting. Then on another hill adjacent to the lodge was a beautiful bath house. I asked the colored boy. When was that constructed? He said. I dont know. sir. but they tell me they built it last year. You can tell by the roof and the building itself that it had not been there 2 years. much less 10 years. Then I went on down to another building. and there was another sergeant who drove up with a Mr. Ackerman. I asked what their jobs were. They were taking care of the forest. they said. and they were lowering the lake 2 feet so that they could kill weeds. so that when the general came down there with his fishing parties there would not be many weeds around. I asked him about the garage. There was a new apartment over a double garage. I said. When was that built? He said. About 6 months ago. I think. I baid. Who is it foi ? General Brooks chauffeurs. when they are here. There was a new refr:gerator and new stove In the garage apartment. Oh. yes. Mr. Speaker. I want you to know that this lodge is heated with oil. The heating system has been recently Installed. But no money has been spent there. Then I went over to another building which they were remodeling. Why do I say they were remodeling? Because they had recently sanded two floors and varnished them. and sanded another but had not yet varnished it. Apparently no one had walked on it. I went outside. and going up the hill to the house were new concrete steps that obviously had not been built 2 weeks. because the forms had not even been removed. No construction since the war. though. Mr. Speaker. to me General Brooks statement is nothing but intentional misrepresentation. this statement here by the spokesman of General Brooks. In plain Tennessee language. that is lying. Sergeant Summerfleld was cleaning the place with a colored private. He had taken Sergeant Graves place. Do you think this was not using the taxpayers money? And in this building. there was a signa group of signsthereincidentally. all this section down there is in a game tireserveand there were signs all along the road. Game preserve. Then there was a sign up on a tree. I would say it was 16 or 18 inches square Off limits to all military personnel. I asked the sergeant. Why is that sign there? He said. When the general is here. he does not want the troops that may be on maneuvers coming up and asking for a drink of water. He does not want to be bothered with them. Whose lodge is it? Naturally. General Brooks does not own it. The Government owns it. It is on a 77.000acre Government reservation. But. he is the commanding general of the Second Army. Mr. Speaker. if that is the best generalship we have in this United States Army. I feel sorry for this country of ours. If he is the most capable officer we have to run the Second Army of the United States of America. we had better disband the Second Army and let them join in with the First or the Third Armies. It is men like Lt. Gen. Edward H. Brooks that make the people in the United States Congress fight the brass. It is men like Lt. Gen. Edward H. Brooks that make many of us doubt whether we should have universal military training because we would go militaristic under men like him. Mr. Speaker. last evening a man came by my office by the name of John Hensley who lives in Arlington. He saw service with the Second Airborne in World War II. He trained down at A. P. Hill with the Rangers. He has a wonderful war record. He was shot six times. and made nine jumps behind the enemy lines as a Ranger. He trained at A. P. Hill from May 1941 until November 1941. he said. We bivouacked right on that lake. There was no lodge there then. He said. There was only one building there and that was the building that has been remodeled. He said. We shot that up even with 75millimeter guns and used it as a target and for practice booby traps. He said. There was no bathhouse there. That Is as late as November 1941. He said. There was no lodge there. That is as late as November 1941. And yet they say there has been no construction since World War II. I was talking with a man this morning who said that the lodge had been built since World War II. He is checking now on the exact date. and when I find out. I am going to let the Congress know exactly when it was built. and he thinks he will have the date and figure as to what it cost to build it. and I want Congress to know that too. Mr. Speaker. I am preparing an hours speech on wastefulness in the Second Army under leadership of Lt. Gen. Edward H. Brooks. Within about 2 weeks. I hope to have it ready and speak to the Congress."},{"1":"8.200523e+08","2":"1951","3":"S","4":"CORDON","5":"210","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. In his argument today. the distinguished Senator from Louisiana repeated. as I understood him. the matters he presented in his original argument before the Senate.

All the Secretary of Labor need do is to determine the points to which the laborers come and from which they return. with expenses prepaid by the American Government. The remainder is all taken care of exactly as it is today. It is solely a matter of good administrative judgment on the part of the Secretary of Labor. and I think we can indulge the hope that we will have that sort of administration. and that the result will be equity as between agricultural areas in the several States of the United States in which there is a critical labor shortage which cannot be met domestically. If there is no shortage. there is no call for the foreign labor. If there is a shortage. there should be equity in its supply and in the cost of providing it.

I rise at this time to support H. R. 6766. a bill to amend the Railroad Retirement Act and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act. It is my privilege to represent. a district with a large railroad population principally because at Altoona. Pa.. is located the Pennsylvania Railroad shops. the largest railroad shops in the world. In addition. the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad at DuBoise and the New York Central Railroad at Clearfield employ thousands of men. It is estimated that current railroad employment in my congressional district totals 32.698. with an estimated total potential retirement coverage of 81.745. As a result. there are thousailds of retired railroad employees who will benefit directly by this legislation. At the present time these thousands of retired employees are living under conditions. dueto the high cost of living. that make it impossible for them to receive the bare necessities of life. According to the Railroad Retirement Board. for the fiscal year. of 1947 there .were 240.026 persons on the retirement rolls whose average monthly benefits were $61.10. Widows 65 years and over on the retirement rolls received a monthly payment of $28.34.. while dependent children averaged- $15.70 monthly. and dependent parents $16.84 monthly. These recipients of railroadretirement benefits are .faced with the high cost of living. which has practically doubled since the Railroad Retirement Act became effective in 1937. This increase in the cost of living is no fault of this particular group of retired railroad employees. There is hardly a day in the week that I do not receive pathetic letters from retired railroad employeesor their survivors informing me of their dire circumstances. Let me quote a few excerpts from some of these letters I have been receiving: We find it hard to live on our small pension of $50 monthly since the prices are so high. We do not like to ask our children for help because they have a hard time making ends meet. But we do want to live the few years we have left without worry and anxiety. A wife 73 years of age. whose husband is 76 years of age and permanently disabled. writes me as follows: The $50 monthly pension is all we have in the way of income. My husband has been bedfast since April 1946 and in need of medicine and medical attention. We are existing on one meal a day. which is very scanty. since $50 monthly is all we have to depend upon to keep body and soul together. Another retired employeewrites: I am 67 years old and worked 2 years over my time. Now I receive $55 a month. How can I keep three people and buy coal. clothing. and food on $55. We are hungry many times and have to accept food from our neighbors. No doubt there are many of you who have received similar letters from retired railroad employees. emphasizing the need for an increase in present benefits. H. R. 6766 provides that these retired employees will receive a 20percent increase in benefits. In the case of a person receiving $60 monthly the increase -will mean an additional $12 monthly. While it is true that this increase is a modest one. it will. at least. convey to - these retired employees that Congress is conscious of their plight. According to the Railroad Retirement Board. the total cost of the 20percent increase provided in this bill for the fiscal year 1949 will be approximately $48.000.000. with the cost increasing to about $66.000.000 in 1952. with a gradual increase thereafter due to the increasing number of employees expected to retire. It must be kept in mind that the funds recessary to pay railroad retirement benefits are raised through employeremployee contributions and that no_ money is appropriated for this purpose by the Government. Over a period of years the cumulative balance in the Railroad Retirement Account has increased considerably. -For an illustration. in 1941 and 1942 the balance was approximately $95.000.000. -By 1947 the fund had increased to approximately $811.000.000 and as of March 1. 1948. it was approximately $1.300.000.000. This balance. in the opinion of the majority of the members of the Railroad Retirement Board. is adequate to support a 20percent increase in present benefits and will not endanger the soundness of the fund. nor will it be necessary to increase payroll taxes. At this point. I want to call attention to the following table of receipts and expenditures of the Railroad Retirement Account for the fiscal years 1942 to 1947. inclusive. The table is as follows: Fiscal year Receipts Expenditures Balance Cuulative balance 194142 ------------------------------------------ $143. 993. 059 $126. 6.0. 781 $17. 336. 278 $94.139. 717 194243 ------------------------------------------ 220. 577. 849 130. 863. 977 89. 713. 872 183. 85.. 589 194344 ------------------------------------------ 272. 557. 049 135. 215. 326 137. 341. 723 321.195. 313 194445 ------------------------------------------ 324. 057. 493 142. 527. 642 181. 529. 851 502. 725. 164 194546 ------------------------------------------ 312. 024. 329 153. 815. 252 158. 209. 077 660. 934. 240 194047 ------------------------------------------ 322. 420. 274 173.101.153 149. 319.121 810. 253. 31 NoTE.-Recelpts consist of appropriations and interest. You will observe that in the year 194142 the net balance which accrued to the fund was about $17.500.000. In the period of 194445 the balance reached a peak of $182.000.000. while In 194647 it dropped to $150.000.000. The fluctuation in the yearly net balance is due to the fluctuation in railroad employment. At the present time the cumulative balance. as previously mentioned. is $1.300.000.000. Indications are that railroad employment will continue at a moderately high level. which is assurance that the Railroad Retirement Fund will be kept in a healthy condition. It is encouraging to me to know that this legislation has the endorsement of railway labor and railway management and I wish. at this time. to commend the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee for taking favorable action in reporting this bill. Many of us who introduced similar bills made constant demands upon the committee for action atid. at times. may have appeared too zealous. However. the plight of the retired railroad employees motivated us and I am glad that our pleas have been heard and that the present legislation will receive the approval of Congress."},{"1":"8.000899e+08","2":"1947","3":"S","4":"OMAHONEY","5":"95","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"If the Senator had been on the floor of the Senate today. he would have heard me read from the report of the Republicancontrolled Appropriations Committee. which is appropriating millions of dollars to carry on the very New Deal programs which the Senator seems not to like.

It is high time that notice be served on the President. General Hershey. and all other Government agencies that the laws passed by Congress are to be obeyed by them. as well as by all other citizens. that. notwithstanding the New Deal theory that we should have government by man and be ruled and governed by directives and bureaucratic orders. we still have a government by law. that the executive branch should administer the laws passed by Congress and not attempt to make law by Executive directives or bureau orders or to nullify the law. The law reads as follows: Every registrant found by the selective board. subject to appeal in accordance with section 10l(a) (2). to be necessary to and regularly engaged in an agricultural occupation or endeavor essential to the war effort. shall be deferred from training and service in the land and naval forces so long as he remains so engaged and until such time as a satisfactory replacement can be obtained. You will note this law provides that the selective service board has the responsibility of determining those registrants who are necessary to and regularly engaged in an agricultural occupation or endeavor essential to the war effort. Now. let us see what has been done. Recently General Hershey issued a directive to local boards which said the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion had written him a letter stating in part thatThe President has found that the further deferment of all men now deferred in the 18 through 25 age group because of agricultural occupation is not essential to the best interest of our war effort. The letter then says the President had authorized him to ask General Hershey to take action in connection with the administration of the Tydings amendment that would. in effect. nullify that law. The law does not give the -President any authority to make findings or to do anything in connection with agricultural deferments. His action is an unauthorized assumption of power which he does not have. In accordance with General Hersheys directive the local boards began changing the classification of deferred farm workers from IIC to IA and began inducting them into the armed forces. Probably the local boards should not be blamed for this as they are only following what they consider as an order issued to them. although as a matter of fact. the local boards should. and they would be wholly justified. in refusing to follow this directive or any other one that directs them not to follow the law. In Indiana the State selectiveservice director sent a letter to all local boards. from which I quote the following: It is our opinion. based upon all facts available to this headquarters. that further deferment of farmers under 26 years of age must henceforth be restricted in most cases to those registrants who are sole ownersoperators. who are fully equipped and fully engaged in extensive farm operations. plus those few cases which involve situations of extreme hardship. There is not authority In law for an Instruction to defer only sole ownersoperators. who are fully equipped and fully engaged in extensive farm operations. plus those few cases which involve situations of extreme hardship. Another assumption of power which does not exist. . From the above it is plain that the President. the socalled Assistant President. General Hershey. and the State director of selective service in effect ordered the local boards to disregard the law and to disregard their own rulings as to deferments of those engaged in agriculture. Let me mention only a few of the many cases called to my attention. One is that of a farm owner who has 1 son serving in the Army. and who is farming 500 acres. which is stocked with 15 milk cows. 21 brood sows. 150 hogs. 30 feeding cattle. and who has 3 tractors and full equipment. which was operated by the owner and 1 son who had been deferred under the Tydings amendment. Now this son has been placed in IA and inducted on January 31. The father advises that he cannot get help and that he must materially curtail his farm operations. which means less acreage in crops and less production of livestock. In another case I was sent an ad-. vertisement of a public sale. reading: As I am being inducted into the armed services. I will sell at public auctionHe listed for auction a complete outfit of farm implements and machinery. 32 head of Hereford cows. 5 Jersey cows. 1.000 bushels of corn. all his chickens. 100 bales of clover hay. and all other grain and household goods and numerous tools. Another farm out of production. Here is another. A man 23 years old. living with his mother on a 360acre farm. which he was farming. This farm has 200 acres in cultivation and in production and the rest in pasture. barn lots. and so forth. It has 8 barns. all filled with grain. hay. and livestock. There are 55 head of beef cattle. 6 dairy cows. 20 brood sows ready to farrow this spring. and 40 head of feeding hogs. The farm is equipped with mechanized equipment. all tools tractordriven. has its own hammer mill. combine and pickup baler and a 6ton truck to haul produce to the market. He has more than enough units to defer 2 men. still he has been placed In IA and ordered inducted. Another farm out of production. Why. in one town of 500. the people face the complete loss of their milk supply by the induction of the last remaining son of the only dairyman left supplying the town. Another farmer who has 1 son in the service. who operated his farm with the help of another son and who has 700 beef cattle. 1.500 feedlot lambs and 150 hogs. as well as 50 bred ewes and 30 bred sows. will be forced to liquidate all the breeding stock along with twothirds of the feedlot stock because his son has been placed in IA and inducted. Another man farming 600 ztcres will be forced to liquidate his 200 young feedlot cattle and cut his farm operations in half or more because his son who is 18 has been placed in IA and inducted. Another farmer. who has been producIng 600 hogs per year. has to liquidate his stock and be content to raise what crops he can tend because his son has been placed in IA and inducted. Another farmer writes me as follows: I am writing you this letter to let you know some things that are happening here. I want the public to know part of what is going on right here at home. My son was classified in IIC by the selective service board until the 10th of January when he got a IA card. He was called before the board and was told that the board got a new ruling that all between 18 and 26 would have to go into the service. In 1944 my son and I farmed over 300 acres. We produced 54.870 pounds of pork. 26.435 pounds of beef. 2.915 pounds of lamb. 40.855 pounds of milk. 2.194 dozen eggs. 1.890 pounds of. poultry. We had 92 acres in beans. 76 acres in corn. 47 acres in hay. and 10 acres in wheat. With my son gone into the Army. and as it is impossible to get farm labor. you can readily see that I will be forced to greatly reduce production. Another farmer writes me: Now I farm 300 and more acres. my rent for the coming year is already paid and I am not financially able to lose that. I have over 60 head of cattle and put out from 80 to 90 gallons of milk daily. I raise the feed for this stock. We pasteurize and distribute the milk. My nephew has been working for me for several years. His classification has been changed from IIC to IA. I do not see how it will be possible for me to continue on. I wish to be patriotic but I do not think the farmers are getting a square deal in this particular setup. It is really alarming the number of farmers who have already given up or are planning to do so. Another farmer N rites me: Again and again and again have we farmers been called upon to produce more and more and more. with less and less and less. and the enclosed bill of sale is a partof my forced answer to this appeal for more food. Two years ago three of us gave our entire time to production. then my hired man left and then last year my son and I carried on and produced 49 tons of pork. 15 tons of beef. besides eggs. milk. honey. wheat. etc. My son was in class HC. but has now been placed In.IA and inducted. and I am left to do all the work on a 390acre stock and grain farm. It moves me to think of a quotation from the Psalms that I heard an old man give in 1914 at the beginning of World War No. 1. It was this: How long. 0 Lord. how long. will It forever be? I might mention one other case. that of a sole operator of a 20cow dairy farm. who has called on his local draft board to come and sell out his herd and farm. because he was reclassified into IA and ordered inducted. Many other similar cases could be cited. In each of these cases the local boards had. in conformity with the law. placed these farm operators and workers in class IIC but. since the issuance of the abovementioned directive and orders. they have been reclassified into IA and inducted into the armed forces. I think Congress should make it plain to the executive branch of the Government that the laws passed by Congress are to be obeyed and are to be adminIstered so as to give them full effect. If the administration thinks laws passed by Congress are wrong or that they should be changed. the right thing to do is to ask Congress to change the law. but not to deliberately nullify them by administrative action. Members of Congress are the peoples representatives and upon Congress has devolved the responsibility to protect the people from the present administrations efforts to completely regiment them. We are repeatedly told that food will win the war. Our farmers have patriotically worked long hours. without being able to get needed equipment and machinery. while great quantities were sent to other nations. and with a shortage of farm labor. still these loyal citizens have produced great amounts of food. grain. vegetables. and livestock. They are entitled to more consideration than they are getting. They are mindful. however. of the administrations boast of a planned economy. and they also remember about the planned scarcity which was supposed to bring prosperity. They remember the killing of the pigs and the plowing under of the crops. and many are asking why money is appropriated to encourage the production of crops. some of which have production subsidies. while at the same time another Government agency is paying an export subsidy on the same crops. and at the same time the Government. acting through the Selective Service. is so depleting the farms of workers that it is greatly curtailing food production. Now the War Food Administration announces that it is trying to curb the current decline in butter production by revising the Governments milk and butterfat subsidy program. However. we have one arm of the Government putting farmers out of the milk- and butterproduction business. thus creating additional shortages. while another agency attempts to increase the production through subsidy manipulations. If the Government will let our farmers have *sufficient labor and give them a chance. they will produce enough milk and butter. Oh. we hear much about manpower shortages in industry. but really there is no manpower shortage. What we actually have is manpower wastage. poor use of available manpower. and the Government itself. including the Army and the Navy. is the worst offender. We need a wise. sensible use of manpower. We are told that we have $100.000.000.000 worth of surplus war materials. which simply means that our Government has expended $100.000.000.000 of the taxpayers and bond buyers money for labor and material which we do not need. This is a waste of manpower as well as of money and material. We know there is always waste in war. but need we have this much waste? We are told that the war has cost us. up to date. a total of $230.000.000.000. This includes the pay of those in the armed services and all lendlease aid. It certainly seems that out of this amount of total cost that $100.000.000.000 wasted is very much too much and shows an alarming state of inefficiency. Many instances have been cited where the Government has sold and is selling as surplus property large quantities of material. while at the very same time the Army and Navy are buying large quantities of the very same items from manufacturers. a further waste of manpower. money. and material. The Navy is asking for more employees for a navy yard while admitting that the workmen at this yard have been making chessboards and checkerboards. oystershucking tables. napkin rings. and fine furniture for the officers. Why. it has even been shown that the Government has sold many items at a very cheap price and then purchased the same items back from the purchasers at a greatly increased price. The Government paid $1.500 each for searchlights. declared them surplus. and sold them at auction for $155 each. paid the auctioneers fees. cost of advertising. and so forth. and then bought them back for $235 each. It sold plumbing strainers as surplus property for $3.25 each and then bought them back for $12 each. Enormous quantities of socalled surplus material are being offered for sale. while at the same time the Government is buying enormous quantities of the same items at full price. All this shows a waste of manpower. money. and materials. A miserable record has been made ir procurement and. as the facts become known. it will be evident that the waste and purchasing scandals of the First World War are mild in comparison: Mr. Chairman. the Congress should act at once to see to it that the Tydings amendment is obeyed by the Selective Service and to stop the needless and useless waste of manpower. money. and material. The people are expecting and are entitled to immediate action and. while I realize the administration will oppose this and bring its full power against it. that is no reason why action should be delayed. Congress has the responsibility. and if Congress either cannot or will not act. then our form of constitutional government is surely in serious difficulty. In this hour of national emergency I plead with those of the majority party to lay aside partisan advantages and considerations and look only to the best interests of our country and to join us In our efforts to stop waste and inefficiency and preserve constitutional government."},{"1":"7.802052e+08","2":"1944","3":"H","4":"RUSSELL","5":"795","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. it might be best if I did not say anything as I really believe too much has been said already with reference to this matter. but being interested in the committee when this resolution was before us. and interested in the proceedings of the House here. I thought I would impose upon the membership for a few minutes in order to express my views. if they are worth anything. The American Congress is a legislative body. one of the three separate and distinct branches of our system of government. We are in nowise an enforcing body. We can only make the laws. sometimes called rules and regulations. but we have no power to enforce them except in one or two isolated cases. Mr. Chairman. the thing that we need now in America most and have needed for some time past and the things that I have hoped and prayed for.* is unity of spirit. unity of heart. unity of feeling. unity of effort in carrying on the great struggle that lies ahead of us. In a few days it is hoped we will go into a recess that has been conditionally promised us which will last past Labor Day. This will be about 3 months from now. this being the 6th of June. That would be a little short of 3 months. This morning the radio reported the greate t event. the greatest happening in this World War. If whatever we do is valid. and it is questionable as to whether or not what we do will amount to anything legally. except it is an expression of a desire of the Congress and the people of the United States that this matter should be gone into. I am sure if it might cause at this time the least disunity among us in our great effort ahead. in our great struggle. no one would want it. Three months is too short a time for this matter to be called before the Congress and threshed out again. The section that will be coming up next will have no effect in the world. It is only a directive from the Congress which no one will have to pay any attention to. They will not be bound by it at all until in all probability the conflict we are engaged in will be over. Yes. I sympathize with the fathers and mothers who lost boys over yonder. but I feel those mothers and fathers want the Congress to do nothing now that might cause the death of other boys. If we pass this resolution. it will tear up our armed forces at this time by way of a trial which will necessarily cause the attendance of many officers of the Army and many admirals of the Navy. more than we have to spare at this time. when we are fighting for our very existence on the invasion in France. and. naturally at such a time. this resolution cannot help conditions at all. I do not for a minute condone any irregularities or negligence on the part of our armed forces at Pearl Harbor. But my interest now is for the present. in doing the best we can to win this great conflict. As stated a moment ago. we all grieve over the loss we suffered at Pearl Harbor. but that is water over the mill. We cannot call it back. but can only profit by those mistakes. and should not at this crucial time do anything that will hamper our war effort in any way. and. as I see it. this resolution would force a courtmartial trial while the invasion is in progress. We have not the men to spare to conduct these trials. and for that reason he amendment should be adopted extending the peiod of limitation for 1 year instead of 3 months. . We cannot direct the actions of the War Department in carrying out their duties. We can only pass laws and hope they will be executed by the enforcement branch of our Government. Therefore. it is a useless gesture for us to attempt to do so. It is an invasion of the enforcement branch of our Government. which we have no right to attempt. In all fairness and in all reason. let us pass this amendment and pass it on to the other body of the Congress and let it be acted upon as quickly as possible in order that we can get along with the other business that we are confronted with. This is na time to play politics with a serious question like the one we are confronted with now. I abhor such. and I am sure the people of our country do not appreciate playing politics while we are fighting for our very existence."},{"1":"7.800768e+08","2":"1943","3":"S","4":"BANKHEAD","5":"466","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I shall be very happy to undertake an explanation. because I sponsored the increase. which was agreed to by the committee. My philosophy about the situation is that on the subject of agricultural production or price control we should not have a general. acrosstheboard subsidy program. such as that in operation in Canada and Great Britain. On the other hand. however. I believe that there are times and conditions under which subsidies are advisable on specific commodities and to carry out specific purposes. Merely because a strong wind of opposition has blown up. I do not believe that we should blindly condemn or put under absolute prohibition practices which have been engaged in by the Government over a period of years. practices in which I participated. and in which my good friend from Vermont participated. We all know that we entered the period of the depression when prices of agricultural commodities. particularly. were pressed down by reason of circumstances entirely beyond the control of.the producer. I shall not go into the numerous circumstances which caused such conditions. We know that the farmers were put at a very great disadvantage in comparison with other workers. They were put at such a great disadvantage that they became the lowestpaid major group of workers in all the country. .When the depression came. we had no way of fixing prices by law. because the question of supply and demandthe old. fundamental lawwas involved. In making an economically sound proposal it is always necessary to consider that great law. So what occurred? I know the Senator is well advised concerning It. I know most of the other Members of the Senate are well advised on the subJect. We undertook in the main to find some wayand we did it without party division. I am pleased to sayby which the incomes of farmers could be brought nearer into line with the incomes of industrial workers. and of the general masses of the people. The solution which we first fell upon was the parity payment program. appropriations for parity payments to help equalize the incomes of the farmers. to help give them a larger purchasing power. and a larger debtpaying power. in order that they could contribute their part in starting the wheels of industry throughout the country. They were down and out. with their backs to the wall. So we established the program of parity payments through appropriations of the Government. based upon the idea of lifting them up from time to time until their incomes should reach parity level. and then discontinuing the program. If that was not a subsidy. I do not know what a subsidy is. In fact. the definition of subsidy is of paramount importance when people are- blindly and broadly opposed to subsidies in all forms."},{"1":"7.702045e+08","2":"1942","3":"H","4":"TARVER","5":"119","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"In just a fewminutes. if the gentleman will permit me to iroceed. * We are spending $20.000.000.000 plus -in the war program appropriated during -these 3 fiscal years.

I want to say in advance that I have the deepest affection and the most profound regard for the ability. patriotism. and sincerity of the author of H. R. 1776. our esteemed majority leader. the gentleman from Massachusetts . On its face. H. R. 1776 is a bill to promote the defense of the United States. If the 435 Members of this House believed that this really is a bill to promote the defense of the United States then this bill would be passed in a few minutes time without a single vote being cast against it. because every one of us here believes in defending the United States. I speak to you today. my colleagues. as one of many who feels that this legislation would not do what it proposes to accomplish. namely: To promote the defense of the United States. The decision this Congress makes in passing on this bill will affect the lives of millions of people throughout the world. I want that decision to be in favor of the American people. I do not propose. myself. and I do not think that you intend. to support this. or any other measure that is not in the best interests of the American people. There is not a question in my mind as to where the sympathies of our people lie in regard to the wars raging across the oceans. By thought. word. deed. and prayer Americans have indicated plainly they prefer that the victors of these wars shall be the democracies of Great Britain. China. and Greece. The average American. in my opinion. is thinking something like this: Let us give them anything we have in the way of materials that will help them win the war so long as it does not jeopardize the safety and security of the United States. But the American people do not want this country to plunge headlong into war. Help Britain? Help China? Help Greece? Emphatically Yes. But to the extent of sending troops their answer. a thousand times more emphatic. is No. This Nation has been committed to a policy. so far as the democracies are concerned. of all aid short of war. The people. at least up to now. have taken those words at their literal meaning. Perhaps. now. they finally have come to realize that short of war is vague and may be misleading. This bill. H. R. 1776. is an act to carry out the short of war policy. Under this bill. in its present form. it would be possible. without any doubt whatsoever. for circumstances to arise which most certainly would involve the United States in war. Let me illustrate just one such circumstance. Suppose we were to send our warships into danger zones or use them to convoy supply ships to Great Britain or Ireland. Is there any doubt whatever that Britains foes would attempt to sink our vessels? Is there any doubt that such an attack on our ships would not plunge the United States into war? And this is but one of similar situations that could arise. And let me ask you this question. colleagues: Would any of us whom the American people honored by election to public office last November be here today if. prior to election day. we had stood before the American voters and openly proclaimed: I am in favor of the Unitdd States entering war. Or if we had proclaimed: I will support legislation that may involve the United States in war. Of course we would not be here if we had made any such campaign statement. No Member here. I am confident. will dispute me on this point. If. then. I gave my pledge to Montana voters to do my best to promote the defense of the United States. and keep us out of war. how can I be expected to support a bill that my conscience tells me exposes the United States to the gravest danger of being forced into war? As it now reads. this bill. in my opinion. would do just that. The Republicans. during the campaign. argued that Mr. Willkie would be more apt to keep us out of war. The Democrats argued the contrarythat Mr. Roosevelt would be more adept in keeping us out of the war. The mandate then received from the people by the President and by the Members of Congress was to keep this country out of war. What condition exists now that did not exist last fall when I gave my pledge to Montana votersexcept the emotional hysteria that has been manufactured by the press. the radio. and the motionpicture theaters? Have you colleagues seen this picture called Escape? My friends. it may not be war propaganda. but it was designed. unquestionably. to make the American people hate the German people. Congress passed the Neutrality Act for the precise purpose of keeping America out of war. Then. at the Presidents insistence. we amended that act to strengthen our position as a neutral. Now. after election is over. we have before us a bill that many of us feel would serve to get us intonot keep us out ofwar. In the first place. passage of this bill would amount to a complete abdication of the legislative branch of the Government. Congress already has surrendered so much of its authority as to be virtually incapable of discharging its duty as the lawmaking representatives of the electorate. By the unprecedented powers this bill gives to the Office of the Chief Eecutive. powers that easily could lead to involvement of the Nation in war. Congress would give up the authority vested in it. exclusively. under the Constitution. to decide when the United States shall go to war. Let us. my friends. keep faith with our people. Let us take no affirmative action that seems to me. without a doubt. will cause our naval and military forces to go into this war in Europe. This bill takes the very heart out of our neutrality law. It would be a violation of every principle of international law by permitting the repairing of vessels of belligerent nations in our shipyards. It strikes the heart out of the Johnson Act which forbids us to extend loans to belligerent nations. We have relied on our neutrality law and on the Johnson Act as safeguards against involvement in war. How then. I repeat. can we pass this billunder the pretense that we are acting to promote the defense of the United States? According to press reports England Is receiving 90 percent of our combatplane production. The President already has enough powerand when I say the President. I mean the office of the Chief Executive. There is nothing so certain as the uncertainty of life. Personalities do not enter into the discussion. No one but God knows the duration of life. It is my hope that God will spare the present President. and the present Members of the Congress during these trying times. We have seen 24 Members of this bodysome middleaged. some elderly. some apparently well. and some not so wellpass on since January .1. 1939. Just the other day one of the most lovable. one of the most kindly. and one of the most able Members of our body sat In one of these front rows and deliberated with all of us. Suddenly. and with little or no warning. he passed on. You will be paying him a just tribute shortlythe Honorable Sam Massingale. So I say. my friends. we cannot speak of the President or Congress except in the abstract. We must eliminate personalities. This Is a government by law and not by men. Already. out of the Constitution and the interpretations by our Supreme Court. the President has plenary power in our external affairs. He is the sole agency and representative of our policy with foreign nations. Pass this bill. as it stands. and it would give him the same total power over our domestic defense powers. While I am 100 percent for the purpose of the billto promote the defense of the United StatesI cannot support this bill in its present form. Please understand that I do not contend that any course. in these days. is bulletproof against involvement of this Nation in war. The only thing Congress can do is keep its pledge to the people to try to keep them out of war. We cannot keep that pledge by supporting bills that permit aggressive and unneutral acts that are sure to get us into war. Perhaps the course I suggest is wrong. I do not know. Only the future holds the answer. No human being has it. Let us consider what are Britains aims and what are our aims in this crisis. Are not the words. Hitlerism must be crushed familiar to you? Do you not recall 25 years ago almost the same sort of excuse for war. Only then it was Kaiserism. What happened to the Kaiser after his army was defeated? He was placed in a little place of his own. which. according to good information. afforded him luxurious living. Of course. the cost to the German people was $70.000.000. What is going to happen when Hitlerism is crushed? How much further will Britain want to go? Has Britain said she wants to restore the status quo in Europe as it existed as of August 31. 1939? Has she said that France. Poland. Austria. Belgium. Holland. Finland. Rumania. and the other countries are to be restored? Would Britain need troops to accomplish this? Would we be asked to supply them? If so. the future looks dark for the flower of American manhood. If we are to attempt to right the wrongs of Europe. 3.000 miles away. God help America. Let us think a little further. Suppose Germany is licked. That will not mean she is conquered. Great nations never are conquered. unless they are exterminated. which is Impossible. France Is prostrated today. but not conquered. The spirit of France will rise. On the ruins perhaps a greater nation than ever before will be born. France may profit by her mistakes. If Germany should defeat Great Britain. would the English people be conquered? Oh. no. they are not made of faulty fiber. The fight would have just begun. The seed for disorder in the world Is planted by selfish. greedy. warminded men who find themselves adrift from Christianity. Europe is dark today because most of Europe has forsaken Christian principles. As I see it. the duty of this Congress is not to take any step that might involve this Nation in war. but rather to assume a statesmanlike leadership toward the goal of peace. Involving this Nation. the most powerful on earth. in war certainly is not a step toward peace. You cannot quench a fire by adding a huge amount of new fuel to it. Peace is an active and positive thing. Peace is not merely a cessation of war through some peace treaty. History is filled with the fragments of broken pledges for peace. Never have I heard the Versailles Treaty defended In either branch of Congress. This was a treaty written by the victors of the last World War. Could these victors have had the Christlike concept of love thy neighbor? Peace founded on a desire to destroy or enslave nations only plows the ground for a worse and more hideous war in the future. Consider the words of Woodrow Wilson. Americas President during the conflict of the first World War. At St. Louis. September 5. 1919. after that conflict had closed. he said: Why. my fellow citizens. is there any man here or any woman. let me say Is there any child here. who does not know that the seed of war in the modern world is industrial and commercial rivalry? The real reason that the war that we have just finished took place was that Germany was afraid her commercial rivals were going to get the better of her. and the reason why some nations went into the war against Germany was that they thought Germany would get the commercial advantage of them. The seed of the jealousy. the seed of the deepseated hatred was hot. successful commercial and industrial rivalry. Why. what did the Germans do when they got into Belgium? I have just seen that suffering country. Most of the Belgian factories are standing. You do not witness in Belgium what you witness in France. except upon certain battlefieldsfactories destroyed. whole towns wiped out. No. the factories are there. the streets are clear. the people are there. but go In the factories. Every piece of machinery that could be taken away has been taken away. If it was too big to take away. experts directed. the way in which it should be Injured so it could never be used again. and that was because there were textile industries and iron Industries in Belgium which the Germans hated Belgium for having. because they were better than the German and outdid them In the markets of the world. This war in its inception was a commercial and industrial war. It was not a political war. Do you wonder. my friends. that I shudder at the prospects of America becoming embroiled in Europes wars? At the prospect of having to pledge not only the lives of American young men but the homes of the people who have worked and saved a lifetime to ownin fact. their allto prosecute a war in Europe? The first World War. you will recall. was fought to save democracy. Today the same nations are taking part In another great conflict. eyed in the same purpose. only with added fury. cruelty. barbarity. hatred. and viciousness. What is it about? The same things that caused the first World War. The picture is repainted. of course. by adding a touch here and there. but the face of the war monster is still vivid. The mask does not hide the horrid expression of greed. desire for power. trade. gold. land. hatred of fellow man. and the hideous gaunt jaws and empty eye sockets. The President. in recent eloquent speeches. visualized a world of religious freedom. freedom of speech. fredom from want. freedom from fear. What a great and happy world that would be. Christ visualized such a world. As I heard the Presidents words. I pondered the picture he painted. But we are not living today in that Godlike world. This is a world of chaos created by mans greed. Can we wipe out want in Europe when we have not wiped out want here? I can take you into any town. city. village. or county in this country and show you want. Dare we set America up and commit her as the financial and military blood bank of the rest of the world when the proportion of want in this country is still so great that by doing this our country would become a victim of financial and military pernicious anemia? I can show youand you can show meexamples of the existence. not the elimination. of intolerance. suppressed freedom of speech. or worship. Should we not appreciate the fact that we cannot right every wrong in this manmade world? We cannot police this world. To do so would require many millions of soldiers and billions more dollars of armaments. The forgotten man. to my way of thinking. was the American soldier of World War No. 1. When he came home he found his job gone. He had to abandon gradually the ideals he thought he had fought for. He saw his hope of material prosperity dwindle. He took any job he could get. If he were so unfortunate as to be Injured In body or in mind. he found himself. perhaps. in a hospital or confined in his own home. The help his Government extended was not too much. If America gets into this world war. we will have 10 times as many of these forgotten men when the conflict is concluded. Go back to the cause of the Russian revolution and see if that could not have been avoided had the powers that be not forgot to remember. And we will have a bankrupt Nationof that there can be no doubt. To finance this war we already have seen what the cost would be. America would be economically annihilated. Of course. I want to defend America. But I do not want to be a party to putting my country Into such a position that if England sinks. or any other nation sinks. the United States will go down with her. I do not believe it is possible for any outside enemy to invade America successfully. Germany could not invade the United States. with any hope of victory. without enormous numbers of troops. How could she get them actually onto our shoreswith our naval and military and aerial might to fend her off? Could Germanyif she is victorious in the war in Europehold many more millions of people than there are Germans under her heel while she is attempting to conquer America? Would all the other nations abroad stand idle. totally helpless. if Germany were so foolish as to move her military machine off the European Continent to undertake a conquest of another continent? No. my friends. I think military Invasion of America by any outside enemy is fantastically impossible. I fully realize that national defense In its broader sense means more than keepIng hostile forces from this continent. It means. insofar as we can. protecting ourselves from other threats to our security. There is not a single doubt but what our Interestsfinancial and economicare tied In with Britains victory. but I am not one of those who believes that we are tied In to such an extent that such a victory Is essential to our economic existence and to the continuation of our way of life. Regardless of the outcome of this war. a new order is in the making with reference to our domestic economy and our trade with foreign natoi s. Our whole internal setup Is going to have to be revamped and revised to meet the change in world conditions. Should Britain win this war she. as well as Germany. will be bled white of money and liquid resources. Naturally she will turn to developing her own dominions and will give preference to them in trade. Canada is already becoming a heavy producer of meats and wheat. South Africa contains millions of acres that could be made to produce many crops. Is it not reasonable to suppose that the mother country will look to her own and care for them first? She would not be true to her dominions if she did not. We know that. after all. her dominions are going to be required to go a long way toward paying for this war. Therefore our export trade to the British Empire will be reduced. Now. assuming that Germany should win the war and control the trade outside of the Western Hemisphere. we would suffer. of course. a greater reduction in our trade. We would be obliged to compete with the cheapest of labor in the production of not only industrial products but likewise farm products. To a great extent our trade would be confined to the Western Hemisphere and. as the picture presents itself to me. the situation looks bad either way we look. It is time for us to commence to put our own house in order to prepare to meet either eventuality. We can and will survive either event. I am not prepared to admit that we have not the brains. the resources. or the ingenuity to meet economic competition as well as any other form of attack from any nation. The time is coming when South Africa. Canada. and other British possessions will be brought to the peak of production. It also appears to me that a British victory simply delays the necessity for us to begin to revamp our trade policies and our domestic economy. Unless peace can be brought about it is imperative. until we get in better shape to defend ourselves. that we do everything for the democracies that we possibly can within the framework of the Constitution and our laws to enable them to carry on. but I am not prepared to surrender the power of Congress under the Constitution and to jeopardize the future of my country to the point where we are going to populate the cemeteries of Europe again. No. my friends. to me the role for us is clear. It is the role of peace seeker. not war seeker. A warring world is a sick world. Peace is to the world body politic what health is to an individual. Individuals rejoice when health is restorednot when they start a sickness. Nations rejoice when peace is declarednot when they begin a war. We must study the mistakes that have caused wars. if we are to prevent the spread of war and our involvement. No one nation ever has a monopoly on mistakes. Every nation lives in a glass house. At some time or other every nation has played the role of traitor to Christianity and the cause of peace. Again quoting the great Woodrow Wilson: There must be some real ground for the universal unrest and perturbation. It is not to be found in superficial politics or in mere economic blunders. It probably lies deep at the sources of the spiritual life of our time. As President Wilson declared: The sum of the whole matter is this. that our civilization cannot survive materially unless it be redeemed spiritually. I believe this statement. I believe that peace can come only through the methods of peacenot through the methods of war. We cannot attain peace if we take steps that lead toward war. Peace is what Americaand the whole worldreally wants. We can. and will. protect America. I have supported and will continue to support all measures that I honestly believe will promote the defense of the United States. I am for Americafirst and last. I am for a Christian America. and I am for a world at peace. Americas mandate from God is to promote peacenot war. Our mandate from the people is to promote peacenot war. In conclusion I believe that we should proceed cautiously. Congress will be in session. and must function as the American people created it to function. during such times as this.. I have never seen or known of a more patriotic. sincere. and honest group of Godfearing and Godloving men and women than sit in this House. Last. I would feel that I would be untrue to myself. the laws of my country. and my country. were I to support this bill as written."},{"1":"7.601553e+08","2":"1940","3":"H","4":"PATMAN","5":"828","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I have asked for this time to announce the death of a former very able and distinguished Member of this House. the Honorable J. H. (Cyclone) Davis. who served in this body in 191416 as Congressman at Large from Texas. Judge Davis passed away January 31. 1940. at his home in Kaufman. Tex.. following a lingering illness of 2 years. Hon. James Harvey Davis was born in Pickens District. S. C.. December 24. 1852. the son of W. B. and Salina Moore Davis. and came with his parents in early childhood to Winnsboro. Tex.. where he lived until he attained manhood. Soon after his marriage to Miss Belle Barton. born in Bellview. Rusk County. Tex.. December 1. 1853. the daughter of Col. James Mattison Barton and Emily Miller Barton. he with his bride became citizens of Mount Vernon. Tex.. where he lived until 1892. at which time they moved to Sulphur Springs. Tex. With the exception of the 2year residence in Washing. D. C.. when Judge Davis was serving in Congress. he remained a resident of Sulphur Springs until 2 years before his death. Interment was made in the City Cemetery at Sulphur Springs. by the side of his first wife. Mrs. Belle Barton Davis. who died September 7. 1934. The first bill ever to be introduced in Congress providing for drafting money the same as men in the event of war was introduced by Judge Davis during his service in Congress. The bill was introduced after many conferences with the then Secretary of War. the Honorable Newton Baker. During his entire life he was a crusader for the poor. the weak. and the unfortunate. For this reason he was never a rich man in this worlds goods. but he built a life that will be remembered long after riches would have been forgotten. He did not receive the credit that he was justly entitled to receive for helping to initiate and sell to the country many progressive and humane measures that have been adopted in recent years. But the people who knew him will not forget the many and great contributions that he made in their interest and for their welfare. I am inserting herewith an Associated Press article that appeared in the newspapers of the Nation soon after his death which discloses his interesting career: KAUFMAN. TEx.. January 31.-J. H. (Cyclone) Davis. 85. onetime Texas Congressman at Large. and prohibition leader. died here Wednesday. The bearded. widelyknown politician lately had interested himself in oldage pension questions. Survivors include his widow and four sons. Arlon B. (Cyclone) Davis. of Dallas. Valton Davis and Roy Davis. of Sulphur Springs. and Landon Davis. of Hamlin. and a brother. Dr. Jeff Davis. of Roby. It was in the Populist movement that blanketed the agrarian sections of the country in the decade before the turn of the century that Cyclone Davis attained his greatest prominence. He was one of the founders of the group that split from the old parties and grew into the Populist Party. Davis. with evangelical zeal and burning oratory. threw himself into the movement that placed an aggresisve bloc in Congress. Davis won the brevet. Cyclone. afterward made a part of his legal name. in upholding a cause of the farmers. In March 1894 he debated the question at issue with Watt Hardin. attorney general of Kentucky. in that States capitol. and was described in a newspaper story as a cyclone from Texas. For years thereafter the Honorable Cyclone Davis of Texas was food for the impish humor of Danas New York Sun. along with Simpson. the sockless Socrates of Medicine Lodge. Davis was brought to Texas when 2 years old by his parents. W. B. and Elma Davis. from South Carolina. where he was born December 24. 1853. He was educated in the district or common schools. as he defined them. and taught school 5 years. beginning at 21. In 1879. when 26. he was licensed to practice law and. as county judge of Franklin County during the administration of Governor Roberts. was said to be the youngest man on the bench in Texas. He practiced law 20 years and published a newspaper 17 years. In the latter capacity he was one of the founders of the Texas Press Association and one of its early presidents. Davis interested himself in politics at an early age. joining the old Grange when 19. and for many years was one of the leaders of farmers movements. In 1884 Davis and a group of other friends of Thomas A. Hendricks won wide publicity at the Democratic National Convention for their slinging bandanna handkerchiefs. and the tall. bearded Texan clung to that symbol of the proletariat throughout his life. The convention of 1884 nominated Grover Cleveland and Hendricks. the first Democratic Presidential ticket elected since the Civil War. Since 1934 Davis had been the only survivor of a group of 70 prominent workers in behalf of the election of William J. Bryan in the Presidential campaign of 1900. The only public office Davis held outside his home region was Representative at Large in the Sixtyfourth and Sixtyfifth Congresses."},{"1":"7.600384e+08","2":"1939","3":"S","4":"FRAZIER","5":"51","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Yes. but after a man gets to be middleaged and has never seemed to take any interest in labor problems or agricultural problems or other problems affecting the masses of the people. it seems to me a little strange that he should be considered a proper nominee for the Supreme Court."},{"1":"7.502168e+08","2":"1938","3":"H","4":"NORTON","5":"105","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker.

Without obedience to law there can be no liberty in this or in any other country. Every game. every sport. every business. every government. every organization of any kind must have certain rules and regulations by which they must be governed. Unless these rules are strictly adhered to and faithfully obeyed. the result is anarchy. Today the peace of our country and the happiness. the lives. and the property of American citizens are threatened and placed in jeopardy by sitdown strikes. A few minutes ago the gentleman from Pennsylvania attempted to justify sitdown strikes. I listened attentively to his remarks. and. though he damned and condemned in wholesale manner certain abuses and wrongs of corporations and captains of industry. I failed to find one logical reason advanced by him which would excuse or justify these sitdown strikes. which are nothing more than unlawful trespass by men marching in and taking possession of other peoples property and refusing to move or yield until their demands are met. There is no justification in law. precedent. or morals for them. Mr. Chairman. I hold no brief for the wrongs committed in bygone days by great corporations. I certainly do not condone the unethical and illegal practices of certain captains of industry. Having had to work all my life. starting first by shining shoes and selling papers. and later by driving jennies to a cart to earn my own living. if I had any predilections or sympathies they would naturally be with the laboring man. However. the fact that corporations and captains of industry in ages past have been guilty of wrongdoing. the fact they have perpetrated wrongs is no excuse or justification for employees or laboring men to perpetrate similar wrongs. Two wrongs will never make a right. I think every Member of this House and the American people at large should feel profoundly indebted to the gentleman from Texas . who on the 23d of this month delivered such a splendid speech on this subject. clear. concise. comprehensive. and convincing. The logic he advanced in that address is absolutely unanswerable. It is all the more convincing. because the distinguished gentleman from Texas has for many years been a loyal and consistent friend of labor. However. he realizes. as do many of us in this Chamber whose hearts beat in sympathy with the men and women who earn their living by the sweat of their brows. that many of them today are being misguided and led astray by professional labor racketeers. who are doing labor greater harm than has ever been done by any captain of industry or any corporation. I have received communications from friends of mine in Michigan. Recently I have spoken in Pontiac and Kalamazoo. I think I know somewhat the feeling not only of the citizens of the great Wolverine State but of the laborers in the factories themselves. I have been reliably informed. both through correspondence and by conversation face to face with men who have worked in the factories. that the overwhelming percentage of employees has bitterly opposed from the very beginning these unlawful and unethical sitdown strikes. which have deprived the great mass of laborers the opportunity to work. If an employee can march into the factories of a great industry and take possession of the property of his employer. what is there In the name of reason and common sense to prevent an employer from marching into the home of his employee and sitting down there and refusing to move until his demands are granted? If those who work for an employer can march into his place of business or his factory. sit down. and refuse to budge until their demands are met. what is there to prevent the servants in your own households from sitting down and refusing to allow you to employ anyone else. however anxious these others might be to secure employment by working for you? Carried to Its logical conclusion. no good can come from this action on the part of certain leaders of labor. I have always been oldfashioned enough to believe it is much better to git up and get than it is to sit down and set. The only animal I know which can sit and still produce dividends is the old hen. The minimum wage paid for common sweepers and wipers. unskilled workers in the factories of General Motors in Michigan. was 65 cents an hour. with time and a half for overtime. which was wholly optional with the employees. One friend of mine who has worked for the past 5 years in the factories of General Motors wrote me several weeks ago that last December. working only 23 days. he had received a .check for more than $320. that he was perfectly satisfied with the conditions. the hours of labor. and the price paid for that labor. yet he was prevented. along with perhaps 75.000 other workers. by about 20 percent of the total number of employees. from going to work and earning a decent. honest. and lawful livelihood for his family. Mr. Chairman. I was amazed a week ago Saturday to read in the press that the distinguished majority leader of the Senate. Mr. ROBINSON. reported to the press immediately after a conference with the President on his recent return from Georgia to the White House that the President of the United States was powerless to act in this crisisthat he had no authority to take a decided stand. This statement reveals either profound ignorance of the law or else a sheer statement of pure unadulterated political bunk. and I cannot believe the Senator is ignorant of the law. I want to ask your indulgence to take the time to listen to section 5299 of the Revised Statutes of the United States: SEC. 5299. Whenever insurrection. domestic violence. unlawful combinations. or conspiracies In any State so obstructs or hinders the execution of the laws thereof. and of the United States. as to deprive any portion or class of the people of such State of any of the rights. privileges. or immunities. or protection named in the Constitution and secured by the laws for the protection of such rights. privileges. or immunities. and the constituted authorities of such State are unable to protect. or. from any cause. fail in or refuse protection of the people In such rights. such facts shall be deemed a denial by such State of the equal protection of the laws to which they are entitled under the Constitution of the United States. and in all such cases. or whenever any such insurrection. violence. unlawful combination. or conspiracy opposes or obstructs the laws of the United States. or the due execution thereof. or impedes or obstructs the due course of justice. it shall be lawful for the President. and it shall be his duty. to take such measures. by the employment of the militia or the land and naval forces of the United States. or of either. or by other means. as he may deem necessary. for the suppression of such Insurrection. domestic violence. or combinations. So. Mr. Chairman. I submit to you and the Members in this Chamber that this code not only gives the President the authority and the power to act but it also imposes upon him the sacred and solemn duty to act in order to protect any portion of the American people. be they employers or employees. in their rights. privileges. and immunities as citizens of the United States. The gentleman from Pennsylvania a moment ago said he thanked God we had a Governor in Michigan and a man in the White House who would not allow armed forces to go in and eject the sitdown strikers. I agree with the gentleman. I think we all will agree. No one wants to see bloodshed in this country. No one wants to see violence. but I pause to ask you. Who is starting and instigating this unlawful violence? Grover Cleveland. in 1894. during the great railway strikes in Chicago. sent the armed forces of the United States into that territory and they ended the disputes and prevented the spread of anarchy and lawlessness throughout this country. It seems to me it is the clear obligation and the unmistakable duty of the President of the United States. under the provision which was enacted by this Congress. to take a firm and decided stand in this controversy. It may be bad to employ a little force now. but it is much better to spill a little blood than to coddle and encourage open violence and rebellion that will ultimately and eventually end in the spilling of much blood. What justification is there for the President of the United States to ignore. to pussyfoot. to evade the duty that is clearly placed upon him? I read a clipping a few minutes ago from a Grand Rapids. Mich.. newspaper stating that Governor Murphy day before yesterday. in Pontiac. said that the President often called himmorning. noon. and night. three times a daykeeping in close contact with the trouble in Michigan. Why is it that he. by his silent acquiescence in this unlawful trespasswhy is it. I ask you. that he condones the sitdown strike? Why is it by his silence he is giving encouragement to workers throughout every State of this Union to follow the suit and the trump cards played by Mr. Lewis and his followers? I do not know why it is. but we all know that John L. Lewis raised more than $400.000 from the United Mine Workers alone for President Roosevelts campaign fund last November. I do not know whether Mr. Lewis and Mr. Roosevelt had a secret deal or not. but evidently they did have. for I do know that John L. Lewis has openly and vehemently defied court orders in the State of Michigan. which was once a State of law and order but which is fast and rapidly becoming a State of anarchy. I do know. Mr. Chairman. he defied not only court orders but he defied the Governor of Michigan as well as the President of the United States."},{"1":"7.402447e+08","2":"1936","3":"S","4":"SCHWELLENBACH","5":"357","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. a week ago today the chairman of the committee. the Senator from Massachusetts . returned to Massachusetts. and he requested that from that time on I take up the question of handling the KerrCoolidge bill.

I made the proposal to the Senator from North Carolina that we could keep in the bill those portions which were giving to the Government the power to deport criminal aliens. section 1. under the terms of which 20.000 criminal aliens would be subject to deportation at the present time. and an increase of 3.500 a year during the years of the future. and that portion of the bill which gave to the Department of Labor the right to pick up these people and to hold them for 24 hours. which. according to every authority on the subject. would be of utmost help in enforcing the deportation law.

The Senator from North Carolina was unwilling or unable to agree to that.

I probably am regarded. as I have been denominated by the papers recently. as a tariff Democrat. I am. however. no more a tariff Democrat than the others who sit on this side of the Chamber. with few exceptions. I have stood for a tariff when it affected commodities produced in my own State and in which my State was interested. except that I have been a little bit broader. realizing that I had to be reciprocal and vote for a tariff on the other mans products in order that we might have one on ours. That has been my practical understanding. I have not been one of those who defended the virtue of his own tariff and decried the virtue of the other fellows tariff. However. I have opposed the abdication of the functions of Congress. I shall soon be able to say that I have no further mission to perform in this body. along with my colleagues. My friend. the Senator from Idaho . has been the only one beside myself that I have heard state on the floor that the purposes for which Congress was created are nearly entirely vanished. I know of no rule of lawand if there is one. with my limited knowledge of the law I should like to have it explained from a better source of knowledge if I am not correctI know of no rule of law. if this is a piece of constitutional legislation. that would prevent us from giving the President of the United States the power to declare war. If it is possible for us to empower the President to say that he finds there is an undue burden upon foreign commerce and that if he so finds he has the power to levy such a tariff as he wants to levyand that is what the bill providesand fix such tax as he wants to fix. if that is constitutional government. then we can just as easily write a law saying. or providing in this bill. that if the President finds in his own opinion that there is such a condition as indicates national peril threatening. he shall have the right to declare war and appropriate the moneys to carry on the war. I call upon any constitutional lawyer who has ever been in this body to tell me why. if one is correct. the other is not correct. Is there power in the Congress to abdicate? To say we have not abdicated would be folly. No man. unless he be a Member of Congress. will say we have not been abdicating for the last year and a half. but no man here. I am sure. will say that the Congress has not the power to go on now and wind up its business and its duties and adjourn. simply by adding one more clause to the bill now before the Senate providing that if there is any such thing as national peril to the United States. the President of the United States shall have the right and power to declare war and to levy taxes for the purpose of carrying on the war. In fact. if there are those who yet persist in the belief that an emergency varies the terms of the Constitution. I am sure it would be more valid to empower the President to declare war than it is to empower him to fix revenues under this kind of a reciprocal arrangement in which is involved the treatymaking power and the legislative power as well. Let me see what has been done since I have been in Congress in the way of granting power to the President of the United States. We have made the bold experiment of doing away with legislative government. Any Senator may say that we have not. but I insist that we have. We have made the test as to whether or not we need a Congress. We have decided. whether constitutionally or not. nevertheless it has been done. and we have ventured upon the bold experiment of doing away with the Congress of the United States. Where did we start that plan? We started it when we vested the power in the President of the United States. first. complete authority over the coinage of money and the regulating of the value of money. We started it. secondly. when we gave the President the right to do that which was denied by the constitutional lawyers of the Senate as being within the sole right of the legislative branch itselfthe power to fix the hours and pay of labor.

I very much hope that the motion of the Senator from California will prevail. I know of no more important piece of legislation than that embraced in the provisions of the amendment which he desires to offer. I am going to read partially from section 2 of the amendment. which contains the substance and the purpose and the object of the amendment. Section 2 of the amendment which the Senator from California desires to propose provides thatNotwithstanding any other provision of law. and unless the head of the department or independent establishment concerned shall determine it to be inconsistent with the public interest. or the cost to be unreasonable. only such unmanufactured articles. materials. and supplies as have been mined or produced in the United States. and only such manufactured articles. materials. and supplies as have been manufactured in the United States substantially all from articles. materials. or supplies mined. produced. or manufactured. as the case may be. in the United States. shall be acquired for public use. I know of no more beneficent measure that could be written into the laws of this country than is provided in that amendment. In carrying on the public business. why should not American products. either those which are mined or those which are manufactured or otherwise produced. be purchased to the exclusion of those produced in foreign countries? Unfortunately. frequently those who administer the law of the land seem to be totally disregardful of American interests and of American producers. and. without rhyme or reason. purchase commodities that have been imported into this country instead of purchasing American products. just as some high officials have been known to travel on foreign vessels since America has been spending hundreds of millions of dollars for the purpose of building up an American merchant marine. So it is with some of the administrative officers in administering the functions intrusted to them. They do not seem to care much whether they buy American products or foreign products. It is an evil system. it is an abuse or a reckless disregard. at least. of the administration of the law and of public functions that makes legislation necessary. We certainly have in this country a situation which makes necessary some legislation upon this subject so as to insure that American industry and American producers shall be patronized and American money spent with American enterprises instead of being spent in purchasing foreign products. I do not think we should delay action on this matter. If every other Senator should vote as I intend to vote. we would suspend the rules and we would adopt the amendment in 30 minutes as one of the greatest measures that have been presented at this session of Congress in behalf of the American people. of American industry.

I include the following statement on the tariff rade by Assistant Secretary of Commerce Dr. Julius Klein : At last the tariff bill has become a law after 18 months of tumult. Business. which has owed at least some of its recent troubles to uncertainty about the tariff. can now chart its course under fixed stars instead of by the gyrating uncertainties of partisan fireworks. I am not going to discuss the rate changes. Merely to list them would fill upseveral times overthe allotted period of this talk. To present the  pros and cons  on even the major rate changes would take much longer still. Many of the rates in this act. like many In every previous tariff act. will doubtless be unwelcome to various groups of our citizens. Some will consider this or that rate too highwhile others may regard it as too low. No tariff law has ever met universal .commendation. even among the members of the party chiefly responsible for its passage. - The truth is that modern business has become so enormously complex that a legislative body. however capable and patriotic its members may be. is bound to find the proper adjustment of the rates on the thousands. the tens of thousands. of commodities in contemporary commerce an inconceivably difficult and formidable task. Add to this the necessity for each Congressman to get recognition for the Interests of his section or district by combining with others to promote their needs. and you have logrolling. Moreover. when a tariff billor any billis under discussion for 18 months. the halls of Washington are filled with lobbyists fomenting drives and propaganda. inevitably. therefofe. the admitted zeal and high purposes of the leaders on both sides have been largely obscured. All of which is bound to make one wonder whether such practices are really inevitable in the tariffmaking procedure. We Americans are strong for efficiency in our methods of doing things. We multiply laborsaving devices in our industries. Is it not possible for us to bring a new economy into the  tariff factory. where duties are made presumably in the interests of these very industries and of the public as a whole? The President has felt that these excesses of logrolling. lobbying. and rate swapping must be replaced by a new era. As the mnedium for this lie has developed with Congress one of the most vital provisions of the new tariff law. I believe that we have here a most helpful instrument to be wielded for the public goodone which. in the field of tariff building. is capable of substituting reason for rancor. precision for prejudice. and calm. wellplanned decision for endless. confusing debate. I mean. of course. the clauses that provide for a reorganized Tariff Commission and a new flexibility in this tariff of ours. Just what is this flexible provision? you may ask. In substance. it means simply that an expert tariff commission Is given authority to determine the right rate and to recommend it to the President. If lie approves. it goes into effect. replacing the rate named by Congress. The authority of the commission is. of course. by no means unlimited. No rate may be increased or decreased by more than 50 per cent. The change must be the result of thorough investigation and be based on the fundamental factors which I shall indicate in a few moments. To be sure. Congress could not. under the Constitution of the United States. withdraw entirely from tie responsibility for the levying of duties. It would not wish to do so even If it could. As the representatives of our people. the Members of Congress must lay down the policy. Congress can. however. authorize an expert body to apply the principles thus laid downand it has done so in the act just passed. In view of the extreme complexity of modern economic conditions and the speed of developments. in view also of the pressure of special interests and of sectional viewpoints upon the Members of the Congress during the framing of a tariff act. it would be truly surprisingit would indeed be almost beyond the bounds of human wisdomif there issued from such a struggle a measure devoid of inequities. incongruities. and mistakes. Such unsatisfactory phases are admittedly present in the text of the new law. The primary purpose of the flexible provision is to permit the new Tariff Commission to correct them. Moreover. the flexible provision conforms to the spirit of the modern business age. In any broad view of our presentday business life. we find ourselves confronted with a rather startling paradoxnamely. the Indisputable fact that about the only enduring element in contemporary commerce is its rapidity of change. We are witnessing positively kaleidoscopic shifts in industry and trade. New ideas emerge abruptly and gain astonishing force. Magical inventions bring marvelous industrial transformations almost overnight. New commercial channels are swiftly chiseled out under novel and compelling pressures. The tempo of businessas of our living in generalhas never before been so volatile or so dynamic. Under conditions such as these. no fiscal policy. no tariff policy. can prove widely. permanently satisfactory if it is afflicted with undue ri idity. In dealing with problems such as these. the factor of flexibility expresses the demands of modern business. In such a structure as a bridge. a vehicle. or any sensitive and complex modern mechanism. we must have that Invaluable element of pliancy. To be too unyielding is to invite impairment. damage. grave disaster. There must be springs and safety valves. And so. In that delicate and intricate economic device that we call the tariff. we must provide for speedy. easy readjustments. as new circumstances may require. That is the essential meaning of the new flexible tariff clause. And. incidentally. we are about the only major commercial nation which has adhered most persistently to the idea of a rigid tariff. Over the past 50 years we have had only 8 new tariffs. or an average of I for about every 6 years. In contrast with that. every one of our trade rivals has been very sensibly shifting at frequent intervals this or that portion of its tariff structure to suit the new circum. stances of consumers and of the interested trades. In these days of sudden economic change such elasticity of trade strategy is of paramount importance. But here is an important innovation in our new flexible setup. The Presidents interpretation of the new clause gives to it a generous and human aspect in our relations with otler countries that has not -elsewhere been attained. In fact. not another government on earth has invited other nations to avail themselves of a specially constituted body to pass upon their complaints regarding alleged tariff obstacles to trade. shortcutting the timeconsuming diplomatic circumlocutious customary. in dealings between governments. Let us hope that the benefit of this example will not go unnotided beyond our borders. for we certainly have had on our part an abundance of just complaint against the inequities of foreign tariffs long antedating the retaliatory furore of recent months. I wonder whether it would not be possible to draw a rather striking parallel between this mechanism of the tariff. and that most popular of American machines. the automobile. In the old days. when a  horseless carriage did not percolate. the accepted procedure was to hitch on a team of horses and drag the stubborn vehicle to the nearest blacksmith. who would promptly take ill the machinery apart Cnd spread its  gizzards all over the back yard of his shop. But what do we do now? We simply take It to aii expert who puts in a new spark plug. or blows out the gas line. or cleans up the pointsand we go on our way rejoicing. We do not dismantle the whole car with the object of remedying some minor fault or mechanical mischance. Even a new motor requires readjustment by t good mechanic after it has run a whilea few body bolts to be tightened. the spark gap adjusted. or some tinkerig with the carburetor. Now Is not our way of putting an expert to work on the car muih more common sensical than getting some handy man. who. however helpful and conscienitious he may be. must. because of his many other jobs. in ninny cases give himself a complete prolonged course of elementary instruction in this complicated task? Obviously. I mean no disrespect to my good friends in Congress. Tiley do their level best. in fact. the amazing thing to me is that they accomplish as much as they do. In this tariff matter as well as countless others. considering the terrific pressure under which they must Work. Congress builds the car. let us say. but the trained adjustments of the expert mecianician. namely the Tariff Commission. will keep it running efficiently under the new flexible clause. A permanent scientific body working continuously cnd exclusively on this subject. in somewhat the way the Interstate Commerce Commission works at our railway rate structure. can. il collaboration with the President. make adjustments on individual commodities. as conditlois change or need is provenwithout introducing uncertainty into the entire business fabric. A reasoiable period of investigation and public hearings will constitute sufficient notice to all persons who are concernedso that there need aever be a sense of disturbance to business through sudden and unexpected changes. In any case. changes made under the flexible authority do not become effective until 30 days after pro. clamation by the President. allowing shipments en route to be cleared and pending transactions to be consummated under the old duties. The new Tariff Commission which the President is directed by the new act to designate within 90 days. replacing any or all of the present incumbents. will be composed (we may be sure) of men of outstanding ability. fairmindedness. and high repute before the American publicimbued with the sincere desire and purpose of the President (so vigorously expressed in his tariff statement of last Sunday) to revitalize the flexible provision and make it genuinely helpful to consumers as well as producers. Tile President has declared his intention to make It an effective means of removing any serious inequities or Inadequacies that may be incorporated in the present billaccomplishing that result through a prompt and scientific adjustment of the duties in the light of differences in production cost here and abroad. as well as other considerations in International competition which the new law authorizes the Tariff Commission to take Into account. Here is a chance. offered in the fairest. friendliest spirit. for our foreign friends to present their cases for consideration in a manner devoid of all partisan bitterness and of the exaggerations of political expediency which are more or less universal in tariff discussions. Possibly at this point I hear some critic muttering to himself. Havent we already had a flexible tariff arrangement for nearly nine years. and what has it accomplished? It has raised a few rates and lowered one or two. The changes it has made have been so unimportant as to have no real effect on the national welfare one way or the other. Why expect more from the reorganized commission? There are a variety of reasons why. I believe. we may reasonably hope that the new Tariff Commission will accomplish a great deal more in changing ratqs in both directions under this clause than was done under the old plan. In the first place. there has been in entire revolution In powers. Instead of a very limited and circumscribed authority for the President. we now -have a ratenmakiug commission of large powers. Second. the American people are now. for the first time. fully ripe for real use of a Tariff Commissiom. in contrast with tile conditions following the new tariff law of 1922. when. as the President has said.  by tradition and force of habit the old conception of legislative revision was so firmly fixed that the innovation was bound to be used with caution and in a restricted field. even had it not been largely Inoperative for other reasons. Conditions are assuredly vastly different now. . Wise students of public affairs realize that the administration of a law is often more important in shaping its character amd usefulness than the legal phraseology of the act. The flexible provision under the tariff act of 1922 was the first experiment of the kind in our history. Whereas secking to repair the damage done to agricultute by the A first experiment is seldom an entire success. and we have learned wellmeant prophetic utterances of the President of the United States. much from the mistakes and shortcomings revealed In the operation and with an eye single to the welfare of agriculture. the great Secretary of that provision. of the Treasury of the United States donned the robe of prophecy disI spoke a moment ago about the powers given to the Tariff Commis- carded by the President and essayed to undo the vast damage done to sion.

Prior to 1898 very few people in the United States knew anything about the Philippines. Our fleet under Dewey was out in the eastern seas because the big fellows in this Nation thought China was to be dismembered into fragments and we were looking to be in on the killing. The SpanishAmerican War fitted in with our purpose. The Philippines would furnish us with a base of operations when the civilized nations of the earth. hungry as dogs and fierce as wolves. would swoop down on China. Of course. that looked all right militarily and perhaps otherwise in that day. for that was before Japan had licked Russia and demonstrated to the world that a new power had stepped on the stage. and that. in so far as the Orient was concerned. a dominating factor in Nippon had sprung into existence. Old Kasper thought the Battle of Blenheim was a famous victory. and. in like manner. a great many Americans went wild over the destruction of the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay. Twas a famous victory . but has any good come of it? The flag of our country. the flag of a free people. the emblem of a great Republic. the Stars and Stripes. that should be associated with the freedom of which we boast. waves over a subjugated people who. like the peoples of every generation that ever lived on this earth. are clamoring for their political independence and who will not be appeased by the material blessings and gratifications you or we have been so liberally bestowing upon them. The politician. banker. or industrialist. or preacher. if there be any difference among them. who believes that you can purchase a people into acquiescence. is either ignorant or unmindful of what the pages of history teach. There may be a few in the Islands who pretend to be satisfied. but they have the contempt of their fellows who think. if they do not sayJust for a handful of s~iver he left us. Just for a ribbon to stick in his coat. But aside from the obligation we owe to freedom and the perfectly proper political aspirations of mankind. in our own interests we should immediately begin seriobsly to consider the independence of the Philippines and permit them to work out their own destiny and salvation in accordance with their own cultural inclinations and intellectual hopes and yearnings. They would be a liability in a war with an oriental power. for we would probably lose them in the first week of the conflict and regain them only through the general result that would flow from ultimate victory and treaty. A possession 7.000 miles away from our shores is too far from Broadway. to use good. understandable Americanism. and if they are not now an economic burden. they soon will be. There is no use wasting words to prove this. That need not be proven which is selfevident. and why light candles when the sun shines bright? If not settled before then. the next presidential campaign ought to be pitched so that our tremendous loans we are making to foreign countries and their implications and ramifications and the desirability of releasing the Philippines should be the chief issues. Such a discussion would be far better for the welfare and the intellectual advancement and development of our countrymen than the wretchedly lowgrade stuff and hideous balderhash the people had to endure from the pulpit. editorial sanctums. and the hustings during the last disgraceful presidential campaign. The tariff is not an issue any longer. A tariff for revenue was the slogan of the Democratic Party for years and in its time it was a good slogan. But with the advent of the income tax law that slogan in all of its manifestations went or should have gone to the boneyard. What is desired by the people more than anything else is stabilization in tariff rates and as little tinkering as possible for like the doctrine of stare decisis in the field of legalistic and property rights it is better perhaps to have a stabilized. though perhaps. faulty tariff structure that makes for something like permanency than a vacillating rate policy that makes for nothing so much as uncertainty and confusion. which are the bane of our c~mmercial life. intercourse. and movement. Let me close by reiterating that our two major problems are the Philippines and our huge loans abroad. so vast in total that the imagination is intrigued by the figures. It was Peter the Great who said. After the Swedes have taught me how to fight I will knock the stuffing out of them. Those may not have been the exact words. but that is substantially what his declaration was. That is what he would have said. anyhow. if he had been acquainted with the powerful punch and expressive force that lies in our American vernacular. But in all seriousness. Whither goest thou might be addressed to each of us as a unit or symbol of our national greatness. One thing appears certain. and that is that we will have to maintain the protective system of this country in its widest and fullest significance. That means the development of our waterways. the construction of roads. and the stimulation of our domestic commerce. which is far away as yet from its goal when every lane should be lighted by electricity and be brightened with* fire of invention. homes that should attest the greatness and the glory. the wealth and the grandeur of country by the sculpture and the painting that will adorn. each being : art gallery and a music house into which the singers and orchestras of the world will nightly send their melody. Such a protective system is not in harmony with the colonization of our wealth. the exile of the fruits of our labor. thought. and toil abroad in foreign lands. Such a movement is antagonistic to our domestic development. Such an expansion. if it be expansion. is like sowing dragons teeth that may spring up as armed men to wreck our hopes and make us one with yesterday. I would like before I closeand I will extend my remarks for that purpose. to pay my respects to some people who have assailed sugar for no other reason than to secure a quid pro quo plus. for they have already far more than that to which they are entitled. To give some of these high binders of the productive all that they are demanding would be like greasing a wellfed hogs snout. There are some people still in New England who believe that the Civil War was fought. not to preserve the Union but to expand their industries and keep the balance of the country subjugated for their benefit. They do not want any sugar industry in the United States because it is in the West and South. They are not interested. They are interested in themselves and what money they put into Cuba. The gentleman from New York . for whom I have a great affection. for he has been a hero in many a strife--wept and wailed over the children of New York. When he weeps over those that are In sorrow and misery my tears will mingle with his. I have no doubt of his sincerity. but his methods would be a joke if the consequences were not so serious. Does he not know that the surest way to bring about a sugar famine or enormously increased prices is to ruin the domestic production of sugar? I wonder if with all his astuteness lie has not been played up a tree. The voice is the voice of Jacob. but the hand is the hand of Esau. In other words. while lie is crying aloud for the poor. he is the unconscious tool of the money bags who have sent. their money into Cuba and the Philipilnes. via Europe. as a part of the $16.000.000.000 loans. lie might think he is crying aloud in throbbing tones for the children of New York. but he is crying aloud without knowing it in a thrilling voice for the investments made by the financial interests of Wall Street in Cuba. and. my countrymen. look out for this. This is but symptomaticthe big financial interests of New York have investments in Cuba. and they have. through the $16.000.000.000 loans made to European countries which have reinvested and indirect interest in the Philippines. They will beat down our domestic sugar industry if they can. and because of the $16.000.000.000 invested in European countries. they will sooner or later endeavor to beat down all of the industries of this country. whose output will come in competition with the output of the enterprises this vast sum has rehabilitated and put into operation. Rome was destroyed by the colonies which It had made and which it taught how to fight. Look out for America that she is not overcome by the financial colonies she has created in Europe. loans so huge that the mind can hardly comprehend and grapple with the figures. My friends. stand by sugar. I know that some few over here snickered the other day when it was mentioned that we needed to maintain our domestic sugar production to meet any great exigency or war purpose. I will tell you a tale before I get off this floor. You remember that during the war that was to. end all wars 16 vessels were sunk off New York. We gave out the story that it was of no consequence. because we said the ships were empty. Each and every one of them was filled with sugar. and it was in those trying days that we were crying aloud about sugar. Those vessels might and could have been sunk by the submarine between Cuba and Florida as near New York. Preserve your sugar. Of course. you have to pay for it. Any good thing worth having is worth the price. It is a part of the national defense. It means as much. in a measure. to you as your Army and Navy. Of course. it will cost. but time cost will go into the Treasury Department. and I repeat if those of you who are shouting your lungs out for the debenture plan mean It. proceed along honest. logical lines. and impose the tariff on sugar. a proposed in this bill. and get the revenue with which to finance your debentures. That is the way to do it."},{"1":"7.000989e+08","2":"1928","3":"S","4":"GEORGE","5":"974","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. I wish that I might pay suitable tribute to the memory of the late Senator FRANK B. WILLIS. of Ohio. Words do not enable me to do so. A certain physical disability makes it necessary for me to speak but briefly. Senator WILLIS was a strong man physically. He had all the elements of physical strength which make death all the more difficult to realize. We have always admired strength. even physical strength. since the earlier days. when the clrde cave man stood at the doorway of his cave and. with stonepointed weapons. defended the woman whom his savage heart loved. the children she had borne him. We have always admired fine physical strength and courage. Our race is no exception. We have admired physical strength. the thing that we call physical courage. and that quality which we call courage which consists of a commingling of both the mind and the heart with the physical strength of the body to endure. As a nation we have admired strength and courage throughout our history. from that hour when Betsey Ross first pieced together the colors in our flag. to the last battle in the last war in which our sons were engaged. Senator WILLIS was a man of superb physical strength. He was a man of fine mental strength. He was a man of great vigor of intellect. He was a man of infinite good nature and infinite good will. He spoke often in this body. He spoke upon many occasions and upon many public questions. It would be most difficult to recall a single sentence from his lips which impugned or questioned the motive of any man. He did not agree with the opinions of men. he differed from their views. he was willing to take his side upon issues. and not one of his colleagues can recall when he failed to take his position upon any question of moment or of importance. whether we agreed or disagreed with the position taken by him. He fell in the very prime of his life. In action he passed away. It is most difficult for all of us. for any of us. to realize that he has gone. It seems strange that a man of such strong physique. such robust mental vigor. such intense activity. such infinite good will and good faith. should pass away in action in the prime of life. We do not yet realize it. His going serves to remind us again and again that in the midst of life we are in death. It is difficult to appraise men here. Mr. President. It is difficult to estimate them at their true value. Suffice it to say that whatever may be our judgments in this body. engaged as we are in the consideration of public questions of great moment. it is hardly probable that any one of us comes here who does not possess in some marked degree the elements of human greatness and strength. In this body the man who does not possess some element of strength. some virtue of mind or soul. some willingness and capacity to work and to labor will scarcely attract the attention of his neighbors about him. Senator WILLIS had a zeal for his work. I think that no one of his colleagues would question that statement. He was always industrious. he was always alert. he was always active. and he seemed to have a zeal for public service. It therefore is not strange when we read that he was a representative in his State legislature. a Member of the other House of Congress. a governor of his State. and a United States Senator from his State. Certainly there was no abatement of his energy in the study of public questions. certainly there was no slackening of the pace in his prosecution of his duties as a Senator from his State. Back in his State at the time of his death he was engaged in an ardent campaign. He was still carrying forward with that same physical strength and mental vigor so characteristic of him in this body. It would be untrue to say. and no Occasion. it seems. would demand a statement inconsistent with the facts. that Senator WILLIS never made mistakes upon public questions. That we can always occupy the right position upon great questions which disturb the thought of the people is scarcely to be hoped. But whether he was right or wrong his colleagues here knew his position. He stated his position with force and with energy. He was prepared to maintain his position and did maintain it upon every important question to which he gave his thought and attention. He served his State well in this body. He was alert in the interest of his immediate constituents. But his interest and his sympathy and his efforts were not confined to Ohio. He linked his name with the great causes which have inspired men of this generation in America. He took his side upon a great question. and there was never any doubt about his loyalty amid devotion to the side on which he cast his affections. He was a man of loftiest patriotism. He possessed the virtues common to all men of greatness. He possessed a certain fine strength. a certain strong and charming personality. a certain mental and moral vigor that distinguished him even in this body in a day of men of great strength and vigor. On occasions like this. Mr. President. we regret that we have not the words to pay suitable tribute. but those of us who were privileged to asseciate with the figures that have left their impress upon this body and upon the history of this time may pay genuine and sincere tribute to one such. who in due season. has been called away."},{"1":"6.902146e+08","2":"1927","3":"H","4":"WINTER","5":"55","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the committee. you have been recently enlightened to a very large degree upon the Colorado River compact and the Boulder Dam bill through discussions by the gentleman from California and by the chairman of the Irrigation and Reclamation Committee . also from another point of view by time gentleman from Utah ."},{"1":"6.900558e+08","2":"1926","3":"H","4":"CARSS","5":"648","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I thank the gentleman from Kentucky. This bill imposes a moral obligation upon the employer and employee to settle their differences without injury to the publie through interruption of transportation. and unless this agreement is put into law substantially as agreed to between the parties. the moral obligation will no longer exist. Under this plan. the employer and employee may meet. put their feet under the same table. and thrash out their differences. Whenever such conferences occur. and an honest desire exists to reach an adjustment. some plan can always be worked out that will bring about the desired result. Mr. Chairman. if I thought for one moment that the public interest was not fully protected I would oppose this bill. for my duty as a legislator is to protect the public Interest. but the greatest interest to the public in this legislation is to secure uninterrupted transportation. and I hope this bill will go through without amendment. The gentleman from Kansas [Mr. Hoe]. proposes an amendment which in my judgment will greatly lessen the efficiency of this bill. From my past experience in the settlement of disputes. I have concluded that when the mediators have succeeded in bringing the parties to the point of settlement. it is good policy to settle right then. If the Interstate Commerce Commission. or any other agency is given specific power to interfere at such times. the settlement would probably be delayed so long that hard feelings and bad blood would be engendered to such an extent that no settlement would be effected and a strike or lockout would result. Thus the whole purpose of this legislation would be defeated. Mr. Chairman. there is just one detail of this bill I wish to discuss briefly. section 10. If all negotiations looking toward a settlement between the carrier and their employees fail. and there is reasonable apprehension of a strike or lockout that may deprive any section of the country of essential transportation. the board of mediators shall notify the President. who may thereupon at his discretion create a board to investigate and report on the dispute. and it is the report of this board in which I am interested. After that board has brought in its findings. and if after a reasonable time either party to the dispute refuses a settlement. I should like to see all the facts of the Zase made public so that an intelligent public opinion on the merits of the dispute may be formed. Mr. Chairman. Napoleon has been credited with having said: Providence is on the side of the heavy artillery. In America. public sentiment is on the side of those who have access to the means of reaching the public ear. Heretofore. In all. labor disputes. the workers have never been in a position to put their side of the case before the American people. Organized labor does not ask for anything for itself that will not be of benefit to the public. Mr. Chairman. the -workers are willing to rely on the sense of justice and fair play of the American people to decide in such disputes. All they ask Is that the public have the facts in the case fairly presented. I hope some means may be provided in this bill to fully and truthfully inform the public on the merits of the whole matter should such unfortunate disputes arise in the future. And now. Mr. Chairran. I would say to the railroad men of America. you have come to Congress with a plan on which you are both agreed. Congress looks to you to make this plan a success. If you do not enter into future negotiations with due regard for the rights of each other and of the general public. and in the right spirit. this legislation will have been in vain.

Would the progressive party have taken the gentlemen I have named to its political bosom. put them on important committees. and told them they were good boys and all was forgiven? How much reward would even the gentleman from Texas [Mr. GARNERl expect for having been a trusted friend and ally in the tit reduction battle? Why. I believe that they would not even think of rewarding the gentleman from Texas . The excerpts you have heard could be multiplied a hundredfold.

I realize fully well my inability to paint a word picture that will even faintly reflect the love. respect. and esteem in which the people of the Sixth Congressional District of Nebraska held the friendship and labor of the late Judge MOSES P. KINKAID. Even so. I bring this tribute to the shrine of his memory that the people he served so long and faithfully as their representative in Congress may have the solace of knowing that in his death his work. his activities. and his accomplishments have not been forgotten. Judge KINKAID was born January 24. 1850. in the State of Virginia. His childhood and early boyhood were spent near the line that separates what is now West Virginia from Pennsylvania. His parents lived in Virginia. his grandparents in Pennsylvania. He had a vivid recollection of. and frequently referred to. the days just before tile beginning of the Civil War. as well as the actual hostilities of contending armies in and about his boyhood home. In his reminiscent inoods he frequently told of slaverunning days. and how he. a boy. without comprehending the significance of the act. had piloted fugitive slaves coming from somewhere in the South and headed for Canada. to his grandparents home -in Pennsylvania. where food. shelter. and aid were afforded them. And after reciting such incidents in his life lie would add: When I came to understand it. it made me constitutionally an abolitionist. The war closed. Just before and during the war period young KINKAID had finished his studies at the common schools. Ambitious for an education. and thrilled by the stormy war scenes he had witnessed. though not participated in. he entered college in Greene County. Pa. After a time. how long I do not know. his parents died. and. quitting college. he turned his face to the West. Selecting the law as his chosen profession. he registered as a student at Ann Arbor. Mich.. where he finished the law course and was admitted to practice in the year 1876. His studious habits. his keen analytical mind. and his gentlemanly bearing attracted the attention of the faculty and student body at this institution of learning and he was elected president of his class (luring his senior year. an honor he deeply appreciated and frequently alluded to when talking of the school day period that is a part of every mans life. From Ann Arbor he went to Henry County. Ill.. fully equipped to enter the practice of the law. He had a quick. accurate legal mind. and was soon emersed in the litigation of the community. For a short time he conducted an office in Illinois. when the lure of the West again possessed him. and lie quit an established practice to try new fields of endeavor. The West at that time was going through a series of rapid evolutions. I think I might say. convulsions. and be well within the limits of the facts. West of the Missouri River it was an untried country. In the seventies the Union Pacific Railroad stretched across the plains in its reach for the Golden Gate. The Northwestern and Burlington had out scouting and surveying parties. examiing. trying. testing. an undeveloped country. and on whose report the railroad builders of the West would move. And into the turmoil and strife that such conditions produce we next find M. P. KINKAIO. lawyer. I was fortunate in forming an acquaintance with Judge KINRAID in 1887. an acquaintance that ripened into a warml personal friendship. And as I have studied the characteristics of his life and the psychology of his environment I have wondered how and why a man of his quiet. gentle. uncolibative nature should throw in with the men who. at that time. were the rugged. quick. impulsive characters who were driving the black line of the desert before them In a strenuous effort to subdue a wilderness and change it from a cow country into an agricultural garden. But he (lid. He became a part of the frontier and a participant in its life and manners. He saw the country In Its making and aided in its development. And his influence was always for good. his voice and bis efforts for law and order. Leaving Illinois. Judge KINtAID first located at Pierre. Dakota Territory. The railroad was pushing Its nose into the West. He stopped at Sioux Falls to get his bearings. From there he went to Yankton. A stretch of some 250 miles had to lIe made from Yankton to Pierre. This he made by wagon train. taking a working law library with him. He announced. when he opened his law office at Pierre. that it would some day become the capital of a State. and he never lost faith in this belief. While le was a resident of Pierre he was lawyer and banker for the community. The wild lifeof those  vigilante days were vividly penciled in his memory. The trail leading west to the Black Hills country was crowded with prospectors and the class of men that a gold field always draws to it. Pierre became the headquarters for outfitting and supplies. and consequently drew to it all the various characters and elements that such a life affords. Of this wild and turbulent life of the West he was It witness but hardly a part. He spent the greater part of three years at Pierre. when transportation facilities changed the course of his life. He was remote from railroad connections. Then the Northwestern .Railroad. headed from Omaha to the Black Hills country. built into ONeill. Nebr. In order to get into closer touch with the outside world. lie disposed of his banking enterprise and moved his law office to ONeill. ill tile fall of 1881. where he resided until death called him. July 6. 1922. About the siame rough. rugged. ready. and uncouth citizenship that has always marked the building of a railroad into unsettled territory greeted him at his new locntion. And again I wonder why a man of his gentle and retiring nature mimngled from -choice with the men oil ai untamed frontier. In the broadness and deepness of a new country. he elected to become a pioneer andl bring to that country the standard of civilization. high morals. and personal fellowship that characterized his whole life. He brought to it more. He brought to it law and order. respect for individual rights. regard for society. and a desire for a religious life. Of all of these he was a sponsor and a part. It took courage to do this. Courage not of the kind displayed at San lihiel or in the Argonne Woods. but moral courage. courage of that high type that scorns ridicule. that defies gross censure. And out of it all came the KINKAID that we knew. An incident indicative of the life he led In this new and rapidly developing country occurred last April. While at Pierre lie was instrumental in organizing a Congregational church. He prepared the articles for the organization. incorporating it under the canon law of the church. The congregation built a new church at Pierre. and dedicated it last spring. The pastor in charge. looking over the old records of the church. uncovered the roll of the first membership. He wrote Judge KTNKATD a letter. asking him to be present at. and participate In. the dedication services of the new church. The incident pleased the Judge greatly. And while he could not attend in person he wrote the pastor a letter. setting forth the early activities of the church. and his humble effort to encourage a respect for a religious life and establish a desire for the observance of religious customs In the open country of the West. It is a great privilege to be one of the first in the settlement and development of a great country. to be a pioneer in Its activities. to see the black line of the desert roll back. to see the country unfold and give up its treasures. its fruits. its grains. its products. to the efforts of the husbandman. to watch a country reclaimed. pass from the stage of frontier life and take on the habiliments. of civilization. All this passed in panorama before Judge KINKAID. With the advent of the railroad. villages and towns sprung up. Churches were built and schoolhouses dotted the plains. Judge KINKAIDS entry into public life followed. It was natural that the men of such a reclaimed country should honor the strong man. the outstanding and directing character who leads and shows them the way to success. The State senatorial district in which he lived was composed of five counties and the unorganized territory west of Holt.. his home county. This unorganized territory was a stretch of country 60 miles wide and extending west to the Wyoming line. a distance of 288 miles. One line of railroad. the Northwestern. was building west through this district. A fight was on between conflicting Interests in this new territory. just opening to settlement under the homestead laws. It was in the old days of the convention system of making nominations for public office. Delegates had to be elected and their attendance at the convention provided for. M. P. KINKAID. the lawyer. driving a pair of bronchos to a top buggy. made a canvass of this senatorial district in the interests of the homestead element. When the convention convened he was nominated. At the general election in 1882 he was elected and became the chairman of the judiciary committee of the senatorial body. The roster of the senate. appearing in the session laws for 1883. shows the following: M. P. KINXAID. lawyer. ONeill. born in Virginia. single. aged 32. Eepublican. When the legislature adjourned. he returned to his office at ONeill and resumed the practice of the law. In 1884. and again in 1886. he declined to be a candidate for further legislative ionors. although importuned by his friends to allow the use of his name In the political canvasses that followed. In the meantime a population. gathered from all the Mississippi Valley States. was pouring through ONeill into the counties organized from his old senatorial district. The legislature of 1887 found it necessary to redistrict the State into judicial districts to properly care for the growing interests of the new counties which were being rapidly populated. Judge KINxKATS home county. Holt. with the counties west of it to the Wyoming line. was organized into the ninth judicial district. No resident judge lived In this newly organized district. Judge KINKAID was appointed judge of the new district and assumued the duties of the office April 1. 1887. He was the first judge to hold court in the district. in extent 60 miles north and south and 288 miles east and west. Later this territory was served by two judges. But for five years Judge KINKAID was the sole presiding judge. He held court once each year in each county. and in some of them much oftener. The counties not reached by railroad he made by stage. I wish I could make you comprehend the magnitude of his work. see the people who appeared before his court.. and understand the problems that came before him for solution. As a judge his work was not wholly judicial. He must bring to this newly organized district not only the law but a respect for it. and a willingness to abide by its dicta. No man could have performed this duty to society more successfully. The man charged with the commission of a crimeand there were many capital offenses on his trial docketas well as the man who had suffered for the offense of another was made to feel that the protecting arm of the law was about him. and that In the court over which Judge KINKAID presided each -would receive a square deal under the law. and justice would be done. By such methods. In the rugged life of the frontier. he brought respect for the administration of the law to the citizen. and with it a decent respect for order under the established customs of the law. People soon came to have faith in him. confidence in the justness of his administration. and esteemed him for the fairness of his judicial decisions. For thirteen years he made this territory. holding court. hearing controversies. settling disputes. counseling public officials as to their duties. and giving advice from the bench to audiences assembled in the courtroom which in his judgment was wholesome and wise and for the best interests of the community he served. By such methods he built up friendships among the honest. Industrious. virile men of his district. strong as steel bands and as enduring as granite. He possessed a wonderful knowledge of human nature. an accurate standard for measuring and understanding men. At the end of his third term as judge he voluntarily retired from the bench. leaving a record for efficiency. measured by reversals. equaled by but few men who have served three full terms on the bench. He again resumed his practice at ONeill. Judge KINKAIDS entry into Congress as the representative of the Sixth Congressional District of Nebraska was the natural sequence of a long and popular service on the district bench. He was first nominated in 1900 without opposition. The district. from its organization. had been antiRepublican. and at the general election following he was defeated. At the convention in 1902 le was again nominated. But at this convention six strong men from the district contended for the nomination. Judge KINICArD was nominated on the 768th ballot. He was elected the following November. Since that election. covering now a period of 20 years. he has been nominated without opposition. and has received the support of the people of. the district almost without regard to political lines. The great faith the people had in him as their judge remained with him as their Representative in Congress. He was their fellow worker. their servant. His great heart was in the work he was doing for the people of the West. His first effort as a Member of the House was for the passage of the homestead law. known as the Kinkaid Act. Under its provisions practically all the public domain available for homestead purposes has been entered and homes established thereon. His next effort was directed toward the reclamation of the semiarid lands of the West by irrigation. And while in the beginning this development was local in character. It has now assumed a national importance. Presiding over the House committee that directs this great work the marked success of this arm of Government serv. ice was a great satisfaction to him. His efforts wherever put forth were in the interests of the home and the home builder. The successof the individual working to make for himself and his family a home on a Government homestead selected from the public domain was the first concern of his official life. The last concern of his eventful career was to bring to the man striving against the elements of nature to build up a home on a Government irrigation unit the means. the aid. and assistance that would carry the hope for success. Of him I think it may be truly written. as of Abou. of old: I pray thee. then. write me as one who loves his fellow men."},{"1":"6.703294e+08","2":"1922","3":"H","4":"EDMONDS","5":"680","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. will the gentleman yield?

I presume the argument of this witness was something like this: That rather than try to build up an artificial thing. England being iaturally a shipping nation. we might well use her large shipping facilities rather than throw our money away. The Nation describes this bill as shoveling money into the sea. The Bankers Magazine thinks It is much like  pouring money into a sieve. So. rather than do that. why not get It done more cheaply. even if it be necessary to send it in British bottoms? But it is dreadful. they say. to say such an unpatriotic thing. Listen to this. gentlemen. Here is some more of that kind of language: England perforns her function as a public carrier so satisfactorily that it has not been. and it is not now. worth the while of any other nation to compete with her. Who said that? Theodore Roosevelt. Among time clippings on a table in the Library of Congress I found this citation. It is commlon sense. Roosevelt said it. .ild other people are saying it.

There was just one reason for taking the railroads over. and all of you know it. The four great brotherhoods. with their 400.000 active members. aided and abetted by the American Federation of Labor with its 4.000.000 members. had threatened that unless they were granted certain raises in salaries immediately they would tie up every railroad in the United States from the Atlantic to the Pacific so tight that not one could run. and every sensible mal knew tlat such action meant the starving to death in every big city of several million helpless women n nl little children. and it also meant dire disaster to our soldiers who were fighting in the trenches of France for $33 per montith. and it further meant a victory for German arms. It was proposed in the Senate. and I proposed it in the House. for us to pass a law prohibiting aby set of men to conspire and combine to interfere with interstate traffic and interstate mails during the war. or to thus interfere with shipping on the seas or the mining of coal nee(ed for such purposes. This was a little bill not over two pages in length. and if we had had courage enough to pass it we could have avoided the taking over of the railroads. But my colleagues were afraid of what the brotherhoods and Mr. Gompers would do to them in the next election and could not face the music.. Organized labor would not let Congress pass the antistrike bill. If this little bill had been passed. all the railroads could have functioned and could have produced the required service. and all of this expense of taking them over could have been avoided. But the railroads made a showing to Congress and demonstrated that they could notmeet the demands of President Jewel and his brotherhoods. as such demands would bankrupt them. and that the Government must do one of two things. either it must protect the railroads against strikes and its employees tying up all traffic or the Government must take over the roads and meet the demands of such employees out of its own Treasury. All of u1s knew that this was the truth. All of us knew that Congress lust do one of these two things. All of 11s knew that the time had come when Congress had to decide whether the Government could run the unions in war time or whether it was going to let the unions run the Government. We all knew that the brotherhoods were demanding $754.000.000 extra. and that a refusal without the antistrike law meant the loss of the war. But Congress was afraid of the unions. Congress was afraid of the brotherhoods. The passage of the antistrike measure was out of the question wlen it might mean politicail defeat later. So Congress took the easy alternative. It would rather have the Government pay any amount of cost than displease tile unions. It took the easy road. It decided to make its bed with the unions. And when it decided this. everyone knew there was no alternative left other than to take over Ihe railroads and let the Government furnish the funds. And Congress therefore took over the railroads. And just as soon as this was done the brotherhoods renewed their delnand upon Director Geneial McAdoo that he pay over to themn in cash out of the Treasury $754.000.000 and date it back on their salaries six months. with tie alternative that otherwise they would tie up every railroad so tight that it could not run. And some of these conductors on the big systems were then getting $300 per month for riding eight hours per day in comfortable trains. spending most of thef time in Pullmans and eating their meals in luxurious diners at half the price thlat you and I have to pay. and in some instances lve auditors to take the tickets tip for them. and when their trains were late. as was usually the case. they received overtime pay under the ridiculous Adamson law they had forced through Congress. And when Hines succeeded McAdoo as Director General. thrbugh such a deadly threat to tie life of this Notion and the life of our allies. these same brotherhoods again forced Director Hines to turn over to them. out of the Treasury. $67.000.000. and various later sums. and finally received as a parting gift from the Railroad Labor Board $600.000.000 additional. Thus. since the unions forced Congress to take over the railroads the Government has given the railroad employees over $1.000.000.000 in annual increase in wages. And not a newspaper In Washington can open its mouth about the matter. because they are union controlled. And only a limited number of the daily newspapers In the United States can say anything about this question editorially. much less give the news to the people. And this is why the people had begun to believe that the taking over of the railroads was necessary. But the day is coming when the newspapers over this land are going to free themselves of union domination and are going to give the people the facts. both as news and editorially. and then they are going to wake the people of this Nation up to such a degree that no man who wears a class yoke around his neck can remain in Congress. The people are not going to stand for (lass yokes. either the yoke of big business or the yoke of labor unions. They are going to demand that every vote shall be for the people as a whole. And I pray God that the day will soon come when our press shall be free again. Why. Mr. Chairman. two amd onehalf years ago the Los Angeles Times and the Buffalo Commercial were the only two large daily newspapers in the United States that were open shop  papers. and therefore editorially free.

He has not presented his papers to Washington. or. if -he has. he has not followed them up by estalblishing a resideil<. here. but he has- opened an office. consisting 1 think of two floors in the great Woolworth Building. where he has employed a large force of clerks. and these are engaged in an active propaganda of some sort in the United States. The State of New York has had its attention called to this condition.. and it has appointed a commission. called the Luslh commission. to investigate Martens and his activities.� In that investigation they seek to secureupon the assumption. of course. that they have a right to do socertain documentary articles or evidence in the possession of Martens. The latter declines to produce them. and shelters himself behind his assumled position of ambassador to the United States. and in that connection I understand that he has also removed many of his documents. if not all of them. beyond the jurisdiction of the State of New York. and therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the Lusk commission. Now. I take it that if an individual comes to America as the reputed ambassador of a government which tile country has not recognized and assumes to indulge in such activities. it may not only be the right but under certain circumstances the duty of the Government of the United States to aid the State of New York to ascertain what the real conditions are. I do not think that ever before in thehistory of this country. with the possible exception of the acerediting of Genet from the French revolutionary government. any socalledainbassador has assumed such prerogatives as this man Martens seens to have assumed and exercised. That being the case. I would suggest that this resolution. as prepared by the Senator from Iowa. be conifined to Martens and his activities. for the reason that he claims to be all ambassador to this country and is protecting -himself in whatever he may be doing by virtue of that claim. If lie had presented his commission to Washington. if it had been accepted and an exequatur issued. le would have no more right to conspire against this Government or to do anything that would even seem to be a reflection upon it than any other ambassador.

It is an astounding proposition that a man can come to this country as the accredited official representative of a foreign country. whether we recognize it or not. and assume to mingle ii our domesticactivities. even in the most friendly way.

I do not propose to detain the Iouse longer than will be required simply to explain the amendment upon which we are now about to take a vote. In 1.908 a law was passed providing for the establishmentof a reclamation project on the Flathead Indian Reservation in northwestern Montana. The project contemplated the reclamation. by a great system of storage reservoirs. canals. and tunnels. of 152.000 acres of land. of which 97.000 acres were Indian lands. 5.000 acres of State school lands. and 50.000 acres of unallotted lands. which were appraised under the direction of the :Secretary of the Interior and thrown open to settlement. The project contemplated also the expenditure of something in excess of $6.000.000. of which sum $1.600.000 has already been appropriated and spent. Since that time all Indian appropriation bills brought into this House. five in number. have. contained Items making appropriations of sums ranging from $200.000 to $400.000 for carrying on work .oi this- project.

There was no question of the position of the Democratic partya promise of tariff revision downward by the friends of the people and in the interest of the people. Unfortunately for the people the duty of revising the tariff was intrusted to the Republicans. and faithful to their established custom of forgetting the pledges made to the people before an election. they returned to their seats of power. and the friends of the tariff and the partners of the trusts again revised the tariff in the Interests of its beneficiaries. The people were sincere in their demand for revision downward. and the Republicans were sincere In their determination that it should be a revision upward. The people had grown tired of the oppressive rates of the Dingley Act. as it had steadily drawn the money from one class of the people and caused it to flow into the pockets of a favored class and had built up monopolies. multiplied trusts. and plundered the people. From this deplorable condition the people asked for relief. and the promised response is the PayneAldrich Act. So severe is the criticism and condemnation by the people of this act that the President is continually explaining that nothing was especially said in the platform that the revision was to be a downward revision. yet he confesses that the people regarded it as a promise of downward revision. Why did the people regard it as a promise of downward revision? Because the candidate of the Republican party. Mr. Taft. iterated and reiterated the statement that the revision should be a substantial reduction downward. On September 24. 1908. at Milwaukee. he said: It is my judgment that a revision of the tariff In accordance with the pledge of the Republican platform will be. on the whole. a substantial revision downward. though there probably will be a few exceptions in this regard. As the temporary leader of the party. I do not hesitate to say. with all the emphasis of which I am capable. that if the party is given the mandate of power in November it will perform its promises igood faith. And at Des Moines the following day he repeated the statement. in substance: It is my judgment that a revision of the tariff In accordance with the pledge of the Republican party will be on the whole a substantial revision downward. though there probably will be a few exceptions In this regard. The people accepted the word of Mr. Taft and. as the presidential candidate of his party. recognized his authority to voice its sentiments and purposes. The result of that pledge is the PayneAldrich Act. a worse measure than it amended and revised. How heartlessly. yes. cruelly. has the pledge been broken and the promised lighter burdens been made still heavier. the cost of the necessaries of life raised still higher. until the necessities of yesterday have become the luxuries of today. The people denounce this willful betrayal of plighted faith. The President now claims that the campaign pledge for substantial revision downward is evidenced in the PayneAldrich Act. and to convince the public of the faithfulness of his party he vehemently declares it to be the best tariff measure ever enacted. The people do not agree with him. yet they admire his audacity. He bases his claim on a substantial revision downward on the alleged fact that of the 2.024 items in the Dingley Act. only 220 were increased. 1.150 were unchanged. and 654 were reduced. These figures constitute his argument. and upon them asks an approval of the act. These figures show that in over twothirds of the items (as counted by the President) there was no substantial revision downward. The American people have been too recently deceived by his party to applaud his arguments and be satisfied with such proof. Mere declarations without substantial proof will not be accepted at this time by the people. It requires time to assuage grief and also to reestablish lost confidence. No one should depend on the mere declarations by Republican partisans of a fulfillment of party promises. but the people should demand the facts instead of a mere conclusion. A full investigation as to the results of the decreases and increases must be resorted to to arrive at a correct conclusion. Is a revision of rates which in its application to the same importations adds to the aggregate of duties collected a reduction. substantial or otherwise? In other words. is an increase a reduction? In 1907 the articles imported yielded duties amounting to $329.109.342. Applying the rates of the PayneAldrich bill to the identical goods imported in 1907. which is a simple arithmetical calculation. the PayneAldrich bill. had it been a law then. would have yielded $334.758.344. that is to say. the new law applied schedule for schedule. paragraph for paragrapli. and item for item to the articles Imported in 1907 would have yielded 1.71 per cent more revenue than the old law. Is this a substantial revision downward of the tariff? Applying the AldrichPayne law by schedules to the imports of 1907. and comparing results with the duties yielded by these schedules in 1907 under the Dingley law. we obtain the following result of the increases and decreases of revenue based on the AldrichPaynQ law upon identical imports: Schedule.

Increase over Dingley duties. $5.649.002. or 1.71 per cent increase. Looking at the column of percentages in this table. it will be found that in six schedules the duties were raised. in seven they were lowered. and in one no change was made. The Republicans may truthfully say. We reduced more schedules than we raised. but this is no basis for the claim of a substantial reduction. In other words. it is not true that because you reduced more schedules than you raised you have reduced the tariff. The President bases his dictum of substantial reduction on the fact that 654 paragraphs of the Dingley law were reduced. This is the old idea of poetry transferred to the tariff. Pope said: But most by numbers judge the poets song. And smooth or rough with them is right or wrong. The Dingley law had 2.024 paragraphs and items. In the socalled revision 1.150 of these were not changed. To fairly judge what is meant by these 1.150 unchanged paragraphs and items. it may be well to enumerate some of them. show the value imported in 1907. and the ad valorem rates paid.

Looking at the table more closely it will be seen that for four of the socalled reduced schedules the reduction was so small as to make it hardly perceptiblethe total reduction in the four schedules together is less than 1 per cent. Refined sugar was reduced four onethousandths of 1 per cent. The Dingley duties on sugar were $60.338.523. On the same imports the AldrichPayne bill will yield $60.335.866. or $2.657 less. Is this a substantial reduction on sugar? No one but an extremist would make the claim. In all. for woolen manufactures. the value In 1909 was-- $18. 048. 453 The duties paid on same were -----------------------10. 278. 827 And the average ad valorem percentage ---------------- 90. 20 None of these were changed. which not only made the imported articles 90.20 per cent higher. but. enabled the home manufacturer to add 90.20 per cent to the domestic article. for which the consumer paid. while the Government got nothing. The entire wool schedule was unchanged. and in 1909 the account with this schedule was: XLV411 Total wools and manufactures ------------------- $52. 807. 241 Total duties ----------------------------------------33. 361.817 Ad valorem percentage ----------------------------- 63. 18 The tariff added 63.18 per cent to all the woolen goods consumed in the country. and no part of this. except one item of yarn. was reduced. The reduced item was on yarn valued at not more than 30 cents per pound. Under the old law the duty was 271 cents per pound and 40 per cent. It was reduced to 27J cents per pound and 35 per cent. On yarns valued over 30 cents per pound the compound duty was 38J cents per pound and 40 per cent. which was not changed. This is trumpeted as a reduction of the wool schedule. In 1909 the value of the entire import of yarn valued at less than 30 cents was exactly $7.80 and the duty paid was $11.23. or 143.97 per cent. Under the new and reduced rate this $7.80 worth of yarn will pay $10.95 to the Government instead of $11.23. or 28 cents less. The ad valorem rate will be 135 per cent instead of 143 per cent. Only 29 yards came in of this kind. On the other hand. of the kind that was not reduced. 299.224 yards were imported. valued at $246.299. on which $213.745 duties were paid. or 86.77 per cent. This is a fair sample of the vaunted  substantial reduction. On articles of little importance a change was madea very little changeand on this little change the argument rests that the Republican party has redeemed its promise for a substantial revision downward. It is a flimsy. unsound. and untruthful. argument. If there is one schedule more than another that deserves and will receive the condemnation of the American people. it is this schedule of woolen manufactures. Its rates are exorbitant and unwarranted. and its burdens fall upon all. but most heavily upon the people who are least able to pay. Our climate requires and our health demands comfortable and warm clothing. asid the tariff duty in this schedule practically forbids a large number of people from securing these needed articles. Wool clothing and woolen blankets should not become luxuries. Nature demands that their use should be general and not restricted to the wealthy alone. I fail to comprehend how any-. one can justify a tariff tax of over 100 per cent upon these prime necessities of life. while articles of luxury that can be purchased only by the wealthy are taxed at less than 20 per cent. If I were adjusting tariff rates. I would put the lowest duty upon the necessaries of life. and upon those articles that must be purchased by the poor at a low rate. leaving the higher rates to be paid for the luxuries of life that are to be purchased by the wealthy. The people of the country will have to pay the exorbitant rates provided for woolen clothing or be compelled to use those composed of woolen stuff mixed with cotton or no wool at all. The people are compelled by law to pay at least from 80 per cent to 165 per cent tribute to the woolen manufacturers upon every blanket they buy. The poor working girl who draws around her shoulders a shawl to protect her from the wintry. winds as she goes to her work must pay a dollar for this shawl. and another dollar to the overflowing treasury of the woolen manufacturers. This is a crime against humanity. an outrage upon womanhood. and a disgrace to our national honor. We may excuse the thief who steals to obtain bread for his family. but is it not worse to take the hard earnings of labor and give them b. law to those who never earned them?"},{"1":"6.100160e+08","2":"1909","3":"S","4":"PENROSE","5":"162","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I can answer that inquiry from personal braids. galloons. trimmings. ribbons. beltings. ornaments. or other knowledge.

Generally. I may say that the bill as it has been reported to the House by the Committee on the PostOffice and PostRoads is less objectionable to the members of the committee than any similar bill presented during my service in Congress. For the information of the country it may not be out of place to make some comparisons. In 1900 the total appropriations for the support of the postal service amounted to $105.627.13S.75. The present bill carries $220.766.192. In my opinion. a number of items are too small in amount and others are too large. However. I am only one of eighteen members of the Committee on the PostOffice and PostRoads. and it is a fact that close scrutiny was given by the committee to all items going to make up the bill. This leads me to digress somewhat. It is commonly reported in the press and generally believed by a great majority of the people in this country that the Senate of the United States is a deliberative body and that the House of Representatives is not. I am not one of those who indorse the rules of the House which give to the Speaker and his three Republican colleagues on the Committee on Rules the absolute government and control of the House. I do not propose. however. to discuss at present this phase of the question. Revenue bills. under the Constitution of the United States. must originate in the House of Representatives. Custom and practice has brought it about that all appropriation bills shall also originate in the House of Representatives. The Senate consists of 02 members. the House of 391. It is evident without argument that in the House of Representatives there is less than onefourth of the time for debate by the Members individually that there is in the Senate. and then. when it is considered that the appropriation bills. amounting to nearly a billion of dollars at each session of Congress. originate in the House. are prepared in the various committees of the House. hearings are had. the items going to make up the same carefully scrutinized. and full reports are made showing the necessity for the appropriationconsider this work in connection with the consideration given to appropriation bills in the Senate. and the conclusion is easy that the time of the House is largely taken up in the preparation and consideration of appropriation bills. and it is patent to all who wish to know that the Senate gives no such consideration to appropriation bills in the matter of preparation or time. The time has been when the Senate of the United States passed seven great appropriation bills in one day. and it is sometimes the case that the postoffice appropriation bill is reported to the Senate after short consideration. so that it is true that in matters of appropriation the House of Representatives gives the closest attention. analysis. and consideration to all bills and that the Senate does not. If I may be permitted. I will say that this is as it should be. The Members of the House are elected directly by the people. and it is proper that the House of Representatives should hold the purse strings of the nation. It follows that in general legislation. the enactment of new laws outside of appropriation bills. the Senate has infinitely more time and is able to give larger consideration to all such legislation than is the House of Representatives. I am constrained to make these remarks for the reason that many uninformed people do not understand or do not care to know why it is that equal time and the same consideration is not given to matters of general and permanent legislation in the House that is given to bills of this character in the Senate of the United States. I am unwilling that the House of Representatives shall be criticised without a statement at least of conditions leading to this state of facts. To illustrate. three months of the present session of Congress have passed. At the beginning of the present session the reports of the PostOffice Department and the Secretary of the Treasury were available to members of the PostOffice Committee. and it was necessary that they study these reports before entering upon the long and tedious labor of preparing the PostOffice appropriation bill. Since Congress convened after the holidays. two months ago. the various subcommittees of the PostOffice Committee. and particularly subcommittee No. 1 having in charge the preparation of the bill under consideration. have until the past few days been in almost daily session. that is to say. the members of this subcommittee have practically speaking been three months in the preparation of this bill. It is evident to all that during these three months the eight members composing subcommittee No. 1 of the PostOffice Committee have had time for no other work. As this is true of the PostOffice Committee. it is also largely true of many other committees. such as the Committee on Appropriations. the Committee on Naval Affairs. the Committee on Military Affairs. and many other committees I might name. The time of the members on these committees is taken up in this way. With apologies for this digression. I will now proceed to discuss some items of appropriation in the bill under consideration. It is my opinion that there is appropriated for the screenwagon service at least $150.000 more than is necessary. This is brought about by placing the underground electriccar service in the city of Chicago under this head. The pneumatictube service unquestionably costs more than the good of the postal service demands. The same is true of the appropriation for starroute service. Eight years ago in the Congressional district I represent. consisting of seven counties and with an area of more than 4.501) square miles. there was the starroute service and the country postoffices. In the past six or seven years the district has been practically covered by ruraldelivery service. and where there were approximately 200 postoffices there are now 95. Where there were scores of star routes in the district. today there are only 10. This should. be the case throughout the country generally where the ruraldelivery service has been extended. To my mind this service vill never be brought to a proper basis until both starroute and ruralroute services are placed under the same bureau. As it is today the Fourth Assistant PostmasterGeneral has control of the ruraldelivery service. the Second Assistant PostmasterGeneral has control of the starroute service. Both should be under one management. The Second Assistants office would have enough to do without having anything to do with the starroute service. At no distant day I hope to see this branch of the postal service transferred to the office of the Fourth Assistant PostmasterGeneral. I do not make these remarks by way of criticism of the Second Assistant PostmasterGenerals office. It is. however. impossible to properly manage and control the expenditures in the matter of starroute service so long as the same is under a different jurisdiction to that of ruraldelivery service. In the last Congress a law was enacted and provision was made for increasing the salaries of postal employees by nearly $13.000.000. Railway mail clerks were given an increase of $100. rural carriers on standard routes $180. clerks and carriers in first and second class postoffices were given classification and automatic promotion up to $1.000 in secondclass offices and $1.100 in firstclass offices. based alone on one years service and efficiency of service in the next lower grade. There is one matter. however. in connection with this that I am not satisfied with. and it is this: That up to this time the PostOffice Department has formulated no rules or regulations as to what standard of service shall constitute efficiency of service. The practice at present is to take the statement of the postmaster at first and second class postoffices as to whether or not the clerk or carrier in his office has made good from a stanfoint of efficiency. Now. the clerks and carriers are under civilservice law. The postmaster is usually. and I might say almost withont exception. a politician. so that we have this abominable condition. that a politician who happens to be postmaster passes upon the record of postoffice employees. clerk and carrier. and as a general rule there is no appeal. However. there is some hope that this condition will be remedied before a great while. the sooner the better. in my judgment."},{"1":"5.901634e+08","2":"1907","3":"H","4":"BENNET","5":"125","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I will yield back what I do not use.

It seems to me that there is a discrimination in the provision of the lawI am not speaking of the amendments now. for which the committee is particularly responsible. but I am speaking of thelaw containing the provision that those who desire to employ persons in Europe strictly as personal or domestic servants are permitted to do so. Now. the Senator says. when I suggest the desirability of having a like privilege for those who wish to employ servants or laborers to come here to engage in agricultural pursuits. that that will not do at.all. as It would. in his opinion. open the door to fraud. It seems to me. in the same way. the same reply might be made as to those who are employed as personal or domestic servants. It looks as if that were done in response to the demand of a certain influential class who wtnt to be made exceptions to the general law. They wish to have the privilege of having servants. selected by them in Europe or elsewhere. brought to this country to be used by them in personal or domestic service. But that is not so marked in its discrimination. it seems to me. as the particular proviso to which I ask the attention of the Senator. which goes to the extent of absolutely antagonizing In a degree what is the main purpose of the labor contract law. which is to protect the mechanical population of this country. those engaged in mechanical pursuits. from persons being brought here from Europe under contract to be brought in competition with them. This proviso. permitting -the contracts for skilled laborers. Is in direct conflict with that design and is evidently. while not so intended. something which would in practical operation be unfriendly to those engaged in mechanical pursuits in this countryI say evidently. but. of course. that is probably too strong a wordbut it seems to me to be intended to give all persons who are interested in the great mechanical industries of this country the opportunity. when they may be short of labor. to supply that labor by going to Europe. making contracts for such labor. and bringing that labor here. The Senator says it has been only utilized partially in the case of the glass workers. Well. in the same way it can be utilized by any of the other great mechanical industries of the countryiron works. potteries. textile. wood. and all other manufacturing enterprisesand whenever they are in a position where they are suffering by reason of the inadequacy of the supply of mechanical labor for their particular industry. the law gives them an opportunity to supply the need. Here is the great agricultural industry of the country. which is not in any manner in conflict with those engaged in mechanical pursuits. When the great agricultural industry of the country is suffering from a lack of labor. there Is no possibility that they may contract for labor to be brought here upon the ground that unemployed labor in the same line of work can not be found. Now. why should there be that discrimination against the agricultural Industry of the country? If the policy of the country is to exclude all immigrants secured through contract. that is one thing. But to admit skilled immigrants secured by contract when needed by the mechanical or manufacturing industries of the country. and to deny to the agricultural industries the right to secure unskilled immigrants by contract when they need their labor equally as urgently Is quite another thing. It is the unfair discrimination now found in the law against the agricultural interests of the country of which I complain."},{"1":"5.801012e+08","2":"1905","3":"H","4":"VREELAND","5":"3211","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Perhaps they do. If that is true. we could justify regulating the price of meat by saying that it is in the .hands of a combination. and that there is no free competition in the sale of meat. Mr. Chairman. it is my judgment that when we cross this line there Is no logical place to stop. Why not fix the price of coal? It is an article of absolute necessity in our northern climate. and claim is made that It Is sold at an exorbitant profit. Why not fix the price of clothing. of furniture. and finally of all of the necessaries of life that make up our interstate commerce? Gentlemen may stand here and believe themselves conservative because they are willing to stop at fixing the rates for which commodities shall be carried on the railroads. but I say to you that in some future time. when some wave of hard times or depression shall sweep over this country. these chairs may be filled by another set of men who will not have the scruples you have here today in crossing the imaginary line that exists between fixing the price at which railroads shall carry the products of the country to market and fixing the price at which all of the staples and necessaries of life shall be sold when they get to market. It is no more the business of the Government to furnish transportation of the necessaries of life which comprise interstate commerce than it is to furnish the necessaries of life themselves. These are the realms of socialism. and if the Republican party. the conservative party of the country. sets this great precedent by giving to the Government the right to fix the price at which transportation shall be sold. why shall not those who may come after us. and who may be more radical and more socialistic in their tendencies. use that precedent and invoke the same power to fix the price of other necessaries of life? What evidence is there that the people are demanding that the Government shall assume the ratemaking power on railroads? It is true that Mr. Bryan has expressed the conclusion that the country should own the railroads. but I assumne that he meant that we should take them and pay for them. The Populists of the country would like to have the Government buy the railroads. and I have no doubt would approve of taking from them the right to fix rates. but the Republican party. which always carries out its pledges to the people. has never advocated either Government ownership of railroads or the fixing of rates upon railroads by the Government. My information is that the rates of the country. as a whole. are not complained of. Freight and passengers are carried cheaper in the United States than anywhere else on earth. Our freight rates are onethird of those of England and France. and onehalf those of Germany. where the Government owns the roads. The railroad rates of this country have steadily. decreased. In 1870 the average earning per ton per mile of the railroads of the country was 1.990 cents. In 1903 it was 0.763 cent. That is. the earnings per ton per mile for carrying freight in 1903. for the whole country. was a little more than onethird of the amount charged in 1870. Many shippers. in the hearings before the Interstate Commerce Committee of the House and Senate. declared that the rates in themselves were not a subject of complaint. The reports of the Interstate Commerce Commission indicate the same thing. It has several times discussed In its reports unreasonably low rates. (See Annual Reports for 1893.1894. and 1897.) In Its annual report for 1893 the Commission stated thatToday extortionate charges are seldom the subject of compalnt. We are not troubled with the question (under consideration In England) that rates are too high. It Is significant that during the period of commercial development and railroad extension. which have brought communities Into such close business relations and made slight differences in transportation rates on competitive commodities a matter of serious import. there ha� been. under the operation of the interstatecommerce law. a steady decrease of complaints based on charges unreasonable In themselves. The concession is quite general among shippers that. with some exceptions. rates. as a whole. are low enough. and they often express surprise that the service can be rendered at prices charged. In Its annual report for 1898. the Commission said: It is true. as often asserted. that comparatively few of our railroad rates are unreasonable in and of themselves. The cases are exceedingly rare in which unreasonableness has been found merely in the amount of rate itself as laid upon the particular traffic and distance it was carried. In 1898 the chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission testified before the Senate committee that the question of excessive railroad charges- that is to say. railroad charges which in and of themselves are extortionate is pretty much an obsolete question. What is it. then. that the people are complaining of about the railroads? What is it they are asking us to cure? Mr. Chairman. the people are complaining of unjust differentials and discriminations. They are complaining of rebates and secret rates lower than the published rates. of concessions to owners of private cars. of small terminal switches. a thousand or two thousand feet long. which are called railroads by. their owners. who demand concessions for freight run over them. It is generally understood that the Standard Oil Company laid the foundation of its fortune with rebates received from railroads. People demand that all men doing business with railroads shall have what the President calls a fair deal . that large shippers and little shippers shall stand on the same footing under like conditions. He asks for an instrument with which to strike down rebates. Mr. Chairman. I am in favor of giving to the President any necessary power to suppress these evils. They fall within what I understand the Constitution to mean when it gives Congress the right to regulate interstate commerde. Here we are upon a sure footing. Here we are carrying out Republican policies. There are already laws upon the statute books for the corrdction of some of these evils. If there be need. using the light of experience. let us make them stronger. but why is it necessary to venture into the dark unknown of Govelnment rate making in order to do this? What evidence is there that Government rate making would cerrect these evils? Gentlemen say that the rates would be published. but they are published now. Gentlemen say that discriminations and rebates would be criminal. but they are criminal now. The trouble is that by means of private car lines. terminal switches. midnight rates. and other similar devices the law is evaded. Could not rebates be given as well if the Government published the rates as at present. when the railroads publish the rates? Mr. Chairman. I object to the bill under consideration because it will not. in my opinion. reach the evils complained of by the people. I object to it because it takes away from private owners of a vast amount of private capital at least a portion of its value without due process of law or just compensation. I object to it as a precedent fraught with danger under our system of Government. Civilization has been built upon the security of private property. Capital and enterprise are not found where vested rights are not safe. Railroads have been built by private capital. They are owned by private capital. the savings of the people have gone into them. Life and fire insurance companies. savings banks. and estates own large portions of the railroad stocks and bonds of the country. A blow struck at railroads which will depreciate the value of their properties affects hundreds of thousands of our people directly and millions of our people indirectly. Gentlemen say that by means of combinations and agreements competition has ceased among railroads. The decisions in the Northern Securities and Beef Trust cases show that there is ample law now on the statute books to prevent illegal combinations in restraint of trade. Competition has not ceased among railroads. It has changed. but it exists in a wider form then ever before. Competition may not exist between roads running from Chicago to New York as to the price of carrying a bushel of wheat. but competition exists on a gigantic scale between systems and groups of railroads as to whether the wheat shall go to New York. or Baltimore. or Galveston. or to New Orleans. Competition exists between great systems as to whether the forests of the South or of the far West shall supply lumber to the Eastern market. It is admitted that we have the most magnificent system of railroads in the world. Railroad men from other countries are constantly coming to our shores to study and imitate our methods. The 1.300.000 men employed upon our railroads receive more than double the wages paid in other countries. The railroads of this country pay much more for coal. iron. ties. and all the supplies necessary for the building and maintenance of railroads than they do in other countries. pay twice as much for labor. and yet tile freight rates. as I have stated. are onehalf and onethird those of other countries. The development of this continent during the past fifty years has filled the world with amazement. and I suppose no one will question that the railroads have been the most important single factor in this development. We have become the richest people in the world. and in no other country is wealth so equitably distributed. In no other country do so many people own their own homes. In no other country are the people so well fed. so well clothed. so well housed. so well educated as in this country. and we have achieved this position at the head of the nations of earth under our present railroad systems. with all the faults which are alleged to exist. If the railroads had held back the development of the country by charging exorbitant rates. or if exorbitant returns had been made upon capital invested in them. we could better justify ourselves in seizing the ratemaking power from the hands of their owners. but the facts are exactly to the contrary. It seems to be the fact that the capital invested in railroads. as a whole. has not received to exceed 5 per cent return. The rich prairies of Iowa. of Nebraska. of the Dakotas. of Kansas. and the hidden riches of the mining States would still be comparatively valueless except for the enterprise of the men who built railroads through them. Yet the returns to the owners of these lands and mines have been vastly greater than to the owners of the railroads. Mr. Chairman. it is said that the President desires this legislation. I have faith in the sincerity. the patriotism. the intelligence of Theodore Roosevqlt. I have been amused at the enthusiastic praise which has been showered upon him by our Democratic friends. They say it is because he is now advocating Democratic principles. Is that the reason? Not at all. It is because the President has declared that he will not be a candidate for reelection. and they know that Theodore Roosevelt never lies. If it should come to their ears that he had reconsidered and would again lead the Republican hosts to victory. lie would again become in their eyes the Rough Rider. the man on horseback. the man who would trample upon the Constitution. the man who would embroil us in wars with other countries. Mr. Chairman. I am in accord with the President upon every material policy which he has expressed. although I may differ as to some of the details of carrying them out. The latest utterance of the President. relating to the regulation of railroads. is in his Philadelphia speech. as follows: The details must rest with the lawmakers of the two Houses of Congress. but about the principle there can be no doubt. Hasty or vindictive action would merely work damage. but in temperate. resolute fashion there must be lodged In some tribunal the power over rates. and. especially over rebates. whether secured by means of private cars. of private tracks. in the form of damages. or commissions. or in any other manner. which will protect alike the railroad and the shipper. and put the big shipper and the little shipper on an equal footing. The President cautions us against hasty and vindictive action. He says the details must be left to the lawmaking power. where it belongs under the Constitution. but that in some manner we should correct the abuses about which the people complain. to the end that every man. or corporation. or company. rich or poor. great or small. shall receive the same treatment from railroads under like conditions. I am willing to assist- in writing into the statutes of the land any law which is needed to achieve this result. but for reasons some of which I have briefly stated I do not believe that the pending bill is a remedy for the abuses which we wish to cure. while it strikes a damaging and unnecessary blow at one of the greatest business interests of the country. Many of my colleagues have stated to me that their opinion of this bill is the same as my own. but that they will vote for it in the belief that it will fail of passage In the Senate. Mr. Chairman. I have no criticism to offer upon the vote of any other Member. but. as a general principle. I think we should not permit any measure to pass this House which we are unwilling to stand for as a law of the land. To quite an extent the conservative people of this country have come to rely upon the Senate for protection against hasty of illadvised legislation. because too frequently the House has responded to a passing clamor which did not represent the sober second thought of the people. Many Members have stated since this debate began that this is one of the most important and farreaching matters presented to Congress since the civil war. If this be true. what exact information have we at hand to enable us to pass upon a question of such magnitude? Even this debate is valueless for practical purposes. because we must pass this bill. under the rule. ex. aetly as it came into the Housewithout the change of a word. It has never been an issue before the people. Few of the Members have had a chance even to read the hearings before the Interstate Commerce Committee. In these closing days of this short session. with many appropriation bills yet pending. with the Swayne trial taking up a large portion of the remaining time of the Senate. it is evident that no proper consideration can be given to this bill at this session. Let us appoint a commission to investigate this subject during the summer and collect together all the facts necessary for intelligent and farsighted action by Congress. Believing as I do that it is both morally and legally wrong to take from the owners of railroads the right to fix the price at which they are willing to sell transportation. I have not touched upon the practical workings of a commission clothed with this power. I have time only to touch on this phase of the quQstion. but I believe the practical workings of the Commission having this enormous power would be disappointing in the extreme to the country. I have already quoted Judge Cooley. one of the early commissioners. who said that in a country so large as ours. with so vast a mileage. the task of fixing rates by a commission would be superhuman. The present rates are a growth resulting from years of experience. They are made by hundreds of men. each with a limited field which he has studied until he knows it perfectly. They are constantly changing to meet changing conditions. The making of rates for vast railway systems is not a simple matter. but one of the most intricate and complex character. There are millions of separate rates in existence. The change of one usually means the change of hundreds of others to correspond. Where can .we find men. through political channels. capable of performing this gigantic work? A majority of the Commission would be appointed by each succeeding President. They would be subject. then. to the varying currents of political opinion. This in itself would produce a condition of uncertainty most harmful to business. Such a commission would lack the flexibility necessary to the proper handling of business. It must proceed along rigid lines of precedent. It would encounter constitutional difliculties. Nearly every town of any size. inland as well as upon the seacoast. has been made a port of entry by Congress. The Cont stitution says that there must be no discrimination between the ports of different States. Where. then. shall we find the natural workings of competition between cities and sections of country and railroad systems. which has been the life of our business? This natural competition has brought down freight rates to onethird what they were in 1870. and measured by the price of staple commodities they are cheaper now than ever before 190i. FEBuUARY 8. What is the necessity for haste in considering this important legislation? Is the business of the country in such desperate straits that we must rush through measures for relief? Are we unable to move the products of farm and factory by reason of oppressive freight rates? Is labor unemployed? None of those things is true. The wave of prosperity which came in with Republican policies in 1896 is still in full flood. Labor is fully employed at high wages. The farmers of the West have grown rich compared with their condition ten years ago. The manufacturing plants of the country are turning out their products and shipping them to market at a much greater return upon their capital. I believe. than the stockholders of railroads are receiving. Our foreign trade is still at record figures. We are looking forward to four years more of prosperity. The great party to which we on this side belong has been intrusted with four years more of power upon the promise that we would continue the policies by reason of which this prosperous condition has come to us as a people. There is nothing in sight threatening to disturb this condition unless it shall be radical legislation by Congress which shall cause alarm among business men. We have refused to revise the tariff at present. although it is admitted that some of its schedules could be revised to advantage. because we are afraid that the losses arising from disturbing business would be greater than the benefits of revision. Why. then. is it necessary. in such feverish haste. to rush through legislation affecting onesixth of the taxable property of the country. along lines which many of our people regard as socialistic and confiscatory and which is not at all necessary to regulate the evils complained of?"},{"1":"5.800554e+08","2":"1904","3":"S","4":"FORAKER","5":"177","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"If the Senator will allow me to interrupt him again.

A man may be shown to have lost an arm or to have lost a foot. That may interfere with one man much more than with another. I apprehend. however. it would interfere to some extent with anybody.

We must consider. not only a certain number of coal owners and coal corporationsnor even the 125.000 people who mine coalbut the 80.000.000 people in the United States of America who use it. Can one believe that it is advantageous to the people of the community or wisdom in the Republican party to keep up an impost which must be paid by the entire population on an article of primary necessity? The object of protection is to build up our manufacturing interests. and it is of vital importance to them that the cost of coal should be as low as possible. The price of soft coal has almost doubled within a few months. Is that a good thing for manufacturers? This increase in the cost of power will seriously cripple many of them. It will diminish the amount of business they can do and the number of men they can employ. It is argued that taking off the duty on coal will make little difference in its cost except at a time like this when prices are abnormally high. Is that any reason for keeping it on? Here is a duty which is inoperative most of the time and only operates when it does harm. It may well be that the abolition of the duty on soft coal should be accompanied by a provision that other countries should abolish any duty they have on our coal. I do not believe there would be any trouble in obtaining such an agreement with Canada. and I have understood from large dealers in soft coal that they would view the abolition of our duty with pleasure if it was accompanied by an abolition of the duty imposed by Canada. As a result of this we might fairly expect to cheapen the cost of power for our manufacturers. and to increase the market for our coal in Canada. I can not understand why the leaders of the Republican party think it is wise to keep this duty on. Let us suppose the question of the free entry of coal was put to a popular vote today. Nine hundred and ninetynine out of a thousand would vote in favor of taking it off. Is it good politics for us to insist in keeping iton? This extra cost is paid by every man in the country who has a stove to cook his dinner or to keep his house warm. It is paid by every manufacturer in the country who warms his building or creates power. Who receives the benefit. if any benefit is received? A few very powerful and very rich corporations. I do not believe in any anarchistic outcry against great corporations. but when it comes to increasing their profits where they are already large. and when every cent of this increase comes out of the pockets of the entire population. that is another question. Are we to consider the interests of a few great coal operators. or are we to consider the interests of 80.000.000 people who buy coal? Let every man choose whom he will serve. Who gets the benefit of the tax on meat? I have no feeling against the great packing companies. but surely they are not in position to demand an increase in profits already large. when these come out of the whole community. Need I say that a tax on an article absolutely necessary for health. for the ability to labor. for life itself. like meat. is always and necessarily a wrong one. no matter who gets the benefit of it."},{"1":"5.700944e+08","2":"1902","3":"S","4":"MASON","5":"537","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I wish to make a brief statement in regard to what seems to worry the Senator somewhat. and possibly I can bring him peace of mind. and he may go on and let the Government pay for the commission which has been appointed. waiving the question as to whether the President had any power to do it. I simply wish to make the statement that it was done with the approval of all the people. and there can be no possible doubt that the people are entirely willing to trust the Executive to make due and proper allowance or compensation. I want to say to the Senator that if he has confidence in the gentleman who now has the floorand I am sure he has in some waysI have prepared a bill which I intend to present to the Senate within the next few days and have referred to the Judiciary Committee. which. I think. will relieve his anxiety. temporarily at least. Without taking the time of the Senate to explain either the intention of the bill or its merits. I will say it simply provides that when these great mines are not being operated the Government of the United States. through its AttorneyGeneral. may ask for the appointment of a receiver to operate the same for the benefit of the people. and under that clause of the Constitution which.provides that we may pass laws for the general welfare. I believe it to be a bill entirely within the power of Congress to pass. While I quite agree with the Senator from Iowa that the matter has no special place in this discussion. yet when the Senator from South Carolina. in that vigorous way he has. turns to every gentleman upon this side of the Chamber and wants an answer.

I think I can satisfy the members of the committee and the Senate that it is clearly within the power of Congress. under decisions already rendered by the Supreme Court. to pass such a law. so that the thing which the Senator from South Carolina now fears may not happen again. Then. when the time comes that. either through the cupidity of one side or the stupidity of the other side. the great mines of the country are stopped. the Government. as it has in many other cases. may go into a court of equity and ask for the appointment of a receiver. who shall operate the mines not in the interest of labor. not in the interest of capital. but in the interest of the third party. the public. accounting both to labor and capital in a proper way.

The bill provides that one of the functions of the bureau shall be the construction. when necessary. of standards. their multiples. and subdivisions. it in nowise adopts a standard for the Government or anybody else. At present. we are told. there is no reliable photometric standard in this country. If a reliable photometric standard should be constructed by this institution when established. it would be a matter for sincere congratulation. but this bill would not compel anyone to adopt it or use it. This bill proposes the standardizing of the instruments we possess for the General Government. for the States and municipalities. and for anyone else who may see fit to employ its services. It has nothing whatever to do with the metric system. I made that statement in the start. I wish to read just a paragraph from the statement of Dr. C. B. Dudley. chemist for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. You are doubtless quite well aware that where it is essential to have standard apparatus at the present time we are compelled to send abroad for it. There is no reason in the world why this work can not equally well be done in this country. and I am sure I voice the sentiment of everyone who is at all conversant with the facts in the case. and especially those who. like myself. have had endless disputes and conflicts during the years which have passed. some of which would have been avoided if we had had in this country a means of having the apparatus which we use in this country standardized. The importance of this bureau in scientific investigation I leave to others. confining myself to the actual practical daily use of apparatus in commercial work. I have been connected with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. I may say. for nearly twentyfive years. and the value of material alone which has been examined in our laboratory during that time can safely be said to be not less than $50.000.000. I most sincerely hope that your committee will see their way clear to make a favorable recommendation in regard to the establishment of this bureau. and that satisfactory legislation will follow that recommendation. Captain Sigsbee. United States Navy. made a very interesting and valuable contribution to the information of the committee. I wish I could read all of it. but for want of time I shall read but a small part of what he says: It seems to me very important that the Navy. when inviting bids. should be able to say that the standards offered should be those of a national bureau of standards. Doubtless bids would then be made by a greater number of competitors. and this would be very advantageous to the Navy. The Bureau of Equipment uses delicate instruments. At the Observatory. which comes under that Bureau. they make magnetic and astronomical observations. which requires instruments of precision. Surveying and navigation come largely under that Bureau. and also meteorological observations at sea. The Hydrographie Office under that Bureau has between 1.500 and 2.000 voluntary observers of the weather at sea. all of whom use delicate instruments. which must be compared with standards for which again there ought to be an ultimate standard. . The Bureau of Equipment also. I might say. is charged by the Navy with matters pertaining to electricity. and makes many observations accordingly. The Bureau of Steam Engineering gave me yesterday a list occupying a whole page of foolscap naming tests and observations required in that Bureau. all of which had some relation to the necessity for ultimate standards. The Bureau of Construction makes tests in many directions which require ultimate standards. The Bureau of Ordnance. as we all know. deals with questions of ballistics. and of measurements in the manufacture of guns. shells. and powder. and in many other ways the Bureau of Ordnance is interested in the establishment of ultimate standards. In order to draw a parallel to what we desire to effect. I might invite attention to the fact that our National Observatory gives daily the standard of time for a vast region of country. We set our watches by the standard Observatory time. whereby we know that they are correct with respect to each other. This. in brief. in respect to all measurements. is what we want. 1 do not see any way of attaining authorized standards for ultimate application except by means of a national bureau. therefore I favor such an establishment. The present state of the art of steel manufacture in this country is largely due to the high standard of tests persistently demanded by the Navy at the outset and against all opposition. A similar improvement may be expected in other arts from the maintenance of exalted standards. A bureau of standards under Government control would give universal encouragement to this end. The bill has been enthusiastically indorsed by all the heads of Departments of the General Government having scientific bureaus. as well as by all the chiefs of such bureaus. As furnishing an illustration of the necessity and value of this proposed bureau to the General Government. I will quote from the statement of the Secretary of Agriculture: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of April 24. and beg to assure you that the establishment of a national standardizing bureau. having the function outlined by you. will be of the highest value and importance. not only to the scientific bureaus. offices. and divisions of this Department. but to the country at large. Its influence will be felt wherever the quality and value of substances are fixed by chemical and physical tests. whether this be in connection with scientific investigations. in connection with manufacturing and other industrial processes. or in connection with commercial transactions. Speaking for this Department alone. I wish to say that it has been our policy to patronize the American manufacturers of scientific apparatus whenever practicable without hampering our investigators by compelling them to use apparatus of an inferior grade. The art of the construction of scientific apparatus has been brought to such a high degree of perfection under the fostering care of European governments--notably Germanythat we have been compelled to send abroad a large proportion of our orders. either directly or indirectly. through imorters. The greatest disadvantage resulting from this state of affairs is not the de ay. inconvenience. and expense connected with making purchases abroad. nor is it to be found in the danger of injury to delicate and expensive apparatus during transportation across the sea. It is the necessity of importing the certificate of a foreign government whenever an official certificate of accuracy is desired with apparatus. In Germany an order can be issued for apparatus with the specification that the goods delivered must be of the quality and accuracy recognized by the regulations established by the standardizing bureaus of the Imperial Government. Apparatus made in accordance with these regulations are regular commodities. and are described in the catalogues of all the apparatus makers and dealers. When the goods are received the purchaser is able to send a proper proportion of the shipment to the government standardizing bureaus and base his acceptance or refusal of the goods upon the results of the official tests. For the accommodation of customers who need certified apparatus for immediate use most of the dealers keep in stock apparatus bearing the official stamp. The disadvantage under which American scientific workersnotably chemisislabor is evidenced by a recent experience of the Division of Chemistry of this Department. The confusion of standards and carelessness which has characterized the manufacture of graduated chemical glassware in the past is notOrious. Some months ago the Division of Chemistry issued to an American dealer and importer an order for graduated glassware. to be made in accordance with the regulations of the German Imperial Testing Commission (Kaiserliche Normal Aichungs Kommission). While all of this apparatus was to fulfill the requirements in point of construction and limits of error in graduation of the regulations named. certain pieces were to bear the official stamp of the Imperial commission. At the special request of the American dealer to whom the order was sent permission was granted to import only the pieces of apparatus requiring the official stamp and to suppy for the remainder of the order apparatus of American manufacture. but ma e in accordance with the regulations named. After considerable delay the goods were delivered. The certified pieces were eminently satisfactory. the uncertified ones were quite the opposite. They were unsatisfactory both in the form of construction and in regard to accuracy. As an example of the degree of inaccuracy. it maybe stated that a flask marked to contain 100 cubic centimeters was found to contain 100.3 cubic centimeters. I do not believe that this experience was due to unworthy motives on the part of either the manufacturer or dealer. This experience is simply the result of the absence in this country of any wellestablished and authoritative standards governing the forms of construction. the system of graduation. and the allowable limits of error for apparatus of this kind. The mere adoption of regulations relative to the character of apparatus admissible for stamping by a national standardizing bureau will cause a revolution in the apparatus manufactured and give to it that highly important quality. uniformity. As a further illustration of the great desirability of such an establishment I may call your attention to the contention which has arisen in the courts in the United States in the last few years concerning the regulations prescribed by the Treasury Department governing the polarization of imported sugars. These regulations were prepared by a joint commission consisting of the Chemist of the Department of Agriculture as chairman. a representative of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Office of Weights and Measures. and the Chemist of the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The regulations were based upon the most careful scientific determinations and the apparatus and utensils employed by the customshouse officers standardized by the Office of Weights and Measures of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Nevertheless. the accuracy of these officials has been called into question by the importers. and the question is now the subject of expensive and tedious litigation. The existence of such an office of your Department as you propose to establish would have avoided all such trouble by the weight of its authority. This is only one of the many instances where the utility of such a bureau would prove of practical advantage to official operations. The above examples merely serve to illustrate the numerous ways in which the establishment of a national standardizing bureau will directly facilitate and increase the value of the scientific work of this Department. While it is a proper part of every scientific workers training to be able to assure himself of the accuracy of his instrments and of their suitability for the work in hand. in these days of the division of labor the testing of apparatus has very properly become a welldefined specialty. requiring a special training. in order that the various operations connected with it may be performed with rapidity. with the greatest economy of time and apparatus. and with the highest degree of skill. Our investigations need. first of all. clearly defined authoritative standards for many forms of apparatus. including volumetric apparatus. thermometers. etc.. second. they need the assistance of a readily accessible and properly equipped bureau charged with testing and official certification of apparatus. third. they need from time to time the cooperation of just such an institution as you descitbe in aiding them in devising and perfecting new apparatus for special purposes. as the progress of discovery in various branches of agricultural science makes them possible and useful. I am sure that the close of this century of most brilliant scientific discoveries can not be given a more enduring monument in this country than the establishment of just such an institution as you describe under the head of a national standardizing bureau. It would take much more time than we have at our disposal to refer even briefly to the many splendid indorsements received in support of the pending bill. The hearings had before the Committee on Coinage. Weights. and Measures. and also those had before the subcommittee of the Committee on Commerce in the Senate. have been printed. those in the Senate as a Senate document. No one can read these hearings without wondering why this country has waited so long to take the first step toward the establishment of a national bureau of standards. We sincerely hope that the bureau of standards. when established. as it certainly must be. will become an aid to scientific and industrial progress in this country. such as the Reichsantalt has been in Germany. Germany for several years has been rapidly advancing toward industrial supremacy in Europe. One of the potent factors in this notable advance is the perfected alliance between science and commerce existing there. and the Reichsanstalt is universally regarded as the crowning glory of her scientific advancement. Professor Carhart. of Ann Arbor University. in a paper presented at the one hundred and fortysixth meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York City. in September last. refers to the necessity of an institution in this country similar to the Reichsanstalt in the following language: If Germany has found it to her scientific and industrial advantage to maintain the Reichsanstalt and is proud of what it accomplishes. and if Great Britain is so impressed with the success of the institution that she has decided to imitate it. it is surely the part of wisdom for the United States to move in the same direction. It is therefore very gratifying that at the suggestion of Secretary Gage a bill was introduced in the last Congress to establish a national standardizing bureau. and that the Committee on Coinage. Weights. and Measures reported unanimously and strongly in favor of its passage. So great is the importance of this movement from the point of view of science. of national pride. and of the higher interests of industrial pursuits that the effort. so hap pity begun. to secure suitable legislation should he repsated with redoubled force and enthusiasm. Some of the reasons for making this effort one does not need to go far to seek. iIn the first place. the scientific interests lo be served are certainly as great as iany other country in the world. Science is cultivated here with increasing assiduity and success. Wve are no longer content to follow in the footsteps of European savants and modestly repeat their investigations. Original work of a high order is now done in many American universities. but the difficulties under which university instructors prosecute research are even greater hers than in Germany. and wvs are still compelled to go to Europe for most of our standrds. As a result. inventions of an almost purely scientific character originating hers have been carried to perfection in the Resehianstalt. and Germany gets the larger part of the credit. I need only instance the Weston standard cell. which has been so fully investigated at the Reichianstat. and the altoy manganin. which the same institution employs for its standard resistances after a searching inquiry into its properties. Both of these arc the invention of :Mr. Edward Weston. one of the past presidents of this institute. So long as there is no authoritative bureau in the United States under Federal control and presided over by men commanding respect and confidence. we must continue to utilize the far anupecrier standardizing facilities of other governments. It is true that science knows no nationality. but the scientific workers of any nation can serve their own country better if they are not compelled to obtain their standards and their best instruments from distant parts of the globe. America has the cultivation in physical science. the ability on the part of her investigators. and the inventive faculty to do wvork in a national institution that we shall not be ashamed to place by the side of Germanys best products. The establishment of a national institution for physical and technical purposes can not fail to foster a vigorous and healthy growth in science. to which we already owe so much of our national prosperity end renown. In the manufacture of optical and scientific instruments Germany is leading the world. and we can not expect to compete with her in this line of manufacture unless we offer our own people equal facilities for standardization and calibration. If we have been successful in impressing the House with the real value and importance of the measure. we have doe fear that it will not receive favorable consideration. Some objection has been made to the salaries carried in the bill. In the bill as reported by the committee the salary of the director was fixed at $6.000 per annum. In the judgment of the committee this is not too large. but to meet all possible objection in the amended bill the salary is fixed at $5.000. with the hope that Congress may see fit to increase it at some future time. The officers of the bureau of standards will be called upon to determine the most important as well as the most difficult problems. These decisions must be such as to command the respect of the world. The salaries proposed for the director and others in the scientific class are no higher than the corresponding positions in our leading educational institutions. and it should be kept in mind that the latter positions are to be preferred on account of the general impression which prevails that Government positions are subject to political changes. and the fact that the scientific men of educational institutions receive from three to four months vacation annually. in which they may travel or study. iWhen men of the ability required for this position are willing to give up the many advantages they possess at educational institutions. there is open to them the position of scientific expert in the large industrial corporattonspositions which frequently pay as much as $10.000 per year. M~oreover. a physicist or chemist of repute who holds a responsible position in an educational institution or industrial corporation in one of the large cities is frequently consulted and called upon for expert testimony. thus providing him with a source of income not available to the scientific men of the proposed bureau. Some have thought the amount authorized for the building too large. The building must be solidly built. It must be very solidly built. with heavy walls and floors. Many of the walls must be double. on account of temperature changes. The material in the building would be at least 50 per cent more than in an ordinary building of the same size. The heating of the building is much more complicated and expensive than in ordinary cases. The heating plant must he of the most improved form. and capable of perfect regulation. It will cost twice as much as the usual heating plant. In addition to the gas and water pipes of an ordinary building every room in the building must be provided with water and gas for laboratory purposes. There is also a system of compressed air and vacuum pipes which extend throughout the building. The plumbing and piping of a laboratory is a very considerable item of its entire cost. In addition to the usual electriclight wires there are several systems of wires and switchboards used in the distribution of electricity for experimental purposes to the various rooms. This item would be four or five times that in an ordinary building. The windows are to be provided with lightproof shutters or blinds. in order that the rooms may be absolutely dark or flooded with light. as the work may require. Many of the windows should be double. The heating plant. engines. dynamos. motors. pumps. and heavy machines or apparatus would be placed in a small building. detached from the laboratory proper. which must be free from vibration or disturbances of all kinds. The instrument shops would also be in the small building. It will be understood that owing to the requirements of such a building. the appropriation. rather the authorization. is not too large. The building should be built in an isolated place. It should be far enough from the city to insure freedom from the disturbances caused by traffic or electric streetcar lines. but not too far from the Departments and shipping facilities. The site should be large enough to prevent the construction of buildings. streetcar lines. or streets near the laboratory. Mr. Speaker. as I said in the beginning. the bill should pass without a dissenting vote. A summary of the whole situation could not be made in better terms than those used by the honorable Secretary of the Treasury in his statement before the subcommittee in the Senate. He there said: In a most general way I may state that it is open to our observation that a new country is raw in its methods. It does not work by close rule. There is often a large margin for waste. The technical and scientific side of affairs comes later on. when by the development of society the relation of things will become more complex. The law of competition becomes more closely applied. and we learn by slow and painful steps that accuracy and closeness and scientific skill are required to supplement what went on in a tolerably skillful way before. This country has advanced now to a point where in all the great things of life it is In competition with the older and more thoroughly established nations of the world. and by more thoroughly I mean in the experience of trade. in the scientific application of Ideas. and in all the economies which save waste and aid efficiency. In this particular of standardizing weights and measures and testing apparatus of every kind the older countries are far ahead of us. in fact. it may be said that there is no comparison between us. We are dependent utterly upon Germany. perhaps France to some extent. and England for our measurements and those standards which we are obliged to resort to in testing and comparing when we enter into competitive work against them. The application of a standardizing bureau. if established. will be very wide. It touches the manufacturinq arts and commerce and all scientific efforts. and it will be most important in the general work of education. We have come to a period where guesswork will not do and. to use an old familiar phrase. pretty near does not count. Exactness and absolute conformity to standards and uniformity are the essentials. There is another side to that which occurs to me. It may appear to many to have a more sentimental than practical value. but it gives the proposition. to my mind. great force. and that is what might be called the moral aspect of this question. the recognition by the Government of an absolute standard. to which fidelity in all the relations of life affected by that standard is required. We are the victim of looseness in our methods. of too much looseness in our ideas. of too much of that sort of spirit. born out of our rapid development. perhaps. of a disregard or a lack of comprehension of the binding sanction of accuracy in every relation of life. Now. the establishment of a burea.u like this. where the Government Is the custodian and the originator of these standards of weights and measures as applied to all the higher scientific aspects of life which we are so rapidly developing in. hs. to my mind. a value far and above the mere physical considerations which affect It. although those physical considerations are fundamental and most important. Nothing ca dignity this Government more than to be the patron of. and the establisher of. absolutely correct scientific standards and such legislation as will hold our people to faithfully regard and absolutely obey the requirements of law In adhesion to those true and correct standards. Mr. Speaker. I ask for a vote."},{"1":"5.600031e+08","2":"1900","3":"S","4":"GALLINGER","5":"259","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I am trying to do two things. and I hope I shall succeed before I get through. The Grand Army of the Republic have asked for two changes in the act of June 27. 1890. which has frequently been denominated the dependentpension act. They have asked that a widow who is in possession of an income not exceeding $250 in addition to the proceeds of her daily labor. whatever that may be. may become pensionable under this proposed act. They have asked that in making a rating for an exsoldier under this proposed act minor disabilities shall be aggregated. that if the soldier has lost a finger. that shall be taken into account. that if he has incurred a disability which perhaps affects his chest. it shall be taken into account. and that a rating shall be made upon his combined disabilities. Of course in no case could the pension exceed $12 a month. the maximum allowed under the law. As I stated before. the President of the United States in his last message recommended the matter regarding the widows. and thought it would be a proper thing for us to amend the law in that particular. Now. Mr. President. that is all the amendments to the act contemplate as the bill is now before the Senate. I hope it will be allowed to pass. and that if there are wrongs in pension legislation we will take them up at some future time upon the suggestion of Senators or upon imendmnents offered here or bills presented. and that the defects may be cured."},{"1":"5.501574e+08","2":"1899","3":"H","4":"DAYTON","5":"1731","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Exactly so. As a member of that commission the proposition of this amalgamation came from Captain Evans. Now. Mr. Chairman. if members will.pardon me. I want.to call the attention of the House to every single feature of this bill and then briefly point out the reasons for them. First. it provides for the amalgamation of the Engineer Corps with the present line corps. second. it increases the officers in the new line corps 98 in number. third. it provides for a regular and constant flow of. promotion. fourth. it readjusts the numbers in the construction corps. fifth. it provides for the retirement of officers who served in the civil war in the next higher grade. sixth. it provides a change of the name cadet in the Naval Academy to that of midshipman. seventh. it decreases the Naval Academy course from six to four years. eighth. it provides for the appointment of 100 warrant machinists. ninth. it equalizes the pay of the officers in the Navy to that of the Army. grade for grade. tenth. it provides that the term for enlisted men shall be four years. and also provides. as the Army has. for the retirement of enlisted men. finally. it provides a reorganization of the Marine Corps in accordance with the necessities of the increased and enlarged Navy. Now. Mr. Chairman. those are the provisions in this bill. In order that the members of the House may understand it. I want you to go with me aboard of one of our modern battle ships and let us.see if we can understand the internal household affairs in that vessel. I know there are many members here who fully understand these little matters of detail. but there are many to whom they are not so plain. because we do not all live by the sea. Take. for example. the Iowa. one of our latest battle ships. We have there a vessel of 11.500 tons displacement. She has 42 guns aboard her of various and different sizes. all of which are operated by the very finest machinery. She is from 350 to 375 feet long. and from 6 to 72 feet wide. Within those confines is the home of all this controversy. That is the house. that is the fort. that is the arsenal. that is the fighting machine. and by reason of the fact that it is better constructed by American workmen. with American brawn and American brain. and commanded by American officers and manned by American seamen. it stands without a parallel in the world as a fighting machine. She has two engines of about 12.000 horsepower combined. and a large number of other engines and electrical devices for the purpose of operating its 42 guns. and for the purpose of hoisting its ordnance and attending to its internal functions. It is safe to say that on an average there are 150 cylinders in such a vessel under the control of the Enginec - Corps. The average complement of her men will be 450. Thau is the whole force aboard of her. Of this number. on an average. 50 will be marines. 100 will be of the Engineer Corps. and 300 will be the deck force. She will have generally about this number of officers: Eight commissioned line officers. 7 cadets of the line. 4 engineer commissioned officers. 2 engineer cadets. 2 marine officers. 2 doctors. 1 paymaster. 4 warrant officers. and 1 chaplain. Now. the members of the House who are uninformed in regard to these matters will see that there are several different kinds of officers there. The general distinction is line officers. staff officers. and marines. The staff officers include several different corps. namely. the engineers. the doctors. the paymaster. and the chaplain. Let us see for a moment the duties of these people. The commanding line officer will be a captain. who is in general command of the whole force aboard the vessel. a lieutenantcommander. who is the executive officer and general business manager of the ship. Then there will be a lieutenant. the navigator. who attends to the navigation. and alsoI hope the members will mark meit is also the duty of that line officer to attend to the electrical machinery and ordnance. Then there will be three lieutenants. who drill the men on deck and man the guns. there will be two lieutenants of the junior grade or ensigns. whose duties are the same as the last. then there will be the cadets. who are from the Naval Academy. in the last two years of their course. and whose duties are simply to assist these lieutenants in drilling the men. The engineer force will consist of a chief. who will have general charge of the steam machinery. three other officers. who will take charge of the running of the engines. and two cadet officers. who will assist. The marines are substantially the police force on board the ship. There will be two officers of the marines. who will have general charge. In action. in addition to their police duties. they will have charge of what is known as the secondary batterythe small guns. Everybody will understand the duty of the paymaster from the mere name. but in addition to paying the men on board he also has charge of the provisions and clothing. The duties of the doctors will be readily understood. Now we come to the warrant officers. There will be one boatswain. who has general charge of the boats. anchors. and rigging. one gunner. who does not fire the guns at all. his name is misleading. his dfLty is to have charge of the care of the guns and the torpedoes and the ammunition. There will be one carpenter or mate. or both. who will have charge of the interior structural fittings of the ship and its drainage. and finally the chaplain. Now. Mr. Chairman. the first section of this bill provides that the 195 engineer officers shall be put into the new line and made a part of the line corps. This is the amalgamation feature against which objection has been made by the gentleman from New York. I want to stand right here and say that that provision is not illogical. on the contrary. it is strictly logical. and Iwant to point out why. It is logical because it is based upon a logical distinction that exists from the very start between the two general classes of men who are on board that vessel. The chaplain can come from the ministry. the doctor can come from the medical college. the warrant machinist can come from the machine shop. but the line officer can come only from the Naval Academy. and the engineer officer can come only from the same Naval Academy. Under existing law. these two officers must be educated side by side in the Academy. They take the same course for three of the four years that they are in training. On the opening of the last yearbefore their minds have developed. before they have had any experience at sea. before any of the developed thought comes to them. so that you or anybody else could tell their capacity there is an arbitrary distinction made by selection at the Naval Academy. whereby about onefourth or onethird of the class whose members have spent three years in that Academy are assigned to the Engineer Corps and the others to the line corps. What is the effect? Under existing law the onethird who go to the Engineer Corps can never acquire any positive rank. while those who go to the line have rank the moment they finish their course. Both classes of officers command. Never forget the fact that the engineer officer is as much a commander as the officer who is on deck. He has his force down there in the hold. where in battle the severest labor is performed and where the greatest personal responsibility has to be assumedin a living hell when the hell rages above. These men are trained in the Academy for command. and they have by necessity to command. They are not the men who actually have handhold of the machinery. they are the men who direct and control it. They stand with just as full capacity to command as those who may be on deck. Mr. Chairman. years ago the world was thrilled with the spectacle of an engineer of the United States Navy who accomplished the most daring. the bravest act that the worlds history has ever known to have been performed under similar circumstances. and the person who performed that act was George W. Melville. chief engineer in the Navy. and today its Engineer in Chief. This bill draws the distinction between the educated man on board the ship and the uneducated man. We are speaking not of general attainments. but of professional education. Therefore the measure is logical. It places the engineer officers in the class of those who have to command because they do have to command. Now. what are some of the advantages of this provision? First. it brings about harmony. it heals a dissension and a sore that has rankled for thirty years. second. it is economical. third. it gives elasticity. fourth. it gives the true natural distinction. as I have indicated. fifth. it broadens and increases the officers capacity by imposing upon him new responsibility. and. lastly. it fits the personnel to the matdriel. Now. let us look very briefly at these advantages. I say there has been an unfortunate dissension existing for years and years in the Navy between the line and the Engineer Corps. Why? Simply because your boy at the Academy may sleep with my boy. may sit with my boy. may be his boon companion for three years of the course. and then. because your boy is arbitrarily assigned to the Engineer Corps and my boy to the line corps. the separation comes. Your boy never has positive rank. He becomesI will not say what I was about to sayhe becomes a mechanic. sometimes when this bitterness has sprung up between the corps he would be dubbed contemptuously a grease wiper. Yet the boy thus discriminated against may have been at the head of his class. Thus these social distinctions grow up between educated men who are making this service their life study and life work. And the suffering in this respect is more than most of us outside of the Navy can understand or appreciate."},{"1":"5.501457e+08","2":"1898","3":"H","4":"HEPBURN","5":"652","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"I prefer not to get into a controversy with the gentleman. This road owes the Government $59.000.000. There is a sinking fund of some $7.000.000. and there is a judgment. or a series of judgments. in favor of the Southern Pacific Company against the Government amounting to perhaps two millions or two millions and a half more. Now. Mr. Speaker. we can not acquire this property without an expenditure and a loss of $86.000.000. That is the situation now. As security for this immense sum we have a lien upon 860 miles of railwaynot what is commonly known as the Central Pacific Railway connecting the city of Ogden on the east with the city of San Francisco on the west. We have not that. because we have not a lien upon the 5 miles of road leading into the city of Ogden. and we have no lien upon that portion of the Central Pacific road that extends from Sacramento to San Francisco or Oakland. . We have as our security a road that starts from no place and runs to no placestarting 5 miles west of Ogden and reaching the little town of San Jose. Five hundred miles of thatroad run through the wilderness of Nevada. Remember. there are less than 45.000 people. men. women. and children. in the whole State of Nevada. Those 500 miles do not furnish local traffic enough to this road to pay for the oil and the waste with which the axles are greased. That is the character of our security. The debt. I claim. will be more than $100.000 a mile upon the whole length of the road. The gentleman from Nevada has had the frankness to say that in his judgment the road could be duplicated for a vastly less sum than $100.000 a mile. Now we find the gentleman from California reproducing against this proposition the arguments of Dennis Kearney of twenty years ago. The gentleman in all his three hours of assault upon this proposition has said nothing that Dennis Kearney had not long ago saidperhaps said quite as well. He has simply reproduced the arguments of that celebrated California statesman. The gentleman is undoubtedly familiar with all of them. Three times in this Congress we have heard the gentleman make the same argument on this subject. He ought to make it. He is indebted to this road more than any other man in California. Four times he has ridden the road into Congress. and many say that it is within the limits of the gentlemans expectation to ride it into the gubernatorial office of California. I do not know how that is. but I believe as firmly as I believe in my existence that if this company should come here today and offer to lay down at the Treasury the $59.000.000 of its indebtedness. the gentleman from California would find some reason why the offer should not be accepted until after the election of next November. He knows a good horse when he sees it. He knows a wellgaited animal after he has ridden it. and he is too familiar with all the gaits and paces of this animal. and all of the abilities that it possesses. to surrender it without a kick. Now. the selfishness of the gentlemans argument is apparent to everybody. and must be. First. the gentleman asserts. I am told somewhere. mildly. that he is a Democrat. I undertake to say. and think I can prove the assertion. that the gentleman is a Populist. I undertake to say that there is no proposition in the creed of Populism that the gentleman does not subscribe to. without it is possibly the subtreasury scheme. and whether or not he subscribes to both branches of that I do not know. Let me read from the Populist platform: Transportation being a means of exchange and a public necessity. the Government should own and operate the railroads. That is the gentlemans position on that question."},{"1":"5.500424e+08","2":"1897","3":"S","4":"PETTUS","5":"1534","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. I desire to make one plea for the farmer of the United States. I do not propose to discuss the bill generally. I propose to discuss merely those matters referred to by the Senator from Mbntana . which were intended to be for the benefit of the farmers of the United States. not as a tax levied for their benefit. but as an exemption in a very small degree from the burdens of taxation which they have borne these years and years. and borne so patiently. Mr. President. I have a great feeling on this subject. and every other man ought to have. There is not a Senator on this floor who would dare to risk his reputation for veracity by saying that any claim asserted in these exemptions is unjust. There is not a Senator on this floor who would risk his reputation for truth and veracity by asserting that there is anything in these claims but what is right and proper. and more. in accordance with the Republican doctrine itself. or at least not opposed to it. We have different theories on the subject of taxation by the General Government. It is not to combat the theory that is advocated on the other side of the Chamber that I rise to speak. That is not my purpose. That is not my purpose at present. I am making an appeal to Senators. and I am making it in earnest. and I am making it with some hope. I am not saying that the words I am uttering here today will be without efect. I am making it with hope. The title of the bill makes plain the general division between the two great parties. It is An act to provide revenue for the Government. and to that extent it covers the whole of the Democratic doctrine on this subject. But you have added and to encourage the industries of the United States. I am not going to discuss these differences. because I recognize the plainly established fact that a majority of the Senate believe in the doctrine of protection for the sole purpose of protection. not as incidental to the raising of revenue for the support of the Government. but to the entire loss of all revenue from many articles of supposed tariff taxation. In other words. a majority of the Senate believe in a prohibitory tariff on many things for the purpose of protecting American labor and American capital. Now. Senators. though I do not believe in this power. which the majority assert. of putting a tax on the people for the benefit of a particular class. or for the benefit of a combination of casses. as you are doing in this bill. I intend to appeal to the Senators who believe in the doctrine of protection to American labor and American capital for justice. not in opposition to that doctrine. but in strict subordination to it. If Senators believe in this protective system. let them carry it out honestly and fairlynot in a wanton spirit of sectionalism or in utter disregard of the principles of common honesty and fair dealing. Be just to all classes and sections so far as you can whilst adhering to your protective principles. A decided majority of the Senate put bagging for cotton and cotton ties and bags for grain and the material of which they are made on the free.list and gave the Western people a clhance to build houses to shelter their families by reducing the tax on whitepine lumber to $1 per thousand feet. In neither one is there any infraction of any principle of the Republican party as proclaimed to the world. The farmers of this great country asked the Senate. not *to tax others for their benefit. but to allow them to buy lumber not excessively taxed. for the purpose of building humble homes for their wives and children in the great West. Senators. have you ever seen that grand and wonderful country. the great Northwest? I saw it. many years ago. as the allwise and merciful God made it. before the untiring labor. determined courage. and neverending perseverance of the AngloSaxon pioneer had sublued the most fierce and bloodthirsty of the savage races. and encountered and overcome thousands of other dangers and hardships. and built up avast empire as parts of the United States. Do not these hardy men of the West deserve some consideration from the Senate of the Thuited States? They are. in the full sense of the word. American laborers. and they are very numerous. Oh. yes. Mr. President. the farmers for whom I am speaking constitute largely more than onehalf of all the laborers in the United States. and the pretense is that we are legislating for the benefit of laborers. It is a damnable pretense merely. In this matter they are asking very littlenot onethousandth part. in value. of the benefits which this bill gives to capital invested in manufacturing industries. And. Senators. I also appeal to you for justice to the farmers of my own State and sectioniAmerican laborers. menwhom I know and have known for generations. As a peopleI speak of the AngloSaxon racethey are the equals of the people of any other State or section of this grand country. Ju.y 23. equals in all the qualities which go to constitute real manhood. equals in courage. in patriotism. in morals. and in loyalty. Our people are not the equals of some others in their devotion to the almighty dollar. but even in that regard there are grave fears that there is a change going on in that direction. I speak only what I know of these American laborers -the farmers of the South. I claim descent directly from that class. And right here I desire to affirm that ninetynine out of every one hundred men in the United States who have been useful to their country. in peace or in war. were the descendants of farmers or other laboring men. You gentlemen from New Hampshire boast of the parentage of Daniel Webster. Who was his father? Do you not know that it was a farmer. a hardhanded farmer and leader in his neighborhood among farmers. who commanded your armies in the early days in that particular locality. who raised up that great man to honor his country? And who was the father of Andrew Jackson? A farmer. Who was the father of Abraham Lincoln? A farmer. You boast of these great men. you make parade of them. and you may justly do it. for they were great men. I only name them as a part of the class. Every man who ever did any good for his country. so far as I know or am informed. came directly from a farmer or some other laboring man. The fact of the business is that labor is essential to real manhood. I was drawn into these remarks about the men of our section by a brutal sarcasm uttered on this floor to the effect that the people of the South were becoming civilized. The Senate passed the votes to which I have alluded. putting these articles on the free list and reducing the tax on white pine. by a very decided majority. Not only did the Senate pass them by a decided majority. but a technical objection being made when they were stricken from the taxable list. thej were then put on the free list by a separate. independent. and a decided vote. And when the Senate thus decided that justice and fair dealing required that bagging and ties for cotton and bags for farmers. use should be put on the free list. and tbdt farmers in the Northwest should not be taxed more than $1 per thousand on the lumber which they were forced to buy to make homes for their wives and children. the country rejoiced. Yes. Mr. President. not the farmers. but the country rejoiced. Senators here on this floor. all of them I have no doubt. received telegram on telegram rejoicing over the returning sense of justice in this Chamber. That vote gave almost universal satisfaction. It was not at all because of the amount involved. It is a small matter as compared with other things involved in the bill. So I say the country rejoiced not because of the importance of the thing itself. but because of what it indicated as the sense of the Senate of the United States. that body to which all conservative men are bound to look. if they look at all. for justice. I say deliberately that it is the only deliberative body that concerns the administration and the enactment of the laws of the United States. No man can look elsewhere for anything that approximates justice. It was because the vote indicated that there were men in the Senate of the United States. and a majority of them. who were not willing to sacrifice truth and justice and honor and fair dealing merely to accommodate the combinations of people who were calling on them to tax every other man for their benefit. I suppose it gave universal satisfaction to all except a few men."},{"1":"5.400421e+08","2":"1896","3":"S","4":"FAULKNER","5":"142","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"If the Senator from South Dakota will permit me.

I rise today on this solemn occasion of the Congressional Prayer and Fast Vigil for Soviet Jewry to once again focus our attention on the tragic and appalling situation facing the Jews of the Soviet Union. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues Congressmen KEMP. LANTOS. MRAZER. and PORTER for organizing this special order. This June marks the 14th anniversary of the infamous Leningrad trials. These trials. in 1970. were a historic event In Soviet Jewrys struggles to leave the Soviet Union. 11 people were charged with treason. their only desire was to emigrate from the Soviet Union. The impact of the trials and the cruel sentences were intended to frighten other Soviet Jews. heighten antiSemitism in the Soviet Union. and point out the vigilance of the Soviet judicial system. Although most of the 11 defendants are free now. they owe their freedom to the worldwide pressure that was brought to bear on the Soviets because of the cruelty and severity of the original sentences meted out to the defendants. It was precisely because of the international reaction to the trials that the sentences were reduced from death to prison terms ranging from 7 to 15 years. Mr. Speaker. I recently had the privilege of attending a communitywide meeting in my district at which Yosef Mendelevich. one of the 11 defendants of the Leningrad trials. was the featured guest. He told the assembled crowd that the American public must keep up the pressure on the Russians to allow thousands of Soviet Jews to leave Russia. Mr. Mendelevich said that last year 40.000 Soviet Jews asked to leave Russia and that 400.000 more had applied for visas for the first time. He noted that increased emigration of Soviet Jews is linked to outcries and pressure from the West. The issue of Soviet Jewry must stay in the forefront of our activity here. for the sad and tragic fact is that in April 1984. only 51 Jews left the Soviet Union. The total for the year is only 280. This terrible situation has been exacerbated by the rapid rise of antiSemitism in the Soviet Union. In Government publications. Israel and Zionism are equated with the Nazis and Nazism. The Hebrew language has been outlawed. Jews have been fired from their jobs. and Jewish homes have been raided by the police to seize religious material. The Soviet authorities are even preventing mail and prepaid packages from the West from reaching the Jews of Russia. In the face of this ongoing tragedy. we must double and redouble our efforts to focus world pressure on the Soviet Union to allow their Jewish citizens to emigrate and to bring to an end this vicious antiSemitic campaign. We must make it clear to the leaders of the Soviet Government that their attempts to silence the Jews of Russia will not go unnoticed and unprotested here in Congress. We must let the leaders in the Kremlin know that we are outraged over their treatment of the Jews of Russia. and we must also let the Jews of Russia know that we do care and that we have not forgotten them and their struggles. It is only by means of pressure on the Soviet leaders that Jewish emigration will increase and the Jews of Russia will not have to live in constant fear of losing their jobs. their heritage. and their lives. Mr. Speaker. this special order is intended to call attention to what is happening today in the Soviet Union. It is my fervent hope and prayer that a year from now there will be no need for this special order and that the Jews of the Soviet Union will be free to emigrate and free to practice Judaism and free to enjoy their rich cultural heritage.9"},{"1":"5.201285e+08","2":"1893","3":"S","4":"WOLCOTT","5":"517","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I have been told so outside generally. and I find the direct statement included in our testimony. so I assume it to be true. I assume that the humanitarians who desire to legislate respecting other peoples property so freely would at least have found out if that were not the fact and have so advised us. It certainly appears. so far as the testimony yet taken is concerned. that the people for whose benefit we desire to legislate do not want this kind of legislation. and the reason of it is partially a reason not stated here. The moment you get a purely automatic coupler skilled labor becomes of no value. the veriest farm hand taking his trip for the first time along the iron rails is just as good a car coupler. just as good a man to ride on the top of a freight train as the switchman or the brakeman who has spent his life in that pursuit. So their testimony should be taken with some grains of allowance. yet it is a fact that they themselves do not believe that the question has yet been solved. Mr. President. it is not. I take it. the desire of the Senate to legislate for the mere sake of legislating. If everything is being done that can be done. and if legislation can accomplish no useful purpose. or if legislation is unnecessary. I assume that it is not the desire of a majority of the members of the Senate to pass a bill. As to the first section of the bill there is something which should be said. We propose to require by that section that railroads shall do two things: that before a certain date in 1895 they shall. first. equip all their locomotive engines with air brakes. and. in addition to that. in the same section. or the section following. uron the subject of air brakes. we then propose to require them that after this certain date they shall operate no trains of freight cars enough of which are not equipped with the air brake operated from the engine to absolutely control the operation of the train so that hand brakes may not be required. Mr. President. that is rather a sweeping measure. We ought to know how many of the locomotive engines of the country are at present so equipped. We ought to know whether the railroad companies are negligent in the equipment of their new engines. We ought to know something as to the present construction of motive power. We ought also to know how great a change will be required in the equipment of the freight cars in existence in the United States. The coupling is one thing. That costs from twentyfive to forty dollars a car. The equipping of every one of the freight cars with an air brake is an entirely different question and involves an expense. I believe. of somewhere from fifty to one hundred dollars. If the Senator from New Jersey knows. he or somebody will correct me if I am wrong in my statement of this expense."},{"1":"5.200353e+08","2":"1892","3":"H","4":"BOWERS","5":"3595","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"expected members of the House to believe that his 56pound block would not have been produced but for the McKinley act. He either did not know what the law was himself. or he assumed that other members did not know. or else he expected them to believe that a tariff tax. which has not been imposed and will not be for more than fifteen months to come. has already brought the tinmining industry into existence. In any case. his performance was not complimentary to the intelligence of the House. The laughter with which it was greeted was appropriate. whether members knew exactly what they were laughing at or not. I may be permitted to further remind the distinguished gentleman from Maine that twentyfive years ago. before the adoption of his system of protection. we had no anarchists. no Mafias. no Molly Maguires. no dudes. or no billiondollar Congresses in this country. Hence he ought not to question but that all these beneficent blessings have been bestowed upon us by reason of his great American system of protection. Passing from these particular examples and many others that Imight mention. and which the other side see proper to ignore. I come to a subject still more directly to the pointone which was extensively and learnedly discussed by the gentleman from Maine. In my humble judgment the wool question is the best illustration. the best object lesson (with one exception. perhaps. to which I shall call attention later on) of the folly. unwisdom. and injustice of a protective system. the statements of my colleague. Mr. JOSEPH D. TAYLOR. this afternoon to the contrary notwithstanding. The system of protection is advocated and justified by its friendsFirst. Because it tends to encourage home industries and home markets. Second. Because. if not prohibitory. it provides a revenue for the Government. One of the principal arguments of protectionists here. on the stump. and elsewhere. is that the United States. by reason of the diversity and extent of her soil and climate. and the inventive genius of her people. can profitably produce and manufacture substantially everything that is necessary for the comfort of mankind. provided she is protected by a sufficiently high tariff against the pauper labor of Europe and other countriesI was about to say. and other foreign countries. But that would have been an egregious mistake. as they make the same demand for protection against Mexico and Canada. adjoining us on the south ad north. respectively. and having the same diversity of soil and climate in the same localities respectively. It has been and is now their stock argument that when any industry is thus fostered and protected it is only a question of time. and that. too. but a reasonable time. until we will be enabled not only to supply our home market cheaper than ever before. but will be exporting those products and wares to foreign lands. Such is the protection theory fairly and fully expressed. as I understand it. But it is an old and wise saw which says that One fact is worth a bushel of theories. And to this should be linked that other old maxim. viz. Experience is the best school. Hence let us hurriedly apply the Republican theory of protection to the woolen industry in the light of experience. and see what are the facts. It will be conceded by all at the outset that woolen goods form one of the greatest necessities of the American people. and therefore it will be conceded by all consistent Republicans at least. or ought to be conceded by all. that no tariffno high tariffshould be placed on it for revenue purposes only. being one of the great necessaries of life and justifiable. if at all. on the ground that such tariff is necessary to protect and foster the wool industry. It. will be conceded also. I doubt not. that both wool and woolen goods have been protected since 1867 by a very high duty. the tariff or duty on the latter now averaging about 92 per cent. and on the former about 60 per cent. under the present law. as will appear from the fol]owing statements taken from the able speech of the gentleman from Kentucky .

In other words. these official figures show that if the sheep had increased in number in the same ratio as the population Michigan should now have. in round numbers. 7.000.000 head of sheep. whereas she has but 2.250.000. Pennsylvania should have 5.600.000 head of sheep. whereas she has but 1.000.000. Kentucky should have 1.250.000 head of sheep. whereas she has but 800.000. Indiana should have 3.750.000 head of sheep. whereas she has but 1.250.000. and Ohio should have 9.250.000 head of sheep. whereas she has but 4.000.000. Nor is this decrease or loss. or rather want of increase or gain. which should follow if the th eory of protection is right. confined to these five central States or to any particular locality. In 1868 there were in all the States east of the Mississippi River 33.895.674 head of sheep. while in 1890 there were but 17.116.306 head of sheep. showing a loss of over 49 per cent. The gain in population in these States for the twenty years ending with 1860 was nearly 48 per cent. The same ratio of gain in the number of sheep would give us.in these States alone. over 50.000.000 head. whereas. as stated before. we now have less than twofifths of this number. In the whole Union we had. in 1870. 28.477.347 head of sheep. In 1890 we had 44.336.072. In 1870 our population in round numbers was about 38.500.000. while teday it is 63.000.000 in round numbers. showing a gain of about 62 per cent. In 1870 our total estimated wealth was about $30.000.000.000. Today it is about $60.000.000.000. showing a gain of 100 per cent. Now. I contend that in order that I may be convinced that the sheep industry can be successfully fostered and maintained by this high beneficent tariff on wool and woolen goods. which has taken millions and millions of dollars annually from the pockets of the people for the last twentyfive years. I should be confronted with some statistics showing me that the wool industry has fairly kept pace with the general progress of the Union. I maintain that a fair test of this question is a comparison with -.the general wealth and the population of the country. because as the population increases the demand. the necessity for wool. in this whole country especially. increases in the same proportion. And if we increase in wealth alone the same argument would apply. because the more money we have to expend the more and better the clothing. carpets. bedding. etc.. we will purchase and use. What do we ascertain to be the fact as to the development of the wool industry during the last quarter of a century in this country? While during said time. as before stated. our population has increased more than 62 per cent. and our aggregate wealth more than 100 per cent. the number of sheep has increased but 56 per cent. Little wonder the people cry out how long. oh high and mighty protectionist. how long must we carry this burden in order to demonstrate that your theory is a miserable failure? When we look at the value of the sheep and quantity of wool produced we find this failure more than corroborated. And for the purpose of fairly considering these branches of the wool tariff I will here insert in my remarks a table taken from the report of the minority of the committee. showing the number and value of the sheep. and the number of pounds of wool produced for the past twentyone years. from 1871to January. 1892. both inclusive.

That in 1871 the number of pounds of wool produced was 160.000.000. while the number of pounds produced in 1891 was 285.000.000. thus showing that during said periods of twentyone years there was a gain in value of $34.000.000. and in quantity of 125.000.000 pounds. And yet. notwithstanding this apparently fair increase in value and in quantity. and notwithstanding the high tariff. we are confronted with the discouraging and humiliating fact. as shown on page 19 of said minority report. that we were compelled to and did import from foreign countries considerably over 100.000.000 pounds of wool in the year 1890 in order to supply a home market for h ome consumption only. I say home consumption only. because our exportation of manufactured woolen goods is but a mere trifle. being another illustration of the boasted beneficent and encouraging effects of a Republican system of protection. This is building up and supplying a home market with a vengeance is it not? By further reference to the tables we ascertain that the average price per pound for fine. mediuni. and coarse wools in January. 1871. was 45j cents. while in 1891 it had fallen to an average of but 331 cents per pound. But the most convincing proof of the utter failure of the protective system as applied to this industry. and one that I have never heard contradicted. is that at a time when we had as many sheep and as many pounds of wool per capita as we have now. at a time when we had a low tariff as compared with the present one. and when money was as valuable as now. our farmers received from 20 to 40 per cent more per pound for their wool than they do today. For the purpose of illustratiug this point more in detail I will here insert a table showing the prices of the same wools in the same markets for the eleven years beginning with 1847 and ending with 1857. both inclusive. known as the antiwar freetrade period: Price per pound.

In other words. for illustration. assuming that all the wool now produced is of this grade. the farmers of today. under a high protective. beneficent Republican tariff system. are receiving in round numbers for their anual woolclip the sum of $96.000.000. for which same quality of wool they would have received under a low Democratic revenue tariff the sum of $115.000.000. showing an actual net loss to our farmers by reason of the present system of the enormous sum of $19.000.000 annually. But this is not all. Last but not least. by any means. of the articles to which I desire to call the attention of the committee. and the gentlemen on the other side. is that of shoddy! shoddy! I doubt whether there is a man within this Hall who ever heard of such a material before the war of the rebellion. Yet in 1890 the value of this product in twelve States only was more than $9.000.000. the increase from 1880 to 1890 being nearly 88 per cent. As more plainly indicating the enormous increase in this product and its deleterious effect on our woolgrowers. I quote very briefly from page 20 of the majority report: The whole number of sheep in the United States for the census year of 1890 was 44.336.072. the fleece amounted to 277.000.000 pounds. These fleeces produced 92.000.000 pounds of scoured wool. while the ninetyfour establishments engaged in manufacturing shoddy produced a wool product equal to that of 29.605.168 sheep. In other words. Mr. Chairman. in the. year ]890 shoddy displaced or supplied the place of 29.605.168 sheep in this country. ow grateful. indeed. our farmers ought to be to the gentleman from Maine and his party who are advocates of our great American system of protection. under which and by means of which this new product has developed and grown to such alarming proportions. But the most excruciating portion of the great speech of the gentleman from Maine is his statement therein that the Republican party has always been the true friend of the farmer. and it will oppose this bill now under consideration because it discriminates against the farmer in favor of the manufacturer. When the distinguished gentleman made this statement. I imagined I could see a peculiar twinkle in the eye of the little band of Alliance. or third party Representatives ever there. all of whom. with one exception perhaps. now occupy those seats in this Hall from the heretofore great Republican States of Kansas. Minnesota. and Nebraska. because of the wellknown and wellunderstood friendship of the leaders of the great 4epublican party for the farmers of this country. When he made that statement. I imagined that they. in conjunction with myself and many others on this side of the House felt like exclaiming aloud: Then God save us from our friends. If the gentleman was sincere and notsarcastic. why did he not explain to the farmers how it comes about that. whereas before his system of protection was invoked in the land. they. the farmers. owned more than 50 per cent of the wealth of the country. they now own less than onefourth of it? Why did he not explain the enormous increase of their mortgage indebtedness during the twentyfive years of Republican protection? Why did he not explain to them the reason that in my own great State of Ohio. where by reason of careful fertilization the soil is just as rich and productive as it ever was. where the farms have been continually improved also by good turnpikes. ditches. fences. houses. and other appurtenances. the farms today are worth many millions of dollars less than they were ten years ago? As stated in the report accompanying the bill under consideration. this bill. which is to take effect the 1st day of January. 1893. provides in brief for the admission. free of duty. of all wools. hair of camel. goat. alpaca. and other like animals. and of wool and hair on the skin. noils. top waste and other wastes. and rags. composed wholly or in part of wool. and also repeals what are known as compensatory duties on woolen goods. and reduces the ad valorem duties on such goods. It also reduces the duty on imported woolens. etc.. from an average rate of about 92 per cent under the present McKinley law to an average of about 35 per cent. The low rate of duty. as compared with the present law. on imported woolens. etc.. is retained so as to afford ample protection for the difference in wages and other cost of production in Europe and in the United States. Personally. I would have preferred that some other reason had been assigned for the retention of this duty on woolen products. for I am of the opinion that so long as our shores are wide open to the pauper or cheap laborers of Europe. no tariff can protect our workingmen against their competition and labor. But as men of better judgment and experience in my own party differ from me in this opinion. thus raising a doubt in my mind. I am willing to resolve that doubt. as all lawmakers should in all cases. in favor of the workingmen of America. I would prefer to say that this duty is retained first. because of the revenue. the necessary revenue it will produce. and second. and more especially because all reduction and revision of the tariff should be made gradually. cautiously. and discreetly. so as to not unnessarily disturb and possibly disrupt any of the great industries of our country. I have the honor to represent upon this floor a very large agricultural district in Ohio. with a constituency composed in a large part of honest. industrious. intelligent. and frugal farmers and wageworkers. Although these farmers own a great many sheep. 166.000 head in the six counties yielding more than a million pounds of wool. the vote I shall cast for this bill. thanks to their intelligence and understanding of the subject.will meet with the approbation of a very large majority of them.

I shall vote for it. not only because I believe it to be for the best interest of my immediate constituents. but because it will be for the best interest of our common country. as long as our public revenue or any considerable portion of it is raised by a tariff system. For these same reasons. when the opportunity is presented I shall vote for free bindingtwine and agricultural machinery. free cottonties. cottonbagging. etc.. free lumber. free salt. free sugar without bounties. and free American ships without subsidies. If. by reason of these reductions of the tariff. we should reduce the public revenue below the needs of the Government honestly and economically administered. I would make up the deficiency by a wellregulated. wellgraded income tax. the reasons for which I hope to give this House at some length before the close of the present Congress. By the passage of these and similar bills. and by the exercise of the utmost economy in our public expenditures. consistefit with the general welfare and proper administration of the Government. we will not only rebuke the last billiondollar Congress. but we will be carrying out the solemn pledges we made to the people who sent us here. and hence can feel assured that when these same people again speak through the ballot box next fall. not only this House. but the whole Administration will once more be intrusted to the only true party and true friend of the great masses of the peoplethe great Democratic party. that will live forever."},{"1":"5.101791e+08","2":"1891","3":"H","4":"BAKER","5":"555","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. my acquaintance with the departed friend whose memory we honor today began in the early days of the last Congress. That acquaintance ripened into friendship in this Congress through association with him in the closer official relation which followed as members of the Committee on Commerce. As in the House. so he was in our committee. He gave prompt. intelligent. and faithful service. always manifesting an earnest desire to perform his full share of the arduous duties with which he was charged. I was impressed with the belief that his participation in the duties of public life was inspired with a fall realization of the high responsibility resting upon him. He was honest and capable. fearless and independent. and personally controlled by a warm and friendly spirit. He inspired faith in mankind and commanded the confidence of all. His sincerity won my esteem not only for him as a man. but a firm belief that he was eminently worthy of the high trust confided to him by the suffrage of his constituency. Hence. when he came to bid me good bye just as hedeparted fora visit to hisdistrict. I could but wish for him a continuance of the honors he had so worthily worn. Little did we realize that a last good bye on this side of the river had been spoken as he left. Truly. Life treads on life and heart on heart. We press too close in church and mart To keep a dream or grave apart. In a few weeks. Mr. Speaker. the pleasant associations experienced during the past six years of my own Congressional life will terminate. but time can never terminate the friendships formed. while the memory of those of our colleagues whom God hath called from labor to eternal rest will ever be cherished. It is proper that we should pay honor in this way to the memory of our deceased friend and associate. May we not in so doing afford consolation to an afflicted household and at the same time give new luster to those graces. Faith. Hope. and Charity. which are the divine characteristics of every manly heart ? We should be reminded that we are rapidly pressing on toward the same dark river over which our friend has passed.

I hear some objection made to a bounty on the ground of its lack of permanency. It is proposed in the bill to give a bounty of 2 cents per pound on sugar grown from sugarcane. sorghum. or from beets. and it is conceded that if sugar can be produced from sorghum and beets it could be made a success within that time. Objection is made zon the ground that a subsequent Congress could cancel this bounty. That. Mr. Chairman. is unquestionably true. but the fact is that the Senate of the United States is today Republican and will be so for many years to come. the allotment of this bounty is in the nature of a contract between the sugarproducer and his Government. and it will be so considered. and in my opinion there will be no attempt made to disturb it. and in this connection let me say that in my deliberate judgment it is in the interest of the sugarcanegrowers who do not produce more than 10 per cent. of our sugar consumption to accept the provision of this bill. for. sir. so pronounced is the demand for free sugar that if this measure shall fail. the Fiftysecond Congress. whether it may be Republican or Democratic. will be compelled to place sugar on the freelist. even if it shall be done without -any protection to the American growers. Sir. in the debate on the trust bill on May 2 the gentleman from Tennessee stated that the Republican bill of the Ways and Means Committee was in the interest of the sugar trust by reason of the fact that it gives the refiners 40 cents per 100 pounds by way of protecting that industry. The majority of the committee recognize the fact that the refining industry employs in its business a large number of men in many branches of labor. Many men are engaged in the labor of making the 11.500.000 barrels used annually by the refining industry. It requires. sir. 30.000 kegs of nails to nail the hoops of these barrels. Many are also engaged in other branches of this industry. Sir. the majority of the committee believe that this labor should be kept employed at fair wages at home rather than have the refining business transferred to foreign countries. Let me call the attention of my friend from Tennessee to the difference between this bill and the Democratic bill. the passage of which the gentleman so eloquently discussed and urged two years ago. The Democratic bill made a horizontal cut of 20 per cent.. thereby reducing the revenue $12.000.000 annually. The Democratic bill preserved the differential rate in favor of the refiners at from 60 cents to about $1 per hundred pounds. Let me also call the attention of the gentleman from Tennessee to the additional fact that the first bill which came from his committee two years ago made the dividing line at No. 16. but it has been stated and not denied that when the sugartrust people came over here from New York. No. 16 was stricken out and No. 13 inserted in the bill. thereby forcing every pound of sugar imported through the meltingkettles of the refiner."},{"1":"5.100012e+08","2":"1889","3":"S","4":"BLAIR","5":"51","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"It is probably a claim that has been considered in former Congresses. and has been sent to the Committee on Claims.

Measter & Co.. of Greenwich. N. Y. Since that time. having an interest in this industry. I have taken pains to examine all that is contained in Secretary Mannings volume. which he furnished to the last Congress. Not one of the letters bears on the trend of the reduction of this duty. The gentleman from Arkansas. in the remarks he made a few moments ago. seemed to think there was no infringement at all on the workers wages here. He fiails to take into account this fact: That most of these great industries that are affected now have come into this country and have been built up in this country since the Morrill bill went into effect. Consequently what argnment of the gentleman may remain in respect to the wage question and in respect to the difference between raw material products and wages can not certainly hold good now. Without trespassing further on thetime of the House. I desire to send to the Clerks desk the report of Secretary Manning. and have read a portion of the letter of J. R. Leeson & Co.. of Boston. who are the agents of the Grafton Thread Mills. From that letter. Mr. Chairman. the Holse can get exact data of the difference between one of the best running threadmills in the world. at Johnstone. Scotland. and the Grafton Mills. in Massachusetts. The letter is as follows: BOSTON. Yovember 6. 1885. Sip: referring tothe Treasurycircular sent to the Grafton Flax Mills. asking for information in regard to linenthread manufacturing.we beg to submit briefly our replies upon the main points suggested therein. 1lagcs.-Tlhe wages paid throughout all the manufacturing departments at urs per week. TVork 60 hours per week. Grafton are fully double what are paid at the Jolustone Mills for exactly the same work. In many cases the Grafton ratesaro 200 per cent. greater. and itis certainly within the mark to state that the wages at Grafton are double those paid in Johnstone for the same work and time. Machinery.-Thc machinery at Grafton was all imported. as no flax machinery. such as is there used is. to our knowledge. made in the United States. The duty on the machinerywas 35 per cent.. and on the brass and steel portions 45 per cent. ad valorem. With transit and other incidental charges added. the cost at Grafton was 50 per cent. higher than in Scotland. Buildings.-Such experience as we have had of building in the United States leads to the conclusion that a mill here costs at least double what thesamoe mill would cost in Scotland. With buildings and maelineryeosting 100 per cent. higher. it will be seen that a mill in the United States. fully equipped for running. will involve double the capital and interest charges of an establishment in Scotland. Supplies.-Gcncral mill supplies arc as a rule dearer at Grafton than at Johnstone. although oils are somewhat less here. but on the whole prices here for supplies are higher than in Scotland. Coal.-This is a very important item. and it is considerably dearer at Grafton than at Johnstonc. Coal has never been lower at Grafton than 64.50 per ton. while at Johnstone a similar quality could be bought for $1.25 to Q1.50 per ton. The cost of coal at Grafton. therefore. will be fully three times the cost at John. stone. From the foregoing it will be seen that the cost of manufacturing threadsat Grafton is very much greater than in Scotland: (1) the duty of 5 to 7 per cent. on the raw material used. (2) building costs 100 per cent. more. (3) machinery costs 50 per cent. more. (4) coal costs 200 per cent. more. (5) wages are at least 100 per cent. higher. Under such circumstances a protective duty on the mianufactured thread is absolutely essential to the existence of an American linenthread mill. Taking into consideration all the various items of increased cost as enumerated. we are fully satisfied that any reduction of the present rate of duty on linen thread. which is 40 per cent. ad valorem. would entail the most scriousresults upon linenthread manufacturing in the United States. and would make it extremely difficult for domestic thread manufacturers to hold their own against foreignmade thread. We beg to remain. sir. with great respect. Yours. faithfully."},{"1":"4.901246e+08","2":"1887","3":"S","4":"CALL","5":"1642","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"The question whether it is carried at a loss will involve several different elements. The specific article may be carried at a loss in the individual cases. The bulk of the articles may not be carried at a loss. Of course. if in general terms all the through business is carried at a loss then unquestionably the local business has to pay it. But you provide a rule by which you say that in all cases this through business is carried at a loss to the injury of the intermediate shipper. the local man. because he has to pay more for carrying it 10 miles or a hundred miles than the through business pays for carrying it 500 miles or the whole distance. I say there is no foundation for that proposition. It is unknown. It is one that can not be sustained. It rests upon quantities and elements which nobody can ascertain and nobody can determine. but it is peculiar to each particular case. I desire to say that it is no remedy for these evils. I desire to say that it is no triumph to those who desire that the interstate commerce of this country shall be regulated and that transportation shall be made as cheap as possible. with a just system of economy in the operation. maintenance. and compensation for money actually and honestly used in the construction of these highways. For myself. I do not want any halfway or halting measures on this subject. nor to be drawn away by them from the great fact that we are only. providing methods by which this vast amount of over three thousand millions of dollars. for which no consideration and no value has ever been given. shall be freed from the labor and products of the people with the least amount of inequality and oppression. Now. Mr. President. we come to another proposition. which I think is the great crowning feature of this bill. and which receives my most hearty commendation. With so powerful an agency as this the abuses of power by which it has created all the great evils which the Senators from Kentucky and Texas referred to in their speeches. with a power of collecting greater revenues than the Federal Government. with its nine hundred million or its one thousand million dollars of annual tax levied as its gross earnings upon the labor of this country. upon the food and clothing of this country. upon the comforts of the laborers of this country. with its vaster power of annual taxation than all the States possess. with its between three and four thousand million dollars of fraudulent debts. fraudulent not in the terms of the law. but in fact issued upon false pretenses. because it hag the power to tax the people for it. With this vast power it is evident that no citizen can obtain any right by litigation. Assuming. which is not always the case. that the judge is incorruptible. assuming that he is not influenced by the political. the social. the professional considerations which those who represent this great power are able to cast around him. assuming that he is not mercenary and venaland there are many cases. I am afraid. in which the facts would justify condemnation and conviction of persons occupying this -high station in these relations. assuming all that to be true. supposing the judge to be honest. incorruptible. wise. and learned. our system of law. and any system of law. and every system of law belonging to modern times will enable natural or artificial persons of vast wealth to maintain an endless litigation. What is the citizen to do when deprived of his right. when his property is taken from him. when excessive rates are imposed upon him. when an interest in his neighbors business is taken by a great transportation company. his freights delivered at lower charges. when his town property is destroyed by the building of another town. by establishing a depot. because they have been paid to leave his place of business and the natural place of delivery of trade and build their depot elsewhere two or three or four miles from the town. as I have seen done. and as is frequently done? What is he to do? Sue in the courts? Such a suit is useless. it is beyond his means. He is entirely at their mercy. he has no rights. Very often the men who own the stock or these corporations. broadminded. liberalminded men. merchant princes of finance and commerce. have no knowledge of the manner in which these roads are operated. The shipper is completely at the mercy of the management of the road. How is he to be protected? The bill provides. I think. a great remedy. It provides that the power of this great Government. that the power of the peoples President. their exJAuARY 12. ceutive. their representative. directly responsible every four years to them and amenable to their servants in the Senate and in the House of Representatives for his official conduct. shall be charged with the duty of depending and prosecuting and protecting that right of the humblest citizen. I regard this as the great and crowning feature of the bill. the appointment of these commissioners. themselves amenable to the President. the President amenable to the people for their official and personal responsibility in the administration of this great trust. the greatest and most important possessed by his office in time of peace. He is charged with the duty. under this bill. of protecting the humblest citizen. and I commend the bill in this respect. it excuses many defects and many shortcomings. I am inclined to vote for the bill notwithstanding the objections I have pointed out. but I would prefer. if it were possible. that it should be further considered by the conference committee. I would prefer that these provisions should be modified. I believe that it is true of this long and short haul provision that it is useless. unnecessary. and perhaps injurious. and that it is a mere definition of what is a reasonable rate. I think that provision of the law (although the commission has the right to supersede it. to set it aside in cases where it presses hardly) might operate injuriously at times. Take. for instance. the State I represent. There are many lines of road having the same terminal points of departure and arrival connected as lines with other lines.the Coast Line. the Kenesaw Line. I see the enterprising Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company have just opened a line now by the Kenesaw route into Florida and Louisiana. Take these different lines of road diverging and traversing different distances. at a very great difference of cost of operation. and very great difference of cost of construction. some going by Pensacola. some going by Macon. Ga.. others going by Charleston. Savannah. Richmond. Washington. and following the coast line. others going by Cincinnati. the Pennsylvania Central. and the Baltimore and Ohio. These different lines of road are all used by our people. They make their rates of freight. in one sense of the word. under a certain degree of competition. that is. they know that if they do not agree upon some basis which is reasonable to the people. one or the cheapest line will be preferred. But this provision of the law in regard to long and short hauls may place the whole traffic in the power of the shortest line. So far as pools operate to prevent a reasonable rate on either or all of these several lines they are very objectionable. I am willing to legislate that they shall not combine for any unreasonable rate that would be wrong. but what do we do when we say now that none of these lines of roads shall impose on this interstate commerce from the State of Florida coming along any part of that line a higher rate for the short distance than for the long one? I do not know. you do not know. whether that specific sum will be the sum that will enable some of those lines to do any part of the business. You do not know but that the shortest line may be enabled to do the carriage profitably under this rule and that the longer lines can not. Therefore you destroy the possibility of competition in that respect. While I do not think that result would occur. because the margin between the difference between the charge frr the longer distance and the charge for the shorter is so great that you could probably find no shorthaul freight that would come within it that would not pay a compensatory amount. I think it is uncertain. and therefore an unwise provision. Representing a terminal State. approving the policy of the bill. the spirit of the bill. objecting most earnestly as I do to the implied legalization of the bill of $3.000.000.000 of fraudulent debt upon the people of this country and $300.000.000 of annual taxation for nothing. objecting to legalizing this enormous and oppressive taxation upon the people. I still approve the policy. the great features of the measure. and expressing my dissent upon these subjects I now expect to give the bill ultimately my support. but I should prefer and I should vote for its further consideration upon these points by the committee of conference if there was or shall appear to be any reasonable probability of a modification of its provisions. and of action at this session. but I am satisfied that every interest of the people and of the railway corporations themselves demand that the power of Congress should be asserted and exercised over themin respect to the interstate commerce of the country.

I do not yield to any man on this floor or elsewhere in my support of public schools. I have as high an opinion of the great work of the public schools as any person can possibly have. I am anxious to extend to all parts of the country financial aid if it be necessary. and I am also anxious to go beyond that. to create in the minds of the people a desire to keep up public schools and an attachment for the publicschool system. I ventured the other day when this bill was before the Senate to criticise its terms. I regret to say that this appeared to meet disapprobation on the part of some of the friends of the bill. and there was at least the intimation. if nothing further. that the opposition to the bill was not in good faith but was made for the purpose of defeating the appropriation. So far as I am personally concerned I have no constitutional objections to the bill. I have no constitutional difficulties in dealing with this subject. Long ago. on this floor and elsewhere. I have committed myself unequivocally. unhesitatingly. unrestrictedly. to the power of the General Government to contribute out of its great abundance to the support of public schools anywhere within its j urisdiction. I have no difficulty in following such appropriations by Federal control. I have no doubt of the proposition that when the General Government has contributed the money the General Government may also direct where it shall go and how it shall be expended. I do not see myself how any man on either side of the Chamber can maintain that the right exists in the General Government to appropriate the money. and yet that the General Government has not the power to direct its expenditure. It does not follow because the power exists in the General Government to follow an appropriation. that it necessarily should do so. In all of my utterances upon this question. I have assumed that the purpose of the appropriation was first to meet a present emergency. to meet an emergency that ought to have been met many years ago. secondlyto stimulate the States to build up within their borders a school system to which the people should become so thoroughly and certainly attached that under all circumstances it would be maintained. Because my views have been in that direction I have been willing to a great extent to trust the States. I have been willing to vote for appropriations that should give to the States the money. and then trust to their honesty and their zeal in the cause of public education for a proper application of the money so appropriated. But I should not be willing to vote a dollar of public money to any State if it was not with the understanding that if the State did not properly apply the money. the General Government might withdraw the appropriation. or in case of great emergency might interfere and establish schools within the borders of the State. I do not think the beneficiaries of this billand when I speak now of the beneficiaries I mean the people who are to receive the great share of this moneyought to complain of a moderate restriction or of a moderate direction as to the appropriation of the money. I would not myself be in favor of establishing side by side with the State schools. as long as the States were making an effort to maintain public schools at all. national schools. I would not be in favor of interfering Ni ith the State schools. Neither do I understand that any amendment which has so far been offered to this bill. including even the amendment offered by the Senator from Iowa. in any wise interferes with the State schools or can in any wise impair their usefulness or their efficiency. It has been said all through this discussion which has now lasted in this body for nearly five years. and it has been said over and over again. that the States who are to receive the greatest proportion of this money were too poor to furnish to the children of those States proper and suitable educational facilities.. Mr. President. I have never myself agreed to that proposition. I do not believe today that there is a State or a Territory within the jurisdiction of the United States that is not abundantly able to maintain a reasonable commonschool system for the education of all the children of the State or Territory. but I realize the fact that in some of the States the people have been unwilling. have been reluctant to pay the necessary expenses for the maintenance of public schools. I have taken some pains to look over the census returns and ascertain the comparative wealth of the States which or whose people are thus complaining. I do not say the complaint comes altogether from the regions of country where school facilities have not been furnished. for the complaint comes with equal volume frompeopleof our own section of the country who insist that the South is unable to maintain public schools. According to the census of 1880. the State of Alabama -was estimated to have $338.000.000 of assessable property. and I find that in that year the State of Alabama paid $448.498 for public instruction. for school facilities to the great number of children within its borders. I find that Arkansas was estimated to have $246.000.000 of assessable property and paid $479.471 for school purposes. Delaware had $138.000.000 -of assessable property and paid $207.000 for public schools. Florida had $95.000.000 of assessable property and paid $133.000 for schools. Georgia. with $554.000.000 of assessable property. paid$613.260for publicschools. Mississippi. with $324.000.000 of assessable property. paid $803.000 for public schools. North Carolina. with $446.000.000 of assessable property. paid $582.000 for school purposes. South Carolina. with $296.000.000 of assessable property. paid $341.176 for school purposes. West Virginia. with $307.000.000 of assessable property. paid $553.000 for school purposes. Tennessee. with $666.000.000 of assessable property. paid $795.000. Colorado. the youngest of the States. had $149.000.000 of assessable property and paid $752.000 for the support of public schools. Nebraska. with $290.000.000 of assessable property. paid $1.358.346. Texas. with $725.000.000 of assessable property. paid $1.150.332. less than $200. 000 as much as Nebraska. Mr. President. these figures. in my judgment. show that the people of the South and the people of the North are everywhere financially able to take care of the publicschool system. a fact that I knew as well five years ago when I voted for aid to the public schools of the land as I know it today. I have never based any vote I have given nor any utterance I have made in defense of appropriations of Federal aid to the schools of the land upon the theory that the States were unable to support public schools. but upon the theory that they had declined or neglected to do so. andwith the hope thatbyour so giving Federal aid they might be incited to see the beauty and the advantage of the commonschool system. and that they might thus do in the South what has been done in the North and what has been done in the great West. I said five years ago on this floor. educate the community and they will maintain schools no matter now poor they may be. I have seen it illustrated and exemplified in my acquaintance with the Western country. Let me speak of my own State. and I speak of it with the utmost pride. and I think I may speak of it as an illustration of what I have said before. that the people who have been educated in the public schools. who have seen the advantages of the system. love it as they love no other institution in the land. and they place it a little even above the church of their fathers. In 1859 the great wave of emigration departed from the settled States across the add regions of the West and lodged at the foot of the Rocky Mountains. thousands of men went out there. staid a few days. and returned. but many remained. and more came. In 1861 the Government of the United States gave to those people a Territorial organization with exactly the boundaries that the State of Colorado has today. InSeptember. 1861. in the midst of war. in the midst of tumult. in the midst of excitement. the people of that Territory organized their first government. The Legislature met the last of September. and on the 7th day of Notember following the people of that Territory through their Legislature adopted a complete and perfect freeschool system. They not only adopted a freeschool system to give every child within the borders of Colorado a commonschool education. but they established a university. and they attached to the common schools a highschool system that has been efficient and valuable to the people of Colorado so that today in all the towns and cities of any considerable importance in the State the high schools send out boys fully qualified to enter Yale. Harvard. or Princeton or any other of the great institutions of the land. Mr. President. when the people of Colorado adopted that system there had never been a surveyor in the Territory. there was not an acre of land except a few grants on the southern border that was not owned by the General Government. The first schoolhouses we built were built upon the public lands before we could get control of the title from the General Government. We have followed it from that day to this. We have today the most efficient school system of any State in the Union. I think. and last year we paid beyond Federal aid. for the purpose of maintaining our public schools. $21.43 for every child in the State between the age of six and sixteen years. and taking that as the basis we have put 90 per cent. of our children in the public schools. We have maintained in additign three institutions of high character. one for the education of people in practical metallurgy and mining. another for giving them the highest education that can be given in a university. and we have maintained also an agricultural college built long before we ever received a dollar from the Government of the United States in support of our schools. I know that when we speak of the school system in the West Senators say: You have received magnificent donations of public land.I Why. Mr. President. when I speak of the expenditure of money I speak of an expenditure over and above and beyond anything that the Government has given to us. Last year the total receipts from the Government aid that we received and passed into our school fund were less then a dollar per capita for the children enrolled in our schools. I had hoped that by an appropriation of this character we could stimulate in all sections of the country some of the spirit that has pervaded the people of Colorado and of Nebraska and other Western States. who in their very beginning. in their poverty. were ready to part with their money for- the purpose of establishing and maintaining a freeschool system. If this bill can be properly amended. if it can be put in proper shape. I believe that that will be the result. and I am anxious myself to vote for a measure which will accomplish that. even if no very great deal of immediate result follows from the appropriation of this money. If we could put into the hearts and minds of the people of Louisiana and of Mississippi and of Georgia the sentiment of attachment to schools and the school system that pervades in some other sections of the country theywould find means to maintain schools for all the people within their borders. I know it was said by the Senator from Mississippi on the other side that we have a virgin soil and that we have natural advantages. Mr. President. when we went to Colorado we went 600 miles beyond the line of a railroad. When the first schoolhouse was built in Colorado there was not a mile of railroad within 600 miles. There was scarcely a break in that great arid region. but little had been done. Those people were there in a new country. with undeveloped riches. it is true. but requiring great labor to make them available.- They had yet to tear down the mountains and fill up the valleys to make an entrance into the mountains where the riches were in existence. All of these things they did. but they did not while doing them neglect the school system. Since we adopted a State government we have had a constitution which provides that the State shall not run in debt. the State shall contract no debt that exceeds $50.000. and yet we allow our school districts to run in debt whenever it is necessary for the protection of the interest of the children of the State. We have no State debt. we do not allow the municipal authorities to run in debt beyond a limited sum. and yet the school districts of Colorado have borrowed a million of money to put in schoolhouses in that new State. We do not ask a dollar of Federal aid. and I do not believe there is a man in Colorado who would accept a million of money from the Government of the United States if it would interfere with our cherished State system of public schools. and I am as clear from wanting to interfere in the system of public schools in the South as I am to have the Government interfere with the system in my own State. I believe. however. that it is but fair and proper and prudent that the Government of the United States when appropriating this money should have at least a discretionary control over it. so as to see that it goes to the class of people who are particularly needing the education that. under the unfortunate circumstances which have surrounded them. they have been unable to acquire. I do not see myself why any Senator on the other side should be sensitive when it is proposed to say that if there are three times as many black children assembled in black schools as there are white children in white schools there shall be threefourths of the money appropriated to those black schools. If they were all assembled in one school then I could see that there would be no propriety in saying that it should be divided according to the illiteracy of the races. but they are not unlike some other sections of the country. and not unnaturallyI do not wonder at it myselfthey do not propose to commingle the whites and the blacks together. I believe it is better in the South that the two races should be kept in separate schools. But if there are three schools required to educate the black children in a State and only one required for the white children it does not strike me thatit can be objectionable to the friends of this bill if it should be said by the giving power. We give to you three for one class and one for the other. 1 $3 for the three schools and $1 for the one school. and in that proportion. If this bill can be put in such a shape that it will carry out the two great purposes for which I have contended. I shall cheerfully vote for it. If it does not. I think we had better wait another year. We have waited for twenty years. If it is aduty that the Government owesnow to appropriate this money. it is a duty that it owed twenty years ago. and. I am free to say. it is a complaint I have made more than once. it was a duty twenty years ago. but it was a duty which the GovernXVII115 ment failed to perform. I want to perform it in such a manner that it shall accomplish the two great purposesfirst. that it shall educate the uneducated. and. second. that it shall be received by the people in such a spirit and in such a manner as to attach them to the system. and not create an antagonism and an opposition to the publicschool system at the South."},{"1":"4.800996e+08","2":"1885","3":"H","4":"CANNON","5":"437","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. nearly forty years have elapsed since the close of the Mexican war. Following the precedents. itis proper that the soldiers who served in that war should be placed upon the pensionroll as a reward for their services. In addition. the Senate amendients to this bill. as I understand it. place all of the soldiers of the late war who are disabled and who are dependent in whole or in part upon their labor for a support upon the pensionroll according to their disability. and I believe it right that this should be done whether it costs much or little. I do not believe it will cost more than from fifteen to sixteen millions of dollars per annum. according to the best estimates I have been able to procure. The proposed legislation is but justice to the soldier and will prove a measure of economy to the Government. The nation can not afford to withhold from its defenders in the field proper relief and compensation. In every neighborhood. at least in the northern part of the country. can be found one or more Union soldiers in the late war who are disabled and needy. and who can not make the technical proof required under the law to place their names on the pensionroll. Yetthey know. and their neighbors know. they ought to be pensioned.. The time will come. following the precedents. when all Union soldiers of the late war will have their names placed on the pension:roll without reference to disability. and unless we afford relief to those who are actually disabled. by this or similar legislation. you will find that public opinion will demand that justice be done these disabled soldiers. even if in doing them justice it is necessary to put the names of all soldiers of the Union Army on the pensionroll at an earlier day than it would otherwise be done. It would be economical to give this legislation. It is right to give it. and therefore I shall vote for it now. and I say to my friend from Illinois that I have no confidence whatever. considering the filibustering tactics of gentlemen on that side of the House during the last session of Congress. that this bill will ever become a law unless it becomes so within sixty minutes of this time. so far as the House is concerned. Again. it is right and proper to increase the pension of the widow whose husband died from injuries received in the service from $8 to $12 a month as old age comes upon her and her necessities annually increase.

And all that they have to pay out of their weekly wage of 6s. is ls. 6d. for the forge and fuel. and another 6d. for having the rods out of which to make the chains brought to the forge. Free tracechains! God forbid that any Kentucky girl or woman should ever work at such unwomanly employment for such starvation wages. even though it be to furnish cheap tracechains to my friend and his constituents. I say to the gentleman as my friend Emory A. Storrs said toa party of Engishmen when at the dinnertable of a friend in London. they undertook to badger him on the subject of free trade.  Gentlemen. you do not want to provoke a discussion of that intricate subject at this social board. I will admit that free trade is best for you. at least for those of you who can afford to purchase anything. but I claim that protection is best for us. The vital difference between us is that you think more a great deal of a cheap shoe than you do of a prosperous shoemaker. while in America we think more of the welfare of the artisan than of the cheapness of his product. [Renewed applause.] In one of the smallest and dingiest of the forges of Halesowen we found two men at work making light nails. such as girls are put to making when at 14 years of age the British law allows them to leave school and enter upon their lives of unwomanly toil. One of these men was a cripple and the other was evidently suffering from pulmonary disease. One of them by expending his force for full time could earn 3s. per week and the other 4s.. from each of which sums are deducted weekly is. for fuel and furnace rent. so that at the close of the week they had as a net result of their joint toil $1.25. In the villages I have named. all of which are appendages of Birmingham. we also saw English girls and matrons making large firebricks. one carrying against her breast or stomach heavy lumps of wet clay. out of which her coworker. it may be her sister or mother. molded the immense bricks which she who had brought the clay carried to a heated space near to where she was to pick up her next load of wet clay. Why. you ask. do these girls engage in such work? The answer is a simple one. they prefer to make bricks. because they can make 6s.. or a dollar and a half. net per week. while their sisters who make nails or chains can not assuredly earn so much. and are. as I have said. subject to a charge of Is. 6d. per week for fuel and rent of forge. The chief specialties of Cradley are chains and hollowware. There we saw girls galvanizing stewpans. boilers. bathtubs. and other articles of like nature. The desperate struggle for life imposed on British toilers by cheap goods and low wages is well illustrated at Cradley. The assured receipt of $1.50 a week will tempt women from the nail or chain makers forge to the brickshed. The pay of a galvanizer is $1.75 per week. and for this additional shilling girls will pass the forge and the brickshed to engage in a galvanizing room. although the strongest of them knows that in less than six mouths the gases generated by the process will vitally impair her health. In this connection I submit a brief extract from one of Miss Kelleys published letters. It is characteristic of the neighborhood of Birmingham that each village has one industry. thus nailers and chainmakers are as thoroughly separated as though their work differed radically and separation were needed. But the difference between LyeWaste and Cradley is slight. There are the same forges. the same hovels. the same dusty roads. and the same industrious people. To tell the story of the chainmakers. who we watched at their forges. is merely to repeat the picture of Stocking Lane. and this I have no wish to do. Here and there. however. the forges are interspersed with factories and works. and the facts as to these works illustrate some of the ills to which the nailers eagerly fly in their effort to escape from their peculiar slavery. In one establishment we were shown young women at work on galvanizing pails. and our guide (who had come over from LyeWaste for our benefit) observed privately concerning them. Teym flyin from nailin.and they thinks its a fine thing to get seven shillhns a week. But they gets poorly. and then they gets sick. and then their parents has to keep em. and they dont earn nothin for a long time till theym well again. This we were prepared to believe. for we found difficulty in breathing in the first room to which an intelligent foreman showed us. This was a large. dusky room. with a high ceiling. and arrangements for ventilation with which we could find no fault. But in the middle of the room stood a seething cauldron of a steaming fluid. Back of this stood a man dipping pails in the cauldron and handing them to young girls. who swiftly rolled each pail in ulheap of sawdust. then deftly brushed the fluid over the metal surface. assuring an equal coating to every part. A few moments of breathing the fumes from thecauldron made our retreat to the sultry outdoor air very refreshing. and sufficed to convince us of the unwholesome nature of this work. even before we noticed long rows of carboys of vitriol which furnish one ingredient of the galvanizing fluid. The inspection is severe. observed the foreman. The works are closely watched. and if a girl works a halfhour overtime were brought up roundly. Its very unwholesome work. This brief extract will convince you that I do not speak of things of which I have merely read. No. gentlemen. I speak ofincidents that I saw and of people with whom and whose employers I conversed. Sir. I do not want American goods to become so cheap that. as my distinguished friend the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means said. we can sell to other people. God forbid that American labor shall ever be embodied in any production that shall be cheap enough to be sold at Halesowen. Lye. LyeWaste. Cradley. and other manufacturing villages that surround Birmingham. But depressing as was the influence of each of these towns in which the employments are in this country regarded as demanding masculine muscularity. girls and women are almost the only workers. our visit to Myrthyr Tydvil and to the great Dowlais ironworks upon the hill overlooking Myrthyr was still more saddening. In the neighborhood of Birmingham. Manchester. and Bradford the school law is admirably enforced. and during school hours children between 5 and 14 years of age a not frequently seen upon the highways. In this Welsh mining andiron district the contrast in this respect was as striking as it was painful. Here it is evident that the local authorities give but little if any attention to the enforcement of the only law which protects British childhood from the cruelest exactions of British industry. Here we found boys and girls loitering listlessly at all hours of the day in the reeking admixture of clay and grime which make the sidewalks and highways. It would have been a satisfaction to see them indulging in any of the plays of joyous childhood. but in our several tours we saw no instance of this. The factory law. however. has even here had one good effect. it has reduced the number of women employed in the Dowlais works from nearly 3.000 to about 1.000. and for this womankind throughout the civilized world may well be grateful. The Dowlais works are engaged in the production of heavy iron of all descriptions. the interior is a network of railroads. forges. furnaces. rollingmills. and triphammers. the coarse labor in attendance upon all of which. as well as at the mouth of the coalpit on the cars. was until quite recently the special and almost exclusive work of girls and their mothers. The number of them. as I havesaid. hasbeen reduced to about 1.000. and of these we saw some loading and unloading coalcars. others. one upon the car pitching bricks to another upon the wet. rough floor. who piled them according to orders. others were handling and carrying heavy iron plates or bars from the lifting of which I would have shrunk in my days of greatest vigor. Having asked the privilege of speaking to any of these women when not engaged. we felt free to interrogate them as to their wages. They might not have answered me. but to one of their own sex. who addressed them in tones of sympathy. they told their stories freely. and from all of them we learned that 6s. ($1.50) was regarded as good wages for a week. I am unwilling to reduce the duties on any form of iron or steel 20 per cent.. as is proposed by this bill. in order to allow my countrymen to consume the results of the labor of these British maidens. wives. and matrons. The plea that their employers. in order to sell us such cheap goods. must compel them to accept such wages is not one that satisfies my judgment. but is one from which my manhood revolts. At Manchester we remained nearly a fortnight. It is a noble city. the management of whose municipal affairs is unequaled in the United States. To Sheffield our visit was less protracted. The houses. grounds and conservatories of the great steelmakers who so long controlled our market. to some of which we were admitted. are regal in their extent and magnificence. but the offensive surroundings of the homes of the working people and the brutal coarseness we encountered at every turn in their quarter of the city made us glad to beat an early retreat. The American traveler finds much to admire in the best parts of Birmingham. Manchester. Sheffield. Bradford. and every other great industrial center of England. but going thence to the localities in which working people dwell he will. unless he be a tariff reformer who believes that to get his supplies cheap is the chief end of man. be shocked by the terrible contrast he beholds. In each city and town he will find long rows of small houses. between every two of which is an arched alley leading to a court. upon either side of which there are from four to six houses. These. like the front ones. are without cellars or underdrainage. have three small rooms rising one above another. each also having a house like unto itself built against its rear wall. the consequence of which is that thorough or through ventilation is impossible in any of these huddled groups of houses for workingmen and their families. The streets are the only playground for children. as well as drying ground for the wash of each family. whose patched and ragged garments flaunt in the breeze on lines drawn from house to house as if by common consent or express stipulation. For the use of the occupants of each court. together with those of the front buildings. there is one hydrant and one privy. In view of these hard conditions is it not too much to expect cleanliness. modesty of bearing. or chastity itself of families who are habitually huddled together in this fashion. A house in any of the villages referred to. as small or smaller than these. of similar construction. with three rooms. the lower one a livingroom. parlor. kitchen. and sittingroom. with brokenstone floor. and chambers above. which furnish sleeping accommodations to the parents. the sons and daughters. and not infrequently to the husbands and wives of the sons and daughters and their children. all of whom are thus crowded into two little sleepingrooms. Yetitis of these sets of three apartments. contracted. dark. undrained. and unventilated. that those apostles of falsehood. Professor Sumner. of Yale. and Perry. of Williams College. speak when they compare their rental with that of the homes of Ameriean artisans to prove the superior condition of the working people of Great Britain to that of those of the United States. It will hardly be regarded as possible that other classes of British laborers are housed with less consideration than the facts I have presented indicate. but the London Echo of Monday. October 8. 1883. says: The paper read by Mr. George Smith. of Coalville. before the social science congress. on Saturday. gives a lamentable account of the condition of large numbers of canal children. Mr. Smith tells us that there are close upon 30.000 of these children of school age who never enter a school. Many of the cabins in which they live are so small that a man can neither stand upright nor lie out straight on the bed on which he and his wife and his children have to lie."},{"1":"4.701764e+08","2":"1883","3":"S","4":"BROWN","5":"843","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I have admitted that there are days probably when everything is working well that it can be done. but Colonel Sloss will not come here to testity. nor will any other man from Alabama. that he can take it the year through and that the years work will average anywhere in that neighborhood. It is simply out of the question. as every man who knows anything about ironmaking who is at all informed on the subject. knows. There are periods when a furnace works very finely. and other periods when it does not work so well. There are stoppages by breakage and the like occasionally. but your hands are employed and their wages are running. You are one or two weeks at a time making nothing. Counting all these contingencies. and they all come out of the expenses of the year. there is no concern that can possibly do it. Now a word as to the idea of the Senator from Alabama about manufacturing our own pigiron at home into bars. I would be delighted to see that day. I would like to see the day when railroad menwould have to carry none of the pigiron made in Georgia. Alabama. and Tennessee any further west. but the Senator will never see it while he pursues the policy in reference to the tariff on iron that he now pursues. for neither he nor any friend of hiswill ever under such circumstances put any money into rollingmills to make the iron. they can not do it. Take the rollingmills at Chattanooga. one or two have broken down already. A large steel mill has been put up there by the Roane Iron Company. but it is now virtually broken down. They are doing very little. because they can not live at present prices. I do not say they are in insolvency. for it is a strong company. but they are finding it a very bad investient and will not be able to continue it. Take the rollingmill property at Atlanta. my own city. it has been in the hands of three or four companies and is now entirely broken down. Under the present tariff it has not been able to live. There is a rollingmill or two I believe at Birmingham in the Senators State. but they are running at very short profits. and if you reduce the tariff on iron let me tell the Senator from Alabama and everybody else that you are not going to find capitalists who will put their money into any such losing business to make your iron fbr you at home. You have to still continue to ship your pigiron and pay four dollars and a half a ton on it for freight. and in doing that the railroads are getting very low freight. We have to carry it a long way. It is carried in the cars returning from bringing loads of provisions usually. .and you get a rate of threequarters of a cent a ton a mile. not much more than the actual cost of carriage. The railroads are making no large amount out of it. If it were not that they bring loaded cars from the West with supplies for the South. which is unfortunately done to a greater extent than we ought to doif it were not for that and the scant low rate we get on the iron in returning cars that would otherwise go empty. we could not ship any to the West at the present rate. All the advantage we have over Iennsylvania in the cheapness of making pigiron on account of the materials being near together would be more than overcome by the freight. and as it is it is not nore than overcome. My estimate is that there is just about one dollar a ton in our favor when we count the advantage we have in the juxtaposition of the materials on the one hand and the disadvantage we have offreight on tl other. That is in our favor. and I think likely to remain about in that condition. I am familiar somewhat with the pigiron interest there. and I know at the present rate of tariff the margin is exceedingly close. The manufacturers are piling up iron simply because they do not want to force it on the market at the present low rate. hoping for a little better rate. If you reduce the tariff it will not be a living rate. and some of them will be obliged to close. In speaking of the Tennessee furnace that I referred to a while ago. I will add that it is to be taken into account there that they have very cheap labor. That company works over three hundred convicts. I have the authority of Mr. Warner fbr saying that the iron costs them over $15 a ton. The company that I belong to works over three hundred convicts. and counting $1 per ton for repairs of the furnace. which Dr. Miller admits to be correct. it costs us within a fraction of $15."},{"1":"4.700404e+08","2":"1882","3":"H","4":"SCRANTON","5":"155","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"It has not been my intention to ask a hearing upon this subject. already so ably and thoroughly debated.

The report was read. as follows: The Committee on Invalid Pensions. to whom was referred the petition of Caroline Boll. mother of Louis Boll. deceased. praying for a pension. report: That Loris Boll the son of claimant. was enrolled on the 12th day of November. 1661. in Company ft. Eleventh Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers. to servo three years. and was regularly mustered* into the service of the United States. as a pri. vate. on the 27th (lay of November. 1861. at Annapolis. Maryland. in Company H. Eleventh Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers. to serve for three years. or during the war. and was killed in action at Bull Run. Virginia. on the 30th day of August. The claim was originally filed at the Pension Office on the 25th day of January. 1873. and was. after a full compliance with all the requirements of that office. rejected upon a final hearingcause. nondependence. An appeal was taken to the Secretary of thoInterior. who. however. sustained the decision of the Commissioner -of Pensions. Your committee consider. after a careful investigation of all the evidence intho case. that the decision of the Pension Bureau was erroneous. in that it was based entirely upon a letter from the postmistress at Mauch Chunk. Pennsylvania. Mrs. Tane Righter. whose statement was not made under oath. ignoring thereby the sworn statements itestimony) of sixteen unimpeachable and disintercsted citizens -of Mauch Chunk. who testify to claimants dependency on account of old age and physical disability of husband. This postmistress. in ber reply to Department let. ter of June 14. 1873. requesting her to forward anr opinion relative to husbands .ability to support his family by manual labor. and whether the son over rendered the claimant any material aid says : Upon inquiry have learned fro a reliable source that Joseph Boll. the father -of the said Loois Boll. has worked at Parkerton. about two Miles from this place. for the pase ten or twelve years. ae supported his family without the assistance of the son. and is therefore not entitled to a pension. Mrs. Caroline Bolt is the wife of Joseph Boll. The affidavits of Dr. Ludwig Flentje. (thres innumber.) familyphysician. clearly and unmistakably establish the physical disability of husban. as does. also. the certificate of N. B. Reber. M. D.. medical examiner for Pension Bureau. who. in bis report to the Pension Office. dated Lehighton. Carbon County. Pennsylvania. July 2.1872. says:  The said Joseph Boll. husband of Caroline Boll. who claims a pension as dependent mother of Louis Boll. is and has been physically incapacitated for the support of himself and family. Have had no acquaintance with Mr. Boll until at this examination. I find him suffering with saltrhaum on left leg with varicose veins. The limb is very much atrophied. Apparently his limb may have been affected some eight or ten years. He is now totally disabled. hardly ible to walk. and that but a very short distance. His disabilltv is probably permanent. since but very. very few cases of salt.rheoum. complicatel with varicose veins. are curable. It is further shown In evidence that previous to deceaseds entry into the service of the United States he contributed the entire pioceeds of his earnings to the support of his parents. being then not quite seventeen years of age. and that while in the service it is shown by the affidavit of his captain. E. H. Rauch. that he. the deceased. on three or four occasions sent the greater part of his pay to his parents for their support. This fact is also corroborated by the sworn statements. submitted in evidence. by some of his comrades in the company of which he was a member. A letter from the deceased to his parents. inclosing funds for their sole use. is also in evidence. Now. in view of the foregoing. and in addition thereto the affidavits of father - and mother in answer to the interrogatories of the Pension Office. setting forth their dependence on their son and the manner in which he contributed to theft support. all of which show conclusively their dependence upon and aid from that source. we are of ese opinion that the mother is entitced to a pension at the rate of $8 per month from the 30th day of August 1862. the date of the death of her only son and support. and accordingly report a bill for that purpose and recommend its passage."},{"1":"4.600377e+08","2":"1879","3":"S","4":"FERRY","5":"268","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"An additional reason why this amount should be appropriated. which I suggest to the chairman of the committee and other Senators. is that under the former economy of the democratic House in the PostOffice Department. as well as other Deparlements of the Government. the Postmaster- General. in order to come within the appropriation for the Department. was compelled arbitrarily to cut down the pay of these lettercarriers. cutting them down one year $25 each. the next year adding 95. making the reduction $30 each.

I do not propose to discuss the aids and advantages to the moral wellbeing and advancement of the nations of the earth by these great international reunions. What I desire is simply to say a few words in support of thesd resolutions and in behalf of the labbrand industry of the country. although not in the direction of my colleague on the committeei the gentleman from Indiana. and to indicate how our material prosperity and national wealth may be advanced by a. participation in this exhibition. Now I venture -tfie assertion that the American workman. in the originality of his- devices. in the multiplicity of his designs. and in the ingenuity and perfection of his handiwork is sur- patsed by none in the world. Our skilled artisans. our earnest. thoughtful. practical mechanics. have no superiors.- With ourlaborsaving machinery. invented by and operated by the intelligent worken of this country. we are steadily advancing in the front rank of manufacturlug nations. What we need today are the Markets of the world. -We have already reached the point. in many of our industries. where we are producing the manufactured article as cheaply as it is produced by any of the nations of Europe. We want foreign markets for our surplus goods. We wantthe consumers of Europe to buy not only our breadstuffs. our cotton. and tobacco. but also to buy our manufactured articles. Takefor example one of our great industries. the manufacture of cotton goods. The New England factoriesby the perfection of their machinery. and by the intelligence of their operatives. are making goods which are equal to thebestfabrics of English manufacture. and they are making them at a cost which permitstheir sale even at Manchester. the great cotton manufacturing center of England. We have studied the English processes and have improved upon them. and now we wantforeign markets upon an equality with England. While our population from 1860 to 1875 increased 38 per cent. the cotton spindles of. this country. in the same period. increased 82 per cent. Our capacity for production exceeds our consumption. Relief for this industry must come. not through tariffs. but it Must come through exportation. We can manufacture cotton goods as cheap as England can.. Fance buys of England $15.000.000 ofcotton goods yearly. Cotton clothe upon the counters of Paris bear a higher pricothan they do in New York. -oW want France with her forty millions of population to compare our cotton goods with the cotton goods of England. We want France to makea comparison of qualities and prices. and then to join with this country in the removal of those prohibitions which exclude our goods from her markets. And what I have said. Mr. Chairman. with reference to cotton goods can be said of the products of other American industries. In the opening up of foreign markets to our manufactureswoecan revive many of our languishing and depiessed industries and stimulate their further development. In thus stimulating and cxtondin our productions. in the conversion of raw materials into manufactured artioles. wo give increased employment. andmore remunerative employment to our labor. Now. the Paris exposition can mid us greatly in the attainment of these foreign markets. I will not dwell upion this point after the full and forcible statements -which have been made by those who have preceded me. - But the penuriousness.which would exclude us from competition with other. nations. and which would thereby exclude us from foreign markets. is -not in the iuterest of economy. neither is it in the interest of the labor and industry of the country. One -remark further. Mr. Chairman. The United States bannot afford to retire from these competitive exhibitions. By means of these exhibitions the exact condition and the comparative merits of the inventive skill and industries of all the nations of the world are established. In the contest for improvements. in the struggle forthe cheapening of production and in the perfection of workmanship. the American artisan must keep up with and in advance of the artisans of the Old World. . In. order to do this he -must see and stn*dy the operations of his rivals. Thousands of earnest. thoughtful workingmen -went to Philadelphia last year and there they saw and studied the best products of the most skilled workmen of other lands. thoe they saw and studied the choicest specimens in the arts and sciences. The resilf of this will be a gain of material wealth innew appliances and in improved methods. -If we wouldsecure and maintain supremacy we must not exclude our people from these competitive tests. but give them the largest facilities for engaging in them. The sum named in these resolutions and recommended by the committee is very inconsiderablein comparison with the great advantages which. directly and indirectly. our industries are to reap from the expenditure. The people of.this country sir. wilt not begrudge an appropriation which furnishes to them so many opportunities for profiable returns. The amount proposed is small for the purposes indicated. The appropriation has been out down by the committee to the lowest possible figure. Any farther reduction as proposed by the gentleman from New York [Mr. Cox] will cripple the commission and prevent the attainment of the results which are so earnestly desired by the farmer. the operative. and the business men of the country."},{"1":"4.400067e+08","2":"1876","3":"S","4":"SHERMAN","5":"2159","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. this bill. although brief in words and very simple in its title. is very comprehensive in its scope. and far more important than many Senatois would suppose from the manner in which it is presented and the title and language of the bill. This is really a conflict between railroad grants and the grants made to preemptors and homestead settlers. and when I say that it is this controversy which has given shade to the public opi~uion now pervading all the western land States of hostility to all grants of land to railroads. I only assert what is a truism and what is known to every Senator here. Probably the eastern Senators have already heard enough of the intense opposition in certain sections to land grants to railroads to appreciate that this affects not only a few people. but. I may say. millions of people in the Western States. In my intercourse with the western peoplebecauso Ohio has now got to be almost an Eastern State. having had for many years ge public lands of any accountI have heard complaints of hardship growing out of the difficultics between the claims of the lanlgrant railroads and the rights of proemptors and settlers and the rights of purchasers of the public landshardships that. if I were to state them here. it seems to me would excite at least the sympathy of Senators. if not their judgmont. in favor of the settlers. The most marked case of hardship that I know of was a case that occurred in Iowa. where. in a very beautiful portion of our country. a great number of settlers were dispossessed of their lands to which they supposed they had a clear right. and dispossessed upon a shadowy construction as baseless as a dream. Perhaps I would not speak too strongly if I said. in regard to the land which was finally gotten by some of the corliorations incorporated in the State of Iowa. that they received the land upon a title as shadowy as a drean. and yet they divested the title of thousands of honest people who are yet struggling for relief before Congress. Mr. President. knowing these facts. I have read this lill to see whether or not there was in it anything inconsistent with the law or with the vested rights of the railroad companies. I do not think there is. It seems tome that every provision of this bill can be defended. not only upon the ground of equity. but upon the ground of the only decision of the Supreme Court of the Uaited States that has been quoted in this debate that I have heard. - The first proposition isThat all preemptioi and homestead entribs. or entries in compllaneo with any law of lh United States. of the uble lands made in good faith by actual settlers upon tracts of land of not more titan one huilrcd and sixty acres each. within the limits of any lnd grant. prior to the time when notice of the withdrawal of the lands emnhraeed in cuc. hgiant was received at the local land office of the district in whicl sich mods are situated. Then the provision below is that such entries shall be valid and that patents shall issue. It would seem to me tlsat this proposition is so plainly equitable that it woul require a very strong act of Congress to overrule it. By our laws we have invited the people of the United States and of all the comntries of the world to go upon the public lands. occupy them possess them. and have provided fortheir making their claim in a defined way before an officer of the United States. and when they do that. they may go antd live upon these lands and develop themn and build up the country. This section simply provides that where men have in strict compliance with the acts of Congress thus acquired a possessory right to lands by their labor. by their occupation. that right shall not be defeated by any constructive grant of Congress until notice isgiven of the location of the road over and on the lands that they arc occupying. To defeat so plain a right as that. it seems to me. a railroad company ought to have a clear and decisive act of Congress in so many words. Under these circumstances. thousands of men in possession of public lands under our laws developing the country. a railroad grant made by Congress of an nuncertain nature. depending upon a future location. a conditional grant made of alternate sections. has divested the possessory rights of such men. All the land grants that have been made which I know about depend upos a future survey. They are not grants subject to forfeiture. but theyare conditionalgrautswith many conditions attached to them. These are. first. that the railroad company may possess and enjoy the alternate scetions in a certain region of country. defining it. but not to take eflet until the location is made. The provision as to location is not in the nature of a forfeiture. hnt it is a condition upon which the land is granted. it is just as much a condition as the word alterinate. which only gives tie grantee the alternate and not all the scetioms of land within the prescribed limits. Therefore every grant of land to a railroad company is a grant of the alternate sectiois of land on a line to be surveyed by them. the map of which shall be filed with the General Land Ofice amud notice given to the local laud offices. Now this bill comes in and says that this right of the railroad company to secure a grant of hind shall not take effect so as to deleat the bona fite honest grants already made tinder acts of Congress to aetual settlers. It secis to me that this is just. or if there is any doubt about it I certainly will give to the locater the benefit of our law. and if lie is forced to assert and defend his right I will give hint at least tie patent of the United States nado in pursuance of the preemption and homestead laws. and I do not believe then his rights will be contested. The next point is the one raised by the honorable Senator from Missouri. but it seems tome that here the right of the settler is clear and unequivocal. so that there can he no doubt about it. The latter part of the first section provides: Or after their restoration to market by order of the General Land Office. and where the preemption and homestead laws have been complied with. and proper proofs thereof have been made by the paties holding mch tracts or parcels. they shall he ceafirmed. and patents for the came shall issue to the parties entitled thereto. All the railroad grants are in the natutro of conditional grants. They are upon the condition that a certain railhoad shall be bnilt. they are made to promote the construction of a railroad. and that railroad by the terms of the law is always to be constructed within a certain time. say ten years. or whatever may be the time limited. All these grants to railroads are upon condition that the company shall build the road within a certain time. Whether that has been done is a fact easily ascertained. It seems that under the former construetion at the Lad Officeand a very proper one I think. though it has been overruled sy more recent authorityit was the custom to regard the termination of the time within which the railroad was to be built as one of the conditions of the grant. and it was held under the law as it stood that when the time ran out within which the railroad was to be completed. if in fact it was not builta public fact well knowntim Commissioner of the General Land Office was then to restore the lands to market. This bill simply provides that after the Commissioner of the General Land Oflco. an officer of the Government acting in pursuance of the very laws granting these lands. has beld that the time has expired. and has restored to market the lands formrly withdrawn. and openly proclaimed that they should be sold or be open to entry nder the homestead and preemption laws. if then our people go and settle upon them. their title. thus. I may say. invested or acquired in land again opened for entry by the offiter having charge of it. shdll not be defeated by any subsequent act of Congress exteuding the original grant or extending the time for the completion of the road. That is the whole effct of it. if I understaid the first section of the bill. and if I understand the argument of the Senator who reported it. There are two propositions: lirst. that where a mau atquires a fair and honest title. (hecauso it ca. apply to no other.) by grant. or purchase. or preemption. upon the public lands through the local land office. his right to a patent shall not be dofeated until the company that chims under a conditiotnal grant shall have filed it the local laud office notice that the land in a pactieular region of country falls under the grant. That seems to me to be perfectly right. The other proposition is that if the railroad company has ieglocted to build the road. and the time has expired within which it was authorized to build it. and upon which conditionprccedent the whole grant depends. and after that the Commissioier of the General Land Ofice having determined the fact that the condition had not been complied with and restored the lands to the public market. then. if the settler goes upon apart of that land and acquires a title by possession. he shall have the benefit of a patent to maintain his possession against the railroad company. even though Congress may. without the proper exception. have extended the time for the building of theyoad. That is the whole of the first section. as I understand. I know that is all that is claimed for it. and I believe it is admitted to be so. The next proposition is still more clear to my mind. and it seems that no man cai resist the force of equity and law in behalf of the second section. It providesThat when et the time of such withdrawal as aforesaid valid preemption or homesteal claim s existed upon any lands within the limits of any such grants whichafter. ward were abandoned. and. under the decisions and rulings of the Land Depart ment6. were reentered by preemption or homestead claimants who have complied with the laws governing preemption or homestead entries. or shall make theproper proofs required under such laws. sach entries shall be deemed valid. and patcuts shall issue therefor to the person entitled thereto. Let us see what this is. Take the case of a region of country over which a land grant extends. a portion of that land is necessarily covered by preemption and homestead claimants. because all our public land is so coveredto a greater or less extent. Congress grants to a railroad company a conditional title to a piece of land. alternate sections over a certain region of country. At the very moment that grant is made in Congress certain persons have possessory rights given by our law. they have what is called an imperfect or inchoate title. depending upon theirresidence upon the land and their improvement of the laud. There they are in possession. with a title. so far as it goes. as valid as any grant Congress can give. It could not be more valid if a patent had issued at the time they entered into possession. As a matter of course. their rights aro protected without anylaw whatever and the grant to the railroad company cannot defeat their individual rights as claimants. But that is not all that Congress does in all these landgrant laws. every one of them that I have seen. Conges in all cases. when making the grant of alternate sections. expressly reserves the land upon which all these claims exist. and says expressly. in so many words. in the very grant to the railroad company. We grant you the alternate sections. except such land as there may be now. at the time of the passage of the act. any claim to under the preemption or homestead law that is valid. It excepts the land. not merely the rights of the particular claimant. but all the lands upon which there is a valid preemption or homestead claim. just as it does the even sections. and no right whatever is conferred by any railroad grant that I have seen to any land on which a settler lives who has a valid claim."},{"1":"4.300945e+08","2":"1875","3":"S","4":"MORTON","5":"85","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I present a memorial signed by the board of regents of the American Printing House for the Blind and the American University for the Blind.

But we are not left to the positive opinions of learned. practical. cni emitient mon. for we have the light of past experience to guide us in forming a correct judgment. For seventeen years the maBnagemint of Indiai alffirs was uder the control of the War Deparment. In 1849 it was by an act of Congress transferred to the Interior Department. The managemnent of Indian affairs for this seveateui years hat it was anider the control of the War Department was. in my judgment. a most lamenta le failure. as far as any civilization of the Indians was conerned. or as far as there was aty saving to flte TreasIlcy. Military power naykeep the peace for the time being. and the peace policy contemplates it shallbe used toward the Indians for this purpose is well as toward the whites. just as we rely upon the sleriff with his posse comitatite in the ounties. or the police in our cities. Bat thits power alone eati never civilize. It never has civilized.

But after its work is done aother agency than tia isiit carry oat the graud work of civilization. While this arm of the Governmont controlled this usiness you had coustant Itdian wars. The savago warwhoop was heard all along our western border. Almost all the uncivilized tribes were at star during this period. Was the peace ary better kept during this time than it has been since ? I answer no. not half so well. Now. I (I not wish to be understood as speaking disparagingly of our gallant Army. I yield to no one in admiratiin for cur patriotic soldiers and brave officers. They are our pillar of cloud by day and wall of fire by night. thrown around te nation in times of great public danger. thiv are our hope when the honor. integrity. and very existence of ourtnation are endangered by cithera foreign or domestic foe. Btt I stsbmit there is ilo greater cruety ot cani inlic upon our Army than to compel it to live out among the Indians and take upon itself the work of teaching these Indians tho arts of peace. There is no field there for the achievement of the great military deeds which are the pride of the trie soldier. Both soldier and ohuber. as a rule. despise this kind of work. The history of the past shows that military nria ibageaeeot lieet Prolific of wars with these red men. and they can today trly iay: That they died not by hanger or lingering decay. Tho stee of the whito man bath swept tlien sway. Is this state of war desirable as an economic policy. If we look to the Treasury alone. and do not consider it our duty toward these people to make en effort to improve theni and make better men :nil women of them. I submit we cannot favor a military nanageient of their affairs. If a chronic Indian war vititi ass aimual increased e.spenditure of from $50.000.000 to $100.000.000 in consequence thereof is desired. it seems to me the transfer should bofaverel. We have had some fruits. in the shape of Indian wars it the past. as the result of military management. and perhaps it may be well for us to go back a little and see what they have cost us. and iu many cases what has been their origin. One fact will be found oa investigation. and it is thie. that while Indian affairs were under the control of the military establishment more tian half the time was spent in costly. unprofitable. and fruitless as well as unjust wars against the Seminoles and the Sacs and Foxes. and in troubles of the most vexatious and expensive character with the Creeks and Cherokees. Anti nearly all the wars we have had since the Interior Dcpartment took the uranagenseut of Indian affairs have had their origin in the hasty and illconsidered action of the military stationed in the Indian country. I have not time to refer to all of the wars we have had with these people. but will confine myself to these with which we are all familiar. It is in the memory of almost every member of this House that we had a war with the Seminoles. that for seven long years we fought about seven hundred warriors of this tribe with our regular Army and a largo volunteer force. losing about fifteen hundred lives and spending 460.000.000. and at the close of said war the Indians were further frot civilization than wrisen cli war commenced. I now desire to briefly call your attention to the war with the Sioux in 185254. which originated in this wise: An emigrant Mormon train abandoned a cow. A lieutenant and squad went to the camp aid demanded of the Indians. who had found.and eaten her. the man who had killed her. Tie Indians refused to surrender the man. but offered to pay for the cow. The lieutenant and his squad fired upon them. killing and woutding a number. when they were surrounded stid soassacred. The great Sioux war ensued. costing us $:30.000.000 and several hundred lives. besides a large amount of property. Then. again. in 1564. we had a war with the Cheyennes. And how did it originate I Why. a rauchman by the name of Ripley went to Camp Sanbortn. on the South Platte. and charged the Indians with stealinghis stock. A Lieutenant Dunn proceeded with a squad of men to search for it. but did not succeed in fiuding it. Falling in with a comipany of Cheyennes. an attempt was made to disarm them. and in the difficulty one soldier woe hilled and some others wounded. Then followed the Chyenuo war. Cuiliiuatipg in the massacre at Sand Creek. where one hundred and twenty Indians. mostly women and children. were brutally murdered in cold blood while resting on their own hnitinggrontds uder the protection of our flag. This war cost our Treasury not less than. $40.000.000. for it will be remembered that it involved not only the Cheyennes. but the Apaches. the Arapahoes. Kiowas. and CoimauCles. and also many bands of the Sioux. ard was onily ended by the treaty of peace in 1865 at the month of the Little Arkansas. iu 1516 the military took possession of the Powder River country. in Dakota. within the acknowledged territory of the Sioux. and planted military posts Phil Kearrry. Reno. aand C. F. Sutith. without the consent of the Indian proprietors and in direct violation of treaty stipulations. A terrible and bloody war ensued. costing us $10.000.000. many hundred lives. including the gallant Fettorman and his devoted ban. and much valuable property. In April. 1867. a military command burned the peaceful village of the Cheyennes on the Paiwnee Fork in Western Kansas. whohad been at peace with us since the treaty of 1865. and they wore then on lands assigned them by the treaty. The Cheyennes flew to arms and the war of 1867 followed. in which we lost over thres hundred soldiers and citizens. sod $J.000.00l were taken from the Treasury. a large amount of public and private propercy was destroyed. ard we killed sir Indians and no more. The protext for oar war with the Navajoes wts the shooting of a colored servant boy of a military officer by an Indian. and the refusal of the Indians to surrender the criminal. They did propose. however. after their eristom. to pay a pecaniary consideration as satisfaction to the officer. That war cost the Treascry $6.000.000. Now. I might detiin the louse much longer by a recital of the ninny conflicts we have had with the Indian tribes. their origin. and their cost. But I think I have referred to enough to satisfy it and the cointry that you cannot civilize Indians under the management of the military. nor can you save money for the Government. And if Indian exteritination be your policy. you can scarcely do tl at. at least not vel rapidly. for we have been in the busiucas through thoagoucy of the military power of this Government for about two hundred and fifty years. and have not quite succeeded in completing the work of carnage and death necessary to their complete annihilation. And what .e have done by means of the military arm has cost tlis country since its first settlement over $600.000.000. And if the cost of killing each Indiaui ill errn late ware is a fair average of what this process of getting rid of him is to cost in the future. you will have to pay $1.000.000 for each Indian you exterminate. But suppose I were to admit they ought to be exterminated without mercy.andthat we might achieve the grand consummation. doyou nob think that it would be purchasing glory at a fearful cost? The fact is you never can civilize the Indians by military management. Wha aii Indian commits a crime or an outrage. the military strike the whole tribe for the offense perhaps of one man. This begets a spirit of resentment and resistance on the part of the whole tribe. aid perhaps many tribes. just as it would do with us. and the consequence is a war. You plant your military camps amotig them. and your soldiers soon violate eves the sternest ideas of Indian domestic morals. Female chastity yields to either trickery or fear. marital rights are generally disregarded. and shameless concubinage spreads its pestiferous stench through camp and lodge until the whole tribe becomes what Dante characterized Italy. A grand house of illfame. The most loathsome. lingering and fatal diseases which reach many generations in their ruinous effects are spread broadcast. and the seeds of moral and physical death are planted among themiserable and wretched creatures. You tell me you wfuld not exterminate the Indians. Then you must civilize them. In the present condition of this country. situated as the Indian is. surrounded on all sides as lie is by white settlements one result or the other is inevitable. There is no middle ground. H0 can no longer hang on the borders of civilization. but he must either come within its confines or be buried by its mighty wave. which has long since washed our far western shore. You all say yon would civilize the Indian. Then will you send him the sword? You would inspire him with the peaceful principles of Christianity. Is the bayonet their symbol I You would invite him to the sanctuary. Will you herald his approach with martial music. the clangtr of arms. and the thunder of artillery ? The true policy to be pursued toward the Indians is to get them upon as few reservations as possilble. � Let these reservations be sufficiently large to afford them plenty of land to cultivate. Teach them the duty and blessings of labor and the arts of peace as rapidly as you can. and as sooh as possible put them under the control of that civil law whose seat is the bosom of God. and whose voice is the harmony of the world. so that the individual will be punished for his crime and his violation of law. and the whole tribe will not be made to suffer for the wrongdoing of one man. To do this it may cost much money. but in the end it is the cheapest plan you can adopt. It is certainly the most just and the most Christian. In this policy lies the solution of this perplexing problem. which has been a souxrce of trouble to the American people from the first settlement of the country. Sir. the benevolent and Christian men and women of the country should remember that these red men worship the same God that we do. that from many a dark bosom goes up a pure prayer to the Great Spirit. that although he has not traced His laws or them on tables of stone. He has traced them on the tables of their hearts. that these poor children of nature may not know the God of revelation. but the God of the universe they acknowledge in everything around them. and. remembering these things. let them enter through the door. which is wide open. fields for Christian labor and benevolent effort that are presented everywhere. The subject is worthy their highest consideration. and they should put forth every effort to aid the Government in its great duty of protocting. educating. and elevating this downtrodden race to a higher and nobler style of being. And let us not so legislate upon this question. which is so important that it affects a whole race of people. that they will be compelled to soon hear the roar of the last wave which will bottle over them forever. or that in the future the inquisitive white man. as he stands by some great and growing city. will ponder on the structure of their disturbed remains and wonder to what mtanner of people they belonged. or that they. in the language of one of their number. will live only in the names of our lakes. rivers. cities. and towns. or only hi the songs and chronicles of their exterminators. even if these are faithful to their rude virtues as men or will pay duo tribute to their unhappy fate as a people. But lot us rather so legislate that the few of this people who remain will be brought within the precincts of civilized society. where they will stand as human monuments of Gothic grandeur. fearfuel and tremulous amid the revolutions of time. and so that the red man. as wel as the white tnau and the black man. will in the near future. even it may be when the grand cycle of the hundred years of our existence as a nation is completed. be ready with grateful hearts to exclaim: Great God. we thank Thee for this homsThis bouateous birthland of the freet Where wanderers from afar may come And breathe the air of liberty. Still may her flowers untramled spring. Her harvests wave. her cities rise. And yot. till Timo shall fold his wing.

This feeling (if reluctance arises chiefly from the sense of physical fatigue enenilered by the labor. the ureting labor. of the last throe weeks oT the session of Congress just closed. leaving us all quite worn out in body and mind. and therefore disinclined to consider a subject which may well call for our highest powers and freshest condition of miid and hody.

This right of representation to the States appears upon the face of the Constitution with peculiar emphasis. and is secured to each State beyond even the power of ameudmont by nil the other States combined. unless the consent of the State itself le given thereto. 6ubject to the qualifications required by the Constitution. of age. of citizenship. ad inhabitancy. the right of each State to chose. and. whie chosen.to keep ill the Senate. two Senators. cannot be invaded. or in any degree or in any way. directly or indirectly. iaterfered with. excopting in the exoreist of the power reserved by the Constitution to oxpol any Scnator with the concurrence of twothirds of the body. In this way. and by these means only. can a State in this Union be deprived of her full and equal representation in the Senate. and no such pretext as that suggested by the Senator from Vermont. [Mr. lhinriar.] who spoke a ifelw daysago. that thoSenato was theguardian of the States. can be permitted to deprive the States of a right end power which is their own. The Senate is in no sense the guardnun of chie rights of the States to representation. The States compos the Senate. they create the Senate. and their rights are secured by the Constitution to them. and do not rest in the discretion of the Senate in any degree. I will now use the language of the Supreme Court of the United States. delivered at the December term. 1870. which received the approvad of every member of the court. save only Mr. Justice Bradley. who disenterd. and I have not had the opportunity of examining the extent of his dissent.

The General Government and the Statessay th courtaIilough both axist within the same territorial limits. are Silparato and distinrt soirt ignies. acting separately and independently of each other. within their reosjctivo spheras. The former. in its appropriate sphone. is suprene. hot the Stats within the limits of their powers not granted. or. in the lalignage of the tenth nieadtct. reserved. are as indpendount of the General Government as Mitt. Govesnmnnt within its sphere is iolepenlent of the Stars. ilie relations existing between the two governments are well stated by the present Chief J ustice iChase) in the ease of Lane County vs. Oregon. (reported in 7th W.lliae.)  lib tite States and the United States. he observed. existed be. ore the OConetiiition. Ti people threaglo that instrument established a more perlet union by ubstitoting .o notional government. acting with ample powers directly upon the ocitizens. itstead of rite confederate governmeit. which acted. with pow11rn grennfy restricted. only upon the States. Bat. in ninny of the articles of ito Cotioitution. rho necessary existence of the States. and. within their proper apheres. che indpeaident atuthority of the States. are distinctly neogniced. To theirs nearly the whole chargI of interior regulation is c. itited or Icehi to thon. and to tie people. all powers. not expressly delegated to the national Government. arc reserved. Upon looking into the Constitution it will be found that but few of t lie articles in that intumont could be carried into practical effect without the existence of the States. Two of the great departments of the Government. the exeentivo and legislative. depend upot the exercise of the powers or uton the people of the States. The Constitution gimrirtes to rite States a republican form of government. and pro. tota eaoch agaiset invaioion or dooiteotio violonce. Such being the separate and - itdepcndnit condition of che States in our complex system. as recognized by tie Conmtitutiou. and i1re existence of which is so indiopensabl. that. without them. the General Goverinmit itself would disappear from rhe family of nations.-i Collector vs. Day. at Wallaces Reports. pp. 124. i25. Again. in referring to the same relations. the court say : Without this powerThat is. the power of selfcontrol over all such subjects as were then under consideration. such as taxationand tle exercise of it. we risk nothing in saying that no one of the States under the forni of governlntit guaranteed by the Constitation could long preserve its existenco. A despotic government might. Now. Mr. President. considering the relation of the States to the icnral Government under what hae been well called this complex systemi of ours. and iil view of the light of that recent and almost tnanimous decision of the Supreme Court. let us examine the power now sought to be exercised by the Senate of the United States in regard to the choice of Senators by the States. Under no pretext. however plausible. for no object. however laudable. ought the principles which lie at the foundation of cur system of government to be overlooked. and there never was in the history of ortr Government a more dangerous proposition enunciated than that which is contained ilt the resolution of the committee now before the Senate. That resolution is in these words: feOerl. Thit A LmXANIri CALDWtT. vas not daly and legally elected to a seat in the Senate of the United States by fite legislature of the State of Kansas. This resoLtaiOa has received the honest. unhesitating. but I think mistaken support of the Senators from Vermont and Missouri. Indeed I may say that the crowning danger of oar tite in American politics is the belief and practice in the party nowy dominant of doing any act and supporting any measure which seems to be at the moment virtuous. useful. and beneficent. withoat reference to the fact that the power to perform it is comprised within the just bounds of the ehar er of limited powers delegated to the Federal Goveranmtit. Thus we have sei. in the name and for the sake of public welare. an assumption by the Federal Government of control over subjects never committed to their charge. instances of which are to be found in the late proposition for the institution atdltudowincut aid eouttrol of colleges for public education in the several States. and now the purgation of S.ato lagislatires of riiry and corrupltion by trials of the tombors and their candidates before the Senate of the United States. The ruie for an Ameriean legislator is plain and as simple ats tre all great truths. and it is tliat his aspirations aud action for pulic welfare must be subordinated at all tiies rigidly to ti liiitations imposed by the written charter which he is sworn to support. He is not justified in straining coustruections to accoinplish his desires. however holest. unselfish. aid beneficent usay be his object. And it is to a disregard of this principle of action in legislation that I attribute almost entirely the difficulties which surround es now. have covered our country with the pall of sorrow. placed a huge debt upon our poople for many generatlions to come. and threaten its the future the very existence of onr form of government. Becauso a thing is admittedly good in itself. that is no reason why we as Federal legislators should enact it into law. unless the subject and niodo of action have been delegated to our control. nor because a thing is evil. hateful. and abominable in itself. that we should enct umeasures for its suppression. unless the power to do so is clearly within the scope of our agency. Let it not be forgotten that the powers delegated to the Federal Government are comparatively few. and that the groat mass of governmental powers are expressly reserved to the States or to the people thereof. to be called into exerciso by the exigencies of the times. under the healthful and proper demands of local selfgovernincut. the capacity for which is the true test of our people to maintain a republican form of governmcnt. We must rely upon that to remedy public abuses anid moral delinquencies. and ict our people and States learn. through the usual processes of suffcring aud sorrow. how to abate and punish evil in their midst. They will. in time. learn the truth so well stated by Montoesquieru in his Spirit of Laws: It does not requite much probity for a monarehileal or lospetieial government to maintaha or onpporb itself. The force of the laws in the one. the ari of the pinoo always uplifted in the other. regulate or keep in its place everything. But in a popuintr state some additional power ts required. which is virtue. And again : As virtio is necessary in a republic. and honor in a monarchy. fear is what is required in a sleopotiom. As for virtue. it is not at all aeccossary. cnd honor would be dangerous there. If such apothegmas should ever create an impression on the public mild. surely it is at this period of our history. when the results of congressional investigation disclose so melaucholy and discreditable a condition of political morals in many States of the Unio. Let us consider the duties and powers of this Senate in relation to its members. First. How are Senators chosen or elected. by iheni. to reprcst whom. and sOcat ? Article I. section 3. of the Constitution declares thatThe Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State. chosen by tire legislature thereof. for six years. and each Senator shall have one voto. It then proceeds to declare when they shall assemble. and that they shall be divided into three classes. and provides : And if vacancies happen by resignation. or otherwise. during the recess of the legislaturs of alry Stats. ths xoecutivo thereof may make temporary appointments util the next meeting of the legislature. which shall then fill sash vacanoies. The second provision. relating to Senators. is in section four. providiug for the time. place. and mauner of holding elections for Senators and Rlepresentatives. that they shall be 11 prescribed in each State by the legislature thereof. but the Congress may at any time. by law. make or alter such regulations. except as to the places of choosing Senators. The place is kept within the control of the State. for palpable reasons. to prevent an act of Congress causing the legislitnro to sit at any point beyond the limits of the State. or at inconvenient and inaccessible points. or at a point where they would be less under the control and protection of their own people. and that is an illustration of the reserve intended by the States over Congress. in respect of those three things conbioned in the section: time. and place. tod manner. the State to have in the first place choice of the time and manner. the Congress to have the supervising power of regulation . but. with regard to the place. Congress is to have no control whatever. that is reserved to the States exclusively. Then. in section 5. we find thatEach HouseThe Senate and House of Representativesshall be t  judgt of the elections. returns. and qualifications of its own members. and a najority .sf each shall constitute a quorum to do business. but a smaller htiumbeir may odjrurn from thay to day. and may tie authorized to compel the attedtru. of alett anotobers. in such taunor and under auch penalties as each House sany prvido. Again: !Each House shall be the judge of the qualifications. clections. and returns of its own members . and. in the same section. each House may punish its niceers for disorderly behavior. and. with the concurrence of twothirds. expel a momber. Iir I would note that it is in the same section. in the saiie fraine of lainguago. that the power to judge of elections  and to expel by twothirds ii given. The power to expel by twothirds is an unqualified power. I do not like the term absolute in a government of limited powers. and I doubt whether any power may be termed absolute under our system. but it is an unqinalfied power. it rests in the discretion of the bedy : it is capable of abase. but nevertheless it is unqualilicdly delegated. It is mteant for the necessary selfprotection of the Senate. although it should temporarily deprive a State of its full and equal representation in the Sepate. It has been argued that sch a power was naturally inherent in any representative body. and the great name of Chief Justice Shaw has been cited. But the Constitution expressly confers it. anti the Senate may. in its discretion. justly exercise it. The wisdom of requiring a twothirds instead of a majority in our populna system of government. where party organizations and purty spirit form the basis of rule. is very demonstrable. A party consisting of twotltirds of the body is already so strong that it may not only pass any resolution requiring the usual majority. bat even overcome the veto of the Executive. or impeach that official. and expel at will amy obnoxious member. It needs noillegitimate accession of power. it is strong enough already. and. therefore. being beyond temptation. is not likely to be induced to commit injustice toward any member of the minority by expelling him under false pretext. or in the spirit of party persecution. The case is quite otherwise. and all the reasons directly re versible. when a bare majority are to be considered. Each House is to be the judge of its elections . and because of this application of the same language in delegating power to each. the proposition has been advanced during the debate that the powers of the House of Representatives. and its action. are the same. and must proceed. aud may justly proceed. by the same methods as the Senate. Sir. the Constitation must be construed as a whole. In considering the powers of the House and the Senate. the constituencies of each must be considered. the form of government. the relation of the States. as States. to the General Government must be considered. The House is the popular branch of representation. The Senate is placed by the Constitution as a check opon the popularpower represented it the Honsc. You cannot clange the uature of the Senate by an implication founded upon a delegation of power in the saine let guago to both Houses where naturally the operation of the power and their action snder that delegatioi must be different. The uounbers of the House of Representatives are chosen hy. and represent directly. the people of the States. the Senators in this body represent the independent sovereigaties of the States. Tie election of a tinhuer of the House is an exercise by the people of their right of sultiae ill their pilnary capacity. Thtercis no political organization interposed between the voter axel tie House of Representatives. there is uno triiunal otf investigation or deterninatios of fact. This is not so in the easo of an celction to the Senate. An election of a Senator is the Ilelitical act of the State. it is the act of an organized political commnity. sovereign and independent as to its choice."}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
