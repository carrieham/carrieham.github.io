I rise today to congratulate Buck Layne. a good friend. on his retirement from the Searcy. Arkansas. Regional Chamber of Commerce. Buck joined the chamber in February of 1991 after applying for an executive vice-president position. He then went on to give 33 years of dedicated service and hard work for the betterment of the Searcy community. serving as president and CEO of the chamber most recently. During his time with the chamber. Buck has made impressive strides to build an economic development strategy and produce new jobs and careers for all the citizens of Searcy in White County. From expanding existing companies in the city to bringing new ones. Buck had significant accomplishments. I congratulate him for his outstanding work in Searcy. I thank him for our years of collaboration. and I wish him the best in his retirement. Remembering the Life of Bob Brooks"},{"1":"1.182023e+13","2":"2023","3":"S","4":"Mr. LANKFORD","5":"2057","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. I do appreciate the leadership on the Intelligence Committee and for the leadership that has been there. I would concur. You have a spot to be able to lead and a task to be able to be done. You have studied this. so that must mean you know it. We look forward to your leadership in the days ahead. I appreciate that very much. National Debt Mr. President. I do want to speak on a very different subject as well. and it is a subject that we are all going to face in the days ahead. It is this wonderful issue of a government shutdown. We seem to forget. at times in this body. the issues that press around us. but the one that seems to get slipped under the rug most of the time is that of national debt: where we are and how we are going to try to address this in the days ahead. The conversation comes up--it seems to be on a regular basis now--about are we going to have a government shutdown. and the conversation of a government shutdown ends up being a very small portion of the very large debt that we face. The challenge is. how do we actually address that based on its size? Well. let me just give you a little bit of context as to what I am talking about. We are. right now. preparing. within days. to cross into $33 trillion in total Federal debt--$33 trillion. To give some context of that acceleration of Federal debt and what is happening during this time period. from the time of Andrew Jackson--who was the last President who was President when we had no debt at all. From the time of Andrew Jackson until Ronald Reagan. our Nation accumulated $1 trillion in total debt. From Andrew Jackson to Reagan. there was $1 trillion in total debt. From Reagan to the present. now we are $33 trillion in total debt. We are in a rapid acceleration of debt that has not slowed. To give you again the picture of where things have gone just in the last several years. if you go back 20 years ago to 2003. our total spending was just over $2 trillion. If you go back to 2013. which was 10 years ago. our total spending was less than $3.5 trillion. Our spending this year will be right at $6.5 trillion. So in the past 20 years. our spending has increased from just over $2 trillion to $6.5 trillion. To give you the acceleration in spending just in the last few years. if I were to go back to 2018--before COVID. the 2018 time period--our total spending was just over $4 trillion. This years estimated spending is just under $6.5 trillion. That is $2.5 trillion of accelerated spending just from 2018 until now. Again. to set this in context. the revenue that is coming into the Federal Treasury this year is estimated at $4.8 trillion--$4.8 trillion. We are spending an estimated $6.4 trillion. Now. I know these are a lot of numbers. but let me give you one just as a takeaway. We have almost $1.5 trillion of deficit--that is. overspending--just this year. By some estimates. depending on what happens in the next few weeks. it could be almost $2 trillion in total overspending just this year. To put this in context. with the record revenue that is coming in this year at about $4.8 trillion. if we were spending the same this year as we did in 2018. which is a short 5 years ago--if we were spending the same this year as we were in 2018. prior to COVID. we would have a $700 billion surplus this year rather than an almost $2 trillion deficit this year. Because of the record amount of revenue coming in this year compared to what our spending was 5 years ago. we would have been in surplus this year. but we are not. and it is $1.5 trillion over that. We have a very serious issue. We should have very hard conversations about our revenue. about our spending. about the direction in which we are actually heading. and about how we get out of a $33 trillion debt. This is not going to take 1 year or 2 years. There are folks I have talked to recently even who have talked about the time in the early nineties--when we were at a balance of around $100 billion--of the work that was done by the Bush administration and the Clinton administration--two administrations in a row--to be able to get us back to a balance. Two administrations in a row had to work on that. But here is the frightening thing: Our overspending this year is more than the total spending during the Clinton administration--just our overspending this year. This is not going to be a simple process to be able to come out of. This is not even going to be two administrations in a row making agreements to be able to get back to balance. This is going to take decades. My concern is that many here are not willing to start the first year of decades of work to be able to get us out. So we have work to do on this. Myself and Senator Maggie Hassan. a Democrat from New Hampshire. sat down several years ago and started having a conversation about how do we end government shutdowns and actually get into a real dialogue about how do we actually deal with debt and deficit issues. From those productive conversations. she and I created a piece of legislation that is designed just to prevent government shutdowns. All of the conversation right now among the media seems to be about if a government shutdown is coming at the end of this year. We should not have one at the end of this month. at the end of the fiscal year. We should continue to be able to keep going. but we should also have a debate of what direction we are going to go. So Senator Hassan and I came up with a very simple proposal. It is not a partisan proposal. It is a completely nonpartisan proposal. It is a simple proposal. quite frankly. that is equivalent to two things I had growing up. One was. if you dont finish your homework at school. you have to actually stay after class to be able to finish it. If you dont finish all of your work that you had to get done there. stay after class. keep finishing it. and when you are done. you can leave. The second one was. when my older brother and I would get into an argument--which. of course. as brothers. we never did get into an argument--but in that rare moment we got into an argument. my mom would put the two of us in a room and say: You guys settle this. and when you are done. you can come out. We slammed those two ideas together into one simple proposal on how to end government shutdowns. If we get to the end of the fiscal year and the appropriations work is not done. like it is this year. we stay in session 7 days a week. and the only bills that can actually come up. that actually can be called up during that time period. are appropriations bills. The second part of it is. there is no travel for anyone. so we couldnt fly home and fly back. No official or campaign funds could be used to be able to travel. So we are in session 7 days a week. The only bills that are allowed to be brought up are appropriations bills. There is no travel. The next part of it is simple. There is what is called a continuing resolution to maintain the government to be open so that the American people and Federal workers are held harmless. It puts the pressure on this room. not on Federal workers who are working for FAA. not on people who are working for the Housing Administration. not on our Border Patrol. Those individuals dont get a vote on this. They should not feel the pressure of a government shutdown. We can keep the system moving while we still have our arguments to be able to resolve those things. Why is this so important? A couple of reasons. One is. we are the United States of America. We should actually have an organized system because the rest of the world watches us to try to figure out how to do government. When we look dysfunctional. the rest of the world says: How are we going to figure this out if even the Americans cant figure this out? We. as Americans. lose track of that at times. but the rest of the world is watching us. We should have our arguments. We are a representative republic. Every single voice counts. and we dont all agree. Great. Bring it. That demonstrates us at our best. But lets actually resolve those issues rather than having government shutdowns and chaos ensuing. because we need to set a better example for the world. The second issue is much closer to home. We need to stop having government shutdowns because the American people are calling Federal Agencies and expecting someone to answer the phone. expecting to get help with passports or permits or whatever process it may be that they have to interact with the Federal Government. They need to be able to get somebody to answer the phone to be able to resolve that. This puts the American people struggling to be able to just get basic answers. The third is the Federal workforce. We have millions of people who work in the Federal family. They work all over the country. When there is a government shutdown. there are two sets of things that actually occur. If you are a contractor. you are just out. Those contractors may be doing janitorial services in one of our buildings or they may be supplying food services to someone. They are just out. They dont get repaid. they just lose money. period. Those who are actually on the Federal payroll--they dont get their check during that time period. They have this crazy. weird. essential. nonessential. some people laid off. some people not. but everyone is in chaos in that process. For those folks who are in the Federal family. even though they may be declared essential or nonessential. do you know what--their car payments still come in. their mortgage still comes in. they still have to put food on the table. but they are not getting a check during the time of a government shutdown. So those individuals who live paycheck to paycheck. like many Americans do. suddenly have a gap--not by fault of their own but because this body couldnt resolve what we were going to do on the budgeting issues. The fourth issue I have already partially mentioned. and that is the contractors. Let me just give you an example of what this means. Our southern border right now has the worst border crisis that we have ever faced as a nation. To give you a perspective on it. in the last few days. we have had up to 9.000 people illegally crossing our border a day--a day in the last few days. We have one border crossing area just in Tucson where they had 2.000 people who crossed in a day. Those folks are being cut loose and released into the country. It is chaos along our border. Our Border Patrol and CBP and all those folks who are in law enforcement are doing their best to be able to help watch for safety and security of Americans while literally thousands of people are being cut loose into the country. They depend on some folks who are contractors in that area to help sometimes with transportation. with processing. with food. with medical care--all those things. Those contractors are very important to be able to help our Border Patrol in the chaos of what is actually happening. When there is a government shutdown. those contractors arent going to be there. and the chaotic border we have now will be even more chaotic at that moment. That should not happen because we cant resolve our differences here. We need the national security on that."},{"1":"1.172022e+13","2":"2022","3":"H","4":"Mr. SCOTT","5":"364","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Madam Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for yielding. Madam Speaker. more than 2 million Federal employees provide key services to the public. In fact. during the height of the pandemic. Federal workers were critical in delivering vaccines. personal protective equipment. and other COVID relief to the American people. So it stands to reason that when a Federal worker gets sick or injured on the job. we are obligated to provide them and their families with the resources and medical care that they need. Today. we can improve that effort by providing expanded healthcare access for injured Federal workers who are seeking healthcare covered by Federal workers compensation. We live in a country where people are increasingly turning to nurse practitioners and physician assistants as their primary healthcare provider. This is particularly true in rural America where they are disproportionately impacted by physician shortages. Unfortunately. Federal law now limits what can be reimbursed under Federal workers compensation. forcing injured workers to see only a physician to certify the injury and disability as work-related and to deliver services. It is time to correct this lag in access to healthcare. After all. core Federal healthcare programs. including Medicare and the Veterans Affairs system. already recognize services delivered by nurse practitioners and physician assistants if provided within the scope of practice allowed by State law. This bill would allow nurse practitioners and physician assistants to receive reimbursement for healthcare services they are providing to injured Federal workers if. and only if. those services are already permissible under their State laws. Madam Speaker. a yes vote on this bill is a step to expand the group of available healthcare providers consistent with existing State law so that we can ensure injured Federal workers and their families get the support and care they deserve. I thank the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) for his leadership on the bill. along with the distinguished member of the Committee on Education and Labor. the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg). and the committees ranking member. Dr. Foxx. for their support of this legislation. Madam Speaker. I urge my colleagues to support the Improving Access to Workers Compensation for Injured Federal Workers Act."},{"1":"1.172021e+13","2":"2021","3":"H","4":"Ms. JOHNSON","5":"345","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Madam Speaker. I rise today to express my support for the passage of H.R. 7. the Paycheck Fairness Act. This landmark legislation. of which I am a proud cosponsor. will close loopholes in the Equal Pay Act to better protect and promote effective remedies for workers still subject to inequitable and insufficient pay. Signed into law by President John F. Kennedy in 1963. the Equal Pay Act was the first anti-discrimination law addressing wage differences at the federal level. Now. half a century after its enactment. women and minorities still face significant wage disparities despite making great strides in the workforce. According to a study conducted by the U.S. Census Bureaus American Community Survey. the median earnings for women in Texas is $36k. compared to the median earnings of $46k for men. Across the Nation. women are only earning on average 82 cents for every dollar a man makes in similar. full-time positions. The differences are only exacerbated when you take into consideration that Black women make 63 cents. Native American women 60 cents. and Hispanic women 55 cents. As the first Black woman elected in Dallas and someone who has worked in fields dominated by men. I have witnessed and experienced firsthand the biases and hardships that women and minorities face in our workforce. That is why I am proud to announce that the advances made in this legislation are wide-ranging and significant. The Paycheck Fairness Act will protect working women against retaliation for discussing salaries. prohibit employers from screening job applicants based on their salary history. and finally require employers to prove that pay disparities exist for legitimate. job-related reasons. Additionally. this effort will make improvements to the tools available to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Labor to enforce the Equal Pay Act. Madam Speaker. as a member of the Democratic Womens Caucus. I am committed to advancing the professional development and financial security of women and minorities in our workforce. That is why I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation."},{"1":"1.162020e+13","2":"2020","3":"H","4":"Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ","5":"220","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I rise to support our best hope to prevent long-term economic damage and preserve a strong recovery. The Great Depression taught us long ago: do too little now and millions of temporary job losses will not vanish for years. With nearly 90.000 dead and 36 million out of work. any half-hearted coronavirus response is a cowardly retreat. The HEROES Act is a bold response. It lays out a safe. scientific path to reopen America through vital testing. tracing. and treatment. It supports State and local governments. provides hazard pay. and puts more money in workers and families pockets. I am proud this bill prevents veterans from being burdened with co- pays or cost-sharing for COVID-19 preventative treatment or services and includes critical protections for VA healthcare professionals. These heroes need help just like the ones we count on now: first responders. healthcare and postal workers. teachers. sanitation. transit. and food service workers. We need bold action now to keep America standing. If we dont act. it will cost a whole lot more to pick this Nation up off the ground later. By the way. I find it rich that the previous gentleman actually had the nerve and the audacity to quote Maya Angelou. She is rolling over in her grave and certainly would support this bill. {time"},{"1":"1.162019e+13","2":"2019","3":"H","4":"Mrs. WALORSKI","5":"330","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to ask my colleagues to vote down the previous question. If we defeat the previous question. Republicans will amend the rule to include the repeal of the medical device tax and the health insurance tax as part of H.R. 748. the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019. H.R. 748 is an important piece of legislation that would permanently repeal ObamaCares 40 percent tax on employer-provided health insurance. commonly referred to as the Cadillac tax. Ending the Cadillac tax will provide important relief to both employers and employees and ensure employers can remain leaders in utilizing new technologies to reduce healthcare costs and ensure better patient outcomes. However. this bill doesnt include repealing other burdensome taxes. like the medical device tax and the health insurance tax. We all know that Americans are facing rising costs and fewer healthcare options. Raising taxes on health coverage would only make matters worse for families. small businesses. and Medicare Advantage enrollees. That is why we should also include a bipartisan provision to provide seniors relief from the burdensome health insurance tax. Hoosiers are proud to be leaders in medical innovation. with more than 300 medical device manufacturers in my State that support nearly 55.000 good-paying jobs. However. after ObamaCares medical device tax took effect. the medical technology industry lost almost 29.000 jobs nationwide from 2012 to 2015. according to the Commerce Departments data. Medical devices have changed the way we think about healthcare. New technologies diagnose illnesses earlier. lowering the impact of care on a persons daily life. All these notable gains will be wiped out if the medical device tax is reinstated. By defeating the previous question. we can repeal this job-killing tax as well. It is critical that we repeal all three of these burdensome taxes before they go back into effect. Doing so will help lower premiums. improve access to care. and boost American manufacturing jobs. Mr. Speaker. I urge my colleagues to vote against the previous question."},{"1":"1.152018e+13","2":"2018","3":"H","4":"Mr. PANETTA","5":"166","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize Dr. Kerstin Wasson. the research coordinator to the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve. one of the many environmental crown jewels in my district on the central coast of California. This week. Dr. Wasson received the 2018 National Wetlands Award for Science Research. This prestigious award recognizes Dr. Wassons extraordinary commitment to the conservation and restoration of our Nations wetlands. For more than 18 years. Dr. Wasson has distinguished herself as a researcher. conservationist. and mentor at the Elkhorn Slough. It is a great fit for her as it is one of Californias few remaining coastal wetlands and a valuable. ecological asset to our community and. I believe. our country. The Elkhorn Slough reserve manager. Dave Feliz. said Dr. Wasson is a secret weapon to protect our Nations estuaries. She has been instrumental in informing coastal decisionmakers and implementing initiatives that protect the Elkhorn Slough. I thank Dr. Wasson. a wetland hero. for her work and congratulate her for this honor."},{"1":"1.152017e+13","2":"2017","3":"H","4":"Mr. HENSARLING","5":"751","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 78. the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act. I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner) for leading this effort in the House. This bill is technically about something called economic analysis or cost-benefit analysis. That may sound like Ph.D. economics. but it is really about kitchen table economics because. Mr. Chairman. it is truly about whether we are going to have a stronger economy--one that creates good-paying jobs so that parents can afford to raise their children today and these same children can have a brighter future tomorrow. It is about making sure we have an accountable government that expands personal opportunity. not government bureaucracy. Mr. Chairman. I think we all know that small businesses are truly Americas job engine. They create nearly two-thirds of all new jobs in our economy. Our economy works better for all when small businesses can focus on creating jobs and on serving their customers rather than navigating needless government red tape. Unfortunately. for Americas small businesses. bureaucratic red tape has no better friend than the Obama administration. It has issued more than 4.400 final regulations. with an astronomical cost to all of us of $1 trillion. Just since the election on November 8. the Obama administration had cynically issued 145 midnight regulations with a cost of more than $21 billion. For anyone who believes that this doesnt hurt our small businesses. they need to listen to their constituents. because I certainly listen to mine. I heard from a small business owner named Chris. who is back in my district and who wrote me: We have seen wave after wave of Federal regulations affect our ability to grow. The costs associated with additional reporting. auditing. and compliance are massive. The money spent is significant and costs jobs and potential jobs. Mr. Chairman. he is exactly right. The true cost of Washington red tape cannot just be measured in dollars. The true cost includes the jobs not created. the small businesses not started. and the dreams of our children not fulfilled. Ill-advised laws like the Dodd-Frank Act empower unelected. unaccountable bureaucrats to callously hand down crushing regulations without adequately considering what impact those regulations have on jobs. As one former SEC Commissioner testified before the Financial Services Committee. which I have the honor of chairing. these Washington elites have forgotten the key to sensible regulation: The most appropriate regulatory solution should be the one that imposes the least burden on society while maximizing potential benefits even if that means choosing not to regulate at all. Although the Securities and Exchange Commission is one of the few Washington agencies that engages in at least some base level of economic analysis. putting this requirement into law is definitely preferable to current agency procedures. After all. the SECs recent interest in economic analysis came only on the heels of numerous Federal courts throwing out some of its regulations because the Commission failed to adequately take into account. again. the true costs and benefits of its rules. Passing this bill will erase any doubt that the Securities and Exchange Commission must conduct sound economic analysis. It must consider the impact of their rules on our jobs and our family budgets. That is what cost-benefit analysis is all about. Mr. Chairman. we may hear today from the usual suspects--the opponents of this bill--that somehow this is meant to hinder the rulemaking process and encourage litigation against the SEC. You will hear these same people say. once again. that this is somehow dangerous. Mr. Chairman. what is dangerous is being ignorant of the impact the proposed regulations will have on our economy and on the American peoples wallets before they get implemented. That is what is dangerous. What is interesting. Mr. Chairman. is that Presidents. frankly. of both parties seem to agree. Even Presidents Clinton and Obama directed independent agencies to engage in. essentially. exactly the same procedures that H.R. 78 would make into law. Such irony. Mr. Chairman. that some Democrats will come to the floor today and oppose codifying into law Clinton and Obama policy. Again. the irony of it all. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill because we must hold Washington accountable to the American people. We must build a stronger. healthier economy so struggling Americans can get back to work and achieve financial independence. Mr. Chairman.

We are not debating making America more competitive and bringing jobs from overseas and China back home here and creating a growing middle class. Instead. we are wasting time on legislation that wont become law. that shouldnt even become law because it is the inappropriate role of this body. There are so many things that we could be talking about even within the energy realm and the EPA realm that would be productive discussions. I will give you an example. I have had the opportunity in hearings in the Natural Resources Committee to bring up a bipartisan bill that I have with Mr. Gosar twice this week. and this is the third time. It is a bill that would create jobs and create renewable energy. It is called the Public Lands Renewable Energy Development Act. Why dont we have a rule on that bill or bring it up on suspension? Mr. Gosar and my bill would incentivize renewable energy development by streamlining the permitting process on public lands for renewable energy projects. Isnt that something we can come together about. making sure that we can find a way to expedite siting for renewable energy products on public land. creating jobs and creating clean energy? Or we could be discussing the need for a permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. something that just last week was offered as a bipartisan amendment by myself and Mr. Grijalva and Mr. Sanford of South Carolina. But. of course. that amendment was not given an hour of debate. 2 hours of debate. like this. We have the rule. we have the bill. The entire legislative day is discussing a stay on brick kilns. It should be in a courtroom. not in the U.S. House. We werent even given 10 minutes. We werent even given 1 minute to discuss that bipartisan amendment from Mr. Grijalva and Mr. Sanford and myself. Look. the list goes on and on of what we could be doing. It has been said that politics is the art of the possible. When the American people look at our proceedings on the floor and what the Republican majority is doing with Congress. is it any wonder that the approval rating of Congress is 8 percent? The people look at Congress and say. look. you are spending an entire day debating a stay on kiln rules. First of all. why are you talking about it? It should be in a courtroom. Second of all. arent there critical national priorities that you need to be debating right now to create jobs. make America more competitive overseas. improve our schools. make college more affordable. balance our deficit. fix our broken immigration system. improve our roads and bridges. make America more competitive and grow the middle class?

I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Mr. Infiesta for his years of dedication and public service and to congratulate him on his retirement. In 1973. Julio began his career with the Social Security Administration. serving in various local offices in the New York metropolitan region. including in the South Bronx. where he was an operations supervisor. and in Long Beach. where he was selected as branch manager. In 1976. he became a social insurance specialist in the New York regional office in field operations. Mr. Infiesta also served as assistant district manager and district manager in the Jamaica and Flushing offices until 2001. when he entered the agencys Advanced Leadership Program. Mr. Infiesta was promoted to the position of deputy assistant regional commissioner for management and operations support and also served as the acting assistant regional commissioner for management and operations support. As a member of the Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Program. he served as an area director and as the director for disability in the office of the deputy commissioner for operations. In 2003. Mr. Infiesta was selected as the regions assistant regional commissioner for management and operations support and was elevated to deputy regional commissioner in 2014. As Social Securitys second senior ranking official in the New York metropolitan region. Mr. Infiesta oversaw Social Security operations in New York. New Jersey.

I rise today in opposition to the further outsourcing of American jobs through more unfair trade agreements. The Obama administration is currently working on the next executive branch jobkilling socalled free trade agreement. They are calling it the TransPacific Partnership. or TPP. The contents of this agreement have been kept secret from the American people and Members of Congress and. as well. the general public wherever they might live. The administration is using the same old failed trade model called fast track to negotiate this. which means whatever they negotiate. we dont get to see. and then they bring it up here under a fast track procedure. That process ties our hands. They bring it up in one lumpsum vote. with no amendments allowed. And they usually do it in a lameduck session of Congress after election and just try to ram it through. usually very late in the evening. often in the early morning hours. Since fast track was first used. the United States has accumulated red inktrade deficits. more imports coming in here than exports going outfor nearly three decades. We have accumulated over $9 trillion in trade deficits. If you want to know why we have a budget deficit. it is because we have a trade deficit. We have outsourced too many jobs to lowwage havens. Go out and try to buy anything made in America. right? The American people know this inherently. More than 7 million goodpaying American manufacturing jobs have been lost since fast track was first passed. Every poll of U.S. opinion tells this Congress: What do the American people care about? Jobs and the economy. Jobs and the economy. They care about economic recovery. So why is this administration using the same old model that goes back to 1975? Now they are looking at the Pacific. the Pacific region. as if we havent had relations with some of those countries before. But every other agreement has resulted in red ink. The American people want job creation. not job outsourcing. Actually. if this President were to refurbish this failed trade model and really fix it. it would be the first time in modern history that our trade policy would yield job creation in this country. net job creation in this country and real income growth for the American people. Now. lets look at a couple dimensions of this. The trade deficit in 2012. the last year for which we have confirmed numbers. was half a trillion dollars. $534 billion. That alone resulted in over 2 million lost jobs in this country. That number has just been getting worse with each passing decade. more and more jobs lost. Lets look at some of the countries. Lets take China. The trade deficit in 2000 with China was about $83 billion. It has increased four fold. It has quadrupled. In 2012. for which we have confirmed numbers. we had over $315 billion in trade deficit with China. Every billion equals 4.000 lost jobs in this country. So we are net negative with Chinaa job loss of over 1.200.000 more U.S. jobs. With Japan. we have been solidly negative for decades. In 2012. our trade deficit with Japan was $76 billion. With Mexico. they said after NAFTA. oh. it is going to be great for America. there are going to be millions of jobs in the United States. Wrong. Our jobs were outsourced. In fact. in the year 2000. we had a $24 billion deficit with Mexico. By 2012. that had gone up three times more to $61 billion in the redin the redour jobs going there. their exports coming here. not the reverse. Thats 244.000 more lost jobs. The numbers dont lie. In Korea. we had a discussion with some of the Presidents advisers. They said. well. you know. that was supposed to be the new trade model. the Korean trade deal that this President proposed was going to change everything. Well. guess what? We are in the red with Korea. too. In 2000. we already had a $12 billion trade deficit. Yes. more red ink. After the new Korean free trade deal. in 2012. it has nearly doubled. It is $16.6 billion. And in 2013. just through November. it is nearly $20 billion. That is a doubling of the trade deficit with Korea and 80.000 more lost U.S. jobs. So if this fast track free trade is such a great trade model. how is it working for the American people? It isnt. None of these trade deals are working. It might be working for certain transnational corporations who can pay their investors more because of the profits they are making off of cheap labor in low wage haven and the lack of environmental regulations in these other countries. but it is not working for the benefit of the American economy. the American people. It is time to change the trade model. Let me just put two other numbers on the record here. We have over 1.5 million Americans over 45 years of age who still are unemployed. These are people who have worked their whole lives. We cant even get them unemployment benefits and their jobs have been shipped out someplace else. Mr. Speaker. later in the week I will talk about the cost of environment degradation in this country because of imports that are not properly regulated by the Department of Agriculture coming over our border and doing harm from coast to coast. Its long. long over due for a new trade model that benefits our nation and creates jobs here at home."},{"1":"1.130032e+09","2":"2013","3":"S","4":"Mr. SCHATZ","5":"982","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. President. I am here today to briefly discuss an amendment to an important provision in the immigration bill that the Senate is considering concerning Stateless persons. Section 3405 of the comprehensive immigration bill would. for the first time. recognize and provide protections to those people in the United States that have no nationalitythey are Stateless. There are countless men. women. and children in the United States today who cannot claim any nation as their home. Many lost their nationality when their country of origin ceased to exist as a result of political upheaval. rampant persecution. or violent conflict. The comprehensive immigration bill would encourage these people in the United States to come forward and apply to be recognized as Stateless persons. Under the proposed law. if an individual is recognized as Stateless. they could seek conditional lawful status. provided they meet the appropriate requirements. and be protected from being deported back to a State they no longer recognize as their home. The amendment I am offering to the immigration bill would advance this important effort to recognize and protect Stateless persons living in the United States. We live in a time when political turmoil. persecution. and war are no longer the only conditions creating Stateless persons. Today. rapid and extreme environmental change threatens to erode national boundaries and make States uninhabitable to people. This is not an abstract challenge. Lowlying island States and atolls in the Pacific and Indian Oceans today face an existential crisis due to inexorable sea level rise that is making them uninhabitable. In Kiribati. for example. rising seas are contaminating local water tables with salt water. denuding fertile land and decimating island crops. The threat of higher seas also makes Kiribati. the Marshall Islands. and other island States more vulnerable to extreme weather that will inundate these countries with swells of storm surge and leave whole communities literally underwater. And in a short time. these island States will disappear beneath the waves. Sea level rise is just one of the dramatic challenges the world faces as a result of climate change. Other environmental stressors are manifesting in States around the world that carry similar consequences as well. In North Africa. for instance. countries such as Morocco. Tunisia. and Libya lose hundreds of square miles of fertile land each year to desertification. driving away farming communities that are accustomed to living off the land. In Southeast Asia. salt water intrusion from sea level rise is destroying aquaculture ponds that communities rely on for economic development and food. uprooting families from their homes and driving them inland in search of new ways to support their livelihoods. And rapidly receding glaciers in the Himalayan Plateau threaten to make the headwaters of the regions major rivers run dry. with consequences for downstream communities that may eventually be forced from their homes in search of new water sources. Scientists expect that climate change will exacerbate these environmental stressors. including drought. glacial melt. and heat waves. transforming once fertile landscape into barren and uninhabitable land. Besides these slow onset challenges. there are more people at risk today of being made permanently homeless by extreme weather events like typhoons. hurricanes. and other storms that threaten to decimate communities. And. unfortunately. the populations most at risk also happen to be the worlds poorest people who too often have no other choice but to abandon their homes once disaster strikes. By the end of the century. climate change will eclipse war as the greatest driver of homelessness around the world. We can and must protect those people who are in the United States from being deported to a country that is no longer inhabitable due to sea level rise or other environmental changes that leave the state uninhabitable to people. The amendment I am proposing is quite simple. If enacted. the Secretary of Homeland Security. in consultation with the Secretary of State. may designate individuals or a group of individuals displaced permanently by climate change as Stateless persons. Again. let me be clear about what this amendment does. It simply recognizes that climate change. like war. is one of the most significant contributors to homelessness in the world. And like with States torn apart and made uninhabitable by war. we have an obligation not to deport people back to a country made uninhabitable by sea level rise and other extreme environmental changes that render these states desolate. It does not grant any individual or group of individuals outside the United States with any new status or avenue for seeking asylum in the United States. Finally. the amendment also recognizes that the climate challenges that other States face are not unique to people beyond U.S. borders. Indeed. Hawaii. Alaska and other States are and will continue to experience increased environmental pressures. with sea level rise. drought. wild fires and extreme weather driving Americans from their homes. As such. the amendment would require the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study assessing the impact of climate change on internal migration in the United States and U.S. territories. The GAO report will assess the impacts and costs on existing Federal. State. and local services of various regions resulting from climate changeinduced migration of U.S. citizens. This important study will help the United States chart a path forward for responding to internal persons displaced by environmental change and extreme weather events. and identify what resources the Federal. State. and local governments need to invest in to adequately respond to climateinduced migration. Climate change is one of the greatest challenges the United States will confront this century. But with the kinds of forwardthinking and pragmatic policies I am proposing today. we can put the United States on a path to respond to the challenges the country will face. and help protect those communities most at risk. I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this important effort."},{"1":"1.120102e+09","2":"2012","3":"H","4":"Ms. WOOLSEY","5":"185","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. in my dictionary. a slush fund is defined as a fund for bribing public officials or carrying on corruptive propaganda.

In concept. I agree with Chairman LoBIONDO that we should enact a stringent uniform national standard for ballast water treatment technologies for commercial vessels. It makes sense to set a high standard that is technologically achievable and reduces the likelihood of introducing invasive species into our native waters. My amendment does not add or change any technological requirements in the bill. Let me say that again. My amendment does not add or change any technological requirements in the bill. This is an issue of extreme importance to industry for understandable reasons. Nor does it give States carte blanche to prevent ships from releasing ballast water. It simply provides for the ability of States to petition the Federal Government. under a set of criteria that protects international and domestic commerce. to identify and protect highly sensitive water resources within a States existing jurisdiction. My amendment is not without precedent. In 1996. Congress amended the Clean Water Act to require the Department of Defense to work with the EPA to regulate ballast water from military vessels through the Uniform National Discharge Standards program. In providing for these uniform national standards. the thenRepublicanled Congress acknowledged a deep respect for the rights of States. including a residual authority for States to establish no discharge zones similar to those that would be allowed under my amendment if it were to pass. Section 312 of the Clean Water Act. which is probably the closest analogy to the issue of ballast water discharges from commercial vessels. establishes uniform standards for discharges of marine sanitation devices. Section 312 specifically reserves a role for States to create no discharge zones for important State waters. provided that those zones will not adversely impact vessels from operating within the States. The issue really boils down to this: If you believe that States have a role to play. however limited. in determining if some of their State waters deserve additional protections while maintaining a uniform national standard. then you should vote for the Bishop amendment. If. on the other hand. you believe that States should have absolutely no say whatsoever in protecting particularly sensitive waters within their jurisdictions. then you should oppose the Bishop amendment. Given what weve done thus far in this Congress. I would hope that Members would continue to assert that States have a role. Earlier this year. we passed H.R. 2018. the Cooperative Federalism Act of 2011. This bill would eliminate any Federal role in setting baseline water quality standards. giving full discretion to the States. The bill that is before us flips that precisely. It would provide no role for the States and give 100 percent of the role to the Federal Government. I would ask that the House continue to recognize the role of States in setting standards for water quality in waters that they control. so I would urge the adoption of my amendment. Before I close. I do. though. want to thank Chairman LOBIONDO. We worked very hard over the last several weeks in trying to come to a resolution of this matter. We were unable to get there. but it was not for lack of trying. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their efforts to bring this matter to a bipartisan resolution. Im sorry we couldnt get there. but as I say. it was not for lack of trying. With that. I reserve the balance of my time."},{"1":"1.110152e+09","2":"2010","3":"H","4":"HOYER","5":"1201","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I thank my friend from California.

And that America. which has been the engine of economic opportunity. will be an even greater engine of economic opportunity for our people. It will create jobs and growth. Manufacturing is critical. and Americans know it. critical to our economic strength. And Democrats are committed to rebuilding it as a part of Americas economic recovery. Mr. PERLMUTTER has a chart there which shows that we were handed a debt of an economy. the deepest recession in three quarters of a century. There are only a couple of Members. a few Members of the House. who were alive 75 years ago. There are some. America understands why theyre feeling pain because of this debt left to us by the last administration. You showed the deficit. the figures. Ive served with all four of those Presidents. I tell my friend Mr. GARAMENDI. I served with all four of those Presidents. One of them was a Democratthe only one whos above the line. the only President in the lifetime of anybody in this institution that has had a net surplus. The only one. Now we show four Presidents here. but very frankly you can go back for as long as youve been alive. no President ended with a net surplus as Bill Clinton dida $5.6 trillion surplus left by that administration. An ability to address our problems. Unfortunately. we failed to do so. Unfortunately. we had an administration that thought just helping the wealthiest in America. buying things and not paying for them. going to war and not paying for it. doing a prescription drug billwhich has done some good thingsbut not paid for. was the thing to do. And. therefore. we find the economy tanked. And in 1 month in America we lost 786.000 jobs. That was the last month of the Bush administration. 3.8 million jobs lost in the last year of the Bush administration. And what does that mean? If you look at the last year of the Clinton administration. we had 1.9 million new jobs created. So Americans know that weve got to put America back to work. And one of the best ways to do that. Americans are telling usRepublicans talk about listening to Americaone of the best ways to do that is to start making it in America and sending it to other nations. Not the other way around. Putting our people back to work. Thank you. Doctor. I appreciate that. In coming weeks we will be bringing to the floor the Make It in America agenda. A comprehensive strategy to boost American manufacturing. Its based on the idea that when more products are made in America. more wellpaying. blue collar jobs. white collar jobs. nocollar jobs are going to be created. and it will be possible for more people to make it in America. This bill. the Manufacturing Enhancement Act. is the first piece of that agenda. It includes hundreds of tariff suspensions and reductions so that American companies will find it easier to obtain the materials they need to produce goods. grow. and add workers. which we passed today. So weve already started on that agenda. And by the way. I noticed that our Republican friends out of habit voted no. Then they started talking to one another and said. Hey. you know what this bill does? It starts to grow our economy. By the way. the National Association of Manufacturers are for this bill these Democrats put on the floor. Theyre for it because they know it helps to build jobs. And. oh. by the way. the Chamber of Commerce is for this bill. Why? Because it starts to build jobs. Thats the agenda the Democrats are on. And did you notice how they sort of all talked and said. Hey. gee. maybe I better vote for that bill and we saw those noes go to aye. noes go to yes. It was a strange experience for them. I hope its catching. I hope they will keep doing it. I hope they will keep saying yes to the American worker. I hope they will keep saying yes to growing manufacturing capability in America. I hope they will say yes to the proposition that we can. we should. and we will make it in America. America is the greatest land on the face of the Earth. and our people are some of the most talented. innovative. entrepreneurial people on Earth. and if we give them the tools and we give them the opportunity. they will compete with anybody in the world. Thats why we. Democrats. are committed to an agenda that says. yes. we can. we will make it in America. and in that enterprise. a manufacturing expansion. more people will make it in America. I thank the gentleman for yielding. For generations. Americans have looked to our manufacturing sector as a source of pride. a source of economic vitality. and a source of goodpaying jobs. Along with every part of our economy. manufacturing has taken a severe hit from the recessionbut more than that. many Americans worry that industry and the jobs it provides are gone for good. We have a chance to change thatto emerge from these hard times as a stronger. more competitive company. Thats why Democrats are launching the Make It in America Agenda: a comprehensive manufacturing strategy based on the idea that when more products are made in America. more people will be able to make it in America. The Make It in America Agenda will create incentives for investment in industry. strengthen manufacturing infrastructure and innovation. and help to level the playing field for American companies that compete globally. Today. the first part of that agenda passed the Houseand. Im proud to say. it passed with strong bipartisan support. The U.S. Manufacturing Enhancement Act will make it easier for American companies to get the materials they need to produce goods. contributing to a more productive economy and supporting job creation. In the weeks to come. Democrats look forward to introducing a range of similar bills that will help manufacturers invest in clean energy. break down foreign barriers to American goods. ensure that taxpayer money pays for goods made in America. and more. A strong manufacturing sector means a stronger economy and more secure jobs for all of our constituentsso I hope that the Make It in America Agenda will have support from Republicans and Democrats alike."},{"1":"1.110111e+09","2":"2009","3":"H","4":"WALDEN","5":"4005","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Well. its that season. The Christmas season is upon us. And I sort of felt like I must have been at the Nutcracker. because I havent seen that much spin since the sugar plum fairies in the Nutcracker. Lets talk about jobs and the recovery. Lets talk about fact and fact. When the American Recovery Act. the stimulus. was raced through this floor on a totally partisan move. we were told to expect that with the stimulus. as you can see here in this chart to my left. that this is what would happen to unemployment. Now. remember. when the year started and President Obama took office and the Democrats claimed control of the Senate with a 60seat margin. that can overrun any filibuster60 seatsand a 40seat margin here in the House means they are unparalleled in their power and control and ability to pass anything they want anytime they want and sign it into law. When the year started. unemployment was at 7.6 percent in January of this year. High. by national standards. No doubt about it. Highest it had been in many years. We were headed into a recession. No doubt about it. Wed been through unprecedented times. But we were told if the American taxpayers would just go out and loan the Congress. actually its not the American taxpayers yet. its our kids and grandkids that get to pay it back later. Right now were going to the Chinese and the Japanese and the oilproducing countries and saying. Can you loan us the money? But thats the dirty little secret here. If youll loan us that $800 billion. whatever it was. heres where unemployment will end up. Its going to just barely go up and come out at about 8 percent. Oh. and by the way. we were told by some of the Democrats who were all for this that if we didnt pass the stimulus into law. that unemployment would go clear up to here. Now lets look at what really happened. Many of us on the Republican side of the aisle said. That isnt going to work. Just throwing more taxpayer money you dont have. borrowing more money from foreign countries that already have loaned us more than they want to. and throwing that out in rapid succession may create a few jobs. but the longterm implications are dangerous for the future of this country because of debt. And youre not going to create that many jobs. Sure. in a year or two you cant help but create jobs. and well talk about some of those because a lot of them are created right here in the Washington. D.C. area. not out in real America. and are not sustainable. But we were told if we pass it. heres where well be with unemployment. at about 8 percent. If we dont pass it. gosh. well end up almost at 9 percent. So they rushed it through here. The stimulus rushed through here. And now what are we at? Were over 10 percent unemployment. Thats the red line. You see. some of us on the Republican side of the aisle actually come out of the private sector. We actually have signed the fronts of payroll checks like I have and my wife has. For 21. almost 22 years we were small business owners. We took over a very small family business. got it out of debt. on its feet and we grew it in 20 years. We employed 15 to 17 people in small communities in Oregon. I know what its like to be a small business owner and comply with the heavy hand of government regulation and the burdens of taxation and all the things that you all in government think ought to happen because you know best how to create jobs. What a farce that is. So we see what happens when you throw money at a problem: You waste it. and you dont create jobs. You see. Republicans did have an alternative. My friends and colleagues who were on the floor here earlier said that we had no alternative. Well. they know thats really not the case at all. In fact. the 5. Pt. 23 December 15. 2009 Congressional Budget Office evaluated both of our plans and said the Republican alternative would create twice the jobs at half the cost. Now. there are a lot of smart Christmas shoppers out there. Boys and girls. men and women. come closer. There are a lot of smart shoppers out there who look for bargains. and they say. If I could get twice the product at half the cost. thats a bargain. Unless youre the Democrat majority in the House and the Senate and downtown. then you want to spend twice as much and get half as much. You want to tell the American people. Pass my plan and Ill get you no more than maybe 9 percent unemployment. somewhere in the upper 8s. Actually. no. they said it wouldnt go above 8. Thats right. They said it wouldnt go above 8. Whoa. It was at 7.6 and now its at over 10. And lets talk about what happened to that stimulus. So how did they spend the money? There was an interesting report out in The Hill-$6 million borrowed from your kids and grandkids. actually borrowed from the Chinese. the Japanese. the oilproducing countries that buy our debt. and our kids and grandkids will get to repay this with interest. Six million of those dollars went to now Secretary of State Hillary Clintons pollster. Im not making this up. folks. This is not a fairy tale. Two firms run by Mark Penn. current Secretary of State Clintons former Presidential campaign pollster. received a total of $5.97 million in taxpayer funds from the Democrat stimulus that you heard created all these jobs. solved all these problems. BursonMarsteller. a public relations and communications firm run by Penn. received the funding to advertise the analog to digital television switch in 2008. reportedly saving three jobs at the firm. Three jobs. $6 million. Of the $5.97 million. $2.8 million was also allocated to Penns campaign polling firm. Penn. Schoen and Berland. At the end of the day. taxpayers spent $6 million to save three jobs. $6 million. three jobs. How many of you go home to your constituents and say. in a town meeting. Can you loan me $6 million. because Ive got a brilliant way to create three jobs for Hillary Clintons pollsters and public relations people to tell people in America that. by the way. you are going to switch from analog to digital on your TV which. by the way. they were very capable of figuring out on their own. We didnt need to spend the nearly $2 billion that was spent in the overall conversion effort to educate the public. They got it. Theyre smart enough to figure this stuff out. And if theyre not. theyve got 12yearold kids that can figure out how to make the DVD not blink and the VCR not blink. But anyway. $6 million. two jobs. Two million on a dance theater. Oh. this one youll like. Los Angeles Times. The Minneapolis city council recently voted to use Federal stimulus funds to convert a vacant. 99yearold theater into a center of dance instead of funding a solar energy panel manufacturing plant that would have created seven times as many jobs. Now my friends who were talking before me talked about the green energy jobs. Well. here was a perfect opportunity. with your Federal tax dollars. to create green energy jobs and the Minneapolis city council decided to put it into a dance theater instead. The dance project will cost $2 million and create 48 permanent jobs. according to the city. Cl 2045 Interestingly. in the spring newsletter. the theater estimated that completing the project would actually only create 26 fulltime and parttime permanent jobs. So in their spring newsletter. they said 26. Now its reported at 48. The solar energy panel manufacturing plant. meanwhile. that was in competition for that stimulus money received less than $300.000. compared with the dance theaters $2 million. yet the plant would have created more than 360 jobs by 2011. But they couldnt do the right. what is it. minuet? They couldnt spin just correctly. They werent. I dont know. maybe they didnt have the right tutu on or the right shoes or something. They only had $300.000. The dance theater got $2 million. Americans could have created 360 jobs in Minneapolis. They made that decision. Councilman Paul Ostroff was the single councilman voting against the Center of Dance saying the theater wasnt creating enough jobs to qualify for stimulus money. whereas. the solar energy plant clearly fit the Presidents goal. It was a home run. It was a home run. I told you a week or so ago about the $95.000 being spent to study Vikingera pollen in Iceland. Vikingera pollen in Iceland. $95.000. Having been a small business person Ive helped create jobs. and Ive watched every nickel. You do that when youre in real America. Not back here. When youre in real America and creating real jobs. and youre trying to get to something we call positive cash flow and maintain that. you watch every nickel. You dont let $95.000 go out the door to study Vikingera pollen in Iceland. You make sure that you invest every cent correctly and effectively. You dont just spend money rampantly. You dont throw it out the door. Its too hard to earn. And youre trying to grow your business. Youre trying to expand your business. Thats what the American way is about. My friend earlier talked as if the whole American recovery. the whole economy and the greatness that we have. originated because of some Federal programs in the Great Depression. the WPA the CCC. And certainly they left a nice footprint behind with some of our fantastic park lodges and buildings. And they did some wonderful work. That is not the essence of Americas economy. It doesnt start and stop right here In these two wells. the Well of the House or there at the leadership tables. We are not the innovators and creators of jobs. That is out there in America. Ladies and gentlemen. in the real world. when somebody has an idea. they get a couple of people together who want to believe in that idea. and they put their money forward. They dont go take it from somebody like the tax man or woman does. They put their money at risk. And they say. if we do it a little better. a little smarter. we can be successful. We can create jobs. We can benefit from that. And by the way. its our money at risk as private citizens. So. were going to be real careful how that gets spent. Were not going to waste it on lavish offices and all these things. Thats the real America out there. You know what Im talking about. small businessmen and women. You go behind the counter and behind the wall. and they have a brokendown chair and a computer thats sort of wired together that they try and keep operating. and they have paper piled around. I have been in your offices. I had one of your offices. I can show you the pictures and the piles. I know what its like to work day and night to make your idea successful. That is the American entrepreneurial spirit that works. And yet here in Washington under the party thats in power. they know no limit. no limit to Federal government involvement in your life. They know no limit to borrowing. spending. and believing that they should take over your health care. The Democrats want to put a bureaucrat between you. your insurance company. and your doctor. Its bad enough with the bureaucracy thats out there today trying to get health care. I paid for health care for our employees. my wife and I did. paid 100 percent of the premium. I know what those cost increases look like. We never could target enough to figure how much they would go up. And I want to do something to reform health care. and I have supported many proposals to do so. The irony is the plans coming out of this Congress. these plans however. increase premiums on employers. drive up the cost curve on those of us who are trying to figure out how to make health care more affordable. The Democrats plan actually drives up the cost curve. drives up the premium. puts mandates on individuals and taxes on small businesses and will cost millions of jobs long term and make America less competitive. You dont think capital doesnt flow any more? You dont think we live in a global economy? For heavens sakes. You dont think we need to be on our best game and have the most efficient process available to create jobs and run a business? No. I sit here in amazement. I have spent allnighters in my business trying to make it work. I have struggled trying to pay the bills. get up early in the morning. trying to figure it all out. trying to cut your costs. trying to create your jobs. save jobs during tough times. We were in business 22 years. I have seen the good times. and we were successful in the end. I have seen the bad times. and I know what thats like. But I also know that its important how you spend your money. FOX News reported recently the National Institutes of Health received $8.2 billion in stimulus funds. Im all for the National Institutes of Health. However. NIH is conducting a $65.472 study on the relationship between HIV and sex in St. Petersburg. Russia. You think Im making this stuff up. dont you? $65.472 to study the relationship between HIV and sex in St. Petersburg. Russia. I wont even go there. $700.000 on how taxes. trade. and politics affects tobacco sales in Thailand. Malaysia. Vietnam. and other nations in Southeast Asia. $73.000youll like this oneto study whether the Asian tradition of dragon boat racing will enhance the lives of cancer survivors--$73.000 to look at whether or not dragon boat racing enhances the lives of cancer survivors. Why dont we put it into screenings? Oh. thats right. This is the administration that says. women dont really need to do breast screenings nearly as often or maybe at all. Thats a report that came out of this administration. How absurd is that? Put your money in dragon boat racing. dont do mammograms. This doesnt make sense to me. And I dont think it makes sense to Americans. We are looking at some of the other spending. How about this one: $67.726 in taxpayer money to send staff to a customer service seminar. the Green Bay PressGazette reports. The Oneida Bingo and Casino outside of Green Bay. Wisconsin. used a Federal stimulus grant to send their staff to a customer service seminar. The 2day seminar was held at a local technical college to teach the casino staff how to handle confrontations with customers. These are the investments. Do you see why some of us. why every Republican voted against that stimulus? We knew it was going to be wasted. Now lets go to the Congressional Budget Office because they said in the first year or two you cant spend that much money and not create a few jobs. even though they are probably short term. So I give them that. What they look at after that. though. is the debt service cost that actually becomes in the out years. years 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. a debt drag on the economy. It will cost us jobs because you cant borrow $800 billion and not have to pay it back. Even the Federal Government needs to learn that lesson. Lets talk about the debt. because I think that is the single biggest threat to our countrys future. to my sons future. to your childrens future. is this enormous theft. intergenerational theft I think Senator JOHN MCCAIN called it. where were taking money from them. Actually were just stealing their credit card. and were using it like there is no necessity to ever pay it back. to buy things today that they get the bill for later. At $1.4 trillion. this years deficit is more than three times that of a year ago. I want that number to sink in. $1.4 trillion dollars this year is triple what it was last year. Oh. and who was President last year? Thats right. George W. Bush was. So they want to blame the prior administration. And certainly we all had our complaints at times with any administration. But the facts are these: $455 billion deficit at the beginning of this last fiscal year. this fiscal year. under Democrat control. House. Senate. White House. $1.4 trillion. As a share of the economy. its 10 percent of gross domestic product. That is the highest level since World War II. Deficits. however. went up under both parties. Thats why we need a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. The great State of Oregon has had that in its constitution for as long as I can remember. and maybe since Statehood. And it has forced the State legislature and the Governor to make tough decisions to balance the budget. Sometimes I have agreed with those decisions. sometimes I havent. Sometimes theyve raised taxes and sometimes theyve cut spending. But at the end of the day. they had to balance the budget. If you want to reform this Congress. you would require that this Congress. every time. and the President. regardless of party. has to balance the budget. You could have an exemption if youre at war or in times of emergency. I understand that the Federal Government has some unique roles to play. But this is spending with reckless abandon. This is out of control. Debt held by the public rose above $7.5 trillion. or over 50 percent of gross domestic product. the highest level of the share of the economy in 50 years. When Speaker PELOSI took over. it was at $8.9 billiontrillion dollars. Sorry. Its so hard to keep track of billions going to trillions. We used towell. I think 100 bucks is a lot. When youre spending taxpayer money. were talking billion. millions. forget it. billions. we dont even go there any more. We are now talking trillions. So when Speaker PELOSI took over. the national debt was $8.9 trillion. Now why does that matter? The House controls the purse strings of what gets spent. So whoever controls the House starts every spending bill. Thats how the process works. Its simple civics. The House. the United States House of Representatives. this body. you men and women who are watching or here tonight know that thats how it really works. The President can veto it. but at the end of the day. its the House and the Senate that get together. The Congress controls the purse strings. The House originates these things. So $8.9 trillion. the debt is now $12 trillion. Every man. woman and child in America is responsible for at least $39.000. and its going up to $45.000. Under the Presidents budget. the debt is projected to double in the next 5 years. triple in 10. It will be roughly threefourths the size of the entire economy by 2019. Now I want you to think about a debt that goes to $17 trillion. $18 trillion. $19 trillion. $20 trillion. and how you ever pay that back. When Republicans were in charge of the Congress and before the 9/11 attacks and the wars broke out. we actually paid down debt. half a trillion dollars worth. It was a proud moment for our country and for this Congress and for both parties. But it was really Republicans who drove it. We had a Democrat President. We worked in a bipartisan way to get it done. though. And the economy is strong. And we paid down debt. Now go with me on this. Ladies and gentlemen. boys and girls. get closer to that TV because were going to go through some math here. I was a journalism major. not a math major. but I think I can figure this one out. Twenty trillion dollars is at issue here. To pay it off. presume that Congress would have to run a surplus of $1 trillion a year for a 20year span and not spend it. actually apply it to paying down the debt. How many in this Chamber tonight think thats going to happen? Raise yourwell. nobody raised their hands. Because nobody believes Congress will ever run a trillion dollar surplus under any condition and apply it to pay down the debt. Thats why these issues today in our countrys life are so critical. because we have taken our kids and grandkids and probably great grandkids credit cards and spent like there was no reason not to. And theyre going to get the bill. According to The Washington Post. when adjusted for the inflation. World War II. the Korean War. the interstate highway system. the Vietnam War. the race to the moon. and the Iraq War added up to $6 trillion. We are now at 12. and we are headed to 20. In comparison. the government will borrow $9 trillion over the next decade. Now. lets go to a bill that just came up in this House Chamber. Its called the omnibus. Whenever you hear that word. shutter your childrens eyes and ears. Omnibus. Its really a bad thing. American families are hurting. Ten percent unemployment. Democrat leadership responds with a massive spending bill last Thursday. Last Thursday this came forward. And let me talk to you about that bill. 2.500 pages. nearly half a trillion dollars in spending. 5.000 earmarks on hundreds of pages. and we. under the Democrat leadership. we in the House of Representativesdo you know how much time we were given to read it? Now Im not Evelyn Wood. It takes me a little more. Im not a great speed reader. We were given 2 days to read the bill since the conference report was filed. Two days. Half a trillion dollars was spent. Two thousand five hundred pages. 5.000 earmarks. and we were given 2 days. The omnibus contained appropriation bills446.8 billion for those keeping track. So half a trillion. 12 percent over the combined funding levels for the same six appropriation bills last year. How many of you got a 12 percent raise? How many of you would just like to have a job? How many of you got a 12 percent raise? These six spending bills gave your Federal agencies a 12 percent increase in spending. Now. there will be those that will say. Oh. but it was for this. it was for that. Everything is wonderful when youre giving it away. Everybody wants to be Santa Clause. Theres a big bag in the back of the sleigh parked right behind the podium here. Im convinced of it. There are more presents than there are kids right now when it comes to this Congress. the problem is we dont have the elves workshop at the North Pole. Weve got kids at home and families at home who are unemployed trying to figure out how to make ends meet. You would think that this government was running a huge surplus and would be able to help them. but no. were running a huge deficit that hurts jobs. takes away jobs. and they spend 12 percent more. Some of these bills. the TransportationHUD bill was up 21.3 percent. State and Foreign Operations up 33.2 percent. In addition to the normal appropriations. the agencies funded in this omnibus received a total of $128.2 billion in supplemental funding in the stimulus bill that we heard about earlier. So when you heard about this stimulus. the American Recovery Act and how evil it was the Republicans didnt vote for it. remember where a lot of that money went. it went back into the government. It didnt go out into middle America. It didnt go out into rural America. Some of it did. certainly. but it did not go very far outside of Washington. So here is the final tally: The omnibus spending bill I just referenced December 15. 2009 CONGRE brings new spending for nondefense. nonveterans discretionary programs to a level 85 percent higher than 2 years ago."},{"1":"1.100130e+09","2":"2008","3":"H","4":"BURGESS","5":"472","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I appreciate my friend coming to the floor tonight. In fact. lets stay on the concept of electronic health records. electronic medical records for just a moment. I have a confession to make to my friend from Georgia. I havent always been a big proponent of electronic medical records. There has been some debate from time to time in our literature as to whether the savings is actually as great as what is anticipated. Ive used the two separate prescribing platforms in my private practice back in Lewisville. Texas. with sort of marginal success. but became a believer in the availability of an electronic medical record sometime after Labor Day in 2005. And the reason I became a believer was because after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Louisiana and Mississippi gulf coasts. I had an opportunity on several occasions to travel to the city of New Orleans. In January of 2006. in fact. we had a field hearing in New Orleans. As part of that field hearing. we visited Charity Hospital. Charity Hospital one of the venerable old hospitals in this country. one of the hospitals that is responsible for training some of our medical pioneers. In fact. through good fortune. I had a chance to sit down with Dr. DeBakey late last fall. and he talked a little bit about his time of training in the city of New Orleans. Charity Hospital. again. one of the venerable old institutions. now likely lost to us forever. And down in the basement of Charity Hospital was a room that had been underwater for weeks. In fact. there was still water on the floor. This photograph doesnt really do that justice. There was still water on the floor after the city had been dewatered. I didnt know dewatered was a verb. But after the Corps of Engineers had dewatered the city and they were able to go back down to the records room of Charity Hospital. this is what they encountered. These are records that had been submerged for weeks in brackish water. water contaminated with goodness knows what. and what we see here is now smoke or soot damage on these medical records. This is. in fact. black mold that is growing on the medical records. And the reality is you could not send anyone in there to retrieve this information because it would simply be too hazardous. but also. the records themselves had been submerged for weeks at a time in seawater. brackish water. and the ink itself. many of these records were written in ballpoint pen by people over decades. And that ink washed off the pages so those that arent ruined by the black mold are rendered illegible. Doctors handwriting is hard to read anyway. but you submerge it for several weeks in brackish waters. and it truly becomes something you cannot read."},{"1":"1.100079e+09","2":"2007","3":"S","4":"CLINTON","5":"480","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. with the passage of the Higher Education Amendments of 2007. we have given the millions of students and families the key to unlock the door to a college education and the American dream. This bill represents an incredible victory for students and families. and we can be proud that in this new Congress we have renewed our commitment to students working hard to achieve the promise of America. The Higher Education Amendments of 2007 is the first reauthorization of the Higher Education Act in nearly a decade and is the result of 2 years of bipartisan compromise. This legislation will reform the student loan industry and serve the best interests of our students. I believe student loans should be an investment in the future. Sadly. for too many students. their student loans have become a barrier to following their dreams. That is why I am pleased this bill includes provisions from my Student Borrower Bill of Rights Act. My provisions will ensure all student borrowers have accurate and timely information on their loans and will provide much needed help to borrowers with disabilities. These provisions are a major step forward for students who have become disabled and are overwhelmed with student loan debt. I am proud this legislation also includes provisions from my NonTraditional Student Success Act. as the number of nontraditional students continues to increase on college campuses across America. These are students with children. students working while studying. and so many others. By including a provision to make Pell grants available year around. the Higher Education Amendments of 2007 provides the critical support these students need to complete their college education and makes college more accessible and affordable for them. I also worked with my colleagues on the Health. Education. Labor. and Pensions Committee to author two new initiatives to help more students arrive at college ready for success. The first provision will provide the training and support necessary to place 10.000 new teachers in disadvantaged communities over the next 3 years. The other provision will supply comprehensive data and offer targeted assistance to increase the collegegoing rates of high school students in disadvantaged communities. The Higher Education Amendments of 2007 will produce transparency in college cost for students. It will also promote strategies to recruit and prepare qualified teachers and will invest in financial literacy for students and parents. This legislation will simplify the Free Application for Federal Student Aid to improve the process of applying for student assistance and give families tools to plan for the cost of higher education. In addition. this bill will improve the TRIO/Upward Bound and the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness of Undergraduate Programs. strengthening the pathway to higher education for millions of lowincome and firstgeneration students. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation. I thank my Senate colleagues for making this groundbreaking investment in the next generation of American leaders."},{"1":"1.090140e+09","2":"2006","3":"S","4":"REID","5":"1043","6":"Yes","7":"Yes","8":"I intend to vote against the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. This youthful. relatively inexperienced nominee lacks the credentials to be approved for a lifetime appointment to the second most important Federal court In the country. At the outset. let me contrast this nomination with a circuit court nomination we recently approved: the nomination of Milan Smith to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Smith is a pillar of the California legal community. a distinguished practicing lawyer with 27 years of experience in complex legal transactions. His nomination was the product of extensive consultation with Democratic Senators. The Judiciary Committee approved his nomination 18 to 0. and the full Senate gave its consent unanimously. The Smith nomination is an example of the way the process is supposed to work. The Constitution gives the President and the Senate a shared role in filling vacancies on Federal courts. Working together. we can move highly qualified nonpartisan nominees through the process without rancor or delay. But when the President uses judicial appointments as a reward to the extreme rightwing of the Republican Party. he invites controversy and conflict. Regrettably. that may be just the result that the White House wants. Cesar Conda. a former domestic policy adviser to Vice President CHENEY. recently wrote in the Roll Call newspaper: For Bush. a renewed fight over conservative judges . . . just might be the cure to the Republican Partys current political doldrums. One of my Republican colleagues is quoted in the National Review earlier this month as saying: A good fight on judges does nothing but energize our base. Right now our folks are feeling a little flat. They need a reason to get engaged. and fights over judges will do that. At the same time. a lengthy debate over judges serves to distract attention from the pressing problems facing the Nation: an intractable war in Iraq. soaring gas prices. millions of Americans who lack health insurance. Instead of addressing these vital issues. this Senate has been forced to spend days and weeks and months talking about divisive judicial nominees. The nomination of Brett Kavanaugh is nothing if not divisive. All eight Democrats on the Judiciary Committee oppose his confirmation. Every leading civil rights. environmental. and labor organization in the country has urged that he be rejected. This nomination is not the product of consensus and consultationit is a poke in the eye to the Senate. It is a wedge that disrupts the wonderful bipartisanship which has characterized the immigration debate over the past 2 weeks. I recently met with Brett Kavanaugh. He seems like a bright young man. But he is a 41yearold lawyer who has spent his short legal career in service to partisan Republican causes. His two principal accomplishments as a lawyer are his work as an aide to Special Counsel Kenneth Starr during the misguided crusade to impeach President Clinton. and his current duty as a political lawyer in the Bush White House. Those positions do not disqualify Mr. Kavanaugh from future service. but they do not constitute the kind of broad experience in the law that we should expect from a nominee to the District of Columbia Circuit. The DC Circuit is a uniquely powerful court. It has jurisdiction over challenges to Federal activities affecting the environment. consumer protections. workers and civil rights. This court hears appeals from the Environmental Protection Agency. the National Labor Relations Board. the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other agencies. As a result. DC Circuit judges sit in a unique position to judge Government actions that affect our lives in fundamental ways. Mr. Kavanaughs slim. partisan record gives me no confidence he is the right person to assume this awesome responsibility. In the 113 years since the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit was established in 1893. 54 judges have sat on the court. Only three of those judges came to the court with less experience than Kavanaugh. DC Circuit judges have averaged over 26 years of legal experience at the time of their appointment to the DC Circuit. Mr. Kavanaugh. in contrast. graduated from law school a mere 16 years ago. It is not just Mr. Kavanaughs youth but his lack of practical experience that renders him unfit for this post. In his 16 years as a lawyer he has never tried a case to verdict or judgment. When questioned about this deficiency at his committee hearing. the nominee presumed to compare himself to Chief Justice John Roberts. But at the time of his appointment to the DC Circuit. Roberts had argued dozens of cases before the Supreme Court. Kavanaugh has argued just one such case. on behalf of the Starr investigation. There are other kinds of experience one might bring to an appellate court. Some nominees are respected scholars. Some are sitting judges. Kavanaugh is neither. His highranking position in the Bush White House might constitute relevant experience. but we have little idea what he has accomplished in that role. He largely refused to answer questions from the committee about the issues he has handled or the positions he has advocated. We know he helped to select many of the controversial judicial nominees who have tied the Senate in knots in recent years. We know he was the author of a farreaching government secrecy policy. despite his own role in stripping President Clinton of every vestige of privacy and privilege during the Starr investigation. Other than that. all we know is that Mr. Kavanaugh has had a fancy west wing title. Most nominees gain more stature over the course of their legal careers. but Mr. Kavanaugh is headed in the opposite direction. The American Bar Association recently took the rare step of lowering its rating of this nominee. Lawyers and judges interviewed by the nonpartisan ABA Committee described Mr. Kavanaugh as sanctimonious. immovable and very stubborn and frustrating to deal with on some issues. A judge before whom Mr. Kavanaugh appeared considered him less than adequate and said he demonstrated experience on the level of an associate. A lawyer who observed him during a different court proceeding stated: Mr. Kavanaugh did not handle the case well as an advocate and dissembled. Needless to say. these are not qualities that make for a good judge."},{"1":"1.090007e+09","2":"2005","3":"H","4":"NADLER","5":"604","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. I rise in strong opposition to this egregious legislation and in support of the Conyers/Nadler/JacksonLee substitute amendment. This substitute amendment amends this bill in several ways to ensure that consumers. workers and victims in personal injury cases are not precluded from having a fair opportunity to present their cases in court. I know the distinguished minority leader and others have mentioned some of these instances. My good friend Eliot Spitzer. the distinguished attorney general of New York State. has joined 46 State attorneys general in expressing their concern that this legislation could limit their power to investigate and bring actions in their State courts against defendants who have caused harm to their citizen. Our amendment clarifies that cases brought by States attorneys general will not be subject to the provision of this bill and would not be forced into Federal court. The substitute also includes a provision which I have advocated for many years. which actually was supported by the distinguished chairman and passed the Committee on the Judiciary a couple of times. to limit the ability of corporations settling lawsuits to demand that records that may indicate threats to public health and safety be sealed. unless it is necessary to protect trade confidentiality. The substitute provides that when such a gag order is requested. and it is normally requested by both the plaintiff and the defendant because in the settlement the defendant insists on this as a condition of the settlement. the court then rubber stamps it. This substitute provides that if such a gag order is requested. the court must make a finding as to whether the defendants interest in confidentiality outweighs the public interest in knowing of the threat to its health or safety. If the court finds that the privacy interest outweighs the public interest. the court will issue the gag order. If the court finds the public interest in health and safety outweighs the privacy interest claimed in the specific case. the court must prohibit the sealing of the information. Too often. critical information is sealed from the public and people are harmed as a result. How many people were killed or injured because the court sealed records relating to exploding Firestone tires. for one example. This provision will allow the public to learn of threats to this health and safety so as to take proper action to protect the public. while protecting legitimate confidential information. The Conyers[Nadler/JacksonLee substitute amendment also deals with a major catch22 created by the bill for victims of large and complex multistate court torts. On the one hand. the bill provides State courts cannot bear such cases: but when these cases are removed to Federal court. plaintiffs will find that the Federal courts routinely refuse to hear them. Federal courts are very reluctant to certify a multistate consumer class action suit. and six circuit courts and 26 district courts have expressly refused to consider certifying cases where several State laws apply. Our substitute protects victims from facing this catch22 and having the courtroom door completely closed to them by providing that if these cases are removed to Federal court by this bill. the Federal courts cannot refuse to certify a class action simply because more than one State law applies. I urge my colleagues not to allow this bill to completely deny victims their day in court. either in State court or in Federal court. That would render this bill completely hypocritical. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the Conyers/Nadler/JacksonLee substitute and no on the main bill."},{"1":"1.080136e+09","2":"2004","3":"S","4":"INHOFE","5":"243","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"A couple years ago. I read a series of articles in the Sacramento Bee highlighting the facade of many environmental groups.

Crises. real or not. is a commodity. and slogans and sound bites masquerade as scientific fact. That quote was written in 2001. It is still more true today in 2004. But it is not something new.

And I do not know whether it is because I became the chairman that he is leaving or not. He has had a different chairman about the last five times. and so I said I was going to stay awhile. and then suddenly I heard he was going to retire. So I hope it is not because of the conference we have had that he is leaving. because he has done a great job. He has been 15 years here in this committee. He likes apparently the challenge of breaking in a new chairman. but I am not sure that he likes the continuation of that. But he will have to speak afterwards about that. I really want to thank him because he has been a great help to me and a great help to the staff as we have worked on this bill. He was dubbed Silent Bob in one of the reports that was out. I think it was in one of what we call local political rags here around Washington. While most people might say he is silent. I can tell you when he is in the room and Silent Bob speaks. we all listen. He has done a great job for this committee. He has been a great resource to me and to the committee over these years. So I want to thank him. and I hope he can go out and work on his golf game because he tells me his game is about as bad as mine. and that is really bad. So now he will have plenty of time to learn how to play golf better and also to probably earn a lot more money. as he can come back and lobby us about a lot of issues because he is a real authority. especially on the water part of this bill. So. again. thanks to you. Bob. for being the clerk for all these years and for leading us during this period of time. Mr. Speaker. I submit for the RECORD a document detailing the specifics of this appropriation bill. Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to present to the House today the conference report on H.R. 2754. the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2004. We had a challenging conference with the Senate this year. but we were able to resolve our differences and reach a fair compromise. Most importantly. I believe we did the right thing for the Nation in this conference report in a number of important areas. from rebuilding our water infrastructure. to dealing with the disposal of spent nuclear fuel. to advancing the frontiers of our scientific knowledge. The total amount of funding included in the conference agreement is $27.3 billion. This represents an increase of $1.1 billion over the current fiscal year and approximately $380 million over the budget request. Title I of this conference report provides funding for the Civil Works program of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and for the Corps Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. The conference agreement provides the Corps with $4.6 billion. slightly below the current year but nearly $400 million over the inadequate budget request. The Administration does not seem to comprehend that underfunding the Corps of Engineers ultimately costs the country more in the long run. as projects that are strung out over multiple years always cost more than they would if constructed on an efficient schedule. I have already initiated a dialog with the Administration in an attempt to convince them of the need to increase funding to support the Civil Works program of the Corps of Engineers in future fiscal years. In fiscal year 2004. we opted to focus our available resources on completing ongoing projects. and therefore limited the number of new starts in this conference agreement. Funding for Title II of the bill. which includes the Central Utah Project Completion Account and the programs of the Bureau of Reclamation. is $986.5 million. $14 million above the amount appropriated last year and $64 million above the budget request. The Committee did not provide the $15 million requested by the Administration for the CALFED BayDelta program. The authorization for this program expired in fiscal year 2000 and it has not been reauthorized. Total funding for Title III. the Department of Energy is $22 billion. $1.2 billion above fiscal year 2003 and $120 million below the budget request. In many ways. I am most proud of our accomplishments in this part of the conference agreement. My top priority in the Energy and Water bill this year was to provide sufficient funding for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. and I believe we succeeded. This conference agreement provides a total of $580 million for Yucca Mountain. only $11 million below the request but an increase of $123 million compared to the current fiscal year. This project has been significantly underfunded in prior years. and we are finally starting to reverse that trend. Mr. Speaker. it is essential that we keep the Department of Energy on schedule to submit the repository license application late next year and to begin repository operations in 2010. The Yucca Mountain repository is essential for both energy security and homeland security. We have provided the necessary funding in this conference agreement. and I have the commitment of the Secretary of Energy to move forward aggressively on the repository program during this coming fiscal year. Another priority of mine. and of many other Members in this chamber. is the subject of advanced scientific computing. By a number of key measures of computing power. the United States is now in second place behind Japan. For the sake of our scientific leadership. of our national security. and for economic competitiveness. we cannot afford to stay in second place for very long. We have provided an additional $30 million for the Department of Energy to procure additional stateoftheart computers in the near term and to begin an interagency effort to develop nextgeneration computer architectures. Another area where there is significant Member interest in this conference agreement is the portion of DOEs budget that deals with several new nuclear weapons initiatives proposed by the Administration. I strongly believe that we need to take a hard look at our existing Cold War nuclear arsenal before we start down the path of designing new weapons and new weapons infrastructure. As President Bush said when he announced reductions to the nuclear stockpile on November 13. 2001. The United States and Russia have overcome the legacy of the Cold War. At that time. he pledged that the United States would reduce our stockpile to 1.700 to 2.200 operationally deployed warheads over the next ten years. Unfortunately. we are still waiting for the Department to Defense. and the Department of energy. to deliver a revised nuclear stockpile plan that reflects the Presidents commitment of two years ago. It is time for DOD and DOE to take a hard look at our nuclear weapon stockpile and on the infrastructure we are maintaining to support that stockpile. Mr. Speaker. the funding provided in this conference agreement maintains our strong support for DOEs nonproliferation programs in Russia and other countries. This agreement also makes a key change in DOEs contracting culture. as we require the competition of five laboratory contracts that we awarded without competition back in the 1940s and have never been competed since. Most Members are shocked to learn we have contracts that have never been competed in the past half century. We are fixing that situation. Funding for Title IV. Independent Agencies. is $229.3 million. an increase of $22.6 million from last year and $81.4 million above the budget request. We have funded the Appalachian Regional Commission at $66 million. $33 million above the request. in recognition of the strong interest in this chamber and in the Senate in the work of the ARC. I want to thank my Senate counterpart. Chairman PETE DOMENICI. and his Ranking Minority Member. Senator HARRY REID. for their hard work during this conference. They may view me as a relatively junior Member by Senate standards. but rest assured. Mr. Speaker. that I fought long and hard to defend the House priorities during this conference. My Ranking Member. the Honorable PETE VISCLOSKY. was at my side during this process. and I truly value his support and advice. Mr. Speaker. before I conclude I would also like to thank the staff for their help in getting me up to speed on the complex issues we have in this bill. The Subcommittee staff includes Bob Schmidt. Kevin Cook. Dennis Kern. Scott Burnison. Tracy LaTurner. and our detailee from the Corps of Engineers. Robert Pace. I also want to thank Kenny Draft of my staff. and Dixon Butler and Peder Maarbjerg of the minority staff. I urge the unanimous support of the house for adoption of this conference report. I would hope we could quickly conclude action on this conference report so that we can get this bill to the White House for signature. I want to make special mention here today for Silent Bob Schmidt. the subcommittee clerk on my bill this year. Bob is leaving the Hill at the end of this week. and is going on to greener pastures. I hate to say it. but his departure may be partly my fault. He has the remarkable record of having clerked for five different Chairmen. I believe. in the past five Congresses. He apparently likes the challenge of breaking in new Chairmen. and I told him I intend to be around for a while. so that may be why hes going. I hope not. I would like to congratulate Bob on his many years of service on the Appropriations Committee. and for his former service for the Corps of Engineers. Bobs knowledge of the agency programs in our bill. and of the rules of the Committee and the house. have been invaluable during my first year as Chairman on this subcommittee. I will miss his experience and his company. and I know that the staff will. too. I like to refer to Bob as silent Bob because hes not a real talkative guy. so I am not sure that well notice when he is out of the office. even when he is gone for good. He usually managed to speak up. though. when anybody was about to make a mistake. which is one hallmark of a very good Appropriations Clerk and I know we will all miss him when its time to get the work done. On behalf of those of us who have worked closely with him. I want to wish him every success in his golf game and whatever else he takes on in the future.

I rise to urge support of the free trade agreement between the United States and Jordan. As ranking Republican member of the Trade Subcommittee of the Finance Committee. I am pleased that the Jordanian Free Trade Agreement was approved by the full committee and now is receiving floor consideration. While some would say that this agreement amounts to nothing more than a garden variety trade agreement. they would be wrong. From a strict U.S. economic perspective. it is not a major agreement. However. as King Abdullah has made clear. from the standpoint of the Jordanians. it is an important precedent for his country and for other nations in the region. This was true before the tragic events of September. and may be more true today as our country wages a campaign to reach out to moderate Arab states. Bilateral free trade agreements between the U.S. and other countries help establish a mutual understanding of the norms and expectations of trade. I think when foreign business interests enter into trading partnerships with American firms under a free trade agreement. both parties can benefit economically. and the U.S. and our trading partner will almost inevitably grow closer together due to this type of joint enterprise. I must commend Chairman Baucus and Ranking Republican Member Grassley for their work on this agreement. Anyone who has followed the debate on this agreement knows that progress was slowed by a vigorous discussion of how the ambiguous language pertaining to labor and the environment in the Jordanian agreement might. or might not. serve as a precedent in any trade promotion authority legislation adopted by Congress. It is clear that the biggest stumbling block to passage of TPA legislation is how labor and the environment are handled. As a proponent of free trade. I have serious reservations about any move that would make labor and environmental concerns central concerns of trade negotiations. While I know that there may be some in the Senate who would like. for proper but misguided motivations. to attempt to raise the standard of living in the developing world through the implementation of nontrade aspects in trade legislation. But we must not confuse trade negotiations with social engineering. Our chief goal in trade negotiations must focus on benefitting American consumers and American workers. We must remember that what is good for the goose is good for the gander. If we try to impose our views on labor and environment on our trading partners. we should not be surprised if one day these trading partners complain that our food safety laws are insufficient. our air pollution levels too high. and our minimum wage too low. Even prior to the terrorist attacks two weeks ago. the economy was losing steam. It seems to me and I am sure to many other members of the Senate. that one good way to help revive and stimulate our economy is to pass trade promotion authority legislation. Fast track can help put our country back on the right path to economic recovery and growth. While it is my hope that we can work on a bipartisan basis to pass TPA legislation before we adjourn for the year. the Jordanian agreement is not the vehicle to resolve all these issues. Today. we can accomplish a significant achievement by adopting the Jordanian agreement. On balance. this is a good agreement with a good partner. Jordan. It is not a model for how labor and environmental concerns should be addressed in trade promotion authority legislation. It is a statement to those in the MidEast and around the world that the United States is a good partner. King Abdullah and other world leaders need to know that partnering with the United States can result in tangible benefits to their citizens. I urge my colleagues to vote for this measure."},{"1":"1.060182e+09","2":"2000","3":"H","4":"BENTSEN","5":"606","6":"Yes","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of H.R. 1775. the Estuary Restoration Act of 2000. As an original cosponsor. I believe this bill will be tremendously instrumental for the restoration of our nations major estuaries. including Galveston Bay which borders my district in Texas Estuaries act as nurseries for much of our marine life. These complex and productive areas urgently need recognition if estuaries are to continue supporting over 70 million jobs and countless millions of hours of recreation. Due to lack of recognition of their value. millions of acres of estuaries have been lost over the decades. losses which persist today. In my district. Galveston Bay is part of the national estuary program and has suffered troubling habitat loss. It would benefit tremendously under this bill. Galveston Bays watershed encompasses one of the most heavily industrialized and most heavily populated regions in the United States. Since the 1950s. 30.000 acres of wetlands have been lost in the estuary. Wastewater discharges from communities and industries into Galveston Bay account for half of Texas total wastewater discharges every year. Like many of Americas beloved bays and estuaries under these circumstances. the productivity of Galveston Bay has declined. In addition to the ecological loss. declining productivity is an alarming economic trend. because Galveston Bay produces twothirds of Texas oyster harvest. onethird of Texas bay shrimp catch. and onequarter of Texas blue crab catch. Declining productivity also means reduced recreation for a Bay that currently supports the third largest recreational boating fleet in the United States. In response. the local community has reacted. but recognition and support have been limited. This acts defining principle is grassroots action. The bill authorizes $315 million over 5 years for matching grant funds to be used by nonprofit groups. State and local governments. neighborhood associations. schools. and concerned citizen organizations like the Galveston Bay Foundation. The goal of this $315 million is the restoration of 1 million acres of estuary over the next 10 years. so that our estuaries can continue producing food. flood mitigation. water quality employment. and recreational benefits along American coastlines. This bill provides a $315 million investment to ensure the sustainability of activities that contribute well over $100 billion to the U.S. economy. The matching grants will rehabilitate our Nations estuaries by allowing local volunteer restoration activities to continue. strengthen. and takeoff. Priority will be given to projects which build partnerships between public and private groups. relationships which can continue long after the period of this act. We in the Federal Government should make the prudent decision to invest in Americas quality of life. environment. and economy by passing H.R. 1775. As proof of the ability of local communities to take on estuary restoration. the Galveston Bay Foundation is exemplary of the type of organization that the Estuary Restoration Act will facilitate. The Galveston Bay Foundation began by restoring small areas measured in square feet. and now is pursuing the ambitious goal of restoring 24.000 of the 30.000 estuary acres lost in Galveston Bay. Assisted by the National Estuary Program. the Galveston Bay Foundation also monitors water quality by recruiting and training volunteers and by obtaining and distnbuting monitoring equipment. With the passage of the Estuary Restoration Act of 2000. organizations across the country including the Galveston Bay Foundation can leverage the investment efficiently and effectively on the local level. I believe that H.R. 1775 is essential to implement longterm. local estuary conservation and management plans. Estuaries are integral parts of any nearby community and effect absolutely every community. I urge my colleagues to pass the Estuary Restoration Act and invest in the ecological and economic future of Americas coastal areas by providing assistance to those who use it bestlocal communities."},{"1":"1.060013e+09","2":"1999","3":"S","4":"SPECTER","5":"1424","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. I found on my desk this morning a Dear Colleague letter entitled. Oppose the SpecterHarkin Amendment That Seizes $123 Billion in State Funds. Instead of outlining the provisions of the SpecterHarkin amendment. I would just refer my colleagues to this Dear Colleague letter signed by the opponents. and tell them that the amendment is exactly contrary to what is in this Dear Colleague letter. so that by reading the letter. they can just conclude the opposite. and they will have a statement of what the pending amendment is. Before dealing in detail with the Dear Colleague letter. or this misstatement. permit me to outline in very general terms that the pending amendment has been offered by the chairmen and ranking members of the two Senate committees which are charged with authorization of appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services. Senator JEFFORDS. the chairman of the authorizing committee. and Senator KENNEDY. the ranking member. are cosponsors of the amendment which has been offered by Senator HARKIN. the ranking member on the appropriations subcommittee which has the responsibility for appropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services. and the subcommittee which I have the honor to Chair. We must surveythe four of us in our positions as chairmen and ranking membersthe health needs of America in a very. very constrained budget. We have seen the budget resolution. which has come out of Budget Committee. and the limitations on discretionary funding. Our subcommittee has the responsibility for funding not only the Department of Health and Human Services. but also the Department of Education and the Department of Labor. where so many vital programs for worker safety are involved. So our responsibility is a very heavy one. As we have observed. the settlement with the States is in excess of some $200 billion over a 25year period. The thought immediately came to mind that these funds. which have been obtained from settlements on tobacco issues. could be used and should be used in very large part. frankly. if not entirely. for health purposes. In the Appropriations Committee meeting. an amendment was offered by the distinguished Senator from Texas. Senator HUTCHISON. to have the Federal Government relinquish all claims to these funds. and have these funds paid entirely to the State governments. I can understand the popularity of this kind of an amendment. It is backed by all 50 Governors. it would be shocking if it werent. It is backed by all 50 State legislatures: it would be shocking if it werent. It is backed by all State attorneys general: again. it would be shocking if it were not. I support the proposition that there ought to be minimal strings. minimal requirements mandated by the Federal Government. especially in the context where we mandate requirements and do not fund them. Last week. we passed the EdFlex bill to give flexibility to the States. But I submit to you that it is fundamentally different to say that where there are Federal appropriations for a specific purpose. there ought to be latitude for State governments and local governments to figure out how to spend those funds. contrasted with saying that all of $200 billionplus ought to go to the States to spend as they choose. when some States have already made an announcement that they intend to use these funds. at least in part. for highway construction or for debt retirement. When a settlement is reached on matters of this sort by State governments and officials representing the States. those funds realistically are impressed with the trust. where the claims are brought because of damages due to public health. due to tobacco. There is a specific purpose that the lawsuits were started. and that was to redress public claims on these important areas. Even without a Federal direction limiting. in some way. or articulating a portion of these funds to go for medical purposes. it is my legal judgment that those funds are impressed with the trust. I would not be surprised to see that. if the State governments undertake spending on items far afield. they may face a class action or taxpayer suits or people who have been injured by tobacco seeking to impress that trust. We had a hearing in the appropriations subcommittee this Monday. Our subcommittee took up the issue on an emergency basis to try to see if we could find some area for resolution. We heard testimony from the Governor of Kentucky and the attorneys general of Pennsylvania. Texas. and Iowa. Those four witnesses all emphasized the desirability of having some resolution of this issue so that they could make plans for their budgets. I agree with that proposition. A very forceful letter was filed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Donna Shalala. strenuously objecting to having the money paid over to the States. because the Federal law gives her the authority to make an allocation as to how much of those funds should be deducted from the Federal obligation to the States on Medicaid. The States have the obligation under Federal law to sue to collect on claims that Medicaid has. And the States have the authorityand exercise the authorityto release the tobacco companies from liability to the Federal Government. That is provided for under existing Federal law. So for those who say that the Federal Government can bring lawsuits. it simply is not so. because those claims have all been released. It may be. Mr. President. that we are in an area where largely. if not entirely. the States will recognize the duty to use these settlement proceeds for tobaccorelated purposes. The distinguished attorney general of Pennsylvania. Mike Fisher. who testified on Monday. outlined a program for the use by Pennsylvania of $11.3 billion. I believe that. in conjunction with our distinguished Governor Tom Ridge. there will be a program to use these funds for tobaccorelated purposes. But it is not sufficient to say that States may recognize this obligation. because States may not recognize the obligation. as we have already seen from preliminary indications of spending these funds on unrelated purposesdebt reduction and highway construction. In a Dear Colleague letter that has been circulated today. which I referred to earlier. the statement is made: The SpecterHarkin amendment will require every Governoreach yearfor the next 25 years to submit a plan to Washington asking for permission on how to spend fifty percent of the States own money. That is flatly wrong. It is true that there is a 20percent requirement for smoking cessation education to try to dissuade youngsters from smoking and a 30percent requirement on medical plans. But there is no need for Governors to submit a plan to Washington asking for permission on how to spend that money. that 50 percent. That is a matter where the Governors only have to tell the Department of Health and Human Services how the money was spent after in fact it is spent. They dont have to submit a plan. and they dont have to ask for prior authorization. The Dear Colleague letter further says: This is a classic Washington Knows Best policy. an unprecedented Federal power grab. In a sense. it is complimentary to call it an unprecedented Federal power grab. Considering all the Federal power grabs that have been recorded historically. this is really a gentle nudge to the States. saying that here we have funds realized from a tobacco settlement with a statement of policy that 50 percent ought to be used for a specific purpose. On the 50 percent. it is actually on the low side. The facts show that some 50 percent of the funds involved here come from Medicaid. so that the percentage could have been substantially higher. So. Mr. President. it is my hope that we will have a statement of congressional policy on this vote today which will. in a very gentle way. without regulations. without the requirement of submitting the plan to Washington. simply say to the Governors that at least 50 percent ought to be used for tobaccorelated purposes. such as education to discourage children from smoking. where we see a very high rate of juvenile smoking and overwhelming statistics of deaths resulting from juvenile smokingwhere we have a reasonable amount allocated for that educational purpose. and a reasonable amountsome 30 percentallocated not only for public health measures but also for aiding smoking cessation. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that a letter supporting my amendment from the American Lung Association dated March 17. 1999. and a letter of support from the Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids dated March 18. 1999. be printed in the RECORD."},{"1":"1.050201e+09","2":"1998","3":"S","4":"ASHCROFT","5":"949","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 represents a vitally important piece of legislation to raise awareness of and combat religious persecution overseas. Some would downplay the problem of religious persecution abroad. but preserving religious freedom at home and promoting it in other countries is central to the purpose and objectives of the United States. In our own history as a nation and in the histories of countries around the world. religious freedom has been at the center of movements for broader civil liberty. Efforts to restrict religious freedom strike at the heart of liberty itself. Thus. the United States has a duty to stand for religious liberty abroad as we continue to preserve it at home. If the Administration had been more aggressive in confronting religious persecution. such legislation might not be necessary. In fact. at a White House meeting to discuss one of the major bills on religious persecution. President Clinton told religious leaders that legislation which actually required him to confront persecution abroad would put enormous pressure on whoever is in the executive branch to fudge an evaluation of the facts of what is going on. That is a troubling statement by the President of the United States. which not only calls us to question this Administrations commitment to fight religious persecution. but the reliability of other presidential certifications on issues such as Chinese missile and nuclear proliferation. Such statements by Administration officials make it clear why legislation to address religious persecution is needed. Religious persecution is a tragic fact of life in many countries. from Latin America to Asia to Africa. Religious persecution in Sudan and China has been of particular concern to me. As Chairman of the Africa Subcommittee. I held a hearing on religious persecution in Sudan in September of last year. Religious persecution has become enmeshed in a brutal Sudanese civil war that has taken more than 1.5 million civilians since 1983. with over 4 million more being displaced by the fighting. An estimated 430.000 refugees have fled Sudan to seek safety in neighboring countries. Human rights organizations working in Sudan have testified before Congress that the government uses aerial bombardment and burning of villages. arbitrary arrests. torture. chattel slaveryespecially child slaveryhostage taking. summary execution. inciting deadly tribal conflict. the abduction and brainwashing of children. the arrest of Christian pastors and lay church workers. and the imprisonment of moderate Muslim religious leaders to suppress dissent and form a radical Islamic state. Such barbarous atrocities. along with Sudans support for international terrorism. has led me to introduce legislation to cut off financial transactions with the Sudanese government. The viciousness of religious persecution in Sudan should not callous us to the very real and brutal oppression taking place in other countries. As Nina Shea notes in The Lions Den. China has more Christians in prison because of religious activities than any other nation. The State Departments first comprehensive review of persecution against Christians. issued in July 1997 and entitled U.S. Policy in Support of Religious Freedom. says. The Government of China has sought to restrict all actual religious practice to governmentsubsidized religious organizations and registered places of worship. Chinas efforts to restrict religious freedom are driven by oppressive policies which seek to make all religion subservient to the states secular objectives. In the book China: State Control of Religion. Human Rights Watch states that the Chinese government believes that religion breeds disloyalty. separatism. and subversion. The book goes on to note: Chinese authorities are keenly aware of the role that the church played in Eastern Europe during the disintegration of the Soviet empire. Rather than embrace and encourage the free expression of faith. the Chinese government is engaged in a massive. ongoing. and brutal effort to repress nonsanctioned religious activity. Ministers or lay people who seek to practice their faith free from bureaucratic interference and oppression are subjected to imprisonment. torture. and worse. The Far Eastern Economic Review noted that 15.000 religious sites were destroyed by government police in the first five months of 1996 alone. Paul Marshall and Nina Shea note that Chinas underground Christians are the target of what they themselves describe as the most brutal repression since the early 1980s when China was just emerging from the terror of the Cultural Revolution. And yet. in spite of such repression by the Chinese Communist government. this Administration declined even to sponsor a resolution at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights condemning Chinas human rights record. Apparently. some type of back door deal was made with the Chinese government in which a few prisoners would be released and we would turn our head and close our ears to the thousands that remain in Chinese prisons and labor camps. I am aware of mounting concern in the U.S. business community on the damage done to U.S. competitiveness due to unilateral sanctions. I want U.S. companies to compete and succeed in the international marketplace. The Nickles legislation. however. is a carefully crafted bill which offers the President an array of options to promote religious liberty abroad and will target any resulting sanctions on those countries most deserving of reproach for religious persecution. This legislation is a necessary first step to address the problem of religious persecution. Mr. President. I submit that it is time for the Senate of the United States to take a stand on this issue of religious persecution. and passage of the Nickles legislation offers just such an opportunity. It is also time for the Executive Branch to take a stand on this issue. Rather than look at how we might fudge legislative requirements to avoid confronting oppression abroad. let us have the courage of our convictions. Mr. President. I yield the floor."},{"1":"1.050071e+09","2":"1997","3":"H","4":"PORTER","5":"471","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman. I want the gentleman from Indiana to understand what we have done in the bill with respect to the salary and expense accounts. That is. generally. we have provided about a 2percent increase in S&E accounts. and this account is 2.8 percent. both figures are below the rate of increase in the spending in the bill overall. The President has announced that salary increases will be 3.8 percent for 1998. That increase means thatin all of the salary and expense accounts in the bill there will be a need to either cut expenses or have fewer employees. probably mostly through attrition. to meet those requirements. In other words. the level of increase that we have given in this account is below the rate of increase in salaries in the Federal Government generally. and that will mean fewer workers will remain in the Federal work force. That. would apply in this account as well. Now. Mr. Chairman. what the gentleman from Indiana is offering is an amendment that would raise the spending for the special ed. account by $4 million on a base of $4.3 billion. or about onetenth of 1 percent. Let me suggest to the gentleman that last year we raised spending in this account by $790 million and this year we raised it in the bill by an additional $312 million. and last night we raised it by an additional $25 million as a result of the Goodling amendment. So. we now have raised spending in this account. just in the last 2 fiscal years. to this point at least by over $1 billion. The gentlemans amendment would be an increase from the present level of spending by an insignificantly small amount. $4 million. Now. every amount is important. I certainly agree with that. But given the overall funding. it is not as if we are not paying attention to our responsibilities to increase spending for IDEA. We very much are. We put it at a very. very high priority. And while it makes for a good amendment. I suppose. in terms of appeal to cut Wage and Hour Enforcement and put the money in special ed.. I think Members should know that we have done a yeomans job of putting resources into special ed. and taking the burden off of local school districts tax revenues in a major way and that this amendment is going to make virtually no difference in that effort. It will make substantial cuts in the wage and hour enforcement. Mr. Chairman. I think the Members ought to be able to see in perspective that this does very little for the matter where the gentleman moves the money. but would cut even below what we have provided. which is already in the nature of a cut. in the Wage and Hour Enforcement Division. ri 1015"},{"1":"1.040262e+09","2":"1996","3":"S","4":"NICKLES","5":"939","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President.

A lot of people are very skeptical of politicians. in particular when they make statements as it pertains to taxes and you look back in history a little bit. George Bush said. Read my lips. There will be no new taxes. And he passed a tax increase. and I believe it cost him his reelection. Bill Clinton. when he was campaigning in 1992. campaigned on a tax cut. told people throughout the country there would be a tax cut. talked about a S500 tax credit per child. or at least a tax credit for families. but it did not happen. As a matter of fact. in 1993. there was not only not a tax cut but the largest tax increase in history. So a lot of people are very cynical when politicians talk about taxes. maybe because for the last few years they have not seen people follow through with what they stated they were going to do. That quite possibly is understandable. Candidate Bill Clinton in his book said there would not be an increase in the gasoline tax. but he actually did. He passed a gasoline tax increase. as we all know. He did not tell people there was going to be an increase on Social Security recipients. but there was. So my point is. yes. there may be some people who are cynical. but that does not mean that just because Bill Clinton did not do what he said he was going to do Bob Dole will not. I have had the pleasure of serving with Bob Dole. and he is a man of his word. and he is very sincere. He is very sincere about cutting taxes and reducing the growth of spending. I will just mention that he doesnt even cut spending. He slows the growth of spending under his proposal. The facts are we are spending $1.55 trillion right now. and under Senator Doles proposal we are going to end up spending about $1.8 trillion in .the year 2001. But he does commit to -balancing the budget. That is doable. We have done it. President Clinton. unfortunately. vetoed it. Can you cut taxes and reduce the growth of spending and still end up with a balanced budget in a few years? Yes. you can. We have proved that you can. I want to allude to one other thing that was mentioned. It is said. well. Sinator Doles tax cut is paid for by voodoo economics. or it is going to provide tax cuts to pay for itself. That is not the case. He took a very conservative assumption that the tax cuts proposed in his proposal would stimulate growth and that would pay for about 27 percentnot even half. 27 percent. So I just make mention of the fact that some people assume this really does stimulate the economy and therefore pay for itself. Some people make that assumption. Senator Dole did not. He said it will stimulate the economy. the economy will grow a lot faster. It has grown a lot faster. The growth of the economy for the last 3 years has really been pretty anemic--about 2.2 percent compared to the last 10 or 12 years when it has been about 3.3 percent. about 50 percent higher. We can do better. We should do better. I hope we will do better. I also heard a statement. well. very little is in Senator Doles package that would stimulate the economy. I disagree. Allowing people to keep more of their own money. when you are talking about the child credit--Senator Doles package has provision for a $500 tax credit per child. That is very family friendly. That says families. if you have four kids and you are making $60.000. maybe two people working. you are going to have $2.000 more of your own money to spend at the local restaurants or at schools or for your family. That is going to help those businesses. Those businesses are going to make more money. They are going to generate more jobs. It is going to help the economy and. I believe. actually spend it better than how the Government would spend it. He also cuts the capital gains rate in half. Some people disagree with that. I believe we have at least a strong majority vote in the Congress to do it. because if you reduce the tax on financial transactions. you are going to have more. Some countries do not even tax financial transactions. I think there are several things in Senator Doles proposal that will stimulate the economy. that will balance the budget. He is also calling for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. So he is sincere about doing it. I think he will do it. In spite of the fact that maybe one or two of his predecessors did not do what they said they were going to do. did not follow through. did not tell the truth to the American people. I believe Senator Dole is telling the truth. He is a man of his word. We will cut taxes. We will balance the budget. We will pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I think that is significant. it is positive. and it will help the American economy and help American families as well. I yield the floor."},{"1":"1.040146e+09","2":"1995","3":"S","4":"LAUTENBERG","5":"2003","6":"Yes","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. I rise in support of the conference report on H.R. 2002. the transportation appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996. First. I thank my colleague from the State of Washington for his able work on the subcommittee and for managing the bill this morning. We worked together on many issues and it is a pleasure to be able to stand here with him this morning. I support this bill. but with considerable reluctance. When it comes to addressing the transportation needs of this country. this bill falls short. Yet. in many areas. fortunately. this bill does not accept some of the more draconian and counterproductive measures called for in the budget resolution or in the House bill. For that I am grateful. This conference agreement cuts $800 million in outlays from the fiscal year 1995 funding levels for the Department of Transportation. And. while it is over a half a billion dollars higher than thj severe reductions called for under the Senatepassed budget resolution. it still signals a sizable disinvestment in our Federal transportation infrastructure. This is not the direction our country ought to be heading. Consider the fact that. between 1972 and 1990. the United States public investment in infrastructure as a percentage of GDP ranked dead last of the six other 07 nations. Among those nations that have the largest economies and the most power. we are last when it comes to investment in infrastructure. During the same period. the 1972 to 1990 period. the average productivity growth in the United States also ranked dead last. In recent years. Japans investment in infrastructure as a percentage of its GDP was roughly three times that of the United States. To catch up even for 1 year. we would need to increase spending on infrastructure by more than a quarter of a trillion dollars. This widening investment gap is bad news for Americas ability to compete in the 21st century. and it undermines our ability to provide essential jobs that will raise living standards. Recognizing that reality. over 400 of our Nations leading economists have urged our Government to increase public investment. With the extraordinary congestion that we face on our Nations highways and runways across our country. we must do no less. even within the current budget environment. My remarks are in no way intended to reflect on the distinguished chairman of this subcommittee. Senator HATFIELD. Those of us on the Transportation Subcommittee were extraordinarily fortunate earlier this year when our full committee chairman. Senator HATFIELD. accepted the chairmanship of this subcommittee. I was delighted to hear that he made that decision. Throughout the year. he has skillfully guided the subcommittee through extensive hearings as well as an amicable markup and conference. Senator HATFIELD demonstrated his characteristic fairmindedness. openness and good judgment throughout the process. and I am grateful for the considerations he gave to my concerns throughout the year. Separate from the funding levels contained in the bill. I am pleased to report that Senator HATFIELD and I were successful in retaining in the conference agreement several of the important policy positions articulated in the Senate bill. As it relates to the Coast Guard. for instance. the conference agreement retains the provision allowing the commandant to realign his existing search and rescue stations. as well as reallocate billets throughout the Co..st Guard to achieve his rebalancing goals. Under the provision. however. dozens of local communities will be spared the upheaval and the worry of losing their Coast Guard search and rescue presence entirely. and that includes several communities in New Jersey. in Oregon. and in several other States. The bill before us also includes the provisions for FAA personnel and procurement reform that was included in the Senate bill. Under this provision. absent the enactment of other legislation. the FAA Administrator will be authorized to reform his agencys personnel and procurement processes by Both the Commerce Committee and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee are currently working on a comprehensive reform legislation for the FAA. In fact. I recently testified before the Commerce Committee on this legislation. It is my sincere hope that this legislation will be enacted and supersede the provisions in the appropriations bill. The issue of personnel and procurement reform is a very complex one that requires the input of all affected parties. -including the air carriers. general aviation. the unions representing the FAAs employees. and others. I expect the language in the appropriations bill will continue to serve as a strong incentiveif I may characterize it as the pebble in the shoeto bring all parties to the table to agree on necessary reforms. because I frankly think. as many do. that they are overdue. I should mention that. during conference committee deliberations on FAA personnel reform. both Congressman COLEMAN and myself sought to ensure that bill language would be included in the conference report ensuring that no new personnel scheme would be put into place that would bar the rights of FAA employees to be a member of the union. While we were only successful in including the relevant language in the statement of managers. I have obtained an assurance from Secretary Pefia that absolutely no measures will be included in the FAAs personnel reform plan that will undermine the ability of FAA employees to be members of a union. just like other people who work for the companies in the country. Perhaps the most critical decision reached by the conferees as it relates to aviation is the final funding level for the FAAs operations account. The final funding level will be $4.646 billionalmost $50 million more than the Housepassed level and almost $100 million more than the level passed by the Senate. Mr. President. we have a wonderfully safe aviation system in this country. While we have all been disturbed by aviation accidents in recent months. a dispassionate review of the relevant statistics reveals that this past year was not one of the worst years for aviation safety. The fact is that usage of the air traffic control system continually grows but without the kinds of investment I believe is necessary to bring it up to the current and future needs. The funding level for this account was. perhaps. the greatest deficiency in the Senatepassed bill. As the transportation appropriations bill moved to conference. the administration made clear the priority it attached to adequate funding for FAA operations. It was a program that gave all the conferees. frankly. a great deal of worry. I am very pleased that the conferees found a way to fund this account at a level more closely resembling the Presidents request. Importantly. as part of this effort. we were able to eliminate the provision in the Senate bill imposing a 5percent pay cut on air traffic controllers. Frankly. these people are under great stress. and great strain. The last thing that we need to do is worry them further by threatening their ability to attend to their personal and family needs. I am very pleased. especially during this period of heightened anxiety over the adequacy of our air traffic control system. that we are not imposing a pay cut on our already overworked air traffic controllers. There are several conference decisions with which I strongly disagree. I find it outrageous. quite frankly. that the Senate conferees receded to the House provision prohibiting the DOT from increasing the corporate average fuel economy standard in 1996. Simply put so everybody understands it. this provision will prohibit the DOT from requiring the manufacturers of light trucksa very popular vehicle in Americafrom trying to do even slightly better in terms of fuel efficiency. Everyone sees the quantity of imported oil we bring into this country increasing. I think it is an outrageous condition for Americato be hostage to foreign suppliers. It is not the way we ought to be going. if we can avoid it. One way we can avoid it is by conserving more here. This provision is being forced through the process on an appropriations bill because it could not be adopted through freestanding legislation. While I was very disappointed in the outcome. I want to commend Senator GORTON for his leadership in sticking up for the Senate position on this item. Other areas of deep disappointment for me are the deep cuts included in the bill for transit formula assistance and pipeline safety activities. Transit operating assistance is being slashed by 44 percent. To make matters worse. the conference agreement changes the formula in a way that poses an additional hardship on our major urban areas. Members need to be aware that a cut of this magnitude will necessitate service reductions and fare increases across the country. Every Senator will have constituents that will pay more money for less transit service. We are talking about longer waits for the bus to get home from work and more cars on our already congested highways. The Senate budget resolution called for transit operating subsidies to be phased out entirely. I hope that after the experience of a 44percent cut this year. my colleagues will join with me in saying that enough is enough. I hope that next year we can hold the line and stem the hemorrhage in this program. Last years tragic pipeline explosion in Edison. NJ. served as a wakeup call for the entire Nation as to the need to beef up our efforts to ensure pipeline safety. Our Nations pipeline infrastructure is aging rapidly. President Clintons budget recognized this reality and requested a 13percent increase for pipeline safety. The conferees. however. turned around and cut these activities 16 percent below last years levela cut of 26 percent below the Presidents request. I only hope that it will not require another pipeline explosion with either massive pollution or loss of life to get my colleagues to recognize our extraordinary needs in this area. So once again. Mr. President. I want to thank Chairman HATFIELD for his consideration throughout the development of this conference agreement. My unhappiness with the bill does not reflect at all on his leadership. What it does say is that this country is not investing enough in its transportation infrastructure. By some accounts. the U.S. ranks 50th or worse in comparison to other industrialized nations. in terms of per capita investment in infrastructure. It is outrageous. Everybody knows that efficient transportation helps us move goods. helps us move people. helps us become more efficient. more competitive. and provide for a quality of life far better than that which is saddled with air pollution. delays caused by congestion. time away from family. and time away from business appointments. Mr. President. one of the things that we talked about and all of us feel so deeply here about is the diminution of the quality of life in our country. about how difficult it is for families to make a living where both mother and dad go out to work because it requires two workers to earn what one used to earn. Do you know who pays the heaviest price for that? It is the children. It is those who miss parental contact during the evening hours and the daytime hours. If this transportation system of ours continues to break down. continues to lack the ability to service our needs. it will impose an even heavier burden on the family. It is pretty simple. So. Mr. President. I am going to support this bill. It is the best that we could get done in the current budgetary environment. The administration has signaled definitively that President Clinton will sign this conference report. There are only 2 other appropriations bills that have been signed out of the 13 thus far. That is military construction and agriculture. We will look forward to having this bill signed. We also ask our colleagues who are in committees of jurisdictionthe Commerce Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee on which I sit. to expedite their action on the transportation authorization bills. Those bills. like this bill. will be critical to the functioning of our country. Mr. President. with that I yield the floor."},{"1":"1.030152e+09","2":"1994","3":"H","4":"HORN","5":"302","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I join my colleagues in commemorating the tragedy of the Armenian genocide which began its ugliest phase in April 1915. I add my voice to the chorus of vigilance that remembers the sad fate of over 1.5 million Armenians killed by the Ottoman empire and the millions more driven from their homeland. On April 24. 1915. the Ottoman empire systematized a campaign of racial hatred which had already killed over 300.000 Armenians since 1894. On that date. authorities in Istanbul ordered the arrest of hundreds of Armenian religious. political. and intellectual leaders. These leaders were then exiled or murdered. Within months. thousands of Armenians in Asia Minor and Turkish Armenia had been deported and the 250.000 Armenians serving In the Ottoman army had been disarmed and placed in forced labor battalions where most starved or were executed. Women. children. and the elderly were put on death marches where they were subjected to rape. torture. and mutilation. By 1923. the destruction of the Armenian culture within the confines of presentday Turkey was all but complete. 500.000 Armenians had escaped into Russia or emigrated to Europe or the United States. At the beginning of the First World War there were more than 2.5 million Armenians living In the Ottoman empire. today fewer than 80.000 declared Armenians remain in Turkey. Sadly. the Armenian genocide was only the first example of this savagery in the 20th century. Adolf Hitler excused his own genocidal campaign against the Jewish people by citing the worlds apparent indifference to the Armenian genocide. The killing fields of Cambodia. the ruthless battles between Hutu and Tutsi. and ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia are only the most recent examples of mans inhumanity to man. We must use todays commemoration of the Armenian genocide to once again remind ourselves and the world that the words let us remember announce an active cause."},{"1":"1.030018e+09","2":"1993","3":"S","4":"PELI","5":"911","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. I wish to express my strong support for this amendment. and particularly for the education action agenda already set into motion by President Clinton and his administration. It is abundantly clear that we have a President dedicated to improving American education. Nothing could be better evidence of the administrations commitment to education than the appointment of Go. Richard Riley as Secretary of Education. In the few short weeks he has been on the job. Secretary Riley has already demonstrated that his interest lies not in making headlines but in a sure. steady effort to strengthen our Nations education system. The education initiatives set forth by President Clinton in these early days of his administration are of critical importance in what they set out to accomplish. Perhaps even more important. they convey to the American people that we have a President who intends to be extremely active in the cause of bettering American education at every level. The National Service objective already outlined by President Clinton are exciting not only because of how they will affect education but also because they kindle a new spirit of community concern and service on behalf of our citizenry. Tying student aid more closely to national and community service is a concept I am proud to have advocated for many years. I am literally overjoyed to see a President give life to this idea. and am committed to helping him bring it about. If we but give him the chance and work with him in the cause of national service. I am confident that our Nation will indeed be a better place to live in the coming years. I am equally encouraged that the President clearly sees the National Service concept as an adjunct or supplement to the Pell Grant Program. Thus while he has acted quickly to move us forward in the area of National Service. he has acted with equally swift speed to place the Pell Grant Program on a sound footing for the first time in over a decade. The proposal to erase the $2 billion shortfall in the Poll Grant Program is something that deserves the solid support of every Member of this Chamber. regardless of their party affiliation. It will erase all accumulated deficits. and give students and families the assurance that the funds we put into the Pell Grant Program will go out as aid to students. and that families can count on receiving the funds for which they are eligible. Some may say that erasing the shortfall has nothing to do with economic stimulus. I would say simply that such an argument is wrong. Over the past several years. the ranks of individuals eligible for Pell grants have increased dramatically as thousands upon thousands of Americans have sought a college education or returned to school. This is a direct result of the recession in which both unemployed and underemployed workers see additional education as the avenue to a job. the way to upgrade their skills. and a chance to improve their economic standing. Restoring health to the Poll Grant Program will mean that individuals and families who count on this help can do so with the confidence that the help will be there when they need it. President Clinton has also proposed an additional $500 million in funding for summer Chapter 1 programs in elementary and secondary education. This is an important provision. The Chapter 1 Program provides critical basic skills assistance to children from families who are not well off. A Chapter 1 summer program in our most disadvantaged areas will help sustain the gains that are made during the regular school year. It will also provide critical employment to the people who run the programs. The President has also proposed $235 million to help States that did not benefit in the census. but which continue to feel the full weight of the recession and the ongoing responsibility to meet the needs of poor children in a program that. today. reaches only about 40 percent of those who are eligible to participate. This. too. is an important part of the economic stimulus package. for without it school districts will face the need to impose additional layoffs and cutbacks in services in the Chapter 1 Program. Very soon the administration will submit its education reform legislation. Goals 2000: Educate America. My understanding is that this legislation. among other things. will codify the national education goals and the National Goals Panel. will provide an important framework for the development and certification of voluntary content standards. and provide important assistance to States. local education agencies. and individual schools to begin or build upon education reform efforts. I look forward with enthusiasm to working with the administration to obtain swift enactment for this important legislation. Mr. President. I cannot emphasize too strongly how important it is that we give President Clinton and Secretary Riley the chance they deserve to chart a course of positive change in American education. It has been clear from the outset that the Clinton administration has an expansive view of education. It is committed to bringing fundamental change in elementary and secondary education through school reform. and to revitalizing American higher education by bringing the spirit of national and community service onto the campuses and into the minds and actions of students across America. I stand with the President in this pursuit. and urge my colleagues to give him the chance that he deserves to make American education second to none. I yield the floor."},{"1":"1.020239e+09","2":"1992","3":"S","4":"MOYNIHAN","5":"2064","6":"Yes","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. I rise to introduce the Bullet Death. Injury. and Family Dissolution Control Act of 1992. Its purpose is to collect data about the nature and magnitude of bulletrelated death and injury. and to develop options about how to reduce. and if possible. eliminate. bulletrelated injury. death. and the associated negative impacts on the American family and society. This bill represents a new approach for protecting U.S. citizens from gun violence. It seems to me we must view the public health impact of bulletsdeath and injurymuch as we view an epidemic. Look at the data. In 1989. 34.776 lost their lives in the United States from bullets. 14.464 were murdered. 18.178 committed suicide. the rest died from accidents or legal interventionshot by a policeman or such. Although no national statistics are kept on bulletrelated injuries. studies suggest they are from two to five times more frequent than deaths. up to 175.000 bullet injuries per year. Homicide is the second leading cause of death in the 15- to 34yearold age bracket. surpassed only by unintentional events like automobile crashes. It is the leading cause of death for black males aged 15 to 34. The lifetime risk of death from homicide in United States males is 1 in 164. about the same as the risk of battle death faced by United States servicemen from all forces serving in Vietnam. For black males the lifetime risk of death from homicide is 1 in 28. twice the risk of battle death faced by marines serving in Vietnam. Almost all homicides are caused by bullets. Consider. in 1989 a total of 17.277 black males in the 15 to 34 year age group died in the United States. Homicides accounted for 6.031 of the total deaths. 4.804 were murdered by bullets or 80 percent. That same year a total of 52.148 white males in the 15 to 34 year age group died in the United States. Of these. homicides accounted for 4.464 of the total deaths among these young white males. 3.126 were killed by bullets. over 75 percent. We have an epidemic of death by bullets. For black males it is pure carnage. 10 times the white rate. The 1985 report from the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Trauma Research notes there is no central. responsible agency for this particular trauma. relatively little funding available for this line of inquiry and large gaps in research programs to reduce injury. Some epidemiologists have recognized the devastation of firearms. Again. gun control has been the focus. As noted by Susan Baker and her colleagues in the book Epidemiology and Health Policy edited by Sol Levine and Abraham Lilienfeld: There is a correlation between rates of private ownership of guns and gunrelated death rates. Guns cause twothirds of family homicides. Small easily concealed weapons comprise the majority of guns used for homicides. suicides and unintentional death. Baker states: These facets of the epidemiology of firearmrelated deaths and injuries have important implications. Combined with their lethality. the widespread availability of easily concealed handguns for impetuous use by people who are angry. drunk. or frightened appears to be a major determinant of the high firearm death rate in the United States. Each contributing factor has implications for prevention. Unfortunately. issues related to gun control have evoked such strong sentiments that epidemiologic data are rarely employed to good advantage (emphasis added). Certainly. the strong sentiments about gun control have made the subJect difficult for the epidemiologists. But. it might also be they are looking at the wrong interaction. Couldnt we focus on the bullets and not the guns. avoid some of the strong sentiments and even save lives? Let us look at our experience with controlling epidemics. Although the science of epidemiology traces its roots to antiquityHippocrates stressed the importance of considering environmental influences on human diseasesthe first modern epidemiology study was conducted by the James Lind in 1747. His efforts led to the eventual control of scurvy. It was not until 1795 that the British Navy accepted his analysis and required limes in shipboard diets. Most solutions are not perfect. Disease is rarely eliminated. But might epidemiology be applied in the case of bullets to reduce suffering? I think so. In 1854 John Snow and William Farr collected data that clearly showed cholera was caused by contaminated drinking water. Snow removed the handle of the Broad Street pump in London to prevent people from drawing water from this contaminated water source and the disease stopped in this population. His observations led to a legislative mandate that all London water companies filter their water by 1857. Cholera epidemics subsided. Now treatment of sewage prevents cholera from entering our rivers and lakes. and disinfection of drinking water makes water distribution systems uninhabitable for cholera vibrio. identified by Robert Koch as the causative agent in 1883. 26 years after Snows study. In 1900. Walter Reed identified mosquitoes as the carriers of yellow fever. Subsequent. mosquito control efforts by another U.S. Army doctor. William Gorgas. enabled the United States to complete the Panama Canal. The French failed because their workers were too sick from yellow fever to work. Now that it is known that yellow fever is caused by a virus. vaccines are used to eliminate the spread of the disease. These pioneering epidemiology success stories showed the world that epidemics require an interaction between three things: the host [the person who becomes sick. in the case of bullets. the victim]. the agent [the cause of sickness or the bullet]. and the environment [the setting in which the sickness occurs or in the case of bullets. violent behavior]. Interrupt this epidemiological triad and you reduce or eliminate disease and injury. How might this knowledge apply to the control of bulletrelated injury and death? Again. were talking about something different from gun control. There is a precedent. In the middle of this century it was recognized that epidemiology could be applied to automobile death and injury. From a governmental perspective. this hypothesis was first adopted in 1959. late in the administration of Governor Averell Harriman in New York State. In the 1960 Presidential campaign I drafted a statement on the subject which was released by Senator John F. Kennedy as part of a general response to enquiries from the American Automobile Association. Then Senator Kennedy stated: Traffic accidents constitute one of the greatest. perhaps the greatest of the nations public health problems. They waste as much as 2 percent of our gross national product every year and bring endless suffering. The now highways will do much to control the rise of the traffic toll. but by themselves they will not reduce it. A great deal more investigation and research is needed. Some of this has already begun in connection with the highway program. It should be extended until highway safety research takes its place as an equal of the many similar programs of health research which the federal government supports. Experience in the 1950s and early 1960s prior to passage of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act. showed that traffic safety enforcement campaigns designed to change human behavior did not improve traffic safety. In fact the death and injury toll mounted. I was Assistant Secretary of Labor in the mid1960s when Congress was developing the Motor Vehicle Safety Act. and I was called to testify. It was clear to me and others that motor vehicle injuries and deaths could not be limited by regulating driver behavior. Nonetheless. we had an epidemic on our hands and we needed to do something about it. My friend William Haddon. the first Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. recognized that automobile fatalities were caused by a second collision. In the first collision the automobile strikes some object. When energy is transferred to the interior of the car. a second collision occurs as the driver and occupants strike the steering wheel. dashboard and other structures in the passenger compartment. The second collision is the agent of injury to the host. the cars occupant. Efforts to make automobiles crashworthy follow examples used to control infectious disease epidemics. Reduce or eliminate the agent of injury. Seat belts. padded dashboards. and air bags are all specifically designed to reduce. if not eliminate. injury caused by the agent of automobile injuries. energy transfer to the human body during the second collision. In fact. weve done nothing revolutionary. All of the technology used to date to make cars crashworthy. including air bags. was developed prior to 1970. Experience shows the approach worked. Sure it could have worked better. but it worked. Had we been able to totally eliminate the agent. the second collision. the cure would have been complete. Nonetheless. by just focussing on simple. achievable remedies we reduced the traffic death and injury epidemic by 30 percent. Some 15.000 lives saved and 100.000 injuries avoided each year. We can apply our experience to the epidemic of murder and injury from bullets. The environment in which these deaths and injuries occur is complex. Many factors likely contribute to the rise in bulletrelated injury. Here is an important similarity with the situation we faced 25 years ago regarding automobile safety. We simply cannot do much to change the environment [violent behavior] in which gunrelated injury occurs. nor do we know how. We can. however. do something about the agent causing the injurybullets. Ban them! At lest the rounds used disproportionately to cause death and injury (i.e.. .25 caliber. .32 caliber. and 9 millimeter bullets). These three rounds compose 13 percent of licensed guns in New York City. yet they are involved in onethird of all homicides. They arent used for sport or hunting. They are used for violence. There are come 200 million firearms in circulation. The pistol is a simple machine. and with minimal care it remains working for centuries. However. we have only a four year supply of bullets. Some 2 billion cartridges are used each year. At any given time there are some 7.5 billion rounds in factory. commercial. or household inventory. In all cases. except pistol whipping. gunrelated injuries are not caused by the gun but by bullets. the agent involved in the second collision. As Ive said before. would this end the problem of handgun killings? No. But it just might reduce it. A 30percent reduction in bulletrelated deaths. for instance. would save over 10.000 lives each year. And. prevent up to 50.000 wounds. Water treatment efforts to reduce typhoid fever in the United States took about 60 years. Slow sand filters are installed in certain cities in the 1880s and water chlorination treatment began in the 1910s. The death rate from Typhoid in Albany NY. prior to 1889 when the municipal water supply was treated by sand filtration was about 100 fatalities per 100.000 people per year. The rate dropped to about 25 typhoid deaths per year after 1889. and dropped again to about 10 typhoid deaths per year after 1915 when chlorination was introduced. By 1950. the death rate from typhoid fever had dropped to zero. It will likely take longer than 60 years to eliminate bulletrelated death and injury. but we need to start with achievable measures to break the deadly interactions between people. bullets and violent behavior. The bill I Introduce today begins the process. It requires the collection of systematic information about the nature and magnitude of bulletrelated death and injury and it begins to control the agent of disease. the bullet. through taxation of those rounds used disproportionately in crimethe .25 caliber. .32 caliber. and 9 mm rounds. More importantly. it recognizes the epidemic nature of the problem. building on the June 10. 1992. issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association which is devoted entirely to papers on the subject of violence. principally violence associated with firearms. An editorial signed by our former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and George D. Lundberg. M.D.. is titled Violence in America: A Public Health Emergency. Their proposition is admirably succinct. Regarding violence in our society as purely a sociologic matter. or one of law enforcement. has led to unmitigated failure. It is time to test further whether violence can be amenable to medical/publio health interventions.

I thank the committee chairman for bringing H.R. 5796. a bill to conduct certain studies in New Mexico. to the House floor for consideration. New Mexico. known as the Land of Enchantment. contains many natural resources that are nationally significant. H.R. 5796 would provide for three studies to see how these resources can best be protected. First. the legislation would direct the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a study to determine the need for a National Forest Information Center and an expanded environmental education program in New Mexico. There are over 9 million acres of spectacular national forests which are used for recreational and economic purposes. A National Forest Information Center in New Mexico would help the public determine how its natural resources should be managed as well as providing general tourist information. Second. the bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to take two steps concerning cave research. First. establish a Cave Research Program within the Department of Interior. and second. conduct a study on the feasibility of establishing a Cave Research Institute. The Cave Research Program shall include collection of data. analysis. and dissemination of research material related to caves managed by the National Park Service. Including Carlsbad Caverns National Park and the Capitan Reef area. The program shall be directed primarily toward lands managed by the National Park Service. but the Secretary may enter into cooperative agreements with other agencies or entities. The feasibility study shall be submitted to this committee within 1 year after enactment of this act and include the need for a Cave Research Institute. its costs. its purposes. what the facility should include. and where it should be located. An analysis of potential sites for the Institute shall include the Carlsbad Caverns National Park. Third. the bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study of the fossil trackways recently discovered at the Robledo Mountains near Las Cruces. NM. The find at Robledo contains spectacular fossilized trackways of amphibians. reptiles. arthropods. and insects made 280 million years ago. The study would determine the importance of the discovery. evaluate how to curate. display. and interpret the fossils found in the area. and. recommend the proper administrative designation and agency for management of the site. The bill would also provide for an interim withdrawal of the area from operation of public laws which would extend for 2 years after the conclusion of the study. Mr. Speaker. this legislation provides for studies that would enhance public knowledge about these unique natural resources in New Mexico.

I am just sorry that the route we took to get here was more meander than beeline. The adjustments in the wage rate are long overdue. Without question. they will help the millions of minimum wage workers. At the same time. I think they are sufficiently modest so as to not cause substantial disruptions in our economy. including job losses. The training wage provisions are likewise reasonable. I have long thought that a hybrid training wagewith formal training following an initial tryout periodmade the most practical and political sense. With the training wage in place. I hope the next few years will give us an opportunity to validate or debunk our varying views on this issue. This bill makes additional changes which I think are positive. Section 3 will update and hopefully simplify the enterprise coverage test for most small businesses. Section 7 will provide employers with a modest incentive to provide their employees with remedial education in basic skills. I think we have a reasonable agreement to move forward to finally apply the principles of the Fair Labor Standards Act to Senate employees. But despite the positive features of this bill. it is deficient in one major respect. According to its critics. this bill fails on several counts. The wage rate does not keep pace with inflation or poverty levels. for example. While this is true. it may be expecting too much of the minimum wage and the economy to harbor such expectations. As I have argued in the past on this issue. the minimum wage is a poorly targeted mechanism for attacking poverty. While many of the poor earn the minimum wage. a minority of minimum wage earners are poor. By contrast. the earned income tax credit. or EITC. is exactly targeted to the people who need the most help. Over a year ago. Representative PTRI and I and others suggested that we set the minimum wage at $4.25 in 1991 with a family adjusted EITC. At the time. I think some people may have dismissed this as Republican mischief. It was not. and perhaps now it is worth a second look. I know there are costs to reforming the EITC. and those costs cannot be ignored. But I think we must address those costs and move forward. While there may not be an opportunity in this session. I certainly think it should be a high priority for the coming year. Madam President. I urge adoption of H.R. 2710. Madam President. during its consideration of amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act this past spring. the Senate adopted a provision. contained in section 108 of the Senate amendment to H.R. 2. that would start in motion the process of applying the protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act to employees of the Senate. Out of deference to the Senate. the House in its adoption of H.R. 2710 did not include this provision. So as to expedite the business of the Senate. I will not offer the text of section 108 again. I will not do so because I understand that the agreement embodied in section 108 remains in force. that is. that the Rules Committee will act within 180 days of an increase in the minimum wage to report to the Senate a measure to effect this extension. I would ask of the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee. who was instrumental in crafting this provision this past spring. if this is indeed his understanding as well?"},{"1":"1.000165e+09","2":"1988","3":"H","4":"HAWKINS","5":"107","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker.

I rise today to express my dismay at the soaring trade deficit. and more importantly. the negative impact that it is having on American jobs. I just spent the past 5 weeks back in Wisconsin. During that time. the administration issued its decision not to tighten the important restrictions on foreign shoes. Workers throughout the Stateboth those who have already lost their Jobs and those whose Jobs are threatenedwere outraged. Mr. President. the people of Wisconsin are right to be concerned about the flood of imports coming into the United States. They understand that if we dont close the floodgate soon their Jobs may be washed away. The administrations decision only makes this current of unfair trade even stronger. Wisconsin workers know that we have an imbalance in trade because we have left the door wide open to imports. They also know that those same countries whose products are taking over our markets refuse to import many of the products made here in the United States. Now I have said J. before and I will say it againI belheve in free trade. But when other nations are not willing to give the same treatment to our products that we give to theirs. free trade comes at the expense of fair trade. And American Jobs become our biggest export. We must protect our workforce by insisting that our trading partners play fair. By showing that we are willing to treat them with some reciprocity. they just may come to see the virtues of free trade. Mr. President. the precedent set forth by the administrations decision not to follow the ITCs recommendations for import restrictions on foreign footwear is a dangerous one. Does the administration really want to send a signal to American industry that the ITC process doesnt work? Do they really want to give American industry no alternative other than to come to Congress for relief? Industries other than footwear have been hurt by these unfair trade practices. The American textile industry has been suffering since 1980. There has been a 19percent average increase in annual textile import growth. That growth has surged to 65 percent in each of the past 2 years. Now imports control over 50 percent of the American clothing market. As a result. 250 textile factories have closed for good in the United States. The statistics are even worse when you look at the number of people left Jobless. A whopping 300.000 Jobs have been lost since 1980. In the State of Wisconsin. 14.800 Jobs are dependent upon the States textile and apparel industries. which include Oshkrosh BGosh. Wigwam in Sheboygan. and Jockey International in Kenosha. Where do these people go for relief? As the administrations lack of action on footwear demonstrates. the ITC process has become a deadend. That is why today. I have decided to Join the majority of my colleagues who have cosponsored S. 680. the Textile and Apparel Act of 1985. Mr. President. unless Congress acts soon. we run the risk of losing an industry vital not only to Wisconsin. but also to America. We cannot afford to put thousands of Americans out of work. With the passage of S. 680. we can avoid such a disaster. It has become clear that Congress must take the lead in fighting for balanced and free trade. I will continue to push for relief for the shoe industry and to bring this textile bill to the Senate floor. But our final goal must be the formulation of an effective trade policy that encourages our trading partners to break down their own trade barriers. When our trading partners get a taste of their own medicine and realize the effects that import restrictions can have on their own economies. then they may come to understand the importance of free trade. Only then will American workers be truly free to compete. Therefore. Mr. President. today I have become a cosponsor of S. 680. the Textile and Apparel Act of 1985. and will work for its passage in the U.S. Senate."},{"1":"9.802464e+08","2":"1984","3":"S","4":"TRIBLE","5":"1061","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I thank my colleague for yielding. Mr. President. I rise in strong support of the nomination of J. Harvie Wilkinson III of Virginia. We have concluded today one of the most thorough examinations of a nominee to the bench ever seen by Members of the Senate. an examination conducted by both Republicans and Democrats. NothingI repeat. nothingdiscussed here or in the hearing this week calls into question Mr. Wilkinsons fitness to serve on the bench. We have heard much about lobbying. about contacts with friends. telephone calls. and discussions with highranking public officials. Mr. Wilkinson did some campaigning. So what? Who in the Senate has not campaigned for a job in his or her life? It is quite appropriate for those who seek jobs to talk to their friends. their former employers. people who are in a position to judge them personally and professionally. and ask them to say a good word on their behalf. Nothing is improper about that. We have all done it. Indeed. the ABA says that they welcome that kind of information and that. in this case. it did not in any way influence the result. In fact. Mr. President. none of the members of the ABA on the Federal judiciary present at our hearing indicated that their votes were influenced in any way. What did the socalled lobbying campaign amount to? Mr. Wilkinson asked 14 persons who knew his work and his character to speak to members of the committee on his behalf. He was quite open about that. He fully reported that to the committee. He even supplied his telephone records. Two former employers of Mr. Wilkinsonformer Deputy Attorney General Schmults and Justice Powellspoke positively to ABA members about his nomination. At no time was Justice Powell asked to make a call. He did that on his own initiative. He made a single phone call. That member of the committee of the Judiciary voted against Wilkinson. Some influence. Mr. President. Some influence. There is an additional point here. Mr. Wilkinsons professional reputation was at stake. was on the line. It is entirely proper for one who is being evaluated in this way to bring relevant information to committee members. It is quite simply. I suggest to my colleagues. a matter of fundamental fairhess that when someone is being evaluated. he has a right to tender evidence in his own behalf. It is also a mystery to me why former employers of Mr. Wilkinson. who had held high positions of great responsibility in our Government. and who judged Mr. Wilkinson superbly qualified for the bench. should not convey their impressions to the committee. That is exactly the kind of information the committee needed. and without that they were unable to pass judgment. The sum and substance of all this. after a long day of hearing requested by Members of this body. is that there is nothing to suggest that these communications were inconsistent with the independent judgment of the committee and the statements of the ABA members reaffirmed that fact. They welcomed the communication. It did not influence the outcome. Now. let us go beyond that. We have talked at great length about the qualifications of this man. I think it is somewhat instructive that the opponents of this nomination have seen fit to base their opposition not on the mans merits. not on his qualifications. but on the peripheral considerations brought to our attention today. If you cannot win on the merits. then you try to divert the attention of this body. Mr. President. I suggest that if we will focus on the man. you cannot help but be impressed with his qualifications. and his great potential for high service to this Nation to his State. At the kind invitation of the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I sat in on most of the hearing. It began at 10 a.m. It lasted until almost 8 p.m. I heard virtually all of the testimony for Mr. Wilkinson and those who have expressed concerns. I wish that each Member of this body could have been there. I am a partisan in his favor. I will admit quite frankly. But in 8 years as a Member of the Congress. in the House of Representatives and now in the Senate. I have never been more impressed with an individual who has appeared before a Senate or House committee. During his appearance on that long and trying day. he demonstrated precisely the qualities all of us hope for in a Federal judgegrace under fire. a profound knowledge of the law. a deep respect for the integrity of the judiciary and the legal profession. and a facility of expression. one that is evidenced in abundance in his critically acclaimed writings. Mr. Wilkinson is an extraordinarily talented lawyer and scholar. He is a man of unimpeachable integrity. He will be a jurist of rare distinction. We have talked about this for months. Every procedural obstacle has been thrown in the path of this nomination. We have endeavored to satisfy every request from both sides of the aisle. Slowly. painfully perhaps. but those hearings have been held. three in all. I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we have met those reservations and those requests. The third day of hearings was held. Those who oppose Mr. Wilkinson have had more than their day. I believe it is now the hour for the Senate to speak. I do not believe that we should frustrate this nomination process any longer. I believe that this man has a right to have the Senate express its approval or disapproval of this nomination. Therefore. I urge my colleagues to invoke cloture to give the Members of this body. Republicans and Democrats alike. an opportunity to stand up. and speak out. and pass judgment on this nominee. Reasonable men may disagree on his merits. Mr. President. but I suggest that if you take a look at this young man. if you are able to put partisan. and political. and philosophical objections aside. you cannot help but be persuaded that he is a man of rare quality. But I say this to each Senator. The time has come to speak. The time has come for us to pass judgment on this individual. and that is all I request.

I rise to say that I sent a letter to the President in opposition to paying those citizens who were hostages in Iran financial compensation in addition to their hardship pay and regular pay. This was a difficult decision. but I do it for a number of reasons. As a Vietnam veteranand I believe as the only current U.S. Senator to have actually served in ground operations in VietnamI can attest that this payment is blatantly unfair to Vietnam veterans. We cannot find enough money to fund properly the agent orange legislationand Vietnam veterans benefits are at about 35 percent on a parity basis with World War II veterans. Take the case of a young person drafted into combat in Vietnam. He served for 13 months against his will with no escape. He came home to scorn and derision. He received no such compensation. Why should we not vote him some special compensation? The principle is the same. Furthermore. it is my conviction that those people who choose to enter a professionbe it military or the Foreign Service or a similar occupationdo so at certain risks. and we establish a bad precedent by paying compensation of so much per day. I think it is proposed to be about $5.500 per hostage in this case. I know it sounds. that one is not taking a grateful position to the hostages. Indeed. I am very grateful for what they did. They have been recognizedand they deserve it. For example. according to the September 22. 1981. New York Times: State Department and Pentagon officials say that efforts have been to accommodate requests for special assignments at home or abroad. Many requests have been for assignments to posts in Western Europe. Mementos and gifts for the former hostages still pour into the liaison groups Washington headquarters. While the flow is slackening. there appears to be little slackening in requests for speeches by former hostages. If we trace back even in recent history there have been many hostages who have not been paid compensation. Foreign Service officers have the benefit of travel. excellent jobsand people are lined up to join. There are some risks. too. I believe in pay .ng the salary. I believe in paying the combat pay. I believe in paying the hardship duty post pay. but I do not believe in paying extra compensation if something goes wrong. We are establishing a bad precedent here that somehow violates principle. There are people waiting in line to get into the Foreign Serviceif you are in the Foreign Service of your country. indeed. there are many attractions to serving abroad. the privilege of being a Foreign Service officer. the privilege of representing our Government abroad. the travel benefits. the educational benefits. We have people waiting in line for these jobswe should not have a precedent to pay people cash if something that can be reasonably expected to occasionally happen does occur. Also. there has now been a demand from some of the hostages for additional compensation. I am shocked at this concept of public service. But my main objection is the basic principle that we compensate people in dollar amounts for being hostages. I think it is a very bad precedent. Let me repeat that I think our Vietnam veteransnot the ones who were prisoners of war. but the veteransshould be offended by this. should take offense. and the reason being that we have been unable to come up with appropriations that amount to very much for such things as agent orange. It is true we did classify agent orange as a disease for consideration. but we did not add any additional appropriations. The parity for Vietnam veterans. in terms of the veterans benefits compared to World War II veterans. is below 40 percent. I am not saying that Vietnam veterans necessarily deserve anything for having served their country. Many of us do not want any special consideration. We merely want the opportunities that usually go with being a veteran. and I say that as a Vietnam veteran. But this matter is bothersome to me. the payment of additional compensation. in addition to salaries. in addition to time off. and in addition to rehabilitation. We are taking care of these hostages on many fronts. and we have already given them extraordinary recognition. There have been so many precedJents in American history where hostages have been held and we have :ot paid compensation. We have followed the basic principle of saying to someone that: You serve your country abroad and we will pay you this salary. This is the deal. You go. There are certain risks involved. You are not being drafted. You may resign anytime. There may be hardships. You may b3 captured. It is public service. This is in sharp conflict with what was said to most Vietnam veterans who actually servedYou are drafted. you must go. you cannot resign. you will fight for your life in a diseaseinfested environment. and you will be scorned at home. Who should be compensated? So. the point is. to the Vietnam veteran. this appears very unfair. As a Vietnam veteran myself. I tend to agree. Yes. I think Vietnam veterans should and will take it as an insult. because it is giving more monetary recognition to a group of people who served this country well. granted I am not saying anybody did not. I am not critical in any way of the hostages. I do not even know if most of them wanted this much money. But I have talked to Vietnam veterans who are very upset about this. it is another indication at a time when Congress is in a budgetary deficit. at a time when Congress cannot appropriate more money for the veterans and GI bills. similar to what was after World War II. they find this passing strange to put it mildly. Finally. I think it is a bad precedent in principle. You serve your country. you get a certain level of pay. in this instance they were also getting hardship pay. There are certain risks and benefits in the Foreign Service and serving abroad. When you join the military you take certain risks but you also get certain benefits. And one of the great benefits is one of public service. These people got their pay. their promotions. they also got many other recognitions. many more than the Vietnam veterans did. To pay each of them $5.500 more is a great mistake.

The point is that workers are indeed losing their jobs due to imports of color televisions. shoes. and steel products.

Chrysler has 50 executives earning an average of nearly $84.000 a year. Now these management people swallowed hard. and they punished themselves for their incompetence by taking cuts of between 10 percent and 2 percent. Mr. Chairman. I am overwhelmed by such generosity. Somebody making $100000 a year is asking people making $7.000 a year to underwrite his salary. and in exchange he is willing to take only $90.000 instead of $100.000. Has the world ever before known such selfsacrifice? And what about the people at Chrysler who have been earning an average of nearly $47.000 a year? They will take a cut of 2 to 5 percent. What sterling character. What a great sacrifice to protect their own jobs. This Congress has come a long way. We used to be Robin Hoods around here taxing the rich to help the poor. But now we are taking from the poor to help the rich. I cannot stand quietly by and watch this Congress try to justify. taking money from people earning $7.000. $8.000 or $10.000 a year. so 100 or 1.000 people at Chrysler can keep up their country club memberships. This amendment is very simple. It imposes a 20percent salary cut on all Chrysler executives earning at least $40.000 a year. And that is certainly fair. It prohibits any pay increase for Chrysler executives during the duration of the loan guarantees. And does anybody here really believe we should ask the taxpayers to underwrite a pay raise for $50.000- or $100.000ayear executives. And the amendment sets a maximum compensation for any Chrysler employee of just over $50.000 a year and in salary and just under $5.000 a year in other compensationthe same pay level the Congress has set for GS18 level employees. the highest management position in the civil service. I think its fitting that the top Chrysler executives be paid the same as top civil service workers. If Chryslers executives want the taxpayers to take care of them. they ought to work for what the taxpayers pay. This is a reasonable amendment. We should not ask moderate income people in our districts who are struggling to get by. to underwrite $80.000 or $90.000 or $100.000 salaries. If we are going to ask people in our districts who do not work for Chrysler to sacrifice to save the jobs of those who do the executives who have those highpaying jobs should make the first and biggest sacrifices. If they are not willing to give up some of their excess luxury to keep their jobs. why should the working people of this country give up money they need far more. The Chrysler management should make a meaningful sacrifice to save the company and this amendment will see that they do."},{"1":"9.503331e+08","2":"1978","3":"H","4":"STOCKMAN","5":"1002","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. I have listened very carefully to this debate and obviously the only serious argument that can be made against this recommittal motion is the argument that it would be wildly inflationary and send the economy into a tailspin from which we could not recover. As the gentleman from New York points out. a tax cut per se does not necessarily cause inflation. That outcome will only occur if a number of things happen in between. The problem in the debate today is we have heard nothing about those steps that have to happen in between in order to get this dire outcome. First and foremost. if we are going to have runaway inflation. we have to have runaway growth in the money supply. The gentleman from Ohio said that a while ago. Mr. Heller. I think. would agree also. Now. the Federal Reserve Board is not composed of a bunch of wildeyed disciples of William Jennings Bryan. It is composed of responsible bankers. businessmen. and economists. and they are not about to accelerate money growth at that rate. unless the credit demand so exceeds the credit supply that the only alternative to this kind of policy is a devastating interest rate crunch. So the real question about whether or not KempRoth will have a wildly inflationary impact is simply what will it do to the credit demand and to the savings supply in the next 3 years. If we look at credit demand. that obviously depends on the rate of Federal borrowing and the size of the deficit. That is where any major increase in credit demand would come from. What has been overlooked time and time again in this debate is the size of the Federal deficit is not determined solely by the Federal revenue level. but it is a residual from a number of factors. First. the actuaL size of the deficit that has to be financed will result from the expenditure growth trend that we have in the next 3 years. In the last 5 years it has risen at 12 percent. in nominal terms. We have had a 6percent real growth rate even when we discount for inflation. That does not have to occur over the next 3 years. The American people do not want it. That is clear from California a few months ago. The fact is that we have 3 years and we will have 3 budget resolutions and we will have 45 appropriations bills which will give us an ample opportunity to begin to hold the real growth rate of Federal spending to 3 percent. 2 percent. or even zero. And if we did that. we could still permit all the existing programs to continue. and we would not have to penalize anybody or cut anybody off a grant or even fire one Federal employee. We just have to restrain the real growth rate. Second. the deficit level will be a function of Federal revenue. which in turn is a function of the tax rate and the size of the tax base. If we reduce taxes by 30 percent. there will be a reduction in revenue. but the economic base which we will tax. that economic base will be higher. We can argue all afternoon about how much the response will be. what the elasticity is. but if you argue there will be a zero response. no increase in production and no increase in work effort and no increase in the supply factors that make production possible. then you are on a collision course with commonsense. If we lower the top marginal tax rate from 70 percent to 50 percent. there will be a substantial amount of money coming out of the tax shelters and the municipal bond markets and it will go into taxable investments. and that means we will have more income and production to tax. and that will raise revenue. If we lower the marginal tax rate by 30 percent. there will be some increase in the number of entrepreneurs who will be willing to break out of the IBMs of the world and start their own companies. and there will be an increase in the number of doctors who will want to get off the ski lifts and back into their operating rooms. There will be at least some increase in the number of research and development studies that come off the drawing boards and get into production. You will get some salesmen who are willing to work more hours. You will get some farmers who are willing to put in more acreage. You will get some retailers who are willing to work extra hours. And you will have some workers who will be willing to take on more overtime at lower marginal rates. So. in short. you are going to get more production. It does not take a lot of extra production to get a substantial revenue impact. If we get about a onehalf of 1 percent increase in national production. it will raise Government revenue by $40 billion a year. I do not think it is unreasonable at all to think that with a 33percent decrease in marginal income tax rates we will not get a half of 1 percent increase in production. Finally. and hopefully. a deep tax reduction would substantially increase the supply of savings and money in the economy. First. there is the income effect. KempRoth reduces taxes by $100 billion. and that means at least a $25 billion increase in supply of savings because that is the aftertax net savings rate. There will also be a price or incentive effect: this measure reduces taxes on savings by onethird because the income tax is the only tax we levy directly on savings. That effect will further augument the savings supply in credit markets. In short. with expenditure resistant and the feedback revenues. the deficit does not have to exceed $40 billion during the next 3 years. With a substantial in crease in savings supply. there will be no credit inbalance. no pressure on the Fed to pump up the money supply. and no additional inflation."},{"1":"9.500219e+08","2":"1977","3":"S","4":"MAGNUSON","5":"90","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Forty to one is the benefitcost ratio.

I shall be very brief. There is no point in going through the record of what has happened and what has not happened. I can only say. like the Senator from West Virginia. the distinguished assistant majority leader. that he. his colleague. the able chairman of the Committee on Public Works . and I have all been involved in this energy effort for some time. I would only point out. just to mention one or two things. that when Senator RANDOLPH proposed a commission to look into the energy problem in 1970. which was a bipartisan effort. in which I joined the Senator from West Virginia. and I think over half the Senate joined. the administration opposed his proposal on grounds that there was no need for it. Then the Senate. under the leadership of Senator RANDOLPH. adopted the resolution which will now be expanded. Senate Resolution 45. Out of that effort has come the basic legislation through which we have endeavored to do something about the energy problem. and to give the President of the United States the tools to do the job. Over in the Interior Committee. on the Alaska pipelinelet us just take that one as an examplethat would have been started a long time ago had the administration listened when my counsel made it very clear to them that they were in legal trouble because they needed authority beyond the 50foot rightofway requirement which was in the then existing law. But what happened was that they would not agree. They said they were confident. the oil industry took the same position. and the court unanimously overruled them. But. let me point out. It was not on environmental grounds. So we put the transAlaska pipeline bill through. We foresaw the problem of the need for alternative sources of energy with a $20 billion research and development program. The Senator from Michigan supported it. but the administration opposed it. and subsequently came out for their own program. But it passed the Senate 82 to 0. As to the allocation of scarce fuels: I introduced that bill. and it passed the Senate over the opposition of the administration. Mr. Simonwho I think is a dedicated. competent. and loyal American. who is doing his best to do a good jobwithout the mandatory allocation authority could not do anything today. Yet the administration opposed it. I was at that meeting in April a year ago that the distinguished assistant majority leader has referred to. and. very candidly. the President of the United States did not know that they had opposed the $20 billion R. & D. program. That was one of those OMB decisions. I must say that it was very difficult. on the legislative side. to deal with the administration on these problems. because no one was in charge of the store. I do not want to bring up embarrassing subjects. but Governor Love said he never had a chance to talk to the President of the United States while he was in charge of the energy program. That is not the Senator from Washington saying it. that is what he said in a news conference. And I must say the facts are that we had no one in charge until Governor Love was appointed. and then he could not meet with the President of the United States. I say it is no wonder that Governor Love quit in disgust. Now Mr. Simon has taken over. and I have given him 100percent cooperation. I have stated it publicly. I think he is trying to do a good job in a difficult situation. You do not make friends. it is not a good platform to be administrator of this program and expect to have people love you. The facts are that the conference report we are talking about stemmed from legislation that we originated in the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. General Lincoln. over a year agoand it came out in the investigative hearings. the distinguished Senator from Kentucky who is now occupying the chair was present when it came outGeneral Lincoln. who was then in charge of OEP. said that they had a contingency plan to deal with a cutoff. When we had them in closed session before the committee. Governor Love and others said there was no such contingency plan. And. to make a long story short. they did not have a legislative program. We went ahead. and I cooperated with the man who was coordinating at that time. Melvin Laird. We worked together. we got a bill out. and we passed it overwhelmingly. I concede that in the House of Representatives they added a lot of amendments. I did not agree with many of the amendments. but we had two conferences and we worked it out. The conference report is an important piece of legislation. I think it must be passed. I would hope we can get the Republicans as well as the Democrats on the Rules Committee to grant the waiver. Look at what is in the bill. People are really hung up on three things in America. They are hung up on these astronomical price increases. shortages. and unemployment. We tried to address ourselves to all three. We have the provision in there on the price rollback. a provision on unemployment insurance. and provisions on coal conversion. auto emission standards. and the authority. for example. to allocate critical materials so we can get on with the oil drilling that is essential."},{"1":"9.300029e+08","2":"1973","3":"H","4":"DAVIS","5":"1074","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Speaker. and my colleagues on both sides of the aisleI would like to go on record today in regards to one of the recent January 18.. 19 73 austerity moves by the administration. Frankly. I must admit my confusion over the matter. I am speaking about the action taken by the administration toward the Rural Environmental Assistance program. I recall around election time the campaign promise to the small farmer and citizen in rural America was Dont worry. well take care of you. Well. all my friends and constituents who live in rural America are saying that is certainly true. and if they get taken care of any- more they will not be able to stand it. As it is now. they only face destitution. If the Department of Agriculture leadership has its way. they will take good enough care of the small f armer to bring about his starvation. Mr. Speaker. somebody is talking out. of both sides of their mouth. with one hand patting the farmer on the back. and with the other picking his pocket. That somebody is not the Congress. Today. rural America is faced with the greatest threat in its historyevery day more and more people say enough and leave the farm. They leave because they cannot afford to be taken care of in the manner to which the powers that be would like them to become accustomed. They are tired of being the havenots in an affluent society. Well. I do not blame them. I suspect I would lose my enthusiasm too in light of the most recent developmentsthe abolishment of REAP. This is not a budget cutbut a death sentence. This will be the final straw for many in rural America. The deciding factor between staying and leaving. To maintain the American farmer can continue to subsist without assistance is pure folly. He cannot. Moreover he should not. The rural citizen deserves the same consideration as his urban counterpart. but the administration wants to take away this programthat has done so much. What has it done? Well. just to put this program in perspective I would like to quote the distinguished chairman of the House Agricultural Committee. our colleague. Mr. POAGE of Texas. Speaking of the results of REAP he said: It has done more to clean up our streams than all of our pollution programs. It has done this by widespread effort. This program has invited increased yearly participation by never allowing more than $2.500 per individual. This program has stopped the movement of silt and erosion of the land with terraces. contour farming. establishment of cover crops. and restoration of grasslands. Another plus for the program is the major portion it has accounted for in the reforestation of much of our private lands. Let us not forget. this has been a participation program in which the small farmer has put his own funds on a matching basis. Now the experts want to stop this program. I am not sure if they do not knowor do not care that stopping such a program will have disastrous. longrange effects on all Americans. Last year. 3 million acrefeet of silt poured into our streamspractically all of it from the rural area. In comparison. 104.000 acrefeet of sewagepractically all from the city was added to the streams. The very man who is responsible for helping to keep the rural figure from assuming astronomical proportions. the farmer. is being cut out of the assistance picture. I must protest the lack of foresight that is being shown at this time. If we dismantle this program. I can see a return to the dustbowl days of 40 years ago. I am sure there are some who can remember those trying times. when much of Americas heartland was lost. While I agree with the President that expenditures have gone too far. I do not feel that one segment of our society. the farmer. should bear the full weight of budget cuts. At this time. the administration is approving. yes. even increasing. the Federal percentage of assistance to the urban areas. I must object to the stepson role that is being thrust upon rural America. Furthermore. I am concerned with the attempt to determine the priority of Federal spending. We. in the Congress. passed this law to spend $225 million on: this program. First plans were to spend $140 million in initial funds. By my calculations. this was a cut of $85 million. Now we are told that none of the money will be spent. . Mr. Speaker. I mast wonder aloud if anyone but Congress has the authority to abolish a program. As I understand the Constitution. it gives Congress the au-. thority to determine the priority of Federal expenditures. Secondly. I must object to the timing of the announcement of cuts. Farmers in my district had been led to believe that at least $140 million was going to be availablemoney some of them were looking forward to. Following the election this changed. but not until the Christmas holidays. Could it be that there was hope such an announcement would be lost in the shuflebulied in the hustlebustle of the season. Frankly. gentlemen. this whole affair is beginning to take on a faint odor that seems to be growing stronger every minute. I. for one. am reluctant to allow still further erosion of the legislative branchs powers. I answer to the people who take the time to elect me every 2 years. I do not hide behind a wall of advisers. Cabinet members. and various assorted aides. I stand face to face with voters who are displeased with the direction of aid in rural America. I talk to the people and listen to their problemsnot a pack of advisers who would not know. a bull from a bass fiddle. I cannot explain to an irate farmer that while I voted for a bill and it passed and the President signed it. no money will be spent. All the farmer sees is that helping hand being withdrawn at a time when he needs it more than ever. So when he cannot get an answer from the farm agent. then he turns to me for help. Since the Constitution says that I can give him that help. by God. I intend to. Congress has marched to another tune long enough. Now is the time to start making our own music and set our own pace.

I rise today with my colleague Louis STOKES. of Ohio. to vent the concern of black Americans that this administration is intent on letting years of hardearned civil rights progress be compromised by embittered conservatives. Black people joined by white liberals are convinced that our only role over the next 3 years must be to conduct a holding action. It is not easy to accept this new kind of responsibility. for over the past 8 years we have learned to work for progress through legislation. through local. State. and national involvement in the issues. and through articulating the needs of people to an attentive audience. I am not saying that our former audiences always responded as we would have had them respondbut they did listen and they did make strides toward equal educational. social. and economic opportunities for black people. Now there is no audience except the people of this Nation. It is to them we must appeal for understanding of the conditions and deprivations which must be overcome through a national commitment. In this administration. the demands of the poor. of minoritiesand of black people in particularare falling on deaf. insensitive ears. President Nixon started off on a sour note by telling us he did not appoint any black people to his Cabinet because he could not find any qualified black citizens. In this day and age. saying that is like saying. Some of my best friends are black. To add insult to injury. Mr. Nixon visited the campuses of Yale. Harvard. and Princeton seeking qualified black talent. To the Presidents surprise. he found there were few blacks at Harvard. Yale. or Princeton. Of course. anyone who knows anything about the plight of black people in this country would not expect to find many black people at Yale. Harvard. or MIT. The simple truth is that the annual tuition of students at these institutions is in excess of $4.000 a year. The other ugly truth is that the average income of black people in this country is less than $4.000 a year. Why would any thinking man expect to find black people at the universities of Princeton. Harvard. and Yale. Furthermore. since Mr. Nixon graduated from Whittier College and he is qualified to be President of the United Stateswhy do blacks have to attend Ivy League schools in order to qualify to serve In his administration. It is also interesting that only one of Mr. Nixons Cabinet attended any Ivy League schoolbut all of them are millionaires except three. If whites who do not attend Ivy League schools qualify why must blacks attend in order to qualify? Why should we not rise today. then. to exclaim that black people know. by now. what the Presidents views are on black people? Sometimes. we think we have been swept into a time machine. and it is right back to 1877 when Rutherford B. Hayes was President. Consider the record: With the first week of the Nixon administration. title VI guidelines for school desegregation were suspended so as to provide five southern school districtswhich had disregarded the law of the land since 1954extra time to meet Federal standards. Under Executive Order No. 11246with rules and regulations promulgated thereunderthe Federal Government is obligated to do no business with companies which practice employment discrimination. In March. the Department of Defense awarded major contracts to three textile firms with established records of discriminatory practices. They were awarded in violation of regulations which require written assurances of future compliance with the Executive order. The Federal contract compliance mechanism has the potential for affecting onethird of the jobs in this economy. If the Government resolves to enforce the law. thousands of minority group citizens could thereby gain access to jobs and dignity. Before finally testifying on June 26. the Attorney General canceled five scheduled appearances before the House Judiciary Committee to present administration views on extension of the Voting Rights Act. The cancellations coincided with reports emanating from the Justice Department that the delays were precipitated by administration desires to dilute the effectiveness of the enforcement mechanisms provided in the present act. Unfortunately. the Attorney Generals testimony proved these reports were accurate. I am gratified by the wisdom of the House Judiciary Committee which has reported the legislation to extend the Voting Rights Act without administration revisions. The handling of the appointment of a new head of the EEOC added to the evidence that this administration will weaken enforcement on civil rights generally and mandates against job discrimination in particular. I do not dispute the right of the President to appoint a chairman of his own choosingbut to have the White House announce on the day following DIRKSENS vicious attack on Clifford Alexanderthat Alexander would be replacedleads to the conclusion that the President definitely agreed with DIRKSENs rantings. The Senator stated. in fact. that a firm enforcement of equal employment opportunities amounts to harassment of business firms. This administration has even recommended that the tax reform bill include a provision calling for foundations to lose their tax exempt status if they give any money to voter registration programs. Black people know that without the financial assistance of major foundations. we would not have registered black voters in the Southern States. Mr. Evers would not now be mayor of Fayette. Miss.. and Carl Stokes would not be mayor of Cleveland. The city of St. Louis has been struck particularly hard by this administration. First. we lost our Womens Job Corps Center which was among the 59 centers determined inefficient by President Nixons team of investigators. Over 16.000 youth suffered the impact of that decision. This administration said to them. You simply are not worth the price. Now. the Department of Labor is still trying to initiate its new. more efficient programprobably for wellbred. welltodo kids who for some reason decide not to go to college. Needless to say. this new program is not underwayeven though the old one is history. In the interim. nothing is happening. As a member of the special ad hoc task force on poverty designated by chairman of the Education and Labor Committee. CARL PERKINS. I observed close up the response of this administration to the problems of the youth enrolled in Job Corps. As a Member of Congress. a member of that task force committee. and as a representative of people who were directly affected by the administrations decision to close down the Job CorpsI addressed in three separate letters to this administrationmy concern and my questions on the subject decision and its implications. My concern and my questions were communicated in search of a response. The sincerity of my correspondence and the urgency of my very real need for such responses was overlooked. My letter of April 9 to Secretary of Labor George Shultz was answered June 16. more than 2 months later. My letter of April 15 to President Nixon was responded to June 3. and my letter of May 9 to the Secretary of Labor in which I raised important questions to clarify for the people of St. Louis the procedures whereby they might submit a proposal to participate in the new manpower program was answered only last week. July 14. Telephone inquiries from my office have been accorded similar consideration by Department of Labor personnel. If my experiences constitute an oversight or merely evidence of the machinations of bureaucracy. so be it. but I do not consider it a trivial matter or an excusable negligence. My colleagues here know that the Economic Opportunity Act and its program is being dismantled with the precision of a surgeons knife. All that is left is the office to administer to poverty. And to administer to poverty. the President chose a former Congressman who represented a district where the average income of his constituents was $9.300a man who knows little about poverty. a man who voted against the original Economic Opportunity Act. This is how poverty is being administered in Washington. Less than 1 month ago. the city of St. Louis received notice that it is no longer an area which is eligible for economic assistance from the Department of Commerce economic development program. This was only 9 months after a careful study had been conducted and submitted to the Federal authorities documenting to their overwhelming satisfaction that St. Louis needed funds for economic development. On June 17. I addressed my concern for this decision to the Honorable Maurice H. Stans. Secretary of the Department of Commerce. in a letter of that date. I called to the attention of the Secretary the fact that only 1 week prior to the receipt by the city of St. Louis of the decision to withdraw EDA funds. an EDA technical assistance grant was extended. Now. four programs In St. Louis have been brought to a halt. and one more time hope has been withdrawn. The people and city officials of St. Louis are concerned and perplexed. I am concerned and perplexed by the EDA decisionand yet. as of this date. I have received no clarification or explanation for this decision from the Department of Commerce in response to my letter. The only thing I can conclude is that St. Louis has made a miraculous improvement in our economic wellbeing since last Augustso much so that none of us has yet digested the full impact of our progress. Rumor has it that the Economic Development Administration designation of St. Louis as an area eligible for funds was withdrawn because our unemployment rate has dropped. Yet. I cannot consider that statement consistent with the latest statistics released by the Department of Labor on unemployment. July 18. 1969. the Department of Labor released information that the gap between black and white unemployment rates in the poverty neighborhoods of the Nations 100 largest cities was wider In the second quarter of 1969 than a year earlier. The release stated: The ratio of black to white unemployment was 2.0 to 1 in the second quarter of 1969. compared with a 1.6 to 1 ratio in the second quarter of 1968. I shall insert for the attention of my colleagues the complete report released by the Department at the conclusion of my statement. When Treasury Secretary David Kennedy first took office. he testified before a Senate committee to the effect that some increase in unemployment might be the price of controlling the inflationary spiral. In the past month. while consideration of the surtax was pending before the House. the administration spread the word that their antiinflationary policies would soon be felt by the economy. Consequently. I am not surprised by the labor statistics report indicating an increase in black unemployment in poverty neighborhoods. Black people know that they are the last hired and the first fired. The report shows that one out of every three black youths is unemployed. while only one of every eight white youths suffers joblessness. The kinds of employment and training needs of black youths and adults who are confined to the cores of our cities are simply not being addressed. There has been no response to their conditions. The black youth unemployment rate is merely an indication of harder times to comewhen these youth become adult unemployment statistics. Indications from this administration are that the commitment to the need for comprehensive youth training and allaround job preparation will be deferred. This Nation can put a man on the moon. but it cannot put black men on the job. I am pleased to note that the city of St. Louis has received funds for the model cities program. not. may I assure you. without sufficient bickering and cajoling of HUD officials who were. at one time. significantly prompted by the request of their Secretary. George Romney. to consider dropping St. Louis. I would welcome assurances that black involvement and control in the St. Louis model cities plan did not play a part in the vacillations of HUD officials on the St. Louis award. So far. I have witnessed no evidence to warrant such an assurance. Consider the Small Business Administration and discriminative practices which have brought forth special hearings by both the Senate and House committees having jurisdiction over SBA policies and practices. Before the week is up. I shall submit to my House colleagues the results of my study of Small Business Administration practices in the city of St. Louis. It is all downhill in the Nations Capitolpriorities are sadly confused while this President acts on his obvious decision to accommodate conservatists and southerners. Our hypocritical society continues. In fiscal year 1968. this Government paid well over $1 billion in farm paymentsand this figure does not include subsidy payments made in an amount less than $5.000 per farmer. Over 100.000 farmers in the United States collected more than $5.000 apiece last year for not growing cropsand over 4.000 farmers collected more than $100.000 each. Meanwhile. during this same period. the Government spent less than $300 million for its lowrent public housing programs and only $900 million in the Federal food program which includes school lunch and milk payments. commodity distribution. and food stamps. It has been said before. but it deserves repetitionthere is something basically wrong when a nation fails to feed its hungry while it pays its farmers not to produce food. The State of Missouri. I am sorry to say. is one of the worst offenders. It stands at the top of the list in collecting from the Federal Government farm subsidy payments and at the bottom of the list in administering food programs to its poor people. Any discussion of a guaranteed income program for poor people in this Nation must be prefaced by a discussion of the guaranteed income program which now exists--not for poor people but for rich farmers. Senator JAMES 0. EASTLAND. third ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. received a subsidy of $116.978 last year for his plantation. At the same time. citizens of Mississippi suffer the most dire hardships of hunger. In the State of Mississippi a ceiling has been applied to payments for dependent children of $9.50 a month. or $114 for a full year. And yet Senator EASTLAND has consistently opposed the proposal to place a ceiling on farm subsidy payments. No comment on this situation is necessary. it speaks for Itself. On May 17 the House of Representatives passed a proposal to limit these farm subsidy benefits to any one farmer to a maximum of $20.000 a year. This ceiling would effect a savings of at least $300 million to the Federal Government which could be applied to a decent food subsidy program and to almost double our effort for lowincome public housing. The people of St. Louis are well aware of the desperate need for funds for housing. Do you realize that in 1949 the men of Congress pledged to build 810.000 public housing units over the ensuing 6year period? Let me point out that 20 years have passed since they set that goal. and still we have not met it. In fact. it was not until the activity of the past 2 years that this Government brought the number of public housing units to 800.000. still 10.000 short of the 6year goal set in 1949. Back on the farm subsidies continue. In spite of House passage of a subsidy limitation. the Senate 2 weeks ago declined to accept that limitation. Once again. it seems the guaranteed income for rich farmers will continue into the future. At the same time. 12 percent of American families will probably continue under the conditions they are in. They cannot afford decent housing. Some 7.8 million American families--or one in every eightcannot now afford to pay market prices for standard housing which would cost no more than 20 percent of their incomes. I have introduced legislation in an effort to bring reform and activity into the Federal housing effort. It has too long lagged behind and caused too much suffering. In the period 196267the following amounts were spent: $356.3 billion on national defense. a conservative estimate. $33.2 billion on farm subsidies. $24.2 billion on space exploration. $22.2 billion on highway construction. and only $8.1 billion for all housing and urban renewal programs. and $1.25 billion for Federal housing subsidies. My bill provides for more housing subsidies. that the Government would contribute money to local housing authorities sufficient to lower public housing rents to a maximum of 25 percent of tenant income. This is merely a starting point. If we are successful in getting committee attention of this bill. I am hopeful they will go a step furtherapply their experience with housing legislation and pursue a total meaningful reform of public housing law. Expressing optimism on that point would be difficult in light of the ax being applied to appropriations of this sort. The Bureau of the Budget has made the most damaging recommendation of the past decade relating to support for education and libraries in America. The total allotted for all purposes for fiscal year 1970 to the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare Is $3.2 billion. or about 11/2 percent of the total Federal budget. That means 981/2 percent of the total Federal budget. Ask any American what service he would most desire his Government to provide and I believe most would say education. Our faith in education is truly one of the distinctions of this country. In America we have been taught that through education. anything Is possible for our children. Men are more concerned than ever that their children be given a better start. a better job. a better and more secure life. and they are believers in education and training toward that end. Now we have a government which upholds its responsibility for a common defense and ignores its responsibility for justice and domestic tranquillity. And in the Preamble to the Constitution the responsibility for establishing justice and insuring domestic tranquillity comes first. These misplaced priorities bring a severe blow to the pursuit of equal educational opportunity and quality. It is a sad commentary on this Nations social conscience that defense spending should equal $80 billion while health. education. and welfare spending totals only $3.2 billion. The President proceeds on the MIRV system at an estimated completed cost of $20 billion. The President is trading votes right and leftmore right than leftfor the ABM. That is another $20 billion down the drain-Americas biggest mistake. popular name for the ABM. We continually hear about honoring some vague commitment to the people of Vietnamand nothing about the specific commitments recorded in law to the citizens of this land. I can find no sense in this sort of honor to weapons and dishonor to human beings. I participated in the reading of Vietnam war dead names with the Quakers. In a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives I stated: The issues are clear. First. the rights of Americans to take a stand and to make known their views through both assembly and speech. and. second. the reason for standing on the steps of the Capitol. which was to protest the dying of American boys in a war which is unquestionably illegal and immoral. I object to the flagwaving which accompanies each escalation of American spending and Americans dying in Vietnam. The emphasis is tragically misplaced all around. The flag waves over the poor and over the hungry and over the black and over the Quakers. just as it waves over soldiers going into battle. It is quite evident that we will have to have our own flag over the next 3 yearsimplant it on our grounds and fight to hold it. Nothing short of our individual concern and involvement and awareness can prevent a total repression of minorities. The issues have been enumerated quite clearly in the decisions flowing forth from the White House. I urge your interest and your thoughtful analysis of your own responsibilities to yourself. your children. community. State. and Nation. and I hope you will join in the battle and help us wave the flag where it also fliesfor justice and for equality for all Americans. Racism must be removed from this land. The Federal Government can accelerate or impede this progress by its own policies and practices. Presently. the incidents of discrimination by this Government are flagrant abuses of responsible leadership. I include the following excerpts from publications in the RECORD as evidence of the concernand the very reason for concern for and by black citizens of this Nation:"},{"1":"9.003033e+08","2":"1968","3":"S","4":"MORSE","5":"937","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. I wish to speak briefly about a domestic crisis that has been created in this country in recent hours. The American people have just received a slap in the face from a hand in a glove of steel. After many months of heated debate. the American people. through their representatives in the Congress. imposed upon themselves a tax increase amounting to billions of dollars. In addition. they accepted the inevitability of cutbacks in Federal programs providing vital services to them and to the Nation. Why did we do these things? Is it because we like to pay higher taxes? Is it because we do not care if there are delays and cutbacks In the programs we believe America needs? That Is nonsense. We raised taxes and tightened our belts because Americas interests demanded such action. We did these things because we wanted to ward off inflation. We did these things to maintain world confidence in the strength of the dollar. We did these things so that we could continue to play our leadership role in the free world. At least those are the reasons that we gave. Now that the American people have swallowed this bitter pill. they have a right to expect other segments of our society to act just as responsibly and just as much in the public interest. Is that too much to- ask? Is that unreasonable? Apparently. as far as Bethlehem Steel Corp. Is concerned. the answer to those questions is Yes. Responsible action in the public interest Is too much to ask of this giant corporation. Bethlehem Steel Corp. yesterday announced what has been characterized as an acrosstheboard price increase of almost 5 percent on its steel mill products. This news must come as something of a shock to the average American who has just gotten a smaller paycheck because of the July 1 income tax increase. This action must. come as something of a shock to. the consumer who will have to pay more for steel products. out of a paycheck that is somewhat smaller. This action must come as something of a shock to our fighting men In Vietnam who are risking their lives because of Americas vital interest. It certainly came as a shock to me. If the price Increase . announced by Bethlehem Steel made some economic sense. it would still be. hard to accept In these difficult days. But it does not even make sense economically. For example: In the past several years there have been high gains in worker productivity. Between the first quarter 1966 and first quarter 1968labor costs per unit of output went up. less than 1.5 percent. while steel mill prices went up more than 3 percent. The new wage settlement in the steel industry certainly does not justify an acrosstheboard rise In prices of 5 percent. Productivity is rising. for one thing. And for another. labor costs make up only 40 percent of the total costs of the steel industry. In 1966. I was a member of a special commission appointed by the President of the United States. My colleague was exGovernor Collins of Florida. We were assigned. by the President. the responsibility to look into the steel industry in regard to both management and labor problems. and to report to him our recommendations for settlement of the steel dispute of that year. I must say. Mr. President. that I am satisfied that there is not the slightest economic justification in fact for what Bethlehem Steel did yesterday. Bethlehem Steel just reported first halfyear profits for 1968 of almost $100 million. This figure is 41 percent higher than last years firsthalf profits. The consequences on the Nations economy of the Bethlehem Steel action come close to being disastrous. Here are the reasons. First. an acrosstheboard increase of this magnitude threatens to destroy price stability. It is practically a blueprint for inflation. Second. a steel. increase like this would cripple our efforts to achieve equilibrium in our international balance of payments. Third. a major price increase would hurt the steel Industry itself by bringing about an increase in imports of cheaper foreign steel. It would also force other industries to turn. to. steel substitutes such. as. glass. aluminum. and plastics. The more one analyzes the situation objectively. the more difficult it becomes to justify the price. increase announced by Bethlehem Steel on any rational grounds. As President Johnson said yesterday afternoon: The Bethlehem price Increase is unreasonable and just should not be permitted to stand. I do not know what the motives of Bethlehem Steel were when it made the decision to raise prices- in this manner. I do not want to speculate. on the motives. either. But In all candor. I must say this: If ever there was an action which appeared to reflect an attitude of Damn the public interest. the Bethlehem price increase was such an action. As a private citizen. I. am outraged at the damage the price increase can. do to Americas domestic and. international interests. And I am giving voice today to my sense of outrage. But as a Senator. I feel an obligation to gobeyond mere words. I have an obligation to my constituents. to my State. and to my country. I do not believe that the Bethlehem Steel price increase can be allowed to go into effect without some appropriate. committee of the Senate examining the price increase in Its totality. We have investigated questions of far less national importance. We cannot. in conscience. ignore this threat to our domestic stability and our International posture. Therefore. Mr. President. I strongly recommend a Senate investigation of this inflationary actibn on. the part of Bethlehem Steel immediately."},{"1":"9.001163e+08","2":"1967","3":"S","4":"YARBOROUGH","5":"1520","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. President. I submit. for appropriate reference. a concurrent resolution calling for a U.S. initiative to convene a worldwide conference for the preservation of endangered species of wildlife. There are 250 species of wild animals whose continued existence on earth is currently in doubt. Many of these are among the most unique and valuable species we know: the blue whale. the giant panda. the orangutang. the leopard. the polar bear. the trumpeter swan. the bighorn sheep. the California condor. the Indian rhinoceros. the whooping crane. and hundreds of others. Man has already exterminated 250 species of wildlife. Should we not make an effort to stop him from destroying 200 more? Some of these endangered animals. such as the rhinoceros and the American alligator. are living chapters in the history of evolution. Others are essential links in the balance of nature or valuable sources of food and clothing. This Congress has acted to prevent many sorts of crimes. but how few criminal acts compare in scope with the eradication of an entire species of life? It would surely be negligent of this body of lawmakers. with the sure knowledge that this crime against nature. against life. against this earth and the creatures which inhabit it. is about to be committed. to take no action to prevent it. One action which we can take Is that indicated in this resolution. The problem of wildlife conservation is worldwide. and many of the threats to animals are connected with international trade. An international conference. preferably under the sponsorship of the United Nations. is the only way to make a comprehensive assault on mans destruction of his own heritage. No single nation can solve the problem. but all nations. by working together. can bring the situation under control. It is only fitting that the United States. which has finally realized the importance of conserving its own wildlife. should take the lead in saving the animals of the world from extinction. The threat facing wildlife today takes two main forms. Poaching of species whose fur or other parts is in sudden demand by the world of fashion. or which. like the rhinoceros horn. can find a constant market. is rapidly depleting the unfortunate animals in demand. Thus the fashion fad for fun furs has almost exterminated the leopard. the third largest cat in the Eastern Hemisphere. Furriers who can get over a thousand dollars for a pelt in New York are not usually scrupulous in determining whether the animal was a victim of poachers or taken legally. With demand rising. the chances are that it is poached. For the leopard. this meant either slowly bleeding to death with a trap wire cutting into his foot. slow impalement in a spiked pit. or if he is lucky a quick bullet. For the poacher. the man who hires the natives to kill. it can mean an income of $50.000 a year. To mankind. it means the gradual disappearance of a unique. beautiful. and valuable form of life. So great is the concern over this problem that the Secretary of State has directed overseas posts to gather information on and maintain a surveillance over the trade in spotted cats. The socalled legal killings of leopards. to satisfy the vanity of a few people for a leopard skin. added to poaching killings. is eliminating leopards from the earth. The other form taken by the threat to animal life is the progress of man himself. as he expands his agricultural and pastoral range into what previously was wilderness. This is particularly true in Africa. which harbors most of the threatened species. Conditions become intolerable for wildlife living there. their range contracts. and their numbers dwindle. The tragedy of this attack upon wildlife is that it is frequently unnecessary and wasteful. Often wildlife can be more productive than cattle. and wilderness less subject to erosion than cleared areas. What seems like progress is often its opposite. We do not have to halt the advance of civilization to preserve wildlife. but we do have to teach man how most productively to progress. There are no immediate answers to the threats facing wildlife. but it is my hope that a conference such as that called for by this resolution could begin to find them. The resolution proposes that the conference consider measures in three principal categories: First. international trade in wild animals and wildlife products must be brought under control. Much of the illicit exploitations of endangered species would be drastically reduced if the line between the poacher and the wholesaler could be pinched off. The demand for horn. ivory. skins. pelts. and other products far exceed the legal limits on taking them. and this provides an incentive to poachers which ought to be eliminated. It would do no good. however. to put import or export restrictions in only one country. These have to be worldwide. and to be enforced. for them to be effective in ending this terrible slaughter of wildlife. Second. the vital economic importance and use of wild animals can be explored by this conference. Even more than poaching. mans expansion into wildlife habitats threatens their continued existence. The new settlers regard the wild animals of Africa as a threat to themselves and their crops. Wildlife is seen as an obstacle to progress in Africa. In reality. this is not so. In a continent starved for protein. game animals can provide the major source of meat. The carcasses of animals such as antelopes contain more meat than most common range cattle. they mature faster. and a given range can support more of them. Experiments in South Africa indicate that it is more profitable to promote the growth of wild herds and cropping of the resulting surplus than to raise cattle. One square mile of east African savannah can support 16.000 pounds of cattle. The same area can support 66.000 to 90.000 pounds of wildlife. because the different species of wildlife graze grass. shrubs. or tree leaves. at different levels above the ground. A program of education is necessary. not only to teach the techniques of game ranching. but to overcome a social system. prevalent in east Africa. which counts wealth and social prestige in terms of numbers of cattle. however little meat is on their bones. The problem is large and complex. but the return potential is enormous. once a conference begins to determine what specific steps are needed. The economic uses of wildlife are not exclusively agricultural however. The legitimate export of such articles as hides can be a major source of income as long as steps are taken to insure that the supply is safeguarded. And in countries where tourism is a major source of income. animals which attract visits by tourists should not be wantonly destroyed. Third. the conference should explore ways of helping developing countries to undertake conservation programs of their own. The conference should consider both conservation programs which might profitably be undertaken by the developing countries. and forms of increasing assistance from the United Nations and the developed countries to them for this purpose. It will be fruitless to cut off trade in illegally obtained wildlife if the countries from which it comes cannot conserve it adequately to keep it alive. These programs might take the form of game reserves. stricter game laws and better enforcement of them. wildlife conservation specialists. The Interior Department Is now engaged in preliminary planning for a conference of this nature which they hope will be held in 1970. The Department considers that favorable action by the Senate on this resolution would materially help them in arranging the conference. This is no recent or newfound interest for me. I have introduced similar resolutions in the 88th Congress. Senate Concurrent Resolution 60 on October 3. 1963. and in the 89th Congress. Senate Concurrent Resolution 52 on August 23. 1965. Congressman HENRY REUSS of Wisconsin has sponsored similar legislation in the House of Representatives. In the last Congress. the proposal was endorsed by Secretary Udall and was supported by the Fish and Wildlife Commission and by the Department of State. The problem has not abated in these years of delay. and it will only grow more serious in the future. Another species. or several. will perhaps have been irretrievably lost in the delay. Mr. President. action by the Senate is urgent. This is no mere sentimental question. there are hard economic reasons for conservation. There are even more pressing moral ones. The wildlife which remains to us is not ours. We hold it in trust for the future. We can make or repeal a law. but we cannot bring back an extinct species. We cannot by act of Congress retrieve and restore the passenger pigeon in the skies. the Carolina parakeet to the Southern forests. or the great auk to our eastern seashores. They are gone forever. Let us not be the exterminators of additional species of natures heritage to the earth. Man has. and has shown. an infinite capacity for destruction. Let us make this one effort to show that he is also capable of preservation. I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution be printed in full at this point in the RECORD."},{"1":"8.902350e+08","2":"1966","3":"H","4":"SPRINGER","5":"479","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. this bill provides an acrosstheboard salary increase averaging 2.9 percent for postal workers and other Federal employees. This is a very modest pay boost considering the rise in the cost of living that has occurred since the last Federal salary increase in October 1965. The Congress in 1962 pledged that Federal salary rates shall be comparable with those paid by private enterprise for the same levels of work. President Johnson strongly affirmed this principle of comparability when. in a message to Congress on May 12. 1965. he declared: We do not have two standards of what makes a good employer in the United States: One standard for private enterprise and another for the Government. A double standard which puts the Government employee at a comparative disadvantage is shortsighted. In the long run. it costs more. Yet. despite the increases voted last year and in the bill we are considering today. the salaries paid to Federal employees continue to lag behind the rates paid for comparable work in private industry. My colleagues will recall that last year the original House bill provided for a 4percent firststep increase effective in 1965 and a secondstep adjustment to become effective a year later. The amount of the secondstep adjustment was to be determined according to a special formula designed to bring Federal employees salaries into closer relationship with those paid in private industry. However. the Senate reduced the 1965 increase from 4 to 3.6 percent and eliminated the 1966 secondstage increase altogether. The reason given last year for reducing the increase voted by the House is the same reason given this year for not making a greater effort to close the gap between the salaries of Government employees and their counterparts in private industry: the threat of a Presidential veto if the increase exceeds the administration wageprice guidelines. The Consumer Price Index was 110.4 in October 1965. Within 6 months the index jumped 1.9 percent to 112.5. So the purchasing power of the 2.9percent increase we are voting today is actually only about 1 percent. minus Federal. State. and local taxes. civil service retirement deductions. and life insurance premiums. I do not intend to be critical of either our own Post Office and Civil Service Committee or the corresponding committee of the other body. They have both been as generous toward the Federal employee as could reasonably be expected of them in view of the wage guidelines which the administration appears to be applying more rigidly to Federal employees than to those who can bargain collectively with private employers. The fringe benefit features of the final version of H.R. 14122including more liberal retirement provisions. increased Government contribution to the cost of health insurance. overtime pay and increased annuities for certain overtime pay and certain annuity increasesbring the cost to slightly more than the administrations wage guidepost figure. To do less. as the Senate committees report so well concludes. would be to do practically nothing at all."},{"1":"8.900342e+08","2":"1965","3":"H","4":"TEAGUE","5":"101","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker.

One of the most ridiculous provisions of this act is to provide salary increases for Members of Congress in the amount of $10.000. This is sheer hypocrisy. We have promised the American people that this Government will cut expenditures. Many pious pleas were made on this floor advocating the tax cut. but at the same time. stating that expenditures must be held down to make the tax cut an effective one. What is to become of those promises now? Were they mere Idle words to lull the American voter into a false sense of security? To say the least. raising congressional salaries by 44 percent is breaking faith with the American taxpayer. This is certainly an unwarranted and unconscionable increase. and represents fiscal irresponsibility at its worst. The average American wage and salary earner has an annual income of $5.000. and to increase congressional salaries by twice that annual wage is blasphemous. What about the poor social security pensioner who is expected to live on a monthly stipend of $73? My office is constantly flooded with mail from these people asking for a modest increase. yet. we fail to heed their requests. and now we propose to increase our own salary by 44 percent. Who do we think we are kidding? The postal employees and classified civil service employees were promised an increase in 1962. after a comparability study. That study indicates they are entitled to a raise. and I support that part of the bill. But. to raise the executive branch. judicial branch. and legislative offices by such ridiculous sums. I cannot stomach. I fail to comprehend the logic of Congress in advocating economy and tax reduction and encouraging labor and industry to hold the line on wages and prices. on the one hand. then with the other. raise the salaries of elected and appointed Federal officials by such an excessive amount.

We seem to be getting news of a good many pilot projects these days. The Kennedys Federal service corps for youth is a going thing under a pilot organization without any congressional authorization. Many spending proposals are squeezed through this Congress as small experimental or pilot plans. only to balloon to gigantic proportions in later years. And the United Nations is active in pilot projects. also. A number of these are in Communist nations both under and outside of the muchlamented Special Fund. It is a United Nations pilot project in a Red nation which brings me before the House today. An airplane pilot project. Gentlemen. it is with deep regret and dismay that I inform the House that the taxpayers of America. through their subsidization of the United Nations. are scheduled to pay to teach Communist Cubans to learn to fly airplanes. Indeed. we already have paid. so that Cubans and Yugoslavs could learn about aircraft operations and maintenance. In a small project. probably designed to get a U.N. boot in the door. the United Nations through its International Civil Aviation Organization has programed a $17.280 grant to Castro Cuba that not only could send 12 Cuban officials to flying school. but also could instruct them in meteorology. air traffic control. and maintenance of radios. aircraft. and engines. Just as in its plan to give agricultural aid to Cuba. the United Nations once again is working in direct opposition to whatever foreign policy we should have in the United States. and against the best interests of the Latin American Republics. Yet. it is only with the continued massive financial support of the American taxpayers that the United Nations is able to remain solvent. Here again is that 40 percent we contribute to the Special Fund. Under the proposed U.N. project the Cuban officials would be trained at the Mexico City Training Center of the International Civil Aviation Organization. That schoolwhich came under Special Fund support in July 1961trained some 300 students from Latin America in the 196162 period. It teaches meteorology. air traffic control. radio. aircraft and engine maintenance. and flight operations. The aircraft used in training are the Piper Apache. Cessna 172. DC3 and Hiller helicopter. May I point out to this House that as a member of the Committee on Armed Services. I am well aware of the uses of these aircraft in military operations. and it matters not to their military effectiveness whether the pilots and mechanics and air controllers were trained on planes configured for civilian operations. The Piper. Cessna and Hiller models are light aircraft that can be used for battlefield transport. for observation and for artillery fire direction. as our advisers in South Vietnam have so well proved. The oldfaithful DC3. of course. can and has done dozens of military jobs in past years including cargo and troop transport operations and the dropping of paratroops. Need I point out to this House that just a few weeks ago two airplanes from Cuba fired upon an unarmed American shrimp boat? Can there be any question but that training of Castro Cubans in flying operations does benefit Cuba in a military sense? Who will say that a Cuban trained in air traffic control. in interpretation and prediction of the weather. in aircraft engine repair. or in radio maintenance will not be a valuable addition as a trooper and as an instructor in Fidel Castros Red armed force. which if it never attacks the United States is alreadytodayattacking in a bitsandpieces assault. the nations of Latin America? The United Nations has seen fit to help Castro do this. The Latin American nations have not yet protested. perhaps due to our faulting leadership. The American taxpayers are to help pay for it. Mr. Speaker. this cannot be allowed to continue. This still is a small program. But the principle is intolerable to Americans. We will not. we must not. pay to train our enemies. In the period 196162 this same program was operated on a smaller scale by the United Nations. Training of six Cubans was programed at that time. Luckily for the United States only a small portion of the granted money was spent. and the U.S. State Department feels that few. if any. Cubans already have benefited from the program. But we may not be so lucky in the 196364 period. Castro is not stupid enough to turn down a chance to train key young men in aircraft techniques that lend themselves well to his guerrilla operations in Latin Americaand all for free. The U.S.S.R.. as we know. runs Cuba. Russia must be getting a big kick out of the things communism is getting Americans to pay for. under the United Nations. I also find that Communist Yugoslaviawhich seems to get continuing preferential treatment from the U.N.. and from our own State Department. was provided under the ICAO program in 196162 three aircraft maintenance instructors and one pilot instructor. What these U.N. instructors did in Yugoslavia is revealed by this quotation from the 1962 annual report of the ICAO to the U.N. General Assembly: They spent 2 months in Yugoslavia early in the year to assist in setting up maintenance procedures for the aircraft of Soviet manufacture operated by the national airline and in the selection of personnel to undergo further rtaining in the"},{"1":"8.702091e+08","2":"1962","3":"H","4":"CHURCH","5":"3007","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. no one in this House has higher respect for the Ways and Means Committee than has been mine during the entire 12 years that I have been a Member of the Congress. No Member of the House. moreover. so merits my admiration and respect as the present chairman of that great committee. No words that I shall speak today should be interpreted as an attack upon that committee. What I would and do attack is the continued idiotic refusal of the Congress itself to realize this unchallengeable truththat the only way to protect the fiscal solvency of this country and the most immediate way to insure the respect of the world for our continued sound economic and fiscal development is not to continue borrowing. but to stop spending. The argument and plea presented so urgently by the members of the Ways and Means Committee. namely. that the only way to resist national bankruptcy and deterioration of our fiscal position in the eyes of the world is to permit more public borrowing. in my case falls on deaf ears. I belong to that simple group within the Congress that feels that in national. as in private. spending. the only way to resist bankruptcy is to stop spending. Had any Member of this Congress. during recent years. conducted his private affairs with the abandon and reckless extravagance with which Federal moneys have been voted and spent. he would long ago have fallen into personal bankruptcy. He would. indeed. have laid himself open to a charge not only of lack of prudence but complete lack of commonsense. I have said that the argument that an increase in the debt limit is the only way to avoid national bankruptcy and discredit falls. in my case. on deaf ears. It does so. Mr. Chairman. because it is the same argument that I have heard advanced since 1953 every time that the extravagant appropriations by the Congress have led to a request for an increase in the debt limit. My association with this Congressalthough not a memberbegan in January of 1935. At the end of 1934. the entire Federal debt of this country was $27.053 million. When I became a Member of Congress in my own right in January 1951. the Federal debt had increased to $257.357 million at the close of 1950. And during the intervening years. between 1951 and 1962. time and time again the Ways and Means Committee has been forced to bring to this Congress requests for temporary or permanent increases which would allow the United States to pay for the expenditures which this body had voted. It is interesting to note that the argument of necessity. in order that bills might be paid. has been the plea on which each time the request has been made. It was in 1953 that I was asked for the first time to vote for an increase in the national debt ceiling in order to meet our obligations. The permanent ceiling then was $275 billion. The then chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means. the beloved Member from New York. Mr. Daniel Reed. made an appeal that almost convinced me. Said Chairman Reed: It is a painful. though necessary. task which confronts this House today. It is a task which is particularly distasteful to me. Never once have I yielded in my fight to cut Government spending. Never once have I yielded In my fight to reduce the crushing burden of taxation on our people. Time and again. year after year. I have stood before this House and warned that the path we were following was the path to national bankruptcy. These warnings have not been heeded. We have preferred. Mr. Chairman. to countenance waste and extravagance in our Government operations. We have preferred to take the money earned by the sweat of our own people and squander it recklessly abroad. As a result. I stand before you todaycompelled by the bitter necessities of our present situation to ask this House to support legislation raising the statutory debt limit by $15 billion. The House. without my vote. did pass a permanent increase of $15 billion. later changed through action in the Senate in the next session and conference. to a temporary increase of $6 billion. My decision to resist the plea at that time was basedas is similar resistance todayI repeat. Mr. Chairman. on my conviction that the only way to save the solvency of this country is to stop unnecessary Government spending. The argument to save our solvency by raising the debt limit. however. has remained the same. On June 27. 1955. when the motion was made to extend for 1 year the temporary increase of $6 billion. the gentleman from Tennessee. chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Cooper. said: We must remember that it is the Congress itself which has the final sayso in the amount of money which the Government is authorized to spend. and once expenditures have been authorized and commitments have been made. it is the obligation of the Congress to protect the fiscal integrity of the Government. The warning had no effect. Profligate spending continued and increased. On June 21. 1956. Chairman Cooper again besought the House to support a temporary increase of $3 billion in these words: While I am concerned about the recessity for continuing a temporary increase in the publicdebt limit. I am glad to note that the request this year is for a $3 billion increase which is onehalf of the increase found necessary in the two previous fiscal years. As I pointed out to the House last year when we were considering this subject. it is the Congress itself which has the final sayso in the amount of money which the Government is authorized to spend. and once expenditures have been authorized and commitments have been made. it is the obligation of the Congress to protect the fiscal integrity of the Government. Again the warning to cut spending went unheeded. On January 21. 1958. when the request for a temporary increase of $5 billion was before the House. the gentleman from Arkansas . the present respected chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. said: First of all. let me tell you that when the gentleman from New York. Mr. Reed. and I introduced the bills here in question. following the request from the Secretary of the Treasury that we do so. we said that we introduced the proposed legislation reluctantly because we share the thought of most Members and we do not like the facts and realities which put us in the position of believing that we cannot get by in the discharge of our responsibilities under a debt ceiling of $275 billion. but we must recognize them for what they are. I am not here because I like this thing. The gentleman from New York. Mr. Reed. does not like it. We said at the time we introduced the bill together that we did not like this. but we wanted it clearly understood that so far as we personally were concerned this was no indication of any lessening of our personal desire that we economize in Government spending in every way we can economize. Again the warning to cut spending was not heeded by the Congress. On August 5. 1958. seeking an increase in the permanent debt ceiling and also a temporary increase. Chairman MILLS spoke even more strongly: Mr. Chairman. the bill itself poses a serious matter. one that we do not like. and places the Ways and Means Committee in a position that the committee certainly would prefer not to be in. The chairman of that committee does not look with rellsh upon this responsibility. I am just as concerned. if not more so. Mr. Chairman. about the American people destroying our way of life and all those things which we have inherited from the past as I am about those things being destroyed by forces without the United States. Mr. Chairman. when we are in a period such as the present. I think it is incumbent upon all of usnot only the Members of Congress. but every man. woman. and child in the United Statesto develop a degree of statesmanship with respect to our attitude about Government spending and fiscal responsibility that we have not yet attained in the history of the United States. I am not saying that. Mr. Chairman. because I am so concerned about the immediate situation. but because I am concerned about the trends of the immediate situaticn. The Secretary of the Treasury told us very frankly in the course of the hearings that this entire matter of the debt ceiling would have to be again reviewed by the Congress next year. and as we start another fiscal year. 1960. What will that type of Federal spending and the deficits that it contemplates do to this economy? What will that rate of spending do to this economy? I do not know for certain. I have some ideas. It could let loose inflationary pressures that in turn will be emulated by business and labor. The result could be that during the course of the next several years we will see rises in prices such as we have not seen in peacetime. Mr. Chairman. in view of the gravity of the problems with which we are dealing today. I hope that there will be a development of a degree of statesmanship and reality on the part of every man and woman in all walks of life. I hope that they will not continue to believe that that man or woman who merely asks for their support on the basis of getting more and more from the Federal Treasury will in the end do them the service that the request purports to do. Again the warning to cut spending was not heeded by the Congress. On June 19. 1959. with a permanent ceiling of $283 billion. Chairman MILLS again reminded: We are now in the process of paying the piper for what has already happened. good or bad. Again the Congress did not heed the warning. On June 8. 1960. seeking the extension for 1 year of $8 billion of the temporary increase. Chairman MILLS again warned: Let me make it eminently clear. Mr. Chairman. in reporting this bill and bringing it to the House with a favorable recommendation. the membership of the Committee on Ways and Means does not want to be put in the position where it is thought that we relish this task. Neither does the membership of the Committee on Ways and Means want to be interpreted in the process of making this recommendation as being unmindful of the fact that the people of the United States are becoming somewhat weary of the burdens of taxation. and I daresay somewhat weary of the causes back of those things that prompt this bill being reported to the House today for your consideration. Again the warning was not heeded. On June 26. 1961. when a temporary increase of $13 billion over the permanent ceiling of $285 billion was asked. Chairman MILLS made the following appeal for acceptance of fiscal responsibility by the Congress. an appeal that challenged every Member of this House to accept his own responsibility to put reason into our spending programs: The Congress. and this administration. and the previous administration. have all contributed in creating this debt. Some would have us look back and in our wisdom today say that we made a mistake last year. that we made a mistake in our actions so far this year. that we regret what the Appropriations Committee has done. we regret what the authorizing committees of the House have done. So now what are we going to do? Are we going to register a vote of protest about what we have already done? Do you want us to say to the President of the United States. Because our hindsight is so much better than our foresight in voting these authorizations and these appropriations. we have been unable to do the job that the Constitution of the United States imposes upon us. namely. to exercise some degree of control with respect to spending. you take the responsibility to cut where you think it ought to be cut to the extent of $10 billion. I do not think the Congress wants to abdicate this responsibility. I do not think the Congress ought to abdicate this responsibility. I think the gentlemen who are chairmen of all of the committees must take some responsibility themselves to operate within the limitations of what revenues can be produced under our tax system and decide ahead of time what spending levels in this country we want. Yes. I would like to see reductions made. but I do not want them made on a helterskelter basis by somebody downtown. I want the Congress of the United States. if it feels so concerned today. to take action in the remaining days of this session to reevaluate these old programs. to reevaluate new programs. and take such action as the Congress of the United States should take under the Constitution to determine what it wants to do and not leave to somebody else that which is our constitutional responsibility. On February 20. 1962. in seeking an Increase in the temporary ceiling to $15 billion until June 30. 1962. Chairman MILLS pinpointed the fact that it is congressional authorization and appropriation which has played the major part in causing the deficits on which the requests for increases in the public debt ceiling are based. He stated: We talk in terms of the size of the debt. yes. I do not like the fact that we have to come in here because the size of the debt has increased. increased since June 1961. by an additional deficit of almost $4 billion over what we then predicted. I do not like that any more than you like it. The fact is before us. however. that there is a deficit now contemplated for this fiscal year of $7 billion instead of $3.7 billion which was the deficit we had before us as an estimate when we asked you to grant this temporary authority of $13 billion in June 1961. Mr. Chairman. now what constitutes that change? Three billion dollars of it occurred as a result of what developed after this debt ceiling was passed last Junearising from the issues involved in the Berlin situation and our speeding up in trying to face that problem. That accounts for $3 billion of it. In addition to that. it developed that the Department of Agriculture. primarily through the Commodity Credit Corporation. had to have $737 million more than was estimated it would need in June due to better crops than anticipated. There was an increase in the spending of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of $250 million. and an increase in the Atomic Energy Commission of $160 million since our estimates of June last year. There were some reductions. but the total adds up to these figures. largely from these operations that I have given you with reference to these particular increases. Mr. Chairman. did we as a majority voting in the Houseyes. upon the request of the administrationprovide for a speedup in our military posture of $3 billion? Of course we did without a dissenting vote. We had no control in this Congress over this additional estimate for the Commodity Credit Corporation of the Department of Agriculture. but by a majority vote we provided for that situation. We had no control over this $300 million of additional interest required to finance the public debt. It was due in part to an increase in the rate of interest. It was due in part to an increase in the size of the debt. We provided the additional money for the Space Administration. We provided the additional money for the Atomic Energy Commission. We thought it was the proper thing to do. I ask you now. regardless what the picture looks like. no matter how we may abhor the overall result. if it is not good commonsense to permit the Secretary of the Treasury to finance this in the most economical way possible to him. That is all we are asking. to provide him the tools to do that job. Mr. Chairman. the first time that I heard this appeal to protect the fiscal integrity of the country. I was almost persuaded. I recognized the immediate basic situation. I had. furthermore. great respectas I do todayfor the Members who have been forced to make that plea. In the years that have intervened. however. there has been no cessation of spending and no indication. in fact. that the Congress realizes the necessity for economy. Even the most cogent warnings by the Ways and Means Committee. reiterated year by year. have made no imprint. It would. of course. be a shock to have the debt limit revert to the present permanent ceiling of $285 billion. as we have been told would happen if this bill does not pass. Disruption of payments would undoubtedly occur. Nevertheless. Mr. Chairman. such strong reaction might be the shock needed to put congressional spending. at long last. on a sound basis. The Congress might even see the necessity for taking steps. in prosperous years. to reduce what is already owed. Shock treatment has been proved to produce success. as a last resort. in parallel situations. The current fear gripping the country and already showing signs of provoking economic and financial crises at home and in our world position is not based on apprehension that we may not vote to increase the debt limit or on concern that we may not be able to make a suitable financial accounting. The confidence in the dollar. at home and abroad. has been shaken by the runaway spending program which the Congress appears to have neither the wit nor the will to end. Once again. Mr. Chairmanas always in the pastI shall vote against the proposed temporary increase as the only means that I can find to express my own protest against the continued reckless spending of the Congress. My vote reflects my deepseated fear that neither might nor power nor any other means can save this country unless we reverse the present pattern of fiscal irresponsibility."},{"1":"8.700543e+08","2":"1961","3":"S","4":"JOHNSTON","5":"1347","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Madam President. Federal aid to education is a subject we have been discussing and have had under consideration for many years in the United States. I remember that in 1937. 24 years ago. at the Governors conference in Atlantic City. I was assigned to lead the discussion on the question of Federal aid to education. I recall very distinctly that at that time every Governor was in favor of Federal aid to education. provided controls were left entirely within the States. I think if the Governors of the United States today could be assured the control over schools under Federal aid to education would be left in the States. they would be almost unanimous in support of it. All of the letters I get which oppose Federal aid to education base the opposition upon the fear that the Federal Government will take over control of the schools within the States. What would the amendment do? Many Senators say. This is already protected. Let us read the section in the bill and the amendment. Section 103 reads as follows: In the administration of this title. no department. agency. officer. or employee of the United States shall exercise any direction. supervision. or control over the policy determination. personnel. curriculum. program of instruction. or the administration or operation of any school or school system. It would seem that such language would tie it down to a certain extent. but nothing is said in regard to withholding of funds. The only thing we would do is strike out the period and add the words or withhold any funds authorized under this act. from any State educational agency which is in compliance with the provisions of this act. In my judgment that language would tie it down. and no funds could be withheld. provided the provisions of the bill were carried out. The President of the United States of America has declared that he has no intention of exercising control of any form over the schools. He stated in his message to the Congress of the United States on Monday. February 20. 1961. that education must remain a matter of State and local control and higher education a matter of individual preference. I do not think any Member of this august body would disagree with that statement. I do not think there is a Senator who could not applaud this statement. From the testimony before the House Committee on Education and Labor. Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare Abraham Ribicoff stated virtually the same thing. In answer to a question by one of the committee members he said: It is my feeling that there is so deep in the American philosophy the feeling that the States and localities should be in control of education that this is now and always will be an overwhelming factor and the Federal Government never flies in the face of overwhelming opinion and in the face of public philosophy. This is the philosophy. In addition. Secretary Ribicoff wrote the distinguished Senator from Vermont . a letter which apMay 22. 1961. on page 8522. as follows: We have a telephone inquiry from your office on the question whether under the school assistance act of 1961. proposed by the administration and introduced as title I of S. 1021. the Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare or the Commissioner of Education could withhold funds from any State because of segregation in schools within that State. In my opinion. neither the Secretary nor the Commissioner would have such authority. Mr. President. I could not agree more with the statements of Secretary Ribicoff. But this is the opinion of Secretary Ribicoff. who may not be Secretary of Health. Education. and Welfare for the life of this act. which is for 3 years. Some subsequent Secreary could have a different opinion and. therefore. the Senator from Georgia and I have offered this amendment to confirm. uphold. and spell out for the future the opinions of the present administration. We are all in agreement that funds could not be withheld. and that no officer. agency. or other instrument of the Federal Government can interfere with the use of these funds on the local State level. So there should be no objection to this amendment. The bill itself in section 103 attempts to incorporate this philosophy that the State and local governments alone should exercise control over the schools. However. while section 103 precludes control by any Federal officer. there is no provision that funds shall not be withheld from participating schools at the whim of administrators. Many Members of this body think section 103 would preclude an administrator from withholding funds since that is a very effective way of controlling policy. and section 103 does attempt to preclude Federal control. However. other Members of this body do not feel so sure that this section would preclude withholding of funds. All of us know that withholding of funds as a practical matter is one of the most effective ways of exercising control over our school system. The distinguished Senator from Oregon on May 22 stated to this body that under the provisions of the bill. no Federal funds can be withheld from segregated schools. The Senator from Oregon made this statement in response to an inquiry from the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania and went so far as to specify. not from public schools in the South. This should justify even more the attachment of the TalmadgeJohnston amendment to this bill to avoid any confusion or misconceptions in the future as to the intent of Congress. Since this body strongly desires to see the control of our schools remain in the hands of our State and local governments. then I see absolutely no reason why this amendment should not be adopted. The amendment clarifies that this form of control shall not be utilized. As has already been pointed out on the floor of the Senate. this amendment is only an additional guarantee that there will be no Federal control. As I have already stated the overwhelming feeling of this body is that there shall be no Federal control over our school system. Consequently. as I have just stated. there is no valid reason why this amendment should not be adopted. While there is no valid reason why this amendment should not be passed. I regret to say that many people think it cannot pass merely because it is being introduced and cosponsored by southerners. It would be a disgrace to the American democratic form of government if the U.S. Senate were to defeat this amendment solely on the prejudicial basis that it was offered by southern Senators. I can think of nothing more tragic than the picture of the U.S. Government blackmailing local school boards by denying funds for education to little schoolchildren because of some bureaucratic ruling. To prevent such an insidious form of Federal control from ever rearing its ugly head. I earnestly solicit the passage of this amendment for the good of all 50 of our great States. and their schools. I believe in education. I realize that we need better education in the United States. I feel that the Federal Government. if properly regulated. ought to help the schools of our Nation. The only thing I fear is Federal control of our school system. If the amendment is agreed to. I shall vote for the bill. But if the amendment is not agreed to. I do not see how I can vote for the bill. because a guarantee would not be put into the bill prohibiting the withholding of funds. Such withholding of funds is the most powerful way of enforcing their way of thinking available to the Federal Government. I hope the Senate will agree to the amendment in order that we may be able to do what we know is needed. The salaries of teachers need to be increased. and I fear that a great many States are not in a position to tax their people additionally without placing a great burden upon themselves to do so. The same point is evident with respect to school construction throughout the Nation. I hope the amendment will pass."},{"1":"8.602197e+08","2":"1960","3":"H","4":"RIEHLMAN","5":"498","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. serious inequities in this legislation become readily apparent when one considers the effect it will have on the number of industrial areas in this country having records of substantial employment. The Syracuse. N.Y.. industrial area. which is composed of Onondaga. Madison. and Oswego Counties. has not been and is not presently eligible for assistance under the provisions of this bill. Yet the people of the Syracuse area would be compelled to pay taxes that would provide the funds for this program and at the same time. due to the convenient absence of antipirating provisi6ns from the bill. would be faced with the possibility of losing precious industry to an area that had received financial assistance under the bill. I am sure most of the people back in Onondaga County would recognize the necessity for a modest loan program. not to finance the pirating of existing industries from established areas. but to foster the development of new industries and to provide for creation of new jobs in our chronically depressed areas. I wholeheartedly concur in the objectives recommended by the Secretary of Commerce. who said that new jobs should be created in distressed communities rather than being transferred from another area. We are willing to contribute tax dollars to help erase unemployment and poverty in the areas that have lost. through no fault of their own. most or all of their economic base. Is that not enough? Is it necessary in addition that we put our own industry on the auction block and give other areas the money to woo it away from us? Let us be realistic. There is keen competition for industry in this country. Any industrial establishment. no matter how small. is of vital importance to a community. It is not enough that we lose industry because of the competition of imports from lowlaborcost countries. We are now asked to help other communities finance their efforts to lure our industry away. Well. that is too much to ask. I would like to ask my colleagues from the highemployment areas around the country who support this bill what they are going to tell the people they represent when they see their own industry on the move to federally subsidized. depressed areas. Will you tell the family man who finds himself without a paycheck that everything is all right? Will you say that his loss of a job is in the best interests of the community and the country? It will be interesting to hear your justification for support of this bill. I submit that a man out of work is. simply and tragically. a man out of work regardless of the industrial area he happens to call home. and I refuse to support a measure that could bring any additional unemployment to my district. It is my firm conviction that a vote on my part for S. 722 would be a vote against the best interests of every man. woman. and child in my district."},{"1":"8.600780e+08","2":"1959","3":"S","4":"SALTONSTALL","5":"927","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. as the Senator from Colorado [Mr. ALLOTTI has stated and as other Senators have stated. I have been disturbed by the amounts of money provided by the bill over and above the budget estimates for medical research. to be made available for research in cancer. heart. and other dread diseases. This process has been going on during the term of office of President Truman and. more recently. during the past 6 years under President Eisenhower. We want to encourage research in these dread diseases. The question is whether the amount is sufficient and. secondly. whether it is being efficiently spent. I wish to put into the RECORD. because I believe it will help to make it clear. an understanding we had in the Committee on Appropriations with regard to the amounts we voted yesterday for research. The resolution was unanimously adopted. It reads: Whereas the Committee on Appropriations annually makes available substantial sums for research in the dread diseases. and whereas the committee believes wholeheartedly from the hearings it has held on these important problems that progress is being made and further believes that a careful study by experts will be helpful in its future determinations in order to make certain that the committees decisions are made in the best interests of the eventual cure or prevention of these diseases: Now. therefore. be it Resolved. That the subcommittee with funds available to the committee for investigations organize a group of specialists and others to determine whether the funds provided by the Government for research in dread diseases are sufficient and efficiently spent in the best interests of the research for which they are designated. said subcommittee shall take into account the facilities. the experts. the laboratories. the availability of private funds and all other factors including the possible impact which the recruitment of those engaged in research enter into such a study of research efforts. The Subcommittee on Appropriations for the Departments of Labor and Health. Education. and Welfare shall make its report to the Committee on Appropriations on or before February 1. 1960. As I am sure the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee will agree. if the study provided for is made objectively. it will be very helpful to the subcommittee and it will be very helpful to the Congress as a whole. and bring about a greater knowledge as to how these funds are spent. whether they are enough or whether they are too much. or whether they are being wisely and efficiently spent for research in these dread diseases. It is with that motive that the committee adopted the resolution. and it was with the understanding that the resolve would be executed and would be put into effect that the committee voted very substantial increases over the budget estimate. which it did yesterday. I wished to get this matter into the RECORD in the course of the debate on the pending appropriation bill. for the reason that it had a great deal of influence on my vote. and I am sure also on the votes of some of the other members of the committee. Mr. President. I turn briefly to another subject and make a brief statement. and then I shall ask the chairman of the subcommittee a question. It is my understanding that In the bill there is contained. in connection with research efforts. an appropriation to take care of an overhead expense of 25 percent. The House adopted the figure of 15 percent as a limitation. and the Senate raised it to 25 percent. This becomes a very important matter. particularly as it affects private hospitals which wish to do medical research for the good of all our people. I quote two sentences from a letter which I received from Gen. Robert Cutler. who is chairman of the board of the Peter Bent Bingham Hospital in Boston. He states: In 1946. the share of the continuing (bard money) income of the Harvard Medical School which had to be used to pay for unreimbursed indirect expense related to medical research projects was 3.5 percent. In every subsequent year but one. this percentage increased. In 1957. this percentage had reached up to 21.6 percent. Thus at the present time. nearly onefourth of the medical schools continuing income must be siphoned away from the other important aspects of the medical schools work to the payment of unreimbursed overhead expense related to medical research projects. I believe that states the case. On June 20. 1958. when the bill was considered volume 104. part 9. page 11876. there appears. during my colloquy with the Senator from Alabama. this statement by me: The armed services use the socalled Mills formula in regard to indirect expenses incurred by educational institutions in connection with the performance of research. They allow approximately 25 percent. In addition. Lybrand. Ross & Montgomery. a very careful and thorough accounting firm. as the Senator from Alabama knows. made an elaborate cost study at the Harvard Medical School. and determined that the average overhead cost for research projects is between 30 and 40 percent. What the percentage actually may be in the Harvard Medical School may be one thing. what the percentage may be in other hospitals and other medical schools may be another. The two figures may be different. However. certainly the 25percent limitation put in the bill by the Senate should be maintained in conference. otherwise. we shall be handicapping the necessary research for the good of all. I ask the Senator from Alabama if I am correct in stating that there is a 25percent limitation in the bill. I hope that the Senator will do his utmost to maintain it."},{"1":"8.502768e+08","2":"1958","3":"H","4":"RHODES","5":"204","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman.

The editorial justifiably demands that action on these needed revisions be expedited. so that the proposal will not die in committee. As a sponsor of remedial measures in both sessions.

The administration. understandably. does not exactly put it that way.- The President Instead says that our farmers are not now sharing in the general prosperity. Some of my Texas farm friends put it more directly: They say they have been Bensonized. Whatever it is called. Mr. President. it is there and it is unmistakable. Since January 1953. farm prices have fallen from 94 percent of parity to 82 percent of parity. Prices received for crops and livestock have dropped 14 percent. Net income of farmers has fallen from $14 billion in 1952 to $10.3 billion in 1955. The Secretary of Agriculture has reacted characteristically to these facts. At first it was denied that there was such a thing as a farm problem. It was said those who talk of a farm depression are misinformed. Then. after acknowledgment that such a situation exists. the trouble was said to have been inherited from the previous administration. Then it was blamed on surplus. on incentives. on labor unions. and then. incredibly. on the farmers themselves. It was suggested that perhaps there are just too many small farmers. that many of them are simply not operating efficiently. This. then. was the theory of natural selectiona sort of survival of the fittest code. * Mr. President. there are plenty of fit farmers and ranchers in Texas. and many of them are just barely surviving. A friend of mine writes from south Texas that 80 percent of the ranch people are not making operating expehsesthat all -hog raisers lost money in 1955. My friend in south Texas sends along these lines which are currently going the rounds of the country stores and gatepost sessions.. They say of the Benson farm program: A fake and a phoney. A failure and a fuss. A fraud on the farmer. And flexes only one way. And that one way. Mr. President. is down. Mr. President. we have before us a farm bill. which has been discussed for several days. Many Members of the Senate are anxious to vote on the bill.

I have been informed that consent will not b& given to vote on Monday or on Tuesday. However. I believe the record should show that on behalf of myself and the minority leader I am submitting a proposed unanimousconsent agreement that effective on Monday. March 5. the limitations on debate shall start to run. Therefore. on behalf of myself and the minority leader I submit a proposed unanimousconsent agreement. and I ask that the clerk be instructed to read it."},{"1":"8.400196e+08","2":"1955","3":"H","4":"McGREGOR","5":"259","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. today I introduced a bill to amend the Social Security Act to lower from 65 to 60 the age at which women may become entitled to benefits thereunder. I believe this bill to be an economic necessity for married. single. and widowed women. Two hundred and twentyone thousand and two hundred and fortytwo American women between 46 and 64 have applied for jobs in State employment offices. The married woman under 65 does not have enough to get along on even if her husband is receiving his benefits. If she becomes a widow before reaching the age of 65. she receives a lump sum of $255 from social security. The married and widowed woman is then put in the same position as the single women in this age bracket. She must seek employment. Look at any wantad section of any newspaper throughout the land. Very few employers are interested in women over 50. Yes. they must seek employment. but the bulk of women over 50 find the doors closed. Reducing the age to 60 at which women may become entitled to benefits will cost 1 percent of the payroll costs. Gentlemen. these are our American womenour mothers. sisters. wives. and daughters. Compared to the sums of moneys sent to help other women throughout the world. is 1 percent too much to ask? According to the questionnaire I sent to the 17th Ohio District. which I so proudly represent. 68 percent of my constituents favor lowering the age so that women receive benefits at 60. I hope and pray that my esteemed colleagues from the other 47 States will agree with our belief."},{"1":"8.301789e+08","2":"1954","3":"H","4":"CURTIS","5":"1691","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I hope that all Members of. the House will read Senator KNOWLANDS speech- to which it refers. appearing on pages 63536359 of the May 11. 1954. CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. and then reach their own conclusion on the fairness of the editorial and. more important still. on the fairness of the charge that the Eisenhower administration is not conducting a bipartisan approach to foreign policy. I wish to call attention to certain points appearing in the editorial and examine them brieflywe have heard them all from time to time on the floor from the lips of leaders of the Democratic Party. I quote: The country has heard more from highranking officials about bipartisanship in foreign policy since the situation in Indochina became critical than in the preceding 15 months of the Eisenhower administration. My comment: This is undoubtedly so for two reasons: First. Foreign affairs have reached a highly critical state since the Indochina situation became critical. Second. the administration was charged. beginning around this time. with not having a bipartisan approach. 16s spokesmen. of course. have been interested in setting the record straight publicly. I quote: The trouble is there has been little if any implementation of the Presidents (expressed) sentiments (about wanting a bipartisan foreign policy). My comment: Let us look at the record. it is set out clearly in detail on pages 6355. 6356. 6357 of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of May 11. 1954. A recapitulation of this detail shows that since January 20. 1953. up to May 11. 1954. the following bipartisan consultations were held by Secretary Dulles. Undersecretary Smith. and the Assistant Secretaries of State: (a) Secretary Dulles has held private consultations with Senate and House Members of the Congress from both parties 14 times. (b) Under Secretary Smith has held such private consultations three times. (c) Secretary Dulles has held consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs Committees and their subcommittees 17 times. (d) Undersecretary Smith has held such committee and subcommittee consultations three times. (e) Assistant Secretaries have held such committee and subcommittee consultations 22 times. Secretary Dulles has met with other Senate and House committees or subcommittees 14 times. Undersecretary Smith at least 8 times. and 1 or more Assistant Secretaries on at least 19 different occasions. A total recapitulation of consultations: Secretary Dulles. 45 times. Undersecretary Smith. 14 times. Assistant Secretaries. 41 times. Total consultations. 100 times. Now I will pause here for anyone on the floor to take issue with this statement of facts or. if they are unprepared to take issue at this time. to come back tomorrow or the next day and take issue. This is the record and possibly by repeating this record often enough we can silence this unfounded publicity campaign designed to make the people of the country believe that there is no bipartisan foreign policy. At this point. I want to refer to another fine statement made in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD on April 6. 1954 by a distinguished Member of the House. a member of the Democrat Party and a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. the gentleman from Connecticut . You will find his remarks on page 4748 of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD dated April 6. 1954. This is not a long statement so I will read it in its entirety: Mr. Speaker. I have read several times recently in news stories and in some of the columnists reports that Secretary of State John Foster Dulles failed to consult any of us on the Democratic side on the important policy declaration contained in his speech a week ago last night in New York on the Indochina situation. I have no idea who planted that story or why it was planted. But fairness and a regard for the necessary continuation of bipartisanship in our foreign policy impels me to say it is not a true report. Mr. Dulles not only consulted Democratsthat is. those of us on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. at leastin advance of his New York speech. but asked us for suggestions as to what he should say. He appeared in closed session with our committee and went over with the members his plans for this particular speech. Under those circumstances. I would certainly say that we were consulted. and more than that. as I said. he asked us for suggestions as well. Believe me. Mr. Speaker. I feel so deeply about the need for true bipartisanship in foreign policy that if I felt in this particular instance there was any basis for criticism of the Secretary for failure to consult the minority party and its representatives here on a matter of such farreaching importance. I would certainly join in such criticism. But none is warranted In this case. and I think it only fair for me to call that to the attention of the House and to correct the misstatements which have appeared in some of the newspapers. I have listened to several of the speeches made by the gentleman from Connecticut on the floor of the House from time to time. and I have been impressed with the fact that though he does not constantly call attention to the fact that he wants to be fair. or that he always is fair. he invariably is fair and resorts to reason and honest argument to try to win his point. I hope that his attitude will inspire the leadership on his side of the aisle. though I appreciate my calling attention to this is likely to do him a disservice. I sincerely hope not. Now to return to the St. Louis PostDispatch editorial. The next item is a clever handling of a charge made by a Republican Senator delivered before a Republican audience that the Democrat Party was a party of treason. The pretense is made that Senator KNOWLANDS speech of May 11. 1954. is the first formal repudiation of this charge. This is untrue. Furthermore. I will state that the constant publicity given to the charge was by the Democrat leaders and their news reporting allies themselves. Now I dont blame them for taking issue. or indeed offense. at such a wild. reckless. and untrue statement. Nor can I blame them for trying to make political capital out of it. But when they try to create the impression that because one Republican Senator has said nasty things about them the Republican Party has said such things. then they are stretching the matter way out of proportion. Frankly. I dont think either party wants to take on its shoulders the responsibility for the statements made from time to time by each one of its officeholders or officials. And I would hate to try to match anyone on the subject of who has been called the worst names and by whom. Furthermore. it certainly has no place in a serious discussion of bipartisan foreign policy. The offender in point is certainly not a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. the Republican policy committee nor. indeed. is he in very good grace at the present time with the administration. And. to the glee of my Democrat colleagues and their newspaper spokesmen. they know it. The editorial goes on to suggest that Senator KNOWLANDS speech was prompted by Mr. Trumans warning. Well. I would like to ask at this point if my Democrat colleagues are going to endorse. or have endorsed. the various nouns. adjectives. adverbs. verbs. and figures of speech used from time to time by Harry Truman to describe the Republican Party. its history. activities. and motives. No. as I said. we had better not get into a contest to see which irresponsible spokesman has used the most extreme language in describing those who disagreed with him. Certainly it is obvious that what private citizen Truman has to say is of little concern to the Republican leaders. unless indeed. he is still an official spokesman for the Democrat Party. Is he? I well remember what Senator Vandenberg. whom my Democrat colleagues like to refer to. had to say about the bipartisanship in Asiatic and Far East matters. He was quite outspoken in his criticism of the abandonment of the bipartisan approach. I used this as one of my main campaign points in the 1950 election as I am certain many others did. The next theme. and I have heard it on the floor quite recently. is that no Democrats have been appointed to high positions in the State Department. Well. I hope this is not offered seriously. This administration has been in power 18 months and the main difficulty it is experiencing that I can see is getting a few Republicans appointed in the State Department. The lower echelons are so completely filled with the appointees made over the past 20 years of Democrat administrations that it is quite difficult at times to implement policy. In fact. many policy jobs. as I would term them. were classified as civilservice jobs and so the personnel is frozen in them. Perhaps. when the administration gets reasonable control of the executive machinery. there can be and should be talk of balancing off. At the present time. the balance is still so one sided against the administration that no one could seriously ask that it be weighted further. But the test of bipartisanship approach is not one of filling top policy jobs with members of the other party. It consists in taking on the responsibility for shaping policy. but in doing so keeping the opposite party leaders fairly informed of the facts and giving them an opportunity to ask questions and make suggestions before a course is set or taken. This has been done. The record is there. If it is in error. let us have the refutation. Otherwise. let us have no more of these unfounded charges that the loyal opposition is not informed or consulted about our foreign policy. The next statement I want to point up says. This-the bipartisan foreign policy-was continued under Truman. My comment: Yes. as long as the Republican 80th Congress was in office. Under this Congress the Marshall plan. aid to Turkey and Greece. the Atlantic Treaty Pact. the Voice of America were all started or implemented. But when the Democratic 81th Congress came in. out the window went bipartisanship. Again. check the record. It is outlined in Senator KNOWLANDS speech of April 11. 1954."},{"1":"8.300867e+08","2":"1953","3":"S","4":"IVES","5":"559","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. I shall be very brief. I do not wish to let the occasion pass without rising to point out that this is one more example of the manner in which the States of New York and New Jersey have worked together for their common good. Time and time again problems have arisen. and we have always united in doing what we could do to solve them. and to further the best interests of the two States. In this particular instance we have joined in an effort to bring to an end a very provoking situation which has existed all too long in a great harbor. On behalf of the government of the State of New York. for which I can speak in this instance. I believe. I desire to express to the chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. the Senator from New Hampshire . and to his fellow committee members. and to my colleagues. the senior and junior Senators from New Jersey. our appreciation for their cooperation with us in accomplishing a much desired result. Of course. without all of us working together nothing would have happened. I say to my distinguished friend the junior Senator from New Jersey . that without his particular interest in the matter I daresay it could not have been expedited in the way it has been. with the cooperation of the chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. Before I close I wish to read a telegram which I have received from the Governor of the State of New York. because it is applicable at this time. The telegram is addressed to me. It reads: ALBANY. N. Y.. July 16. 1953. Hon. IRVINr M. IVES. United States Senator. Senate Office Building: Early congressional approval of the waterfront commission compact for the States of New York and New Jersey is of vital importance not only to the port of New York district but to the entire Nation. The 19month investigation by the New York State crime commission of waterfront conditions disclosed an incredible criminal domination of vital business activities characterized by widespread corruption. Intimidation. and violence. The recommendation for a waterfront commission was designed to remove control of the piers from gangsters and hoodlums. end the public loading racket. pilferage. and extortion and permit the reestablishment of genuine collective bargaining. The plan was widely supported and acclaimed by responsible civic and business groups. lawenforcement agencies. and public officials at public hearings held in New York City in June. Every opportunity was provided for the submission of alternative proposals and no better program was advanced. The compact legislation was unanimously supported by every member of both houses of the New York State Legislature and In the State of New Jersey the bills were approved with only one dissenting vote. The waterfront commission compact will provide the means through which labor and management can end mob rule over the most important port area in the United States. Prompt approval of the compact will combine the full force of the Federal Government with the efforts of the States of New York and New Jersey to stamp out the evil conditions which have blighted the port. terrorized honest workmen. and subjected a multibilliondollar industry to a system of organized piracy. I earnestly hope that the Congress will expedite this program through prompt and favorable action."},{"1":"8.201836e+08","2":"1952","3":"H","4":"JAVITS","5":"345","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the last word. Mr. Chairman. we come now to a section of this bill which will always recall to my mind an outstanding personality who was a Member of the House for many years. the Honorable Frank Keefe. of Wisconsin. Mr. Keefe gave a very great deal of himself in the creation of the National Health Institutes and in the whole program of research in the great killer diseases. heart. cancer. tuberculosis. and the others. He came from a State which Is generally conservative in its thought. He was a conservative man himself. but he perceived one truth. and perhaps it was the greatest truth that he perceived in his life. That truth was that material resources in terms of our men. women. and children had to be preserved against the dreadful depredations of these dread diseases. that there was a big job to be done in research on cancer. heart disease. mental health. and all the fields. into which these appropriations now go and that the Federal GoVernment had to take part in that field if the job was to be measurably forwarded and accelerated. I think with all humility and all deference to the chairmen of the subcommittees who worked with him a very long time. Mr. Keefe was. if not the most important in driving and pushing and working for this perceived truth. certainly as important as any other Member of the Congress in both bodies. I think the truth which he perceived as to the conservation of our human resources from disease by Government aid to fundamental research in the causes and cures is of the greatest importance. I think these appropriations and the work which they cover are giving a sense of wellbeing to millions upon millions of Americans. the subjects of these diseases who otherwise would face hopeless futures not only for themselves but for their families. I hope the House will indulge me for having called to its attention at this time the work of this outstanding former Member. now deceased."},{"1":"8.200856e+08","2":"1951","3":"H","4":"BRYSON","5":"1080","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"Mr. Chairman. it has been my privilege to spend a few days. including the Fourth of July. in my home district. as did many of you gentlemen. Knowing the traditions of our people as we do. it was no surprise to find them keenly interested in world events as tney are transpiring in the hoped for trend toward peace. The first desire in most hearts is for an early. honorable. safe cessation of the socalled Korean irncident. As anxious as all of us are for the final ceasefire order. we must not allow our desires to divert our thoughts from impelling measures of national security. The strength of our Nation must be preserved if we are justified in securing and maintaining an era of peace. The measure which we now debate. H. R. 3871. of course is of vital importance. The thought of broadening. increasing. or extending any sort of regulations or controls is unpleasant. We rebelled in our youth from the taking of medicine. but just as we complied with the doctors request then. we now face the necessity of resorting to those measureswe hope only temporarilywhich will insure our continuing strength. One hundred and seventyfive years ago the people of this country. finding the encroachment of a strong centralized government unbearable. set forth certain basic principles representing their idea of the proper relationship between a citizen and his government. and to preserve these principles the people of America staked their lives and future on their ability to throw off the chains of tyranny and establish and maintain a free and independent government. Those early Americans endured the gravest hardships fighting against an enemy overwhelmingly superior both in military and naval forces and in economic resources. but at no time during the bitter conflict were the tattered forces of the colonists willing to compromise. In the face of almost certain destruction they refused to accept defeat. and in the end the strength of their convictioa brought them victory. When the American people set about to establish their own Government. they reaffirmed their faith in the right of individual choice and the sovereignty of each State. and to guarantee and protect these basic ideas they established a government based upon a Constitution which expressly reserved all but certain limited powers to the States and to the people themselves. It was a simple delegation of certain essential powers to the central Government. It was the clear intention of those earliest patriots that these fundamental principles should forever remain the guiding light in the American way of life. In the years that have passed since the founding of this democracy many have been blinded by more immediate but less weighty issues with the result thatthey lost sight of the basic tenets of our American philosophy. Despite the prophetic warning of our founding fathers. including the eloquent reminders voiced by such statesmen as my own distinguished predecessor. John C. Calhoun. the fundamental principles of our Constitution at one point became so beclouded by sectional interests and passions that it was necessary to take up arms in their defense. The Southern States were forced to resist compulsion from without. and through the days of that most regrettable conflict uppermost in the minds of those in gray was the preservation of the American way of life. Not even in defeat did the South relinquish its steadfast hold on those principles of Americanism. and today the spirit of America glows brighter in the South than anywhere else. Today. while collectivist forces are making sweeping gains in many parts of the world and are even challenging our liberties here in the United States. the South remains the citadel of democracy. an example of the truly progressive democracy envisioned by the founding fathers. While constantly resisting socialistic programs which would undermine the sovereignty of the States and diminish our individual liberties. the South has made tremendous progress in rebuilding the once destroyed southern economy. and this has been done with a system of private enterprise and individual liberty. We have rejected the encroachments of such things as socialized medicine and all other schemes which would surrender our right of selfdetermination and leave us at the mercy of a domineering Federal Government. And the progress of the South. even during my years in Congress. is unprecedented. As contrasted with the 1939 level of output the South has made tremendous strides in every aspect of its economy. Great progress has been made in farming. mining. manufacturing. construction. utilities. trade. service. and finance. In 1948 the industrial output of the South measured 190 percent above the 1939 level according to the 1939 dollar value. This was 377 percent above the 1939 level according to the 1949 dollar value. and represented an increase of 90 percent in physical volume and an increase of 277 percent in dollar value. All of this has been accompanied by a steady improvement in roads. schools. hospitals. and other facilities throughout the South. Today there are those who would have us believe that progress requires the abandonment of our cultural heritage and basic ideals. They would have us give up our faith in the American way of life. They would have us sacrifice the spirit of democracy and liberty for an impractical utopia called collectivism. socialism. or some other ismanything but real Americanism. But the South has demonstrated- the fallacy of such thinking. The South has shown that the way to progress is not through increased government. but through hard work and a vigorous system of free enterprise based on individual initiative and self -determination. When the early American settlers tackled this rugged continent they did so with a spirit of individualism and selfreliance. By that spirit they built an empire from a land of wilderness and hardship. Today the South seeks to preserve that spirit. To those who cherish our American way of life the South has come to represent the last great stronghold of the American heritage. The spirit of America is embodied in these tenets: freedom from compulsion from without. the right of individual choice. government by the consent of the governed. and the right of a State to determine its own affairs. These ideals constitute the core of everything for which the South stands. The spirit of the South is the spirit of the founding fathers. the spirit of the South is the spirit of America. Let us therefore proceed with more than usual caution as we provide for such continuing controls only as will lead to our military. economic. moral. and social strength."},{"1":"8.102083e+08","2":"1950","3":"S","4":"LANGER","5":"104","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President.

I refer to the diplomatic status of the representation of Ireland in this country and of the United States in Ireland. How is it that countries like Afghanistan. Pakistan. Honduras. Costa Rica and Nicaragua and 40 or more smaller countries have ambassadorial status here and we have Embassies in their countries and yet we have only a legation in Ireland and they have only a legation here? Now facts and figures bear out that the number of Americans who were born in Ireland and the number of Americans of Irish descent is vastly greater than those Americans or descent from any one or from all of these countries and I feel that it is high time that we looked into what appears to be discrimination and have the situation corrected. Bear in mind that we have in this country 13.500.000 people whose grandparents were born in Ireland. We have in the United States over 30.000.000 people with some Irish blood. There are in this country more than 270.000 people natives of Ireland. When you add to these population figures the indisputable historical facts concerning the tremendous contribution made by the Irish people to the establishment of our independence and to our growth to the worlds foremost power we cannot but realize that we Americans owe a debt of gratitude to the Irishand it is time that we recognized it. Mr. Speaker and colleagues. let us not forget that approximately 40 percent of the American Revolutionary Army was composed of Irish immigrants. They not only swelled the ranks but they led the ranks and no fewer than 19 generals in the Continental Army were of Irish birth or blood. The first armed attack for American independence on land was made by Maj. Gen. John Sullivan who stormed Fort William and Mary and captured British armaments which were used by our forces at the Battle of Bunker Hill. It was Jeremiah OBrien who started the hostilities at sea when he and his five stalwart sons leading a band of neighboring patriots put out to sea in their fishing boats. boarded and captured the English warship Margaretta. An infuriated English admiral dispatched two vessels to recapture the Margaretta. The OBriens gave battle and succeeded in capturing the two British warships which were sent out to capture them. And gentlemen. no American can ever forget that the father of the American Navy. Commodore John Barry. commanded the American battleship. the Lexington. the first officially commissioned American fighting ship in the Revolutionary War. It is no wonder then that Lord Mountjoy arose before the English Parliament to explain the cause of Englands defeat In these remarkable words: America was lost by Irish emigrants. I should not have to tell you of the great. the rich. the important contribution made to American democracy by Irish immigrants and by men and women of Irish descent from all walks of lifeIn the military. in education. in science. in labor. in business and in the professions. Ten Irishmen were signers of the Declaration of Independence and the American Presidents of Irish descent were Andrew Jackson. James Polk. James Buchanan. and Woodrow Wilson. Stonewall Jackson. master strategist of the Confederate Armies. was of Irish descent as were Generals Sheridan and Meade of the Northern Army. Cyrus McCormick. who invented the harvesting machine. and Samuel Morse. who developed mcdern telegraphy. were Irish. Robert Fulton. whose father came from Kilkenny. developed steam navigation. John R. Holland was the inventor of the submarine. My fellow Members. if there is any nation in the world deserving of sovereignty it is the Irish Nation: But I wish to point out that no country can enjoy complete sovereignty if within its borders there is a foreign power occupying territory and maintaining military establishments. Mr. Speaker. it is my intention to offer two resolutions before this session is over: First. to raise the status of United States representation in Ireland to that of an Embassy. and the other to have this House memorialize the British Parliament to end the partition of Ireland."},{"1":"8.001787e+08","2":"1948","3":"H","4":"DIRKSEN","5":"3735","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. this Is very peculiarly. our own day. It is our day for personal communion with those who but a short while before were with us in the confraternity of public service. This is the day on which we pay gracious testimony and loving tribute to those who are now gathered in the democracy of death and who were with us a short while ago. If they could come into the doors of the Chamber this day with what warmth and affection we would greet them. There would be Senator BILBO and FRED BRADLEY. Judge MANSFIELD and CHARLIE GIFFORD. RAY SPRINGER and PAT DREWRY. Uncle JOHN ROBSION and ORv ZIMMERMAN. whom we more affectionately called ZIM. Somehow there is a strange selectivity in the democracy of transition for no two of those who have departed from us come from the same State. If I were to characterize each by a single word I would say of Senator BILBO that he was a man of deep and abiding conviction. of JOHN OVERTON I would say that In his great heart was a rich and complete devotion. of FRED BRADLEY I would say there was determination and moral robustness. of Judge MANSFIELD I would say that there was about him a spiritual grace which radiated like a strange and lifting aura in all the years that I knew him. of CHARLIE GIFFORD I would say that in his capacious heart was a love so great that it matched the waves of the Atlantic which beat upon the shores of his native Cape Cod. In the heart and in the manner of RAY SPRINGER was meekness and hu.nility that shone as an iridescent light. PAT DREWRY was a living exemplification of Brownings fascinating lines devoted to sweetness and light. Of ORV ZIMMERMAN it could be said that in his heart was an exuberant hope for this country and his fellow men which was lustrous like June sunshine. Of Uncle JOHN ROBSION. I could always detect a fundamental faith as rugged and redoubtable as the hills of his native Kentucky. And so in this intensely personal communion today we shall live with them intimately again and take thought and inspiration from their divine personalities that will continue to linger long in this Chamber. While the spirit of remembrance and the mood of memory is upon us. I think today of a very simple and entrancing story in the Scripture. It is the story of an obscure and nameless woman who brought an alabaster box of precious ointment with which to annoint the Master. To me it is so simple. so compelling. and so appropriate for this occasion. I am sure you will remember that the Man of Galilee was going to go to the home of Simon the leper in the village of Bethany for a visit and for a meal. How strange that seems to us. Who among us would think of going to the house of a leper to dine and to visit? But Jesus did so and. as I said. Simon the leper lived in Bethany. It was my privilege to visit the village of Bethany in 1945. What a memorable and historic place it really is. You will recall that Lazarus lived there together with his sisters Mary and Martha. It was on the roadway which leads from Bethany that Martha encountered the Master and from a heavy heart and a disconcert of spirit complained of the fact that Mary had not made the household ready for the coming of the Galilean. And after He had listened patiently to her He said so humbly. But one thing is needful. And that. of course. was the need of the spirit. It was in this selfsame village then of Bethany where Simon lived. and while he and the Master were at meat. as the Scripture records. there came this unbidden guest. It was a woman. The only characterization we have of her is that she was a sinner. We know little else about her. Was she tall and stately or was she. perhaps. short statured and robust? We do not know. for the Gospels are silent on this. Did she wear fashionable raiment or was she dressed in ordinary clothing? This we do not know. Did she have dark. lustrous hair and black snapping eyes? Or did she have golden hair which caught the sunshine of the desert? Did she have blue sparkling eyes like those colorful little flowers that grow in profusion on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho? Was her voice harsh or was it soft and melodious? All this we do not know. The record says she was a sinner. And how simply she came to where the Master was visiting with the leper. There were no press conferences. no press releases. no society column. no eloquent speeches. The record simply says that she came. How simple it all is. It is so much like the approach in the story of the. Good Samaritan who found a man wounded and groaning by the roadside and when the Good Samaritan heard his cry of distress the Scripture says He came where he was. It was so simple and so forthright. The coming of the nameless woman to the Master was equally simple. She brought with her an alabaster box of precious ointment. She stood behind the Man of Galilee. who was doubtless sitting or kneeling at His repast. It was the posture of humility. She washed His feet with her tears. She dried them with her tresses and then from the alabaster box she took the precious ointment of spikenard and annointed Him. I presume we would call it perfume. There was no conversation. There was no record. There were no remarks to be examined. We have only the record of this simple and humble ministration. The disciples were there. The Book says they were indignant. I can well imagine that scene. I can particularly imagine Peter. who must have been there. frowning. He was such a sturdy and forthright soul and so practical. The anointing of the Master with precious perfume offended the practical sense of the disciples. Quickly they translated it into an equation of their own. This ointment might well bring 300 pence and the money could be used for alms and for charity. That argument has such a familiar ring today. How often have Members of this body been chided. especially during wartime. for going abroad to inspect the progresses of our arms and to observe conditions the better to discharge their responsibilities. How often we were confronted with the argument that the gasoline and the expenses involved might have been put to better and more useful � purpose. It was the very kind of an argument that the disciples used long ago as they saw the ministrations of this humble woman. The Master must have listened earnestly to the argument and to the conversation and then. with simplicity and logic which is like majesty itself. He suddenly said. Why trouble ye this woman. She hath wrought a good work upon me. How simple. how compelling. how persuasive that was. He simply said. She hath wrought a good work upon me. A little later He then said the things that have such rich appeal on this memorial occasion. Very simply did He say that what she had done would be told as a memorial unto her wherever the gospel might be preached. How simple and compelling is this story because it is the unadorned story of a kindly deed. a very humble service. and there is the promise that it would be a memorial and would reecho down the corridors of time until the end of earth as a memorial to an obscure unnamed woman. As I think of our departed colleagues today who are gathered in the endless land of dreamless sleep. they. too. brought to their task here an alabaster box of precious ointment consisting of their talent. their love. their affection and devotion. and their abiding desire to serve their people. their colleagues. and their country. They brought with them the perfume of humble service and these are the services that will live to adorn and to enshrine their memories. The speeches which we make so quickly. die upon the vesper breeze. The votes on which we and they are recorded will soon be forgotten. It is the human. the humane and kindly little services which are unherald. unsung. and unacclaimed which will be so long remembered on the tablets of the mind and the heart. There is an amazing immortality about a kindly service. a good deed. a humble ministration. In all parts of the land there will be people who will long remember them for these little things which may seem unimportant to us in the hurlyburly of a controversial atmosphere. -How many veterans they must have helped not only in the recent conflict but in World War I in securing expeditious hospitalization. For this there are no headlines. How many refugees in the old countries and the kinfolks of those refugees in this country they must have helped in securing visas that they might be lifted from the tyrannies of the Old World. For this there is no acclaim. How many aged and indigent persons back home they must have helped and to whom they provided comfort in endeavoring to secure more adequate pensions and assistance. The song of unuttered joy for this will be written on gracious human hearts. How many snarls they must have untangled where folks back home were having difficulty with railroad retirement pensions and socialsecurity benefits. How many fathers and mothers they must have helped in finding the last resting place of some son enshrined in glory on some faroff battlefield. How many fathers and mothers. wives and sweethearts they must have aided in locating kin somewhere abroad in this huge world. How many businessmen they must have helped in finding their way through the labyrinth of a bewildering government. All these and a thousand more are the humble services which marked each day of their service in this body. And because these were the humanand humane things they appeal to the heart and will be long remembered. The letters which they have written over the years by the hundreds to bring comfort and reassurance to humble people back home will be passedfrom hand to hand long after they had departed. These will bring strange luster to the countenance of people as they show these letters and say. I got a letter from my Congressman. Yes. these are the things that will live long and be enshrined upon the pulsing tablets of love and memory. Let us go back for a moment to what the Master said to the disciples when they showed their indignation of the ministrations of this unnamed woman sinner. He said simply She hath wrought a good work upon Me. It was objective. It was somebody to somebody. It is the important thing in this compelling story. It is the mark of real service. Their services were so intensely obJective because they were rendered to people. to us. to country. to humble folks who looked upon them as their liaison agents with the Government. As I think of this quality of objectivity a number of favorite examples come to mind. One of my favorite characters. who was rather contemporary because he passed on only 30 years ago. was Maj. Gen. William Crawford Gorgas of the United States Army. He was one of that little group who back in the days when the construction of the Panama Canal was in progress was persuaded that the Canal could not be built unless yellow fever and malaria were first conquered. So insistent was he in his viewpoint that it offended the construction superintendent on the Canal and he insisted on the dismissal of Gorgas. The letter of dismissal was already on the desk of the President of the United States but wiser counsels prevailed and it was never consummated. William Crawford Gorgas continued to serve until the malarialbearing mosquito and yellow fever had been conquered. How little we hear about it. How little acclaim he really received. and yet it was this humble service which had so much to do with the completion of a Federal project for the linking of two great oceans. The services of General Gorgas did not stop here. He served the people of Peru and other South American countries in conquering plagues and increasing longevity. Even as age was coming upon him he went to The Rand in faroff Africa to subdue the -influenza germ. It is no wonder that when he died in London in 1919 a vast concourse of people lined the streets on the occasion of the memorial parade in his honor and when the riderless white horse went by they bowed in reverence and respect to the memory of a truly noble man whose nobility consisted of humble service for the welfare of all mankind. Some years ago I saw a sixline squib in one of the Washington newspapers announcing the death of Dr. Joseph Goldberger. Perhaps it meant little to many people. but it meant a great deal to me. because I had followed the career of this seemingly obscure man. who was a member of the staff of the United States Public Health Service. It was he who was assigned to explore and find the remedy for that dreaded disease known as pellagra. which had invaded the Southland and not only had taken a great toll of life but enervated and devitalized thousands of people so that they could not carry on their normal pursuits. It was to this problem that Dr. Joseph Goldberger addressed himself. The record of his service is thrilling and dramatic even though it appears so commonplace. He visited hospitals and asylums. orphanages and prison schools. and groups in his relentless pursuit of this awful disease. He imperiled his own life freely and willingly in order to find the cause. The record shows him in a pullman car at Spartanburg. S. C.. consuming capsules made from the offal of persons in the last stages of pellagra. He made capsules of the scales which came from their gaunt and haggard bodies to test the effect upon himself. At long last he found the cause. It was a vitamin deficiency. and from this a remedy was soon prescribed. There were no headlines for Joseph Goldberger. no gilded books were written about him. There were no demonstrations to acclaim him. His was the humble service of the commonplace. but gratitude for that service will ring down the vistas of time and come as a song of joy from the hearts of the afflicted. He received but six lines in the current press when the soul took flight. I think also of the humble service rendered by a New Hampshire soldier during the Civil War whose name is unknown to me. Evidently he must have enjoyed a furlough and when he returned to the hills of his native New Hampshire he had time to fashion his own tombstone. possibly because of a premonition of death. On one side of that stone were carved the essential vital statistics and on the other si4e this selfwritten epitaph. This side of my tombstone I dedicate to freedom and union. May they survive and endure forever. Here was a man rendering humble service to this country in an hour of crisis and it will be remembered into the eternity. Yes. there was objectivity about their service here and it so well illustrates that simple but compelling sentiment which the Master uttered when He said. She hath wrought a good work upon Me. They have wrought a good work upon us. upon their kinsmen and their constituency. upon their country and the world. They have wrought a good work and it will be remembered. The intimate and personal character of this memorial service today is possible because it is the remembrance of the living to those who are now gone. It would fail in its purpose if it did not quicken our spirits. It must enrich us and do something for our own perspective. our behavior. and our viewpoint. What then shall we draw from it all as we stand on the very shadow of their lingering spirits and enjoy the communion of memorial fellowship with them? Is it not possible that we tooall of ushave come here with our alabaster box of precious ointment consisting of the talents with which we have been endowed. the love which we bear for our fellowmen. the interest which we have in world welfare and the devotion which we entertain for this our blessed country to be used for the enhancement and progress of our country and the restoration of peace of mind and tranquillity of soul to a restive and tumultuous world. This perfume of talent we can use iW we will to soften the asperities and the severities of life. to modify the hates with which we are often confronted and to so soften our own conduct that it will be as a great spiritual wave and moral force for the Nation and for the world. As we use it lavishly and diligently we cannot help but spill the precious and fragrant perfume of our own talents upon our colleagues and upon everyone with whom we come in contact. Suppose that for a single month we made a diligent effort to make certain that in our disagreement we would never be captious. that in our differences on principle we would never show petulance. that in resolutely following our own abiding convictions on matters of fundamental policy they would never be tainted by acrimony. Suppose we made a diligent effort to exemplify the humility and meekness and forbearance which marked their service. what a great moral force it would become in softening the dissidences of life and clarifying fundamental viewpoints. All this would redound so richly to the welfare of the world and of our own country. When all is said and done. my friends. the problems. the questions. and the challenges with which we are confronted from day to day and year to year can scarcely be met by the lawbook and the statute book. So little of what we might formally inscribe upon the legislative parchments will actually meet the challenges of this turbulent era because the problems come from the spirit and the crisis is essentially moral. You will agree that on so many hands one finds defeatism. but can we reduce anything to the common denominator of words and language that will meet it. How shall we best solve the group antagonisms which are. after all. a matter of heart and soul? How shall we best meet the moral fatigue which one finds in many places and which is the pardonable and inevitable result of a conflict which tugged at the whole human fabric of the world? How shall we meet the frustrations which are also one of the bitter inheritances of conflict? The prophet Haggai in the Old Testament summed it up in a single phrase when he wrote on the parchments of the Scripture long ago. Ye looked for much. and. lo. it came to little. It is the best definition of the frustrated spirit I have ever encountered in the literature of mankind. But frustration and defeatism and moral fatigue and social cleavages and gkoup antagonisms must all be met if we are to achieve that unity of purpose and action so indispensable to the progress of our country and of the world. I humbly doubt that the answerthe real answercan be found in legislative words. We must reach into the citadel of the spirit to find the solutions and we have access to the citadel only in proportion as the heart and the soul finds solid moral ground. In proportion as we can bring this approach to our problems we shall again find sweetness and serenity in our national life which will carry us to levels never attained before In any time or generation. This we can find in our sweet and personal communion with their happy memories today. Let me add one more thing to this simple testimony of remembrance. In the Old Testament is the story of Ezekiel released from captivity who was commanded by the Lord to look upon the Valley of Dried Bones. From an anxious heart he asked the Lord whether they could live again. He was bidden to command. and soon with a great clattering roar these bones assdmbled Into skeletons. He asked whether they could be clothed with flesh and was bidden to command and. lo. they were clothed with flesh. He asked whether bhey could live again and was told to command the four winds to breathe into this great lifeless host the very breath of life. and. behold. it stood there as a living army. One of the old versions. as I remember. then carries this simple admonition from the Lord. To Ezekiel He said that those in the Valley of Dried Bones were like an ancient people and that they were lost and dead and without hope. Then he said He would make them a people once more. He did not say that He would make them two people or a divided people or a cloven people or a turbulent people. He said he would make them a people united in spirit and in effort. As I survey the contemporary scene. is there anything so important as a restoration of common purpose. of domestic tranquillity. and of happy labor in the cause of an ideal which we call the American dream? And so. my friends. in this blessed communion with our own let me say in the language of Peter. let us strive for this great goal for which mankind yearns until we find the day star rising in our hearts. That is the day star of hope and promise for a new glory and a new greatness for ourselves and for the whole world. And so in sweet remembrance we lay upon their divine lingering personalities the memorial laurel of the living to the dead. SOLO Hon.

I see no reason to read any political question into this problem. From the beginning of this particular program. it has always been brought to the House from the Committee on Agriculture practically by unanimous consent. Today I commend the committee for what it has done in bringing this legislation to the House. I justify this program not for any theoretical reasons but for very practical ones. The beginning of it and the continuation of it are justified on the basis of necessity. and not otherwise. Those who today draw a picture of the farmers of the country wanting this program in order to get cheap labor are presenting a picture not faithful to the facts. That is not the motive behind this legislation. As indicated by one or two previous speakers. it is decidedly more expensive for the farmers to.use this foreign labor than it is the domestic supply. They would like to get rid of the program as soon as other taxpayers of the country. But I have seen the operation of this program in our State. Much of the production in California of food products. vegetables as well as fruits. is upon a wholesale mass production basis. Last year California produced the largest canned crop of both vegetables and fruits that was ever produced. Those products are needed by this country and by the countries that we are trying to aid in the distressed situation of the world. I can say to you as a practical fact that a substantial part of that production of fruits and vegetables would never have gone to the canners if it had not been for this means of providing labor to assist the American farmer who produced it. It is literally true that millions of dollars worth of such foods in the past 3 years has been produced with the help of this imported labor. Again. I want to emphasize the fact that it is costing the farmers more than domestic labor. There is still a definite prospect that .there is not going to be an adequate supply of domestic labor this year. Within the last week the Governor of California was here and it has been revealed that California today has more labor employment than it had in the peak of war production. Now. with that situation before us the consumers of the country must realize that. if this program is not continued. they are likely going to have a less supply of the necessary food products in this country for the coming year."},{"1":"7.902017e+08","2":"1946","3":"S","4":"LUCAS","5":"184","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President.

In spite of that wise saying. and with a deep sense of responsibility. I address the House today. These are my closing days in Congress. and I piust of necessity soon relinquish a shield I have borne in behalf of a handful of American heroes in the South Pacific. Unhappily. it is these few men in our armed service whose faith in the justice of Uncle Sam is faltering. for they cannot understand the lack of action of their superiors. and they look to Congress for understanding and as their only hope of relief. I trust some one of you will pick up that shield I now lay down and. with the support of others. carry on where I must leave offand assure these forgotten soldiers of the Pacific that we do understand and we do mean to be helpful. I fought on the battlefields of France in the last war. and I have just returned from a visit to the eastern French war front. where now the greatest American armies ever assembled are engaged. Let me accentuate. I have great respect so far for the ability of our military leaders in the European and in the Pacific theaters of operation. Throughout my term in Congress I have refrained from publicly criticizing the policies of the War Department or its leaders. because I know that without all the facts conclusions are untrustworthy and cannot be authenticated. I also know the sacrifices which are demanded of all in the Nation at war. Therefore you wilt understand. I am sure. that I gave uareful consideration to what I have to say today. for it is close to my heart. and I have a deep conviction that it should be said. This House and the country will judge of its justification and significance. To begin with. there is a War Department policy which directs that menquotewith considerable service overseasend quotebe sent home on temporary duty or be returned home on rotation. which latter furlough means. as an individual. some other soldier takes 0his place overseas. and he remains in the United States assigned to new duty. Out on certain islands in the South Pacificsome large and some smallremoved mostly from todays active combat area in the Philippinesa few hundred American soldiers from New England and elsewhere are awaiting word from the Secretary of War through their officers that this order is being carried out. If it comes. it will revive their lagging faith in American military justice. but if they continue to be told to forget the furloughs they will succumb to complete bitterness. That sudden death may yet come matters little to them. for death is a part of war. and they know it and are still prepared to give their soldier lives if this be their fate. But careless injustice is a factor they cannot understand. and you will agree that should not be a part A war as we Americans wage it. It is against such an injustice to a few members of our armed forces that I raise my voice in this Chamber today. I can only hope its echo will be heard in high military places. and the resulting reverberations will be carried to themto those small bands of men who have been marooned in the South Pacific for nearly 3 years without relief. They should know. at least. thatMembers of Congress feel they have had their full share of the perils of the swamps and jungles and all too long have been the prey to disheartening thoughts. and that their morale. and health if need be. ought to be restored by sight of home and family. The men for whom I speak. from my own State of Connecticut and also from along the eastern seaboard and from the Middle West. were shipped overseas directly after Pearl Harbor. They survived the battles of the island hopping in the South Pacific since those terrible days when Singapore fell. They struggled through the New Guinea and subsequent campaigns. Never before had we heard a word of complaint from these men. Today. however. they are stalled in these island outposts far removed from the present progressive landcombat areas. with a nuisance enemy raid to curse at now and then. and. what is infinitely. worse. less tangible but no less real. those dangers from ennui. loneliness. boredom. sickness - heartsickness mostly - that starve and strain mens souls.. Imagine their emotions as they look back over the slowmoving. futile 3 years and longapparently without hopefor the sight of the homeland they have defended so valiantly and the loved ones who have waited so patiently. Now my knowledge of military tells me that it is proper for orders from the Secretary of War. promulgated by the War Department. to go through channels down along the line to the units. large and small. that must carry them out. But my. military experience also tells me that this routine or system is useful in doing what is commonly called the old army game. passing the buck. The Secretary of War communicated with the commander in the Pacific after my letters requested action. The Secretary directed attention to these men and their eligibility for furlough home. Of course he employed the usual military phrase. take whatever action deemed appropriate. Apparently nothing has happenedwe have heard nothingnothing will happen unless we insist that justice to a few men is as important as justice to the many. if Army discipline is to be maintained. and others. regulations. and policies require compliance by the commanders as well as by the men. I cannot understand why the theater commander in the South Pacific has not acted. He has the authority to- do so. military necessity prompts it. and circumstances permitfor the War Department policy directs thatand I quote: Consideration be given to length of time served overseas * * * the extent of rebuilding of mind and body required. Special consideration be given to men who have been engaged in arduous and hazardous services. Still there they are. and they have been there overseas for 34 months or more. and this will be their fourth Christmas away from home. Many of them are on the sick list. some have been injured or wounded and are being treated in small station hospitals when they might well be in a general hospital. all of them are fed up. esprit gone. their morale low. they feel themselvesand rightly soto be the victims of injustice and forsaken by the outfit that somewhere carries their names on the roll. I hear someone say there is a war on and more important things than sending a few men home must have prior attention. To that let me say. small units make up great armies and small details properly observed make up a welldisciplined army with high morale and excellent fighting ability that characterize ours. I knew a famous general officer who could spot a missing uniform button half way down a company line. but his leadership and successful battle strategy made him fhe idol of his men and won him the respect of the Allied General Staff. Someone is responsible for delay in the return of these few men in the Pacific. Let us find out who is overlooking this important detail. Let us have action. I do not claim nor is it necessary for me to understand many things that are done or left undone by our military leaders today. However. I am astonished and do wonder now and then. Only last week the newspapers were full of the stories of a considerable number of men who were taken out of combat in Europe. after only a few months service. and brought back to this country to impress upon the people the need to keep up war production. I saw some of them the other dayand fine soldiers they are. But. why bring men from Europe when the South Pacific is the hallowed ground where heroes ctually died because of the shortage of guns and ammunition in the early days of the war? Why not bring home these few men who have struggled with and endured continued limitations for three years. and in spite of it have done their share of keeping the enemy from our shores. Their personal story should impress the War Department as it would the country. and meantime the furlough rotation for 30 months combat soldiers would be a reality in the Pacific. But perhaps they dont want to tell this inside story of the unromantic hardships in the Pacific. We know they havent yet told us the real story behind the surprise Pearl Harbor attack. If 350.000 coal miners or workers in industry go on strike. our Governmentour Commander in Chief. in factminimizes the effect of such actions on the war effort. and blithely and publicly cites the fact that it represents only a fraction of 1 percent of man hours lost to the war effort. We have 11.000.000 men and women in our armed forces today. and I suggest that this handful of heroes. less than one tenthousandth of 1 percent of our fighting strength. if we will use fractions. can certainly be spared for a furloughto return home. without any appreciable effect upon the war effort in the Pacific. I respectfully call this to the attention of the Commander in Chief. Many of us have learned to overlook and find excuses for the inequities to selectees in the Selective Service. but the War Department is working this injustice upon valiant and valued combat soldiers. upon their generous families and upon the grateful American people. As I said. no sound reason for holdng these men in the South Pacific is givennothing but trite phrases such as military necessity and endangering the success of operations or effect on the war effort. I am sick of trite phrases. I am weary and disgusted with what has been hidden and excused in the name of the war. I refuse to believe that the continued successful prosecution of the war depends on a handful of men who have already given as much of themselves in the cause of freedom as any other living men. I refuse to believe that the situation in the South Pacific is such that the release of a few small units and the air or sea transport to bring them home would adversely affect our Pacific war progress. I have not forgotten the reactions and results of men. in continuous action. for I went with them. and I refuse to believe that it is wise to retain these men and send them into new battles. Almost every one is already the victim of battle fatigue. They are no longer the alert and agile men that make good combat soldiers. Their physical and mental reflexes have slowed down. They are dogtired. They need a trip home. They need it badly. They must have it. Thirtyfour months ago. when we had only a token Army and a few trained men to fight off the invaders in the South Pacific. we placed our trust and our faith in our reserve. the National Guard. A few units of the National Guard. including several New England regiments. who had received some training and were ready to serve. set sail in February of 1942 for Singapore. But before they got there Singapore fell. and they were diverted to the South Pacific. That was a long time ago. Some of us have not served that long in Congress. The second session of the Seventyseventh Congress and both sessions of the Seventyeighth Congress have passed into history. In the passing of those 34 months the whole course of the war and the whole course of history have changed. But the lot of these veteran units has not changed. They are still out there in the lonely ugliness of diseaseridden tropical islands wondering if their country has forgotten them. Mark you. it is of men in these National Guard regimentsthe small units of them that remainfor whom I speak today. Can Secretary of War Stimson or General Marshall or General MacArthur expect the American people to believe that the whole course of the Pacific warthe difference between victory and defeatrests upon the continued presence in these island outposts of a few hundred. veteran fighting men? There are plenty of men in the Army. 7.700.000 of them and seven or eight hundred thousand of the new class. the 18yearolds. coming in every year. There is no dearth of soldiers. Military regulations provide that there shall be relief for all soldiers after heavy duty. guard duty. or battle service. Do not men who for 34 months have been at the front without relief. who have fought the enemy. Jungle. muck. heat. fever. loneliness. fear. and hungeryes. hunger for civilizationnot merit consideration and relief. I have reported units by name and number which merit special consideration for arduous and hazardous service. I request the Secretary of War to direct that proper action be taken by our military authorities to correct these obvious cases of oversight or neglect of these units. I wish you might read my mail. The letters from the men themselves bring tears to the eyes. because of the unaffected simplicity of the pathetic statement of their plight. The letters from their parents. their wives. their brothers. sisters. and sweethearts are something else again. Today I had one which said. and I quote: I am sure if more Congressmen took an interest in matters of this nature more irregularities would be uncovered and remedied. Another one said. and I quote: If a few more Congressmen and Senators would do as you have done. these boys might get a break which they certainly deserve. One of the men in the islands wrote: We have reached the end of the rope. we are war 4eary. tired. homesick. and illour fighting spirit is goneour morale is broken. especially when we hear of boys who have only been out here 18 months getting homewe are told there is no room on the boats. but what about the Australian brides. From the records I am reliably informed that many and perhaps most of the men and boys for whom I speak voted for the Commander in Chief on November 7. and therefore more than likely they did not vote for me. It must be obvious that no political motive prompts me to speak. but only a desift to let these men know that every Member of Congress who in his campaign for reelection appealed for servicemens support was not indulging in mere campaign oratory. I am near the end of my allotted time today and my time in office is only a matter of a few days. It is my hope to get action before I leave. surely. I trust. in time for some of these men to get home by Christmas. But for the others. evidently it will take looking after. I shall be happy to turn over the correspondence to whoever will take up the work. The matter is worthy of the attention of every Member of this House. I cannot leave the well of this Chamber today without taking the opportunity to pay my respects to the Members of the House. To me it is worthy of mention that I have invariably received on this floor full measure of consideration and recognition from our honorable Speaker. and every courtesy and many kindnesses from the Members on both sides of the aisle. In my 2 years here I have been blessed with many warm friendships and scores of pleasant acquaintanceships. To have been afforded the honor of being a Member of the Seventyeighth Congress in the. midst of the great war is. to my mind. second only in honor to serving the country in uniform. which it was my privilege to do in World War No. 1 and which I. wanted to do again in this war. I confess I lay down my duties here with reluctance. because I believe it is a distinction. as well as a pleasure. to be of service to others. It is a source of pride to me to observe that my colleagues in Congress. each according to his ability and opportunity. serve their districts with painstaking care and with unstinted energy and constant attention to their duties. I am very proud to be numbered among those who have sat in thisthe truly representative body and the bulwark of the people and the greatest legislative assembly in the world. It has been a privilege to have taken my place here. to share with you in greeting and to listen to some of the great men and women of our time. Reluctant though I am to leave. I bear no ill will. personal or political. to anyone here or within my district. I am gratified that the electors in my district entrusted me with the duty of representing them in this Seventyeighth Congress. I gave them my best endeavors without fear or favor. I learned in military uniform to obey a proper order without question. and by that same token when the majority of the electors in my district speak I can but cheerfully hand over my duties to my successor. For the sake of the Third Connecticut District and our country. I can only wish him well. Mr. Speaker. to the Members present and absent. may I say: Fare thee well! And if forever.

In my State we are very proud of the program that is being fostered by the Office of Education. Twentyone cities have vocational training programs which are operated through 24 schools. The program in Tennessee has been successful. I wish that it could be greatly enlarged. I am glad the Appropriations Committee and Congress are so enthusiastically supporting the vocational training program for defense workers. I know that it may be possible at this time. but after the war I hope that the program will not only be continued but that it will be accelerated so that eventually we will have provisions for vocational training in the larger high schools and elementary schools throughout the country. Experience during recent years indicates that we need increased vocational facilities for the school children of America. The tendency is to specialize in some kind of trade or a vocation. This is a necessary result of the mechanical progress of our Nation. I do not mean to disparage the value of an ordinary highschool or college education. but I do think that more emphasis should be put upon vocational training. Many boys who have graduated from high school and college would be better off if part of their education had consisted of becoming a skilled technician in some trade or avocation. This program Is requiring the assimilation of much equipment and facilities. The question arises as to what will be done with this equipment when the war is over. I am glad the staff of the Department of Education is giving study to this matter. I hope that they will conclude that provisions should be made for the use of the equipment in elementary and high schools. and that Congress will sustain a continuation of the program by making appropriations so that the equipment In these schools may be put to good use. I am heartily in favor of the resolution. and I hope that it may be passed without a dissenting vote."},{"1":"7.700378e+08","2":"1941","3":"H","4":"PATRICK","5":"134","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Just as soon as I finish this sentence I will yield to the gentleman.

Indiana limestone is the best building stone in the world. You will find Hoosier stone in many of the most imposing structures in Washington and elsewhere in the country. It lends itself readily to architectural treatment and combines the qualities of permanence and beauty. Indiana limestone competes with other materials strictly on its merits and its Nationwide use is evidence of its quality. In the past 7 years the Indiana limestone industry has had a slump in largescale construction. It is one of the hardest hit industries in the United States today. Many of our stone workers are out of jobs. Counties in the limestone belt have great numbers on the relief rolls. The farmers and businessmen are in distress in these communities. By using Indiana limestone our Govern:nent will benefit because of tremendous savings and a better product. I contend that more Indiana limestone should be used in the construction of Federal buildings. I have read something about the use of marble and the glories of ancient Greece and Rome. While this makes nice reading. I believe that we are interested more in the solid prosperity of America. Furthermore. as building material. Indiana limestone will compare with the best. ancient or modern. It is already embodied in the construction of the following beautiful buildings in Washington: Archives. Departments of Justice. Labor. Internal Revenue. Commerce. Post Office. Apex. and the Carnegie and Brookings Institution Buildings. The Indiana limestone buildings typify the progress and modern soundness of America as well as its glory.

I yield myself 10 additional minutes. Mr. Chairman. I have no fault whatever to find with the Civil Service Commission as at present constituted. I think they are doing a good job with the tools we have given them to operate With and under the laws by which they are bound. but I want to reecho what I have said before on the floor of the House. that in my judgment it should be possible by some kind of standardized examination to eliminate hundreds of thousands of these examinations that are held all over the country that mean absolutely nothing to the citizens. that hold out false hopes of employment. and that get us nowhere. The Civil Service Commission now is piled full of these examinations they have held. because they do not have the personnel to grade the papers. Some way should be found to some extent to standardize certain types of examination under which they could have information and registers that would be available for different purposes. As it is now. if the Federal Securities Exchange Commission want lawyers. the Civil Service Commission holds an examination for them. if the Federal Communications Commission want lawyers. the Civil Service Commission holds another examination for them. and so on throughout all the departments and agencies. It seems to me a standard law examination could be given and that the Civil Service Commission could have a card index there showing the lawyers name and his various fields of endeavor. This would show the department heads whether he fitted in the department or not. Examinations could be held and indexes could be made in the same way on the clerical and stenographic forces. I think this presents a wonderful opportunity for some coordination of effort or elimination of duplication that would save a lot of money and bring about so much more efficiency in the selection of Government employees. On the floor of the House yesterday my distinguished friend. the gentleman from Massachusetts . said he proposed to move to strike out the phrase laborsaving devices wherever the phrase appears in the bill. He added that he had been informed that the Civil Service Commission were experimenting with an electric eye for use in grading certain standard mental tests in order to save time. and that his information was that 130 people would lose their jobs. I told him I could relieve his mind. that we had appropriated sufficient money for the Civil Service Commission to carry the full complement of personnel through 1938 that they had in 1937.

I could not escape the wish that the Republican Party might have been half as virtuous in office as it is when out of control of the Government. I do not always disagree. however. with my Republican colleagues. Occasionally one expresses a wish or hope that I am glad to agree with. That occurred on the 30th of last month when the gentleman from Massachusetts expressed the hope that the Republican convention would adopt an aggressive antireciprocity program. If the gods that make men mad will just reserve a little activity for that convention and do two things. see that the convention nominates the gentleman from Kansas for President and see that that convention adopts an aggressive antireciprocity program. twothirds of the battle to reelect President Roosevelt will already have been accomplished. By the time the radio. the press. and the public speakers get about halfway through this campaign. with the Governor from Kansas leading the Republican Party. and the people begin to see his utter bankruptcy of background and the complete absence of capacity for Presidential office. instead of the managers of the Republican Party keeping him west of Ohio. as they have at the present time. they will want to do something like they did in 1920. conduct a frontporch campaign. except in this case I believe it will be a backporch campaign. By the time Mr. Hearst with his movietone and all the Hearst papers proceed with their futile buildup. our own children become fully acquainted with the facts in the coming campaign. they will come home to us some evening after reading the papers and say. Father. during this campaign if Governor Landon should die. would Mr. Hearst still be candidate for President? I do not believe the gentleman from Massachusetts . when he asserted the hope that reciprocity be made an issue in this campaign. realized the water that has gone over the wheel since the days of the old full dinnerpall campaign. People in this country. through the activity of the Tariff Commission. are no longer as uninformed as they were a few years ago. They know something about reciprocity and the tariff now. If the Tariff Commission has done nothing else than educate the people and inform the press of this country. It has done a wonderful thing. Now. conceive the Republican Party setting out on an aggressive antireciprocity campaign with about twothirds of their newspapers already committed against it. with the United States Chamber of Commerce. or at least its officials. very much committed in favor of reciprocity. there will not be enough left of the Republican campaign on the question of reciprocity even to be interesting. The old days of tariff campaigns were very simple for the hightariff advocates. for the reason that they could talk in pictures that were easily grasped by children. whereas people advocating reciprocity or a low tariff had to talk in abstract ideas. Their textbook was political economy and contained but few pictures. As an example. the hightariff advocates talked about the evils of imports. The imports were here. tangible. visible. Even a childs mind could conceive the idea that local labor could manufacture that import if given an opportunity. The reciprocity advocate would talk about the desirability of exports. but the exports were shipped abroad. out of sight. intangible. and it was a very difficult thing to convince anybody that there was anything to be gained by something that was out of the country. Even people who produced for export had no idea at the time they were doing so. If they did they could see no connection between importing Spanish grapes or Swiss cheese and the commodity they exported."},{"1":"7.400696e+08","2":"1935","3":"H","4":"WILLIAM GREEN","5":"521","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"President American Federation of Labor. Washington. D. C. DEAR MR. GREEN: Your letter of recent date was duly received. and I note what you say regarding the omission of Puerto Rico from the provisions of H. R. 7260. the socialsecurity bill. It is true that the original bill included Puerto Rico in some of the titles and was excluded in others. among which was the title dealing with unemployment insurance. -During the consideration of the bill -in executive session the change was made so that the definition and treatment of Puerto Rico would be the same as under our revenue laws. inasmuch as the bill contains provisions providing for income and excise taxes. This was done because Puerto Rico has its own tax law and does not pay any taxes into the Treasury of the United States. The committee felt that this change should be made in view of the fact that many of the benefits provided in the bill were dependent in a great measure upon the tax features. It was felt that questions involved in this matter might be ironed out later. I regret my delay in acknowledging receipt of your letter. Such delay has been due to the fact that my time has been almost completely taken up for the past few days in connection with the consideration of the bill in the House. Yours very truly. R. L. DOUGHTON. Chairman. I want to quote from the address of the President some of the thoughts that are applicable to Puerto Rico as well as to the mainland. as follows: We find our population suffering from old inequalities. little changed by past sporadic remedies. In spite of our efforts and in spite of our talk. we have not weeded out the overprivileged and we have not effectively lifted up the underprivileged. Both of these manifestations of injustice have retarded happiness. No wise man has any intention of destroying what is known as the profit motive . because by the profit motive we mean the right by work to earn a decent livelihood for ourselves and for our families. In defining Immediate factors which enter into our quest. I have spoken to the Congress and the p5eople of three great divisions: 1. The security of livelihood through the better use of the national resources of the land in which we live. 2. The security against the major hazards and vicissitudes of life. 3. The security of decent homes. Closely related to the broad problem of livelihood is that of security against the major hazards of life. Here also a comprehensive survey of what has been attempted or accomplished in many nations and in many States proves to me that the time has come for action by the National Government. I shall send to you. in a few days. definite recommendations based on these studies. These recommendations will cover the broad subjects of unemployment insurance and oldage insurance. of benefits for children. for mothers. for the handicapped. for maternity care. and for other aspects of dependency and illness where a beginning can now be made.

I appreciate that this amendment was not submitted to the committee. nor were the amendments in the cases to which I have referred submitted to the committees having charge of the legislation. I do not conceive that to constitute any valid reason for the rejection of an amendment. Moreover. Mr. President. I think it is proper to suggest that this bill first received the consideration of five of the besttrained minds of the country with respect to the drafting of the bill. I need not name those men. They are well known to the subcommittee. One of them was to a large extent responsible for much of the language in the bill. This matter. of course. came to our attention when we heard former Governor Grosbeck. of Michigan. describe the Indianapolis Street Railway contest. and the committee had that information before it. Yet the committee did not turn its attention to the almost criminal acts which happened in that case. That is no fault of the committee. Their minds did not turn that way. I am sure my mind did not turn that way. nor did it occur to me that the Indianapolis Street Railway case presented a situation which was so grossly wrong until I undertook an investigation of the hearings preparatory to this debate. As I studied the testimony and the practices involved. my mind at once set upon the question of whether or not we could prevent that sort of thing. I went to the Clayton Act. and I found in that act that. where there was a violation of the act resulting in damage to anyone. the persons aggrieved would have the right to sue in court and obtain threefold damages. The Clayton Act does not set up any rule for determining the method by which those damages are to be assessed. There is no measure of damages set up in the Clayton Act. I know of no law imposing damages which sets up the rule for assessing the damages. There may be such. and I assume there are. but in most cases the rule as to damages is a rule which comes under rules of evidence. and usually they are not set up in the substantive law. So I followed exactly the proposal of the Clayton Act in this respect. We can not set up in this measure a detailed statement of the rules which are to prevail respecting the imposition of damages. That must be left to the court. The court will ascertain from the testimony just what expense the injured party. may have been put to. and assess the damages accordingly. That is the rule in practically all cases. both at law and in equity. Mr. President. at the outset of what I have been saying I mentioned the fact that our committee had the assistance of several men in this country. all specialists respecting labor legislation. distinguished men. After I had discussed the Indianapolis case on the floor of the Senate it occurred to me that we ought to have a provision in the bill. as a part of section 8. which would reach the very thing that we are intending to reach by the amendment. So I sent the preliminary draft to one of those men who so generously furnished of his time and his great ability in assisting the committee in drafting the bill. With the few changes that he made in the first paragraph respecting the very matter about which the Senator from Montana has submitted an amendment. I received the suggested draft. Mr. President. I am convinced that there is nothing technical about the amendment. The proposal in the amendment is identical with the proceeding in every case outside of labor disputes. If an injunction is obtained by a citizen against a municipal authority. we will say. for instance. restraining that municipal authority from undertaking certain public works. and that citizen complaining as a taxpayer is defeated in the injunctional proceeding. I doubt that there is a jurisdiction in the United States that does not provide that the defendant shall have the right to assessed damages against the complainant as soon as the injunction is dissolved upon a hearing. to assessed damages against the complainant not only for the actual loss of the defendant but for all the costs which the defendant has incurred. all the attorneys fees. and so forth. It is identically the same procedure. There is nothing technical about it. Practically every lawyer in the actual practice of the law has had experience respecting injunctions such as I have described. To my mind it is not of such character to warrant the defeat of the amendment simply because we feel that it is altogether too technical. My ownopinion is that the provision as contained in the amendment I have submitted does exactly what I think every Senator wants to do without the suggested amendment. but on the suggestion of the Senator from Montana. I appreciated that the language might be made a little more clear. might be made a little more desirable. I think. after all. that none of the things which have been suggested is ever going to happen to a bona fide workingman. The things that have been suggested are the things which are going to happen to the man who has betrayed his fellow workmen. who has sold himself out to his employers. who is a creature detestable in the eyes of every honest workingman. That kind of a workingman has ceased to be one of his fellow workers and has become a part of the conspiracy in connection with the employer to defeat the rights of the workingmen. Mr. President. my own feeling is that with the perfecting language. which I do not concede to be necessary. but with the suggestions of the Senator from Montana. the amendment ought to be adopted. The purpose is proper. The subject is not a technical one after all. I do not want to delay the Senate longer or to delay a vote longer. but simply because the committee has not passed on the matter. simply because we have not set forth the rules of damage. simply because somebody may trump up these imaginary cases. is no just reason why the amendment should be rejected."},{"1":"7.102981e+08","2":"1931","3":"S","4":"TYDINGS","5":"77","6":"Yes","7":"NA","8":"No. I will answer this one first.

I have the honor to write to your excellency to present to you the condition of our industry producing and exporting imitation pearls. in case the new entry duties on the said merchandise are given final approval by the Senate of the United States. Last year when the American commission charged with the study of the bill of tariff increases met. it changed the original bill in the sense of suggesting a fixed duty of 0.02 of a dollar per lineal inch of pearls. besides a 20 per cent ad valorem duty. instead of the original proposal to apply a 60 per cent duty on the assumed value of pearls manufactured in the United States. The proposed tariff of 2 cents. equivalent to about 0.14 of a peseta. besides 20 per cent ad valorem. equivalent to onehalf centimo (0.01 of a peseta). would mean a total charge of 14% centimos. or a duty of about 600 per cent on the price of origin while the still existing tariff applies 60 per cent on the value or origin or 1t4 centimos per inch of said article. From the foregoing it is understood that under the proposed tariff it would be impossible to import foreign pearls into the United States. La Industrfa Espafiola de Perlas de ITmitaci6n. S. A.. has four factories at Barcelona. Palma de Mallorca. Manacor. and Felanitz. giving work to some 12.000 workers. and of Its total production more than 60 per cent is exported to the United States. If a new increase in duties should be made in the United States in the manner anticipated. the Industria Espatiola de Perlas de Imitaci6n would be forced to reduce its production and personnel by at least half of its present figure. In view of this situation the Government of His Majesty wishes to make it clear to the Government of the United States and to its Tariff Commission that the disproportionate increase provided for the said article would cause a very serious crisis for our manufacturers. with the consequent dismissal of 6.000 persons now employed in the manufacture of pearls in Spain. How much more desirable would a fairer treatment of this merclhandise be. inasmuch as the production of imitation pearls in the United States is very small in comparison with the enormous market for this product in the United States. For the above reasons the Government of His Majesty hopes that the Tariff Commission and the Senate will maintain the type of tariff in force or will accord better treatment to this product than the new duties anticipated.

Ever since I have been living alongside the -bay. which is about as long as I have been living anywhere. each year there has been a limitation on the number of ducks. but so far as I have been able to observe the number has been about constant. Ducks do not come to the same spot every year any more than people go to the same theater every night. Conditions of atmosphere and climate and the feed that they live on vary over the United States. sometimes bringing to us great numbers in one season. while in the next season we do not have as many. But I would like to say to the Senator from New Jersey that I have on a number of occasions looked out on Chesapeake Bay and have seen 4 to 5 solid miles of white swan sitting in a single row. We can not kill a swan because there is a closed season all the year around on swan. and yet the swan. which is a very active bird. has dug tremendous holes in the celery beds on the Susquehanna flats and destroyed large quantities of feed. so that the ducks no longer come and use those particular spots as they once did. because the swan sits there all day long. unmolested. and doing nothing but digging up tremendous amounts of duck feed. which floats away down the bay and is destroyed. I believe that it would be an act of conservation to permit a gunner to kill two or three swan every year. and no gunner will kill more than a dozen. because that is one bird which has a very fine college education when it comes to eluding the hunter. We can not compare this year with last year. but I would say in the main that the number of ducks has been as constant as we could reasonably ask. and that there has been no great decrease and no great increase. Some seasons there are lots of ducks. hundreds of thousands of them. Other seasons there are not quite so many.

I do believe in the theory of the billthat the American farmer is entitled to a price oi that part of the product consumed in America comparable to the price that is paid to industry and labor for their products. Is there anything unsound about that? Who will sny that the producer of the foodstuffs of America. that feed all of our people. is not entitled to am American price for that part of the product which is consumed by the American people? He pays the American price for everything he consumes. and lie is the greatest consumer of all classes of people in America. That is the principle on which the Haugen bill is drafted. If the thing we are attempting to do is proper and right for the farmer. it can not be unsound economically. If a plan can be devised where the farmer bearing his own cost. at his own expense. can be enabled to market domestically at a fair American price the part of the crop used here. that can not be economically unsound. Of course. as to the part sold in export. we are not going to dump it at a low price in other parts of the world. we will sell it for whatever it will bring in the world market. Here has been the great difficulty and is the problem we are trying to solvewhen we produce 800.000.000 bushels of wheat in the United States we consume 600.000.000 bushels. leaving 200.000.000 that must be sold in export to foreign trade. We are not able to control the world market on wheat. and the producers of wheat sold in the world market will have to take such price as hey can get for that part of their crop. but is it fair to the farmer. is it right. that the small percentage that is used in export. which is often sold for less than production. shall be allowed to depress the American market for 600.000.000 bushels sold in this country? We are trying by this machinery to obviate that. Men who have given this great study. able men. say that it is economically sound to enable the American farmer to so market his product. to so control his supply and market it in an orderly way. that lie will have the same bargaining power that others have in other industries.

These increases provided the railroads with about four of each five dollars of net operating return for 1923. Among the increases granted was the surcharge. which is an additional charge for Pullman transportation. of an annual value of about $37.000.000 to the passenger carriers. This surcharge was imposed by the Interstate Commerce Commission in attempting to carry out the policy established by the transportation act. It is now proposed to eliminate this part of the earnings of the railroads by congressional action. Criticism of the method of imposing the charge is not fundamental. The Pullman passenger buys transportation. plus the accommodations afforded by the Pullman car. Part of the burden of this increased service received by the Pullman passenger is borne by tile Pullman Co. and part by the railroad company. It might have been more logical to have raised the two old charges. one for transpotation and the other for the Pullman service. so as to produce an equivalent revenue. The injection of the surcharge as a third charge tends to confuse consideration of the Issue. but it is a confusion of terms rather than substance. The term surcharge smacks of taxes and war impositions in the mind of the traveling public. It is neither. The surcharge was imposed for the purpose of supplying revenue to the roads. contributing to the fund for their maintenance and the production of the fair return provided by the transportation act. The only substantial question involved on a basis of merit is whether or not the Pullman surcharge is a necessary and reasonable charge against the Pullman passengers. For the purpose of argument let us assume the charge is unreasonably high. Does that justify congressional interference to change the rate? If we adopt the policy of interposing Congress to eliminate unreasonable rates. we will make Congress an appellate court above the Interstate Commerce Commission to pass on the reasonableness of individual rates and all rates. Congress should not do this for two fundamental reasons. In the first place. it is a large nontechnical body. having neither the time nor disposition to deal judiciously with the details of ratemaking questions. In the second place. the very essence of our ratemaking policy Is to leave administration to the ratemaking body. the Interstate Commerce Commission. It is the only experienced. skilled body adequately equipped to deal with ratemaking administration. If tie assumption that a rate established by the commission is erroneous or unreasonably high shall be accepted as a sufficient reason for congressional supervision or veto. then every shipper or passenger dissatisfied with rates may regard Congress as his open forum. It is the function of Congress to establish railroad policies. including regulatory rate making. It is the function of the commission to execute the policies established by Congress.  The country is committed to the theory of regulatory control of railroads. If regulation fails. Government ownership is the next alternative. The Interstate Commerce Commission must be permitted to exercise a broad. discretionary power. Like even the Supreme Court of the United States. it may make mistakes. but its power must be exercised if we are to have successful regulation. It must not be hampered in the performance of Its functions. either by arbitrary limitations set up at the whim of Congress or by making Congress the appellate court above the Interstate Commerce Commission. Such a policy would be an invitation to all dissatisfied groups of passengers and shippers to resort to Congress with increasing frequency and persistence. Whether or not the Pullman surcharge Is maintained or eliminated is not of primary importance. It is of fundamental importance to maintain the functioning of our ratemaking body. it is of fundamental importance to the solution of the railroad problem that vitally concerns the agricultural. economic. and industrial life of America. The members of the Interstate Commerce Commission have a very important and a very burdensome task. It requires ability. patience. and great skill. The commission is a nonpolitical body. It must be kept so. Congress is a political body. Appeals for its participation in rate making are largely appeals to political motives. The political body must not he made the appellate court of the nonpolitical body."},{"1":"6.801295e+08","2":"1924","3":"H","4":"CONNALLY","5":"879","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Not just now. I can notyield in five minutes. but I will try to yield later. I am wondering why the leader of the farm bloc waits until about a week or 10 days before the Congress is to adjourn before he is able to persuade his party in his capacity as leader of the farm bloc to bring in some kind of legislation in behalf of the farmer. Is it because the gentleman knows that it is now too late to enact any legislation in behalf of the farmer. or is it because the gentleman has just now realized that there is something really the matter with the farmer that ought to be relieved? The gentleman a little while ago discoursed learnedly on tile law of supply and demand. While I do not think from his utterances on economic questions. he knows much about the economic law of supply and demand. I do believe he thoroughly understands the political law of supply and demand. I think he recognizes a political demand. a demand for political expediency. as quickly as anyone. and that the gentleman also knows how to furnish a supply of political quackery at the right moment when it is needed for political purposes. When I heard the gentleman stand here on this floor and tell about the industries of the East. of Pittsburgh and other points. being built up at the expense of the Anerican farmer. I almost wept as I heard him describe the prostrate condition of agriculture today. and saw him then dramatically point to New England and Pittsburgh and the other industrial centers which he said had grown rich beyond the dream of avarice at the expense of the poor downtrodden American farmer. principally those farmers who have registered duly and legally for the next coming election. As I saw the gentleman shedding tears in behalf of the farmer. and when I heard him telling how the industrial East and the great industrial centers were reaping the profits from the toil and the labor of the farmers out In Iowa and in the Middle West. my mean. cruel memory rose up in the secret precincts of my mind and said. Can that be the same friend of the farmer who. in July. 1922. when the roll was called up yonder on the FordneyMcCumbertariff bill. stood up In his place. representing the farmers of Iowa. the poor. oppressed. downtrodden. exploited farmers. and voted aye in behalf of the FordneyMcCumber tariff bill that destroyed the markets of the farmer in Europe and built up the highest Chinese wall ever erected in the history of any country and thereby said to the farmer. You have got to sell your goods in a world market. but we will make you buy In a restricted market. we will give the industries of the East and the great centers a monopoly whereby they can say to Mr. Farmer.  Come up and buy what you have got to buy in this monopolistic market. but take your agricultural products. Uncle Reuben. and sell them in the markets of the world.  Sell them in the world market said the gentleman in 1922. We are investigating the Shipping Board and that investigation has developed that one reason why American ships can not operate today at a profit is that while we have cargoes going abroad we can not get any cargoes coming back. because the American farmer is not permitted to buy in the world market. He is not permitted to buy French steel or German steel or British steel that goes into his agricultural implements or the railroads which he must support. The gentleman now having committed that crime against the farmer comes up and wants to undo it. Having lifted industry and manufactures by one leg and put it on a high pinnacle. unbalancing the economic arrangement. he is trying to pull the poor farmer up by the boot straps and put him on an equality when he knows he can not do it. Why. the gentleman ought to know that the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. LucE]. for whose constituents lie voted this iniquitous tariff. for the constituents of the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. T.EADWAY]. and the gentleman from Connecticut . the gentlenman from Iowa ought now to know that Mr. LucE stated on the floor that he was not going to vote for the McNaryHaugen bill because it would cost the citizens of Waltham. Mass.. $80.000 annually. I think reciprocity ought to obtain. I think if the gentleman from Iowa votes to give $80.000 of the money of the people of Iowa to Waltham the gentleman from Massachusetts ought to vote to return an equal amount. But such is not to be in the nature of things. That is not the way the tariff works. The gentleman is salving his conscience because he knows the bill will never pass through the Congress before adjournment and he will be happy because in his candidacy this fall for Vice President. and as leader of the farm bloc. he will have a platform of political promises as to what lie will do and political pride as to what he tried to do. and yet the country will be saved because he knows the legislation will not be enacted."},{"1":"6.703726e+08","2":"1923","3":"S","4":"PHIPPS","5":"244","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"At that time I was not a resident of Washington. I was a resident of the city of Denver. and I know what happened there. The War Labor Board ordered that the tramway lines there pay increased rates of compensation to their employees. The average increase in the city of Denver. as my recollection serves me. was about 60 per cent in the wages of labor. Those rates of pay were put into effect. Coincidentally the War Labor Board. having no right to order an increase in the passenger fares or rates. strongly recommended to the authorities of the city of Denver that permission be granted to increase the rates of fare. I remember the telegram that was sent by the joint chairmen of the War Labor Board. The city authorities refused that permission. claiming a 5cent fare contract similar to the one to which the Senator referred here. The business was conducted on the 5cent fare for less than two years. when the company went into the hands of receivers. just as the New York transportation companies finally went into receiverships. That question is being thrashed out today. When the Denver company went into the hands of receivers and the United States court took jurisdiction the court ordered an increase in fares so that the company might be compensated for the extra outlay ordered by the War Labor Board. The question is now up for determination in the Supreme Court of the United States."},{"1":"6.702248e+08","2":"1922","3":"S","4":"SIMMONS","5":"91","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President.

Congress has adopted that policyin fact. it was pursued during the World Warand appropriations for rivers and harbors have been reduced to a very low point and the commencement of new enterprises has been avoided. Good roads are important. but they are in the same class. It is a legitimate form of expenditure. it is a needed form of expenditure. but it is not immediate. and we are not warranted. in my opinion. in taking a hundred millions at this time and spending it for good roads. I think they can wait. We have cut down with great severity the appropriations for the Army and Navy. which I regard as absolutely necessary expenditures for any government which means to protect itself against dangers which may come to any nation. We have cut the Army below a point which seems to me safe. We have cut the Navy down to such a point that work on necessary ships such as the battle cruisers and the airplane carriers has been either stopped or slackened. To my thinking this is exactly like a man who economizes by giving up his insurance. whether on his house or on his life. I think these reductions for our Army and Navy have been carried too far already. but to cut down the naval appropriations $100.000.000 below what is needed to complete in a reasonable time our building program and give us such a Navy as we should possess under present conditions is an economy of the most dangerous kind. When we make such reductions as these and such reductions for the Army as we have made it is wholly indefensible to take all we have saved on the Navy and spend it for good roads. which are instruments of prosperity and convenience. but which are not an insurance of our safety or a security for our peace. I know well how much the whole community. rich and poor. are suffering from the economic conditions produced by the war. It is an utter mistake to suppose that those sufferings are confined to one portion of the country or to one occupation. I know how much the farmers and planters have suffered from these economic conditions. but the suffering is just as serious in the great industrial States of the North and East. which stretch from the valley of the Mississippi to our eastern coast. Our factories are working on half time. quarter time. even. some of them are closed. and every reduction of time and every closed mill means unemployment on a large scale. There is one city in New England which had great activities during the war. a city of some 160.000 people. and I was informed the other day by one of the officers of the labor commission of the State that in that one city there were 28.000 people out of employment at that moment. Take a single instance in my own State. The Fore River yards. in the town of Weymouth. adjoining the city of Quincy. were. of.course. enormously busy duing the war. A large laboring population came there. The Government appropriations for work in those yards. which are private yards. have. of course. been reduced. War appropriations can not possibly be maintained. But the result is that in that neighborhood 3.000 men have been laid off within the last month. That means a great deal of distress of the most immediate kind. actual distress not known to agricultural populations. which at least can always feed and house themselves. The Fore River yards are only an example of the condition in a greater or less degree in nearly every industry of the Northern and Eastern States. We have not come here to ask for appropriations froni the Treasury. but we have a right to expect that new and large appropriations of the public money. involving the maintenance or the increase of taxes. shall not be added to our burdens. The condition of unemployment is very alarming and is increasing. All thinking men must look forward with apprehension to the coming winter. The great need of employment can really be effectively met in only one way. and that is by a general revival of business activities. to which all our efforts should be directed. The prosperity of the great industrial States is just as essential to the farming and agricultural interests as their prosperity is to us. We are all bound together. I realize that good roads are perhaps more needed in the open spaces and over the long distances of the South and the far West than they are in the more densely populated regions of the North and Eist. but as we are all suffering together. as our hopes for better times. which I believe to be approaching. are the same hopes. so we must all bear our burdens together. In one word. where the expenditure of public money is not absolutely necessary for the defense and security of the country or to carry on the Government in the most economical manner possible. it should not be indulged in now. Our prosperity will return and .we then can make liberal appropriations. as we have done In the past. for the development not only of our roads but of our rivers and harbors. but this is not the time to make them. I can not support. as I have been trying to support. all efforts for proper reductions of appropriations and for rigid economies. intelligent economies. and then vote at this time for a great appropriation like this which will take $100.000.000 out of the Treasury of the United States for an object which is most excellent. but which can without injury await the coming of a better day. That day. in my judgment. will not long be postponed if we face the situation as we should. for after all. Mr. President. the safety and prosperity of America will come from the source from which it has always come. from the -thrift and energy. the determination. and courage of the American people."},{"1":"6.601620e+08","2":"1920","3":"S","4":"KENYON","5":"458","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. the amendment of the Senator from Mississippi . of course. destroys the purpose of the bill. and its adoption would be equivalent to defeatifig the bill. I do not know whether that is the intention of it or not. I have noticed in the debate that those who are opposed to the whole proposition continually refer to the work being done by the Department of Labor as being exactly the same work. and this being a duplicate of that. Some of these gentlemen. I think. opposed that provision for the Department of Labora $200.000 appropriation for the Department of Labor for 2.000 schools. it is claimed. That would be $100 a school. What kind of a school are you going to have with a $100 appropriation for the payment of the teachers for a number of months? Of course. there is a general impression that you can employ teachers for about nothing. That work is confined solely to preparing men for naturalization. It has been attempted to take over this entire matter by the Department of Labor. but it -is now being used solely as an argument. by those who are opposed to this bill. to destroy the bill. It is not a duplication of work. It is carried on there in a small way. There is no great. broad purpose as in the case of this bill. and it ought to be entirely in the hands of one department. and that ought to be the Bureau of Education. It seems to me the mistake the Senator from Mississippi makes. in compelling these men to pay for their education ind to pay for attending school in a land where we pride ourselves upon fr~e schools. is that this work is not entirely for the benefit of the men who are learning the English language. or are being educated. This bill is on the theory that ignxorance and illiteracy is a danger to this country. a danger to us. a danger to our institutions. the greatest danger that we have. a greater danger than any danger from the outside. and the purpose of this bllistb protect ourselves and our country. not to educate these men merely for their own gratification or their own advancement. That is the error. it seems to me. in the argument as made by. the Senator from Mississippi. It seems to me that if this is adopted We may as Well abandon .the whole proposition. It is contrary to the genius of our institutions. it is contrary to our great system of free schools. and while there are plenty of foreigners who can pay for this education. they can just as well pay for the education of their children. and we do not require that of them."},{"1":"6.601221e+08","2":"1919","3":"H","4":"SWEET","5":"304","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I beg pardon.to. the. full committee.

I was referring when interrupted to the extravagant appropriations that have been made by the present administration. The figures that I quoted here in the very beginning show that one Congress. the very first Congress held under this administration. increased the appropriations $210.000.000. and there were not any items in those appropriations providing for the defense of the country. either. In this connection we must not forget that the balance of trade against the United States during the four months preceding the war. at a time when the Democratic policies and a tariff law were in full force. was $248.000.000. A couple of more such four months and conditions such as obtained in 1894 to 1897. under the Wilson tariff law. would have been repeated. only in a magnified form. and at the same time the Government revenues were failing to meet Government expenses by approxinately $1.000.000 per day. Eliminate the market created by a temporary. artificial European demand and American industry would be prostrated. The first industries of the country to suffer from the present Democratic tariff law when conditions are again normal will not be the powerful corporations and great trusts. but the thousands of manufacturers with small capital. independent concerns making such goods as require the highest type of workmen and workmanship. In fact. I might say that as soon as the war is over and things become normal and the vast armies. of men. women. and children are again put to work manufacturing articles of commerce. in order to keep body and soul together. with the only country able to pay for their wares. namely. America. God help our industries and our workingmen who will have to compete with such conditions. It is for this class of American workmen and industries that I am interested and I now tell all such that the only safe way to protect themselves is to see that the party that believes in protection is restored to power. In the past I have visited the leading industrial countries of the world and have seen there the value placed upon human labor. I have seen the poverty. the squalor and suffering to which the laborer is subjected. and I shrink from contemplating what it will be after the present European war is ended. I have seen the effect of such conditions on the men. women. and children of those countries. and I have made a vow that no act of mine shall ever place an American workman in a position of having to compete with such conditions.

There never was any legal liability on the part of the Government. and there never was any moral liability on the part of the Government. but we were told that under the peculiar circumstances of tie case. the Government having received the benefit of the work which was done. we ought to pay for these supplies. because the people who furnished them were poor and could not afford the loss. and we were especially appealed to in behalf of a very pleasant and sincere woman.

The Washington Loan & Trust Co. swearing to the value of their banking house and fixtures set down the figure as $695.555.92some degree of accuracy. it will be noticed. We find this property assessed at $322.895. less than 50 per cent. though the law fixes the minimum at 66j. The Union Trust Co.. a total assessment of $575.642. sworn value. $1.018.532.92. The Washington Gas Light Co.. an old friend of this House. assessed at $2.848.861and they called a witness before the District Committee to swear as to the value of their plant. and he. Prof. Humphreys. of New York. said that the plant was worth $9.000.000. and that the business. including the good will. was worth $13.000.000. and here it is assessed $2.848.861. There is no excuse for this. because that company in addition to that has to report once a year to this Congress."},{"1":"6.101112e+08","2":"1910","3":"H","4":"CAMPBELL","5":"139","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker.

It has been expected that the tariff would be reduced and the iron men generally of the country have conceded that a cut of 15 cents per ton. from 40 cents down to 25 cents. ciould ibe made without serious detriment to the mining interests of the United States. and at this figure during the coming years the revenue to the Government may possibly be increased somewhat. Ihere seems to be an impression that any duty retained on ore will inure to the special benefit of the Steel Corporation. and that the independent interests of the country might be helped if the duty was entirely removed. The fact is. however. that during recent years the independent companies have made the bulk of the pig iron for the open market and have to a large extent interested themselves in ore properties and have put up many millions of dollars to develop them so that they wouli have sources of supply. The furnace companies In which we are interested. with 10 different stacks. located in Illinois. Ohio. New York. and Pennsylvania. formed a company some time ago with $1.000.000 capital. and since then have formed another with $300.000 capital for the purpose of developing mines in the Lake Superior district. The Empire Steel and Iron Company. in Iennsylvania. of which the writer is a director. owning 8 blast furnaces. has spent a large amount of money also in developing local ore mines for its own use. and what we have done has been done by other blastfurnace people on a large scale. While the Steel Corporation may be benefited by a duty on ore. its position is such that we believe it can do business at a profit at prices which would put the rest of us out of the running. and it is in behalf of the independents that we are writing you. So far as we are able to learn free ore might help a few of the steel plants that have blast furnaces located on the seaboard or in the extreme East. who would draw their supply from Cuba and other points where they could get their mining done at prices for labor impossible in this country. If reports are true. those parties can well afford to pay a duty of 25 cents per ton on the ores they may bring in from Cuba and Spain. and the Government. we believe. is justly entitled to that amount of revenue from the ore Imported. There is certainly no reason why the United States should foster and help develop mines In other countries and by so doing either shut down the mines here or force a radical cut in wages. We believe that a duty on ore is a legitimate means of raising money to help pay the expenses of the Government. and that it is a taxthat is borne in a very slight degree. if at all. by the Workingmen of this country. while to the extent that it increases our mining interests at home it is a direct benefit to the working classes. We -trust you may find it consistent to vote for a duty of 25 cents per ton on ore. There has been considerable discussion about reducing the rate on imported scrap down to 50 cents per ton. This has apparently been brought about by the efforts of a comparatively few consumers In the East. who get -protection on their manufractured output. but vho desire to get their socalled  raw material  free. We believe that an Investigation of this subject will convince you that as scrap is used in the place of pig iron it should bear the same rate of duty that may be fixed on pig ion. which we trust will not be less than $3 per ton. Hindly pardon us for writing you at such length. but these matters directly concern hundreds of thousands of employees and many millions of dollars that have been invested by the manufacturers.

With grateful ear. sir. I have heard from his colleagues in the House of Representatives upon a former day. and in the Senate today. time beautiful and touching tributes of those who knew RUFUS E. LEsrEM so well. and. because they thus knew him. esteemed and loved him so. much. It is in no perfunctory and formal observance that I lay upon his bier my offering of affection. If length of duration is the measure of friendship. then was I in that relation with him second to but few. for ours was the friendship not of a few years. it was the uninterrupted. close friendship of a long lifetime. I have. known hih much longer than any other with whom he has been associated in either House of Congress. I recall vividly my first acquaintance with him when I. a college boy upon my vacation in Savannah. met him. then an eager young lawyer just entering upon the practice of his professionin the flush of vigorous young manhood. his cheek ruddy with health. the glow of expectancy lighting his eye as of one girded for the mastery. I shall ever remember the admiration and pardonable envy with which I then regarded him. While he Was only a few years older than myself. still he had crossed the divide upon which as a boy my view was strained--the line to tile boy and the youth of all time as distinct and alnost as distant to his impatience as the horizonthe line which separates the schoolboy from the dignity. the liberty. the opportunity of recognized manhood. with its associations in the responsible affairs of life. The acquaintaince then made ripened into in ardent personal friendship which lasted without interruption through all the long succeeding years until time sun had passed tile meridian and the lengthening shadows told of the evening of life. Imnediately after that early meeting came the tragic conflict of civil war. and in its thunder clouds and storms and smioke and dust we were at times hidden the one from the other. but through its diii and uproar there came to tle time and again tidings of the gallantry of the youthful LESTzRhow otn anity a sanguinary field his sword had flashed in the forefront: how at Chicktinauga he won the plaudits of the men and tile praise of his commanding officer. how two horses on that fateful day had fallen under him. and how. mounting the third. lie. undismayed iii that carnage of death. rode to victory at the head of the charging legions. The South had no son whose consecration of life and all to her cause was more unreserved than was his. and while the fortune of war did not require from him the highest sacrifice which a soldier can make and which he so freely dared. still more than once his blood was poured out a libation in her cause. and when that cause was finally lost. aiong the most active of those whose efforts. in the succeeding years of trial and unwearied toil. rehabilitated the South. restored her industries. and rebuilt the altars of her social order was RuFUS E. LESTER. Only those who endured its trial call realize the anguish of that day. with hopes crushed. the highest endeavor and the grandest sacrifice lost in defeat. the land sodden with the blood of its sons. and a universal material desolation on every hand. withScarce a rose of the wilderness left on its stalk. To tell where the garden had been. IHeroic men and still more heroic women were they who then defied despair and nerved themselves to the herculean task of restoration. I would not now speak a word of eritninatiou. but by all it is now conceded. lit the kindly feeling of the present. that the humiliation of the South. in the reconstruction measures was an unforttnate political mistake. one which those who took pirt in enacting them now freely say they Would not repeat. Ti events of that day are not pleasamt either to recite or to retmenber. But they summoned the men and wometn of the South to the rescue of their local governments from those elemuents which were destroying tile material interests. overturning the social fabric. and blotting out the civilization of that fair land. There was a saturnalia of public plunder and political debauchery. In each Southern State the cry for rescue rang out through its borders. Among the foremost who sprang to tile call was LESTER. battling sternly and untiringly to drive out the despoilers. Georgia was the first of the reconstructed States to restore her government to the control of her own people. Within three years after the organization of the reconstruction State governments a legislature was elected by the white voters which was representative of property interests. social order. and of a civilization to be restorel. When it assenibled at the State capital the members found the executive chair vacant. The governor had absconded between two suits and left for parts then unknown. In that and three succeeding legislatures LESTERl was a mnemnber of the Senate. A most difficult and untried task devolved upon the legislature of the State during the years succeeding the reconstruction period. With practically all personal propI erty destroyed and with the value of real estate reduced to a InimIliMuln. in three years of misrule a mountain of debt had been piled upon the State. At its close. with exhausted resources. an empty treasury was on one hand and a bankrupt public credit was upon the other. In matters social and political old things had passed away. and the legislation to be enacted must be adjusted to new conditions in their unparalleled incongruities and everincreasing antagonisms. To restore the lost credit of the State. to rebuild anew a social fabric upon the wreck and ruins of a former civilization. to reopen the educational institutions. and set again in motion the industries which war had stricken down. to insure the supremacy and control of the virtue. the intelligence. the integrity. and the property interests of the State. and to frame and to guard and protect all against the license of the ignorant and the vicious which under evil influences threatened oii every handthis was the task. the magnitude and perplexing difficulty of which can at this distance be scarcely imagined. But in the eight or ten years which followed this apparently impossible task was accomplished. and upon those desolate ruins there has arisen a new civilization which is not inferior to that which preceded it. and there has been builded a new prosperity and aL new wealth greater than those of the former day. In this invaluable work of constructive statesnaship in a field of legislation for which there were no precedents upon which to model the work LESTER was one of the master workmen. earnest. zealous. patient. determined. fertile ni resource. unvearied in effort. rhr.

A terrible condition is stated in the United Hebrew Charities report of 1901: A condition of chronic poverty is developing in the Jewish comnininity of New York that is appalling in its immensity. The report states that of the applicants asking the society for assistance 45 per cent. representing between t0 000 and 25.000 human beings. have been in tle United States over five years. have been given the opportunities for economic and industrial improvement which the country affords. yet. notwithstanding all this. have not managed to reach a position of economic independence. The report estimates that from 75.000 to 100.000 members of the New York Jewish community are unable to support themselves with the immediate necessities of life. and for this reason are depdndent in some form or other upon the public purse. Mr. Chairman. the ratio of paupers that come from those countries and have to be deported is very large. I will not weary the House with statistics. I have them here. and I will publish them in my remarks. They substantiate the statements that I make. The number of immigrants that have to be deported is very large from this section. but the great evil that is inflicted upon this country by those that come from southern Europe is that they remain almost entirely in the cities. They do not go out and occupy the farm lands. and when we know that in our own country. according to the reports of the census. the tendency is for people in the country to migrate toward the cities. you have got a double influx pouring into those thickly populated centers which certainly does not tend to the welfare of our people. I have collected some statistics from the State of New York which are official and which I believe to be correct. They show the influence and the result that this migration has upon our people. Of course I admit it is greater in the State of New York. because it is nearer to the principal entrepet where all these aliens land. but it is in proportional extent to Pennsylvania. and Massachusetts. and Rhode Island. and New Jersey. and Delaware. and the evil spreads in lesser degree throughout all the country. Those that entered in the fiscal year ending June 80. 1903. were 401.057. It is a wellestablished fact that in a little over a year 580 of these became a public charge upon the almshouses of New York. It costs the State of New York $80 a head for alms to sustain a pauper. and that puts a charge on that State of $46.400 annually to support these inmates who should properly be living in the almshouses of the countries from which they have migrated. In New York almshouses there were 66.400 in the year ending September 30. 1901. and of these 37.422 were foreign born. More than onehalf of the inmates of the almshouses of the State of New York were of foreign birth and being supported at a cost to the State of $15.941.622. and this is without counting the $5.000.000 expended in the insane asylums. where almost the same ratio prevails. The value of the property of the public charitable institutions of the State of New York is $68.177.725. and at 5 per cent that represents a cost of $3.408.886. or a total of $24.350.580 that it costs the State of New York to support these people in its charitable institutions. Taking that as against the figures I have already given. it makes a cost of $12.000.000 annually to the State of New York to support these immigrants which have so recently come into the country. Surely this is a showing that should cause the people of the United States to pause and think why this refuse of Europe. these paupers. who should be a charge on their own country. should be dumped on this Republic of ours. no matter how great our resources or how rich we may be. It is a wellknown fact that a few years ago Switzerland was detected in shipping. at the expense of the State. the paupers of that Republic and landing them on our shores to be supported by us. In the insane asylums of New York the inmates are increasing at the rate of 700 a year. and half of these are aliens. by actual statistics. At this rate in ten years it will cost the United States at large $50.000.000 annually to support the insane- aliens. In spite of the greatness of these figures that I have given. they do not include the charitable institutions and homes for children. which cost the State of New York $20.880.283 annually. The alien paupers in the State of New York are increasing at the rate of 1.200 a year. Now..Mr. Chairman. from a selfish standpoint we might shut ourselves up in our shells and say.  Well. New York gets all of these. and let her pay for it. But it is not limited to NewYork. These people are shipped out from that State. They go to other States and cities. and they become charges on the communities and inflict a tax upon the people of the United States at large. The gentleman from Massachusetts inquired a fdw moments ago if we had not laws by which to prevent the incoming of undesirable aliens. We have. Mr. Chairman. An act which was prepared with the greatest care last year from suggestions made by the Bureau of Immigration. by the Solicitor. by the efforts of the members of the committee. and by those who are interested in this work was passed. but we all know the inefficiency of laws. even with a desire on the part of the inspectors to do their duty. When these aliens arrive at the port of New York they are marked undesirable. Then there is an appeal. and they go up before the commission appointed by the Commissioner of Immigration. Then the local politicians and friends come forward. They pledge they will give them situations. They make them presents of money. Political influence is brought to bear to have them passed. and out of a large proportion that on the first examination are marked undesirable a very small percentage is actually deported. In the year ending June 2. 1902. less than fourfifths of 1 per cent were refused admittance. The statistics show that 30 aliens out of every 10.000 who come into this country become. in the course of time. objects of charity. while only 9 out of 10.000 natives become paupers and a charge on the community. I endeavored to get some statistics in regard to my own State of Pennsylvania on this subject. but I was not able to do so they. not having been collated with a view to furnishing information on this question. But my attention was called a short time ago to the facts disclosed in an effort to clear the streets of the city of Philadelphia of mendicants. when the secretary of the organized charity of that city made a report. founded on the collection of his statistics. that 95 per cent of the beggars on the streets of Philadelphia were of foreign birth. It will thus be seen that when we come to look at this matter from a practical standpoint it is a most serious question. Mr. Chairman. there were great difficulties presented in meeting the question how to overcome this evil. Our Republic is open to every honest. healthy man. to every man who desires to secure political and religious freedom. and I should be the last man who would want to shut the door against any of that class. But the difficulty has been how to leave the door open to the desirable ones and how to close it against those whom we do not want. I insert a table showing the sources of our immigration.. Country.

The farmer calls out for help. Last spring in Kansas they were offering $3 a day for hands in the fields. The cities want laborers. The builders of railroads. the diggers of canals. the builders of houses are always making this demand. Under the system of education in our country we are always lifting up each successive generation. If society is not supplied at the lowest stratum with manual labor. it will. in my judgment. become topheavy. We want immigrants from northern Europe. We want the Britons. and the Irish. and the Swedes. and the Germans. and the Danes. They are glorious peoplesturdy and hardy and sound. We want them We are prepared to welcome them to our country. But when we come to this class from southern Europeand twothirds of our immigrants come from therethe question is how can we cut down the immigration from this source? I have introduced the subjoined bill: A bill to limit the immigration of aliens into the United States. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled. That it shall be unlawful hereafter for more than 80.000 alens from any one nation to enter the United States during any fiscal year: Provided. That said restriction shall not apply to citizens and domiciled residents of the Dominion of Canada. the Republic of Mexico. and the Republic of Cuba. nor to aliens seeking admission temporarily in the pursuit of their business as representatives of foreign commercial or mercantile Ihouses. nor to the duly accredited representatives of foreign overnments and their official and household servants. nor to the classes of aliens enumerated in the last proviso of section 2 of the act entitled An act to regulate the immigration of aliens into the United States. approved March 3. 1903. Sec 2. That after the full quota from any one nation shall have been admitted to the United States in any one fiscal year. all other citizens or subjects thereof shall be refused admission and returned as provided by law in the case of other inadmissible aliens. SEC. 3. That any alien who shall enter the United States in excess of the number herein prescribed shall be arrested and deported as by law provided in the case of other aliens found unlawfully in the United States. SEc. 4. That it shall be the duty of the CommissionerGeneral of Immigration to enforce the provisions of this act and to adopt such rules and regulations as may be necessary for that purpose. all under the direction and with the approval of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor. and the expenditures incurred in so doing shall be paid from the permanent appropriation provided for in section 1 of the act enditled Anact to regulate immigration of aliens into the United States. approved March 3 1903. Sec. o. That the words United States. used in the title and the various sections of this act. shall be construed to embrace all territory. land or water. under the jurisdiction and control of the United States. SEc..6. That the term fiscal year. used herein. shall be held to begin with the 1st day of July of each calendar year and to end with the 30th day of June of the next succeeding calendar year. The main proposition is simply this: We can not lay down laws which would show discrimination in favor of one nation against another. Such legislation might be regarded as a violation of international comity and would be likely to elicit protests from the nations discriminated against. In my bill I have suggested the idea that immigration be limited to 80.000 souls from any one nation in any one fiscal year. The practical result of such a provision would be that it would affect only three countries. because no other country comes within that limitation by many thousands. AustriaHungary last year sent 206.011 immigrants to this country. Italy sent 230.622. and Russia sent 136.003. I will insert in my remarks the whole table of statistics on this subject. without wearying the House with them just now. I will state in brief that those are the only three nations that sent to our shores more than 40.000 immigrants per annum. up to last year. which was the maximum year of immigration to this country. So the enactment of this measure would simply mean that immigration from those three countries of Southern Europe would be very materially cut down. while the door would be left open to the countries whose people we wantnot only allowing them to come in as they do now. but to increase their immigratiob very materially. The effect of this bill cuts down immigration about 800.000."},{"1":"5.701168e+08","2":"1903","3":"H","4":"MR DILL","5":"885","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Dill. who has had very large experience in the organization of corporations. is the author of several works upon corporations. and was the attorney organizing the United States Steel Company. testifying upon the question of overcapitalization before the Industrial Commission. said: Q. From your experience in the organization of some of the large corporations. have you been able to form any judgment on the question of overcapitalization. as to whether or not they are in many cases capitalized for considerably more than the real value of the propertis put ta? A. If on will let me answer that questio n my own way. I will do so by saying that there are corporations and corporations. There are very many corporations. which we will call combines. which are organized on a basis that presents no dangerous asects to the public. but there are very many also organized with a good deal of capital that. in my judgment. if not intended riginaly for fraudulent purposes. will becoe the cause of fauduleat actionQ. Will you explain that a little more in detail? A I assume that there are corporations that are grossly overcapitalized for various reasons and with various purposes. Any corporation that is grossly overcap italized is presuenably organized in the first inistance for the purpose of yet iag the stock to the public. Now. in order to get such stock to the public. there must be either a misrepresentation of facts. or. what in my judgmeet is just as bad. a concealmient of material facts. and in my judgment in many of the socalled combines there is a conceulnent of matcrial facts. Q. Do you base your opinion on what has come under your own observation? A. Yes. it you do not take that answer to mean that I am of that opinion with respect to corporations I have organized myself. I have declined many organizations. Now. withoutcalling names atl. a corporation wabrought to my attentionI will say two months ago. so as not to bring it too nearconcerning which. after a carefufl examination of the assets. the consclusion was rceachcd in our ofice thatn$500.000wouldbeamiximum fairvalaalion.

Does this oveapitalization and misrepresentation. in your judgment. chiefly affect the buyers of stock. or does it affect the consumers of goods through pmices? A. it oftfects industry in genieral. and I can not agree with very! many of my colleagues. who say t the question of the amount if capitalization is simply a matter of adjiustent with tiepiblic. because the ordinary company largely capitalized. does not. as a rule. have the same directors as It has at first. It does not. as a rule. consist of exactly the same men the second year as the first. Now. whoever is in office as a director the first or second year feels it necessary. in order to keephis standing. and especially with concerns that have a Vall street end. cither to make a showing of a dividend earned or to declare one that is not earned. In other words. mo far as the race vith honest competitors is concerned. the fraudulently capitalized compay is hound to make an equal showing of honest earnings. and it iesults either in a robbing of the capital or in a resorting io aritificial sucains to euirms that dieidemid. which artificial meais comsi ly consist. in addition to putting up the price of material. in puttiiig down the piice of labor.

Inflation always. in iy judgment. leads to a material error and possible wrongdoing. Mr. Dills experience with great corporations has led him to the conclusion that publicity in connection therewith is both necessary and proper. In another part of his testimony before the Commission he made the following statement: The English law. which in my judgment will have to be passed in all States that desbe to stand as proper charterranting States is about as follows: All stock issued by any company. in w osesoever hands it shall bor shall come. shall be deemed to be held subject to be paid in full or in cash. unless before the stock is issued a contract shall havebeen filed in the office of the company. and open to the public. which shall show which part of the stock has been issued for cash and which for property. and which shall disclose the character and value of the property thus taken. The statute then goes on to provide that anybody may have a copy of that contract on payment of a fixed fee. That is publicity. This statement of his is a fairly good general description of the publicity provided for in this bill. except that it goes further than the provisions of the bill."},{"1":"5.700504e+08","2":"1902","3":"H","4":"LEVER","5":"4309","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Speaker. today the ordinary functions of the greatest legislative body on earth are suspended in order that members of this House desiring the privilege may each add his sincere tribute to the memory of our departed friend.

To me he was the ideal Christian statesman and truthloving gentleman. and I can pay him no higher eulogy than to recite the unvarni 3hed story of his lifeits struggles. its hopes. its triumphs. its virtues. J. WILLIAM STORES. the first son of James Stokes. was born near Orangeburg City. S. C.. on December 12. 1853. He came of an ancestry of planters. his immediate progenitor being a sussessful farmer and mill man. His intense love for farming as an occupation and his interest in the farmer as a class are the intensified and crystallized feelings of his ancestry. an exemplification of the predilections of generations of his family. To him the farm was the nursery of greatness and goodness. the farmer the ideal of independence. morality. and civic virtue. most nearly combining in correct proportion the elements entering into the compositions of active Chris ian -citizenship. The philosophy of his public efforts was that the happiness and prosgerity of the American farmer meant the contentment and welleing of the American people. As a boy he was industrious and intelligent in his work. obedient to his parentsdoing the odds and ends of farm work with that readiness and system afterwardsso characteristic of the man. In the countrv and village schools he showed a quick and investigating mind. given more to searching for reasons than to accepting conclusions it did not understand. Mathematics was his favorite study. though he loved the mysteries of logic and reasoned with great clearness and precision. This prejudice in favor of the more strenuous branches marked his entire course in college and university. and showed its f till development in the winning of the Taylor scholarship in mathematics. a prize much coveted. both in point of honor and money value. at Washington and Lee University. which institution he entered at the age of 19. graduating therefrom with the honors of his classa rare distinction. By earnest application to work. faithfulness to friends and the precepts of right and truth. by his unassuming. though dignified deportment. the strength of intellect and character. he won the confidence and esteem alike of his fellowstndents and the faculty. He was an enthusiastic college man. filled with the college spirit. and took an active part in its athletics. society. and class work. and in the work of the Young Mens Christian Association and Bible classes. In none of these did lie take second place. His diploma meant more to him than an evidence of his having completed certain prescribed studies. it meant his victory over almost insurmountable obstacles. The South lay stunned. her future uncertain. her labor demoralized. her governments unstable and unsatisfactory. the life and property of her citizens insecure. and investments apprehensive and development at a standstill. The social and political status of millions of former slaves had been changed. society was in chaos. opulence found itself reduced to poverty. money was scarcely to be had at all. and never except at the most exorbitant rates of interest. No State suffered more of these horrors than South Carolina. and the devastations overtook all. and fell especially heavy upon the father of young STOKES. leaving him entirely unable to aid his son in getting a college training. No young man ever faced a darker future. nor did anyone ever meet it with more selfreliance and Christian fortitude. Possessed of that pluck that snaps its finger at difficulty. he managed to effect a loan. paying 12 per cent interest. and with this borrowed money completed his education. repaying it after his graduation. Thus early the indomitable courage of the man showed itself in the invincible spirit of the boy. Leaving the university with most convincing testimonials of meiit from president and professors. lie easily secured the first position he soughtassociate principal. afterwards president of a fine school in Tennessee. During this first work his trials were enough to overcome a less brave man. The president of the school died. leaving unpaid the salaries of all his assistants. Mr. STOKES included. Upon his accession to the principalship of the school. he assumed its obligations. giving his individual notes and meeting them as early as possible out of his next years salary. Without a murmur he bore these struggles. a most beautiful consideration for the feelings of his loved ones causing him to keep the knowledge of their hardships from his home folk. But they were not without compensation both to him and his fellowman. Adversity is not without its blessings. It brings men in close encounter with the rough edges of the world. awakening in them a consciousness of their power. a confidence in their ability to cope with its complex and difficult problems. and emphasizes the most valuable of all lessons to the young manthe lesson of economy. Lord Bacon says: Selfreliance and selfdenialAnd they are both the legitimate offspring of povertywill teach a man to drink out of his own cistern and eat his own sweet bread. and to learn and labor truly to get his own iving. and carefully to expend the good things committed to his trust. This philosophy was most completely embodied in the life of Congressman STOKES. Early and forced economy gave him a most distinct and sharp idea of value. To him economy in everything was a virtue. though he was by no means parsimonious. being. on the contrary. generous to a fault. To him life was a trustestate. the conditions being that every moment of time shojild be given in an effort to better the condition of his fellowman and to add some worthy deed to the stm total of human achievement. To frit the moments away in idleness and vain endeavor was -to violate a sacred trust. Work was a duty. a sacred command. While the number of persons who owe their education to his generosity. largely increased. no doubt. by his own early struggles. can not at this time be accurately determined. it is sufficient to say that all over his own and several other States many rise up to call him blessed. In his charity he was liberal to the full extent of his ability. adopting a system which is now being followed by his devoted widow. by which he was able to discriminate between the worthy and unworthy applicants for his help. He continued teaching in Tennessee and Mississippi for many years. in the meantime graduating in medicine at Vanderbilt University while teaching near Nashville. and though hampered by the duties of the schoolroom. taking a beautiful gold medal for a thesis on a given subject over a large number of competitors. He seemed. however. to have little fancy for the medical profession. practicing it only a short time. the quiet work of the schoolroom being more in keeping with his character and the bent of his mind. As a teacher he was eminently successful. many of the best equipped and thoroughly disciplined schools of Tennessee and Mississippi standing. even now. as monuments to his ability and systematic organization. His students loved him for his gentle firmness and patent sincerity. His kindly sympathy and his inherent knowledge of the subtle influences entering into and shaping every life touched a responsive chord in the breast of the student body. as a result of which teacher and student worked together in perfect harmony. disciplined by mutual love and sympathy. Doubtless his experience in organizing. disciplining. and controlling children was of great value to him in the organization of men. The same tact and knowledge of human nature are essential in each instance. for men are but grown up children plus experience and age. In 1881. while teaching in Tennessee. he married Miss Ella Landes. of Fayetteville. a most refined and highly educated lady. whose tact. thoughtfulness. and sympathy in his work contributed in no small measure to his ultimate success and universal popularity. In everything she was his helpful companion. resourceful. practical. and in thorough accord with the noble purposes of his life. Their mutual devotion was most beautiful and touching. and their married life of twenty years one beautiful dream of happiness. a moonlit evening on the seashore. He was preeminently of a religious turn of mind. and in early life connected himself with the Methodist Church. giving to it his most earnest support. He was a Methodist both by choice and heredity. his entire name being among the most influential members of that church in the State. There are not less than a half dozen consecrated men of his name serving the ministry in the Methodist conference of his State at this time. He was more than a mere passive church member. he was an active worker in the cause of the Master. a working Christian. He saw in the church the appointed way to the higher and better ideals taught by Holy Writ. and neither the glamour of political life nor its burdens caused him to neglect his Sunday school and church work. During all of his life he was one of the strong stakes in the Sunday school.. and while in Washington regularly taught a large Bible class. It was while thus equipped with astrong. Christian character. a classic education. a wide knowledge of human affairs. and a keen and cultivated insight into human nature that his father died. necessitating his return home to take charge of the estate. This event. sad as it was to him. was the crisis point in his political career. The political storm which broke with the fury of a hurricane in 1890. arousing the most intense excitement. was gathering rapidly. At Bennettsville. Captain Tillman. now Senator TILLMAN. thundered forth the demands of the farmer. and called upon him to assert his rights. The Farmers Alliance. which had taken deep root in many of the Western States. was beginning to find favor among the farmers of South Carolina. who were chafing under then existing conditions and dissatisfied with the management of State and national affairs. It was at this point that Dr. STOKEs became a factor in the great movement that must ever remain one of the most interesting chapters in the history of South Carolina. He saw in the purposes of the Alliance great possibilities for the agricultural interest of the country. and it was but natural that his love for and belief in the rights of the people should find expression in a zealous advocacy of the party which lie believed promised the most ultimate good to all the people. and. like most of the great Alliance leaders. gravitated inevitably into what was known as the reform movement. His comprehensive mind took in the situation in all its aspects. The people were dissatisfied. restless. and demanding a change. but they were in a state of chaos. without organization and systematic leadership. These conditions had to be met. and he set himself at once to the work of organizing the farmers of his county into Alliances. having for their purpose social and industrial improvement. Into this work he entered with all his mind and soul. bringing to it his wide experience in dealing with men and his vast accumulation of economic knowledge. His enthusiasm was not of the kind born of ulterior motives. He was fighting for principle. In this work he met with remarkable success and his great ability as an organizer found ready recognition throughout the State. About this time he bought The Cotton Plant. making it the official organ of the Alliance. As its editor he showed his full acquaintance with the great issues then agitating public thought and his intense love for the people. His style was clear. logical. and plain. his statements fair and honest. appealing always to the reason of his readers. His promotion continued. He was elected State organizer of the Alliance. the most prominent place on the fighting line. and later became its president. holding the latter position for several terms. He was the great leader of the Alliance. a fearless and aggressive fighter. a cautious and conservative counselor. armed at all points with facts and authorities and the equal in point of equipment to any foeman or occasion. He applied the cold steel of argument to the position of his adversaries and met their assaults in kind. His prominence drew upon him the full fire of the opposition. but no amount of criticism. sarcasm. or ridicule could diminish his zeal for the cause. or induce him to modify to the extent of a jot or tittle the demands of his organization. He stood steady through it all and directed his forces witha judgment almost unerring. He was calm. calculating. judgmaticquick to seize a strategic point or profit by a tactical blunder. neither allowing his judgment to become befogged by enthusiasm nor permitting an infatuation with an idea to warp his reason or entrap his conscience. His ultimate and complete leadership in the organization was assured. and from. this time on he became the loved oracle of the farmers organization. It is not in place at this time to discuss the merits of that controversy nor the fruits of that movement. It is sufficient for the generations who may wish to study his life to point a lesson or adorn a tale to know that he won the complete confidence and esteem of his followers by a fearless and faithful adherence to his conception of right and merited the respect and admiration of his opponents by the fairness and catholicity characterizing his attitude toward them. It is a most distinct testimonial of the purity of his character that at this period of extreme bitterness no word was ever uttered in assault upon it. or the integrity of his purposes. His most bitter political enemy conceded his high moral character and patriotic sincerity. His partisanship was so tempered with conservatism and a proper regard for the opinions of others that when the smoke of that bitter conflict had cleared away there was no one unwilling to testify to his ability. fairness. and manly conduct. He was elected to the State senate in 1890. after a thorough canvass of his county. defeating one of its most brilliant and honored sons. In the senate he was generally recognized as a strong. thoughtful. and conservative man. possessing welldefined convictions on public questions and in most thorough accord with the dominant thought of the State. His eminent services in the senate made him the logical candidate of the farmers for the Democratic nomination for Congress in 1892. He was opposed by Hon. W. H. Brawley. at present a district judge. and was declared defeated by a small majority. In this campaign his great powers as a debater first showed themselves to advantage. His opponent was a past master in the art of disputation. eloquent. resourceful. and adroit. while he wa untried and untrained. But when the clash came. before great popular audiences. where the pulse beat is high and true. the great ability and tremendous earnestness of the farmers champion supplied his lack of prior training. and he proved himself the full equal of his opponent in every respect. Congressman Brawley having been appointed district judge by President Cleveland. resigned his seat. Undaunted by defeat. confident of the correctness of his conclusions and of their ultimate triumph. loved as he was by his followers. he again became their standard bearer for the unexpired term. and was again defeated for the nomination by a decreased majority by Judge James F. Izlar. an able jurist. an impelling orator. and a most popular man with the masses. These reverses did not diminish his optimism nor lessen his faith in the final success of the principles lie advocated. and though thus defeated. his ability and sincerity had so impressed the leadership of the State that the State convention of 1892 elected him a delegate at large to the national Democratic convention. and the same year he was an elector on the Democratic ticket. In 1894 he received the Democratic nomination for Congress without opposition. being opposed in the general election by T. B. Johnson. a white Republican. who. failing of a majority in the election. appealed his case to the House of Representatives. which. in the final determination of the issue. declared the seat vacant. In 1896 he was again awarded the certificate of election for both the unexpired term of the Fiftyfourth Congress and the full term of the Fiftyfifth. and again Mr. Johnson contested his seat. though the case abated upon the death of the contestee. He was a member of the constitutional convention in 1895. and was one of the leaders of that body. contributing largely to the high character of its debates and serving with distinction on its most important committees. Feeling the immense responsibility of this position and the necessary permanency of the work. he spared neither mental nor physical effort to inform himself to the end that he might act wisely and for the best interest of the State. He was elected to the Fiftysixth Congress without opposition. though his nomination by his party was contested by Hon. Thomas F. Brantley. He received the unanimous nomination of his party in 1900the most convincing testimonial of his good service and the confidence of his peopleand in the general election had only a farcical opposition. which met little encouragement from the more respectable element of the Republican party in the district. As a Congressman he gave his entire time to his duties. Regular in attendance upon the sessions of his committees and the House. attentive to the work of the Departments. prompt in answering the demands. however trivial. of his constituents. however humble. alert to the needs of his district. he was at the same time a close student of economic conditions. an original thinker. and an honest and elaborate investigator. in full sympathy with the conservative ideas of the age and intensely devoted to the cause of the people. His intimate and accurate knowledge of the needs of his. people convinced him that lie could serve them in no more practical and material way than by giving better mail facilities to rural communities. and he resurrected the idea of rural free delivery. The system had been getting a desultory support from several preceding Congresses. but was languishing for lack of earnest and aggressive sympathizers. In a carefully prepared and exhaustive speech. he called attention to the needs of the farmer in this respect and pointed out the great and beneficent possibility of a perfected system of rural feee delivery. The effect is known and appreciated by the 10.000.000 farmers daily served by the system. It is his greatest work. his most lasting triumph. his best legacy to the generations that must ever and ever receive its increasing and multiplied benefits. This. together with his authorship of the idea of free delivery on star routes. and his fight against gambling in cotton futures. gave him a reputation unbounded by district and State lines. and it even went beyond the seas. He was intensely patriotic in his work. his vote at all times representing the concurrence of his reason and conscience. No command of partisanship could ever drive him into committing the national conscience to an ethical wrong. He was greatly loved by the membership of the House for his purity of character and faithfulness to every obligation. and the spontaneous and sincere expressions of regret for his taking off were eloquent tributes to his worth. .He was neither a genius nor an orator in the ordinary acceptation of those terms. He was a powerful and effective debater. a strong controversialist. quick to detect a weak point in a line of defense. and as alert to marshal his forces against it. though lie lacked the rich imagination. the nervous energy. the command of soulstirring language. and the personal presence which give the orator the power to touch the hidden chords of the emotions and for the moment still the voice of reason. His intellect was of the steady. substantial kind. without the meteoric brilliancy which enchains the emotions momentarily and then goes out in darkness. He was a most able man. both by natural endowment and judicious training. conservative in his opinion. safe in his judgment. and content to take a practical and human view of things. In his extraordinary capacity for work he was most undoubtedly a genius. His wellstored. wellpoised mind was the effect of his zeal and perseverance in equipping. cultivating. enriching. and expanding it. He made the very best use of his natural endowments. and this constituted whatever genius he possessed. and it is this kind of genius that is in the reach of everyone who will pay its price--conscientious. honest labor. He was a good man. an accommodating neighbor. a devoted son. a tender husband. a thoughtful friend and Christian citizen. and an able statesman. whose influence upon every community in which he lived was most salutary. To touch the circle of his influence was to have the soul raised heavenward. He bould his friends to him with hooks of steel. and their loyalty to him alive and to his memory dead is the highest tribute to his unselfish and generous character. The Golden Rule was his rule of conduct toward his fellowman. To the young man struggling against the tide. baffled. discouraged. and despairing. his life is a hope. an inspiration. and an exemplification of the maxim: The gods sell everything for labor. Preferments came to him as victories: fortune never smiled upon him. Each higher position in the public esteem was but a natural evolution. a just recognition of his faithfulness and ability in the discharge of less responsible duties. He literally won success. Ts not in mortals to command success. But well do more. Sempronius. well deserve it. His death was pathetically sad. coming at a time when he had reached the prime development of mental and moral manhood. the full embodiment of civic virtue and Christian character. The difficulties of young manhood had ceased to be an unpleasant memory in the grand triumphs and honors of full maturity. partisan and factional bitterness had yielded to the nobler feeling of reconciliation. and he had found solid lodgment in the affections of all his people. being stronger in their love at the time of his death than at any time during his career. The full stature of the man was beginning to break upon the people of his State. and the fondest dream of his ambitionthe honor of representing his great State in the Senate of the United Statesin all probability would have found an early realization in the expressed will of his people. But how uncertain are human calculations. For several years prior to his death his health had been failing. and for months immediately preceding it he was confined to his room. where tender and intelligent care did all in its power for him. He continued to sink despite the efforts of the best physicians in the State. The worry. confinement. and constant mental and physical strain incident to public lifehad mad irreparable inroads upon his constitution and i bwas too weak to withstand the assaults of disease. He had literally worn himself out in the service of his people. and on July 6. 1901. at 5 oclock in the morning. the hour when darkness salutes the dawn and bids her welcome to her place. death came. With a calmness and serenity born of Christian fortitude and hope and faith lie faced the ordeal of his dissolution. and even in this dread hour the old familiar smile. so dear to those who knew him. rested on his face. giving an assurance that the bright star of earthly existence had only sunk into the more brilliant dawn of a new and better life. It is a sweet thoughtthe thought of immortalitythe belief that death is only the beginning of a brighter and more joyous life. the faith in the promise that those who keep his commandments shall meet again in the house of many mansions. Such a kind philosophy dispels the gloom of the grave and brings a solace and an assurance to the brokonhearted and disconsolate. A great statesmen has gone. and his greatest monument will be the heritage he has left posterity in the example of a faithful. Christian life. As said he. in eulogizing the late Senator Earle. so can I with equal appropriateness say of him: If I were to attempt to sum up in one term the quality which lay at the foundation of his character. I could find no fitter term than the single word faithfulfaithful to social obligations. to political obligations. to public obligations. to private obligations. to family obligations. and. back of all. faithful to his obligations to his God."},{"1":"5.601194e+08","2":"1901","3":"S","4":"TURNER","5":"3968","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. President. this is the most remarkable and extraordinary measure. I venture to say. that was ever before Congress for consideration. It is vicious in principle. extravagant in operation. and it is absurdly inefficient to accomplish the ends for which alone it is attempted to be justified. Nothing less could be expected when we remember the influences which inspired it and brought it into being. A committee of twentyfive. composed. I believe. almost entirely of shipowners and shipbuilders outside of three or four distinguished Republican Senators and Representatives. has been conferring over it for nearly two years. and after the members had conceived its terms as their interests dictated. it was turned over to distinguished counsel. retained and paid by the committee. who brought it to that state of beautiful perfection in which we now see it. and which the distinguished Senator from Maine. the chairman of the Commerce Committee. looks on with so partial and loving an eye. I have as high an opinion of the integrity and ability of exSenator Edmunds as the Senator from Maine. but I apprehend that he drew this bill according to instructions. and that in doing so he was not so much concerned in safeguarding the interests of the nation as he was in promoting the interests of his clients. As I do not impugn the motives of that distinguished lawyer. neither do I impugn the motives of the distinguished Republican statesmen who lent their presence and presumably their assistance to the deliberations of that committee. They are Republicans. and the Republicanism of today is a strictly business proposition. It lives and moves and has its being by catering to the socalled business interests of the nation. which term I understand to mean the interests of wealth as contradistinguished from the interests of the people. No demand which the former can make staggers our Republican friends. It has but to ask to receive at their hands. They have personified it. and bow down before it as a Hindu bows down before his idol. and though it be grasping and selfish and ugly to all the world beside. to them its image is as beautiful as a dream. Therefore. though this bill be all that I say. I impugn no Senators motive who assisted in conceiving it or in framing it. or who now believes it to be his duty to support it. because I know the delusion under which our Republican brethren labor. and would extend to them the same tenderness which the law. in its mercy. extends to all unfortunates who are similarly circumstanced. I say first that the measure is vicious in principle. It proposes to take out of the National Treasury and give to a lot of people. without any consideration whatever. a large sum of money. Still other people. under the compulsion of law. will be compelled to contribute this money to the National Treasury in the shape of taxes. The effect of the law is to take from one man to give to another. To exact money for such a purpose is not taxation. but spoliation. To spend it in such a manner is not government. but defalcation and breach of trust. I have been appealed to to support this measure because of the supposed benefit it would be to the coast cities of my State. I think I shall show before I conclude that this supposed benefit is largely imaginary. but if it were all that it is supposed to be. I am quite sure that the good people of my State would not have me become particeps criminis to such an act for any possible advantage which might accrue to them. Such legislation is not Democratic or Republican. it is Socialistic. When one industry receives bounty and subsidy. others in turn will demand and receive it. and soon we shall descend from the general to the particular. and give our aid and bounty not to .the class but to the individual. and thus the dream of our Socialistic friends will have come true. with this ship subsidy bill as the entering wedge. There is but one cardinal rule for free representative government. That rule is the one laid down by Mr. Jeffersonequal rights for all and special privileges for none. Protect all men in the enjoyment of life. liberty. and property. and so frame your legislation to that end that no one shall enjoy over any other an undeserved advantage created by law. When it does this. government has fully answered the end for which it was established. Then let the people of the land. with such capacity as the Almighty has given them. strive in their respective avocations for wealth and happiness. Some will succeed and others will fail. but they will succeed or fail within and because of themselves. and whether they succeed or fail all will love their country. give willing obedience to its laws. and defend it from its enemies in the hour of its extremity. One of the strong objections to all such legislation as this is that it sows discord among the people and saps their confidence in the justice and impartiality of their Government. thus rendering it a prey to internal disorder and an easy victim to the aggressions of its external enemies. It is the certainty of such results. and the additional fact that paternalism. if made general. will sap and destroy the energies of the people. that makes the simple rule of government laid down by Mr. Jefferson the only safe one to follow. It is the rule that nature has indicated to usthe survival of the fittest. Undoubtedly. socialism would better secure the mass of individuals in creature comforts. provided the scale of energy and intelligence among the people remained the same. But they would not remain the same. and in time the mass would have deteriorated to a point where the best would not have as much in the way of comforts and conveniences as the worst now has. Socialism. by which I understand paternalism applied to most of the conditions of life. means a lapse into barbarism. a return to the principles of the tribal relation. It will destroy not only free government. but all governuent. as the term is now understood. and because this measure is distinctly a step in that direction. and if followed to its logical sequence a step which brings us almost to the end of the journey. I am unalterably and unqualifiedly opposed to it. The Populist party has advocated many things which the Republican party has denounced as paternal and socialistic. but the Populist party never in all its history went so far as this paternal and socialistic measure proposes to go. The proposition. stripped of all subterfuges and disguises. is that our shipping industry under present conditions can not stand alone. and that therefore we must give it out of the public Treasury a sufficient sum of money to keep it on its legs. As to one class of vessels this is the confessed. conceded. and avowed purpose and object of the bill. and its only purpose and object. As to another class of vessels the pretense is that we are encouraging the registry under our flag of large and fast vessels. suitable for auxiliary cruisers in time of War. and that this object is so far governmental as to justify the outlay of money in the manner and to the extent proposed by this bill. But I think it can be shown that for onequarter the sum which this bill proposes to give to private individuals our Government could build and maintain at all times as its own a fleet of fast and commodious vessels far superior for purposes of war to any which this bill may stimulate private individuals to build and maintain. so that. conceding the end avowed and the means proposed to be strictly legitimate. this bill is only onequarter governmental. while the other threequarters is no more nor less than a lawless and piratical raid by shipowners and shipbuilders on the Treasury of the United States. To call it paternalism. even. would be coarse and misplaced irony. It can not be dignified and made respectable by any such term. It is simply an unlawful diversion of public money to unlawful ends. with personal gain as its motive and a misconceived public policy as the vehicle for its accomplishment. The limitations on the ends of government laid down by Mr. Jefferson have heretofore been. with one exceptionand the history of that exception proves the ruleaccepted as correct by all statesmen of. all political parties in this country. They do not inhibit legislation directed to proper governmental objects which may have an incidental beneficial effect on localities and communities and on the trades and industries of the country. The farmers were benefited by the national highways which the Government built in early days. our coast cities are benefited by river and harbor improvements. our manufacturing industries are benefited by tariff taxes laid on foreign imports. It is hardly possible to perform any necessary governmental act which will not have an incidental effect. beneficial or otherwise. and if the act be honestly performedthat is. with an eye single to the governmental necessitiesit is justified. whether injury or benefit follow. And of course it is proper. in considering governmental acts. to select those which create a minimum of injury and confer a maximum of benefits. Within these limits there is the most ample choice of means to ends. But to propose legislation having for its sole object the building up or maintaining of some trade. pursuit. calling. or industry by paying bounties or subventions out of the public Treasury to individuals is a very different thing. It can not be justified from the writings of any of our statesmen. It is not correct government under the theories of any of our philosophical writers on government. I had supposed until lately that the Republican party would be the last one to give its assent to any such perversion of governmental power. But that party has made tremendous strides of late. It has gone so far beyond the ideas of its founders and its great exponents in earlier days that they wouid not recognize it as the same party if they could return to earth. They declared in 1856 thatthey had formed it and called it into existence to bring our Government back to the practices and principles of Washington and Jefferson. Today the farewell address of George Washington is an indictment of Republican policies. and for the principles of Thomas Jefferson that party has substituted the lawless demands of organized wealth. Anything and everything goes which any large moneyed interest has the wit to conceive and the audacity to demand. That appears now to be the only idea of correct governmental limitations entertained by the Republican party. True. when wealth wants to make a raid on the Treasury it connects its demands with some governmental purpose to give them respectability and standing. They are often shadowy and insubstantial. as in this case. but as hypocrisy is said to be homage which vice pays to virtue. so these pretenses may be considered as a tribute to correct governmental principles. and therefore as of some value to good government. But when we come to analyze them to see how far they are founded in reason and principle. they will not stand the test. and by this I mean the test not of constitutional power. but of correct legislative principles. The two ideas are not identical by any means. The pretense that this bounty subserves a useful governmental purpose by building up auxiliary cruisers for use in time of war would justify a bounty on any trade. pursuit. or occupation whatever. Nothing is more necessary in time of war than food. Therefore the farmers ought to be paid a bounty on agricultural products. in order that the pursuit of farming might not languish and the supply of meats and breadstuffs become insufficient. Let us pay bounties on wheat and corn. on hogs. sheep. and cattle. because our soldiers may need them. They also need horses to ride. Let us pay bounties on them and on the oats and hay which are necessary to feed them. We need all kinds of machines and implements of war. and also all kinds of artisans. Let us extend our bounty system to take them all in. Nothing that the Government may need in case of war must be wanting in that dire extremity. Let us pay bounties on our woolen goods. our cotton goods. our boots and shoes. our hats and caps. on our iron and steel products. in short. on everything. Everybody knows that war may come. and it is only necessary to write in our legislation that these provisions are made to provide against the eventualities of war to close the mouths of the judges and paralyze the arm of the courts. and thereby make any extravagance we may want to perpetrate constitutional. praiseworthy. and patriotic. I assert that there is as much reason to pay a bounty of 5 cents a bushel on all the wheat raised under our flag as there is to pay a bounty on all the vessels run under our flag. The industry of wheat raising is languishing. The farmers on the Pacific. coast find it hard to make both ends meet because of the severe competition which they encounter in Russia and Argentina. It is more important that we have wheat than ships. both in war and in peace. But the farmers do not ask any bounty on wheat. They did ask. however. through their representative. Mr. Hanley. if bounties were to be paid those ships. that they be paid in such a way that the farmers would get a fair share of the benefits. They asked that the American ships be paid a bounty on the American agriculturar products actually carried by them. thinking that in that way they would be enabled to obtain a share of the benefits conferred in cheaper freight rates. But exSenator Edmunds convinced the committee. apparently. that such a bounty would not inure to the benefit of the farmers. because the ships would gobble it all. I quote from exSenator Edmundss speech before the committee: Now. how is the farmer going to get any of that bounty? The bounty is to be paid to the ship. The bounty has only brought the American ship up to the cost level of the others. while the others are all gainingthe bounty addition. The market price for carrying the goods is regulated by the great majority of the foreign ships. just as it was before. And the upshot of the business is that while it will help your American shipowner. who gets his cargo. not a penny of that money will ever get back to the farmer. It is just as clear. from a business point of view. and the way we know this world goes. as anything can be. On the other hand. under the provisions of this bill. take farm products alone. The farmer can load his things onto the ship that is aided in making the voyage by the United States and send them to any market. He is not limitedto great lines of transportation. He can send them to any market where there is a demand for them just as soon as he can get shipsenoughto doit. and he can not be squeezed at all by any great combination. Iam going on theidea that you can not build a palace or do any other great work in a minute. If you do this. and keep on. then you have reached the farmer. and have done it in such a way that nobody can get it away fron him. and you have put him on a footing lust like the maker of manufactured articles and everything else in respect to which he has always been protected in the same way. although he has produced so much more than manufacturers have that le has not felt the immediate advantage as any one particular establishment would. The committee appeared to think this reasoning conclusivealthough. to my mind. the great lawyer was not so clear and per spicuous n dealing with the matter as I could have wished. The price on wheat in this country is the Liverpool price. minus the cost of transportation. If the farmer knew that the shipowner was getting $2 per ton bounty for carrying his wbeat to Liverpool. he would seem to be in a better position to demand a division of the benefits from it than he would be from a bounty system payable in gross. the greater part of which was payable in consideration of speed alone. from which. of course. the farmer would derive no benefit. But the committee thought otherwise. The committee thought the farmers would be more benefited by the building up of a large merchant marine. which. when it became large. would by the force of competition reduce freight rates. But. to my mind. the one system as much as the other would tend to build up American shipping. A 5.000ton ship. carrying wheat from San Francisco to Liverpool. would derive the same benefit from a bounty on tonnage actually carried. if the bounty was properly equaIized. that it would from a mileage bounty. as provided in this bill. and the one system would operate to build up our shipping as mnuch as the other. It might not operate to build up fast vesselsthe floating palaces which the luxury of the present day demands as carriers of passengers. and I do not mean to say that these are unimportant and not to be considered. But I am now considering the interests of the farmers and the extremely loose manner employed in disposing of their demands for the purpose of indicating what I believe the fact to be. that they are not in this bill at all. except to an inconsiderable degree. and only to that degree for the purpose of providing sauce and thereby making palatable this atrocious and villainous decoction which it is proposed to force down the throats of the American people. Otherwise there would not be such obtuseiness in seeing that the proposal of the farmers. so far as the stimulation of the building of vessels of actual tonnage capacity goes. would at least have as great an effect as this measure. and while the tonnage was increasing the farmers would he enjoying some of the advantages at the sae time. Another ground on which the exportbounty idea was brushed aside was that it would require the abrogation of a large number of commercial treaties with other countries. and while it was admitted that these treaties might be abrogated under their own terms. most of them o one years notice and all of them on two. exSenator Edmunds clinched the matter by saying: You can not get Congress to pass and the President to approve a bill to provide for abrogating any one of these treaties. This statement was so manifestly true of the present and the next Congress. of the present and the next President. whatever the exigencies of the farmers might be. that the objection was accepted by everyone. Mr. Hanley included. as unanswerable. But. lest there might be some doubting Thomas left. the distinguished constitutional lawyer who framed the present bill brought to bear against the unsophisticated farmers the batteries of constitutional law. and found in the Constitution an insuperable objection to their project. I quote from a letter written by him to the chairman of the Committee on Commerce of the United States Senate. and read at the hearing before that committee: The Constitution of the United States as it now stands designed to revent Congress as well as the States from enacting any class legislation whatever. Equal rights and equal opportunities to engage In any business or enterprise. and to receive equal or corresponding benefits from public expenditures. are among the fundamental principles embodied in that instrument. Congress may raise and support armies and navies. and do whatever is fairly incidental to those ends. and thus may provide for inducing the building of ships which may be taken and used in the national defense. It may possibly grant bounties on the exportation of all the products of the country as a means of improving commercial relations with other countries. But if it discriminates bv granting bounties on the exportation of particular classes of products. it does at once establish a governmental difference in favor of those particular classes and against all other products capable of amd designed for similar exportation. It is clear to me. therefore. that a bounty on the exportation of woolen goods or wheat. for instance. while the exportation of cottongoods or corn was left unaided. would be in violation of the Constitution. rthink. then. that a law granting a bounty on agricultural products alone. as has been suggested. could not be upheld. just as 4 bounty on the exportation of manufactured products alone could not be upheld. It seems to me that there are a number of serious flaws in this constitutional argument of exSenator Edmunds. The bounty proposed to be paid on agricultural products. according to the farmers project. was to be paid to the ships and not to the farmer. If we can pay the ships cold cash for running without anything in them. on the theory that we are thereby building up our war power on the sea. certainly. on the same theory. we can pay them for running when loaded with wheat and corn. Further. the war idea does not cover sailing vessels and slow steam vessels. They would be of no use in case of war. On what theory is the subsidy constitutional as to such vessels. if unconstitutional as to agricultural products? If it is constitutional as to them. why not constitutional as to wheat? If unconstitutional as to both. and that would be the logical deduction from exSenator Edinundss opinion. then no one is to derive any advantage from this bill except the owners of the fast steam passenger vessels. because the Supreme Court will be compelled to declare all the other bounty features of the bill unconstitutional. null. and void. But a bounty paid direct to farmers on corn. wheat. and oats would be no more class legislation than the bounties provided by this bill. The latter are designed to assist the shipping industry. the other would assist the farming industry. Both involve class legislation as against other industries not assisted. To bolster up the agricultural bounty and put it on a par with the shipping bounty it is only necessary to declare that it is given in contemplation of war and that there may at all times be an adequate supply of food in the country. The Supreme Court would no more question the bona fides of the one pretense than they would that of the other. In fact. as I have shown as to one part of this ship subsidy.-it stands on no higher ground of legitimate governmental purpose than would a bounty on agricultural products. We see. then. that all these objections to the farmers project are more ingenious than substantial. but that they had their effect. not only with the committee. but with the farmers representative. Mr. Hanley. is apparent from the following colloquy which took place between the distinguished Senator from Maine [Mr. FRYEJ. the chairman of the committee. and Mr. Hanley at the conclusion of the hearing before the committee. I quote from page 117 of the report of the committee. Senate Document No. 149. Fiftysixth Congress. first session:"},{"1":"5.600707e+08","2":"1900","3":"H","4":"ROBINSON","5":"3618","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. the Philippine situation is interesting and important. Interesting and profitable it is said to be to the commercial interests. but it is momentous to others because it is destructive to American labor and brings it into competition with the lowest grade of labor on the earth. The taxpayers are interested. because of the enormous expense required to support the standing army and the establishments necessary to hold the Philippines in subjection. Among the misfortunes that came to us in our efforts to hold this oriental peoplemisfortunes measured in blood and treasure. in loss of limb and health. the traces of which will be felt for many yearsnone was greater. as affecting our republican institutions. than the system adopted. and which. leading up to. resulted in the sanction by the President of the United States of the agreement with the Sultan of Slu. Under that agreement the Sultan. a Mohammedan and a polygamist. whose people as far back as their history extends were pirates. polygamists. and slaveholders. was recognized by this Government. together with their system of slaverya slavery so abominable that it gives the master the right of life and death over his slaves. Any slave. says this agreement. in the archipelago of Jolo shall have the right to purchase his freedom at the usual market price. Is that a suppression of slavery? The slaves will never get money enough to purchase their freedom. Where will they get money to purchase freedom? As soon as they get enough the men who own them will form a trust. and then the prices will be raised and the slaves will not be able to purchase their freedom. This Government. frnom the beginning of its negotiations down to the signing of the contract. recognized and guaranteed the sacredness and perpetuity of the Sultans institutions and customs. social and domestic. Not only this. but the Sultan and his datos are paid annually the sum of nearly $10.000 to keep the peace. Some light on the character and customs of these people may not be inappropriate at this time. President Schurman of the Philippine Commission. in an interview. said: The Sulu group proper contains about 100.000 inhabitants. They are all Mohammedans. To attempt to interfere with the religion of these people would precipitate one of the bloodiest wars in which this country has ever been engaged. They are religious fanatics of the most pronounced type. who care nothing for death and believe that the road to heaven can be attained by killing Christians. Polygamy is a part of their religion. and slavery. about which so much is being said just now. is a mild type of feudal homage. Polygamy. says Schurman. is a part of their religion. A mild type. says a commissioner of the United States. Let us see what the authorities say on slavery. I will read from the second edition of Mr. Foremans book. which was published in 1899. and brought up to date. He says: Slavery exists in a most ample sense. There are slaves by birth and others by conquest. such as prisoners of war. insolvent debtors. and those seized by piratical expeditions to other islands. Social History of the Races of Mankind. by Featherman. says: Slavery exists on Sulu Island. and the slaves. who were formerly brought from the Philippines. are not well treated. for their masters exercise the power of life and death over them. and sometimes kill them for trilling offenses. The datos frequently punish a disobedient or fugitive slave by drawing their campilan or kris and cutting off his head at one stroke without process of law. St. Johns Far East. volume 2. page 192. reads: The slaves are collected from all parts of the archipelago. from Acheen Head to New Guinea. and from the south of Siam to the most northern parts of the Philippines. It is a regular slave market. The slaveholders have the right of life and death over their slaves and the monarch has the right to take thte life of his subjects whenever he chooses. And yet this infamous system of human slavery is mildly styled a mild type of feudal homage. Residents. as they are. of the Philippine Islands. claimed by the United States. inhabiting 150 islands and consisting of something over100.000 people. our nation treats with the Sulus. recognizes their titles of nobility. their institutions of slavery and polygamy. We treat with them as competent contractual parties and as if they were a separate sovereignty. and exact from them a promise that they will aid in the suppression of piracy. which for a hundred years was one of their favorite institutions and from which the Sultan derived a revenue. The President. as the Executive of this nation. is responsible solely for this Sultan of Sulu agreement. which he confirmed after it was made under his directions. Congress knew nothing of it till long after its execution. and neither House of Congress had notice of it or power to prevent its execution. The President has taken no steps to renounce or alter this Sultan of Sulu agreement. He withheld from Congress its text for two months after his message of December. though it was a part of the message. and no step has been taken either by the President or his party to rescind or annul this contract. and they are thus properly and solely chargeable with the consequences. The acts of the various departments in the Philippines have been and are now under a strict censorship. The censorship on the press and on the wire at Manila has been and is now the most infernal that has ever been known within sight of the American flag. The secrecy thus secured extends in some degree to the Departments in Washington and controls the policies of the Administration in dealing with its island colonies. We pay annual sums to the Sultan and his dates to secure obedience to our authority and law. This policy is of doubtful propriety from every point of view. and time will prove. I believe. that it is indefensible on the score of peace and quietude. But a few of these corrupt. avaricious. and treacherous people are on the Unitei States pay roll and others of equal standing will feel aggrieved. Discontent is already evincing itself on the islands. The mode of conducting negotiations by General Bates under the direction of the Government. it will be found. will not tend to allay this discontent and dissatisfaction. and our first step in following the colonial policy of Great Britain. or in imitation of the old and corrupt monarchy of Spain. whose annual payment to the Sultan was onethird less than he exacts from us. will be a burden instead of a benefaction. Adroitness and ingenuity were resorted to to get the signatures of the Sultan and dates to this Sulu treaty. and money was used and given to them by the United States as presents to win their agreement and to secure their signatures to the compact. This may be news to some. and the proof of its details will cause a revolt on the part of those who love America for its American institutions. If the United States. through its high civil and military officers in the Philippines. offera bribes to people to induced them to part with liberty. property. and flag. is it to be wondered at that such example will be followed by its political adventurers and spoilsmen sent as its officers to Cuba and other colonies? We have people of all races now within our putative borders. and the power that has extended our dominion. by a process of forcible expansion to the uttermost limits to take in the scurvy scum of creation. will not allow it to be circumscribed by our traditional history nor by the interests of American labor. The people who guide this power of bossism and tyranny will not have their rapacity satisfied in a Utopia. but in the gratification of their commercial greed. and if labor be destroyed. it matters not to them.. This power. by a system of militarism. always repugnant to free institutions and to free men. would incorporate into our body politic a distant. alien. oriental. and undesirable people. if not on an equality and to be governed by our Constitution. then to be governed by a system of colonial rule for dependencies equally undesirable and equally antagonistic to our present form of government. Heretofore on this floor I showed how Hawaii was annexed. with its thousands of Orientals. Japs. and Chinese population. constituting more than onehalf on the islands. Thirty thousand more of the same class of cheap cooly labor was added while it was our territory and under our flag and Constitution. and the latter were bound by slave contracts to labor for masters. Thousands of Chinese and Japanese in years back have crossed. and thousands of these Orientals are now breaking across. the borders of Mexico and Canada into this country to compete with our labor. and no effective means to keep them back has been devised. The AttorneyGenerals report for 1899. on page 38. says: The methods by which Chinese applicants for admission evade or ignore the law are various. They involve many fertile expedients of fraud concerning the alleged status of Chinamen upon original entry or upon return to this country as merchants or travelers. They involve also the asserted condition of applicants as citizens of the United States by birth and the illegal and criminal use of the certificates of entry. residence. and character provided for by the statutes. and entail as a result not only proceedings under the statutes relating to the Chinese. but criminal prosecutions against the Chinamen and their witnesses for forgery and perjury .Chinese laborers [it might now be added. who profess to becitizensof the United States by birth. or Chinese merchants] came into the country by water and by lani. they came through the open ports and by rivers reaching the seas. and they came by way of the Canadas and Mexico. New means of ingress were discovered. and in spite of the vigilance of the police and customhouse officers great numbirs clandestinely found their way into the country. Their resemblance to each other rendered it difficult. and often impossible. to prevent this evasion of the laws. (Fong Yue Ting vs. United States. 149 U. S.. 761.) The smuggling of Chinamen into the country has thus become an offense of grave magnitude and numerous instances. and appears to be carried on in pursuance of a widespread conspiracy. not only among the Chinese themselves but among other individual and corporate confederates and agencies who find their profit in the nefarious business. The Government is compelled to meet an active and persistent movement which attacks the ports of entry on our land border at one point as soon as the Government has shown its ability to meet and repel the illegal efforts at another. and thus the forbidden Chinese immigration moves successively from the northeastern boundary line to the middle northern and the western. and then reappears along the Rio Grande and the Mexican boundary to the west thereof. The report of the Secretary of the Treasury. from page 41 to 43. says: Chinese in transit usually proceed to Mexico. and many of them have attempted thence to reenter the United States. $ 5 * *t * 5 0. The total number of Chinese arrested for deportation in the fiscal year was * * * * * * 5 A thorough investigation of the operations of the Chineseexclusion laws made during the year 1898 resulted I the discovery that its provisions had not been thoroughly enforced in several sections of the country. and that at one port at least Chinese had been unlawfully admittedthrough the collusion of offcers of the Department. These officers were promptly dismissed from the service. and the evidence secured resulted in the criminal indictment of three of them. it is expected that these persons will shortly be tried. and every effort is being made to punish them. * * * * * * * Many of these persons. disregarding the decision of the collector denying them admission. unlawfully enter the United States for arrest for deportation. The Japanese are coming into our country. without let or hindrance. by the thousands. 8.000 within a few weeks have entered. is many are on the way. and reputable reports indicate that from 20.000 to 80.000 are yet in contenmplatton to arrive. either directly or via Canada. Mexico. and Hawaii. It is authoritatively said that a majority of the Orientals so far arriving were bound by some species of ladrone contract. but the ingenuity of the navigation companies. the corporations. and the agents engaged in this traffic so far has baffled justice and detection. In line with these thoughts. the Philippines present a problem for the consideration of labor. Intercommunication by ocean. by wire. and by rail is fast leveling the conditions of labor over the world and is placing our intelligent. libertyloving. and libertysustaining people close to the vassals in the islands of the sea. How can we compete with the labor of Japan. of China. and the Philippines? It was but a few days ago when. by a bill pending now in the House. and reported by the committee presided over by the distinguished gentleman from Iowa . We were askbd to appropriate $75.000 to create a business commission to investigate the trade of China. Japan. and the Orient. I warn the gentleman from Iowa to take it into account when he sends his commission over there. and to beware of the pirates that infest those islandsthe Philippines. But. Mr. Chairman. why not appropriate such a sum to protect labor here at home? Why permit thousands of this oriental labor to come to this country. and millions to be incorporated into it by annexation. to compete with and oppress American labor? Power. wealth. and influence seem ever ready to further the interests of great magnitude and strength. What about some protection to American labor against the cooly and cheapest labor in the world? I have no desire at this time to enter into a general discussion. The Government. through its executive branch. without the aid or concurrence of Congress. has brought this Philippine condition to us. through its accredited officers has recognized slavery and polygamy in the Philippines and brought this people to our very doors. Those who listen with pleasure to the siren songs sung by those who long for profit in the Philippines should be disenchantedby the cold facts of history as written by the President of the Republic in his approval of the agreement called a treaty with the Sultan of Sulu. who is styled throughout that agreement His Highness the Sultan of Jolo. The President. in his December. 1899. message. on pages 43 and 44. refers to this agreement negotiated by Gen. J. C. Bates. acting under Gen. E. S. Otis. in the following language: The authorities of the Sulu Islands have accepted the succession of the United States to the rights of Spain. and our flag floats over that territory. On the 10th of August. 189-. Brig. Gen. J. C. Bates. United States Volunteers. negotiated an agreement with the Sultan and his principal chiefs. which I transmit herewith. By Article I the sovereignty of the United States over the whole archipelago of Jolo and its dependencies is declared and acknowledged. .. The United States fli!will be used in the archipelago and its dependencies. on land and sea. Piracy is to be suppressed. and the Sultan agrees to cooperate heartily with the United States authorities to that end and to make every possible effort to arrest and bring to justice all persons engaged in piracy. All trade in domestic products of the archipelago of Jolo when carried on with any part of the Philippine Islands and under the American flag shall be free. unlimited. and undutiable. The United States will give fall protection to the Sultan in case any foreign nation should attempt to impose upon him. The United States will not sell the island of Jolo or any other island of the Jolo Archipelago to any foreign nation withoukthe consent of the Sultan. Salaries for the Sultan and his associates in the Administration of the islands have been agreed upon to the amount of $760 monthly. Article X provides that any slave in the archipelago of Jelo shall have the right to purchase freedom by paying to the master the usual market value. The agreement by General Bates was made subject to confirmation by the President and to friture modifications by the consent of the parties in interest. I have confirmed said agreement. subject to the action of the Congress. and with the reservation. which I have directed shall be communicated to the Sultan of Jolo. that this agreement is not to be deemed in any way to authorize or give the consent of the United States to the existence of slavery in the Sulu Archipelago. I communicate these facts to the Congress for its information and action. Does the Constitution prevail in the Philippine Islands? Did it prevail there when the President sent his message to Congress? Did it prevail there on the 20th day of August. 1899. when General Bates. acting for the United States. made this agreement with the Sultan of Sulu? This was just five days before the President said. at Ocean Grove. N. J.. to 20.000 Methodists. Our flag does not mean one thing here and another in Cuba or Porto Rico. As bearing upon the question of whether the Constitution prevailed in the Philippines. the letter of Secretary of War Root to General Otis dated October 27.1899. found on page 109 of Senate Document 136. may be cited. Referring to Article X of the treaty. which reads: Any slave in the archipelago of Jolo shall have the right to purchase freedom by paying to themaster the usual market valueThe Secretary saidand with the understanding and reservation. which should be distinctly communicated to the Sultan of Jolo. that this agreement is not to be deemed in any way to authorize or give the consent of the United States to the existence of slavery in the Sulu Archipelago. a thing which is made impossible by the thirteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Under the maze that exists in our system of colonial rule. and the peripatetic nature of a constitution of a republic when it is sought to adapt it to such a form of imperial government. and the weird interpretations given to its provision by its violators and breakers. it is difficult to know just what constitutional status the President will gi. e the Sultan of Sulu agreement. either from a Philippine or Congressional standpoint. It is presumed the President will invoke the Constitution to sustain his rights to make the agreement with the Sultan. but will not consider it a treaty under the Constitution to be submitted to the Senate for ratification. He did not take Congress into his confidence. but with the aid of the strict censorship in the Philippines he was able to keep Congress in profound ignorance of the signing of the treaty and of its terms and stipulations. In this he was aided by such letters as appear on pages 6 and 110 of the Senate Document 136. from the military governor and secretary to General Bates marked confidential. The President. referring to his confirmation of the Sultan agreement. does not mean. nor should the language be construed to mean. that Congress had any power to prevent the Executive from entering into the agreement. nor that Congress had any power of confirmation or rejection. A treaty is a contract between nations or sovereigns. This agreement seeks to make the Sultan of Sulu and his subjects also subjects of the American Republic in such a way at least as to destroy the national character of the Sulu Islanders. The Constitution provides. Article I. section 8. that no title of nobility shall be granted by the United States. and in section 10 that no State shall * * * grant any title of nobility. yet in this agreement we create and recognize the Sultan as His Highness the Sultan of Jolo. The Presidents real meaning in this reference. and as well his language in his message transmitting the copy of the Sultan agreement to Congress. dated February 1. 1900. will be elucidated by the confidential War Department communication of date December 10. 1899. found on page 110 of Senate Document 136. which reads: WAR DEPARTMENT. Washington. October 27. 1899. SIR: The President instructs me to advise you that the agreement signed August 20. 1899. between Brig. Gem John C. Bates. representing the United States. of the one part. the Sultan of Jolo. the Dato Rajah Muda. the Date Attik. the Dato Calbi. and the Date Joakanain. of the other part. is confirmed and approved. subject to the action of Congress provided for in that clause of the treaty of peace between the United States and Spain which provides. The civil rights and the political status of the native inhabitants of the territory hereby ceded to the United States shall be determined by Congress. Hence it is desired that you report upon the character of this Moro slavery. in order that the institution as existing may be fully appreciated. The number of slaves secured 4y the Mores through capture or by purchase from other bands. tribes. or races. and now held by them. and the number of them in use who have voluntarily or involuntarily entered the condition of slavery might be approximately stated.

I again assert that neither silver nor gold was deprived of legaltender power and the right of free and unlimited coinage by the amendment of 1853. The silver dollar remained the standard as it had been from the foundation of the Government. The law was amended at a time when Europe was busily engaged in discussing the adoption of silver monometallism. but when in no country under the sun was there a movement in favor of adopting gold monometallism. This couitry had its monometallists at that period. but they were silver monometallists. They had studied Chevalier and the writings of an English economist and were convinced that the latter was right in asserting that gold would soon be only fit for the dustpan. Then. as now. New England corporations were the head and front of the scarcemoney contingent. Waterpower companies down East. in order to shield themselves against a deluge of cheap gold money. stipulated in leasesthat so many ounces of fine silver. instead of so many dollars. should be paid to them by their customers for waterpower privileges. Mr. Chairman. if in that period moneylending corporations had been as numerous and powerful as they are now. the movement in favor of the demonetization of gold which succeeded in Germany. Holland. and Austria would have extended to the United States. but the truth is that prior to 1873 no movement of the kind was ever heard of in American politics. and the contention that almost immaterial amendments of the coinage laws. dealing solely with details. and in no way affecting the financial system of the country. has any relation whatever to the question under discussion seems to me stupid and preposterous. Mr. Chairman. I declare that now and here for the first time the Congress has under discussion a bill which effectually and entirely eliminates the silver dollar as money of ultimate payment. and thereby definitively establishes the single gold standard. Here. for the first time. the leaders of the Republican party boldly doff the mask. I do not care to thrash over the history of the passage of the coinage law of 1873 further than to state that at the time of its passage there was no.discussion of the great question which has since so largely occupied the time of civilized nations. For twelve years prior to its passage no specie had circulated in the United States. and none did circulate here until five years later. Nobody was thinking about the coinage laws. The men of business who were then 30 years of age or less had never known anything but a paper currency. and as for the members of this House and of the Senate. it is a wellestablished fact that they regarded the bill as a measure dealing with administrative details. and in no way vitally affecting our monetary system. Divers and sundry financial measures have heretofore been brought forward. Scores have been introduced in this and the other branch of Congress. but now for the first time a bill. favorably reported by a committee after full examination. unequivocally committing the United States to the gold standard. is the subject of debate in this House. Under the provisions of this bill the silver dollar and the greenbacks are to remain a legal tender for all debts. public and private. except where otherwise expressly stipulated in the contract. just as greenbacks are. but all forms of currency. including silver dol lars and silver certificates. are made redeemable in gold. Henceforth the silver dollar. now legally the equal of the gold dollar as money of ultimate payment. is to be only a token. differing in no respect from the greenback. It is to lose its character as redemption money and become itself redeemable in gold. It is the intention of the authors of this bill to forever close the door against bimetallism in the United States. A system denounced. when not ignored. by the platforms of all political parties. from 1873. down to this hour. is about to be forced upon the country. and this crime. blacker even than the infamy of 1873. is to be committed by the representatives of a party that has never avowed such a purpose. but on the contrary stands solemnly pledged to a contrary policy. Mr. Chairman. in my State. and in yours. in 1896. the Republicans contended that they. and not the Democrats were the true friends of bimetallism. They declared that Mr. McKinley. if elected. would maintain the gold standard as the surest and. in fact. the only way of securing bimetallism. and not with a view to its ultimate and irrevocable adoption. I hazard nothing in saying that in all the region lying west of the Alleghenies. this was the position of the Republicans in the only national campaign in which political parties have divided upon this question. When Grover Cleveland began his crusade against silver. Republican orators in all parts of the country denounced him as an enemy of bimetallism. I have no doubt that scores of gentlemen on the other side of the Chamber delivered speeches denouncing his policy to cheering multitudes of Republicans. Mr. Chairman. here is a sample of the Republican oratory of that period. It is an extract from a speech delivered by William McKinley. at Toledo. Ohio. February. 1891: During all of Grover Clevelands years at the head of the Government he was dishonoring one of your precious metalsone of our own productsdiscrediting silver and enhancing the price of gold. He endeavored even before his inauguration into office to stop the coinage of silver dollars. and afterwards and to the end of his Administration persistently used his power to that end. He was determined to contract the circulating medium and to demonetize one of the coins of commerce. limit the volume of money among the people. make money scarce. and therefore dear. He would have increased the value of money and diminished the value of everything elsemoney the master. everything else the servant. He was not thinking of the poor then. He had left their side. He was not standing forth in their defense. Cheap coats. cheap labor. and dear money. The sponsor and promoter of those professing to stand guard over the welfare of the poor and lowly. Was there ever more inconsistency or reckless assumption? This speech was extensively used in 1896 to convince Republicans that. if elected. the Republican nominee would not sanction the policy of Cleveland and follow in his footsteps. but would labor steadfastly for the restoration of bimetallism. Mr. McKinley was right. The merciless bankers oligarchy back of this measure then. and through whose influence it is now about to be made the law of the land. are determined to demonetize one of the coins of commerce. limit the volume of money among the people. make money scarce. and therefore dear. They would increase the value of money and diminish the value of everything else. They would make money the master. everything else the servant. Mr. Chairman. when these bitter words were poured. out upon the head of Mr. Cleveland. when thousands of Republican orators were hurling similar verbal thunderbolts at the corpulent stuffed prophet who pointed out the path which is now leading them to dishonor. who would have dared to predict that seven years after the philippic I have read was delivered. McKinley as President and a Republican Congress would become the willing tools of the national bankers trust and force upon the statute book a law fastening upon tne country the policy they so fervently denounced? It must not be supposed. however. Mr. Chairman. that this law imposes the hardships of the gold standard upon all alike. It exempts national banks from the necessity of keeping their reserves in gold and considerately loads the Government with that responsibility. Section 3 of the bill provides for a gold reserve of $150.000.00. and in order to keep it intact authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to sell bonds for its replenishment. Silver dollars. silver certificates. greenbacks. and Treasury notes are made sight drafts against this gold reserve. which thus becomes the foundation upon which is to stand the vast pyramid of bredit represented by all forms of currency. including nationalbank notes. The banks may keep their reserves in Treasury notes. silver certificates. or silver dollars. The Government. their gratuitons agent. redeems these notes on demand out of this redemption DECEMniBER 12. fund. Thus. if the exigencies of business necessitate gold exports. or -an opportunity to make profits by shipping gold out of the country arises. all bullion dealers have to do is to appear at the Treasury or at the subtreasury maintained for theii benefit in New York and present for redemption in gold Treasury notes. greenbacks. silver certificates. or silver dollars- any old thing that happens to be in their vaultsand the gold will be forthcoming. and if necessary they can convert nationalbank notes into sight drafts on the Treasury payable in gold. Think of it. gentlemen! We are to have the gold standard. but our bank reserves are to be kept in token money. The existing law requires national banks to keep on depost in the Treasury a 5 per cent redemption fund. and when it is impaired they must make good the deficiency.  And the note holder has no cause of complaint. for having received from one Treasury official in redemption of a nationalbank note silver dollarshenceforth mere tokens. or greenbackshe may step over to the adjacent wicket and exchange the tokens for gold. We are to have the gold standard for the people. gold is to measure the value of their property and be the harsh standard for the measurement of all debts. but for the ultimate redemption of nationalbank notes the Government isto maintain perpetually a gold reserve of $150.000.600. And. Mr. Chairman. in my opinion this is the most atrocious and indefensible feature of this miserable measure. Why. only a short time ago the wise men who concocted this monstrosity were .fully convinced that if somehow the endless chain could be .broken the financial problem would be solved. They said that the Government was in the banking business. that it was coinpelled to maintain a gold reserve with which to redeem the green.backs. that thenthe greenbacks had to be paid out again. and so had to be redeemed over and over again. and that as longas.this system was adhered to the country might expect to suffer occasionally and.for protracted periods afflictions such as came upon us in.1893 and continued until 1898. And what remedy did they propose? Why. contraction and enlargement of the privileges of the national banks. of course. They demanded the retirement of the greenbacks and Treasury notes and the abolishment of the gold reserve. This. they said. worild takethe Government out of the banking business. For three years this was the programme urged upon the country -by the gold monometallists. And what has it all simmered down to? A bill which adds to the greenbacks and Treasury notes. which formed the endless chain they have heretofore said ought to be abolished. the silver dollars. the silver certificates. and. as I have shown conclusively. the nationalbanknotes! Itincreases the gold.reserve to $150.000.000. makes it a permanent institution. and in case of its impairment authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to sell bonds for its replenishment! And this bill is the offering of the same tinkers who aforetime declared that the salvation of the country depended upon abolishing the gold reserve and taking the Government out of the banking business. Mr. Chairman. having stated briefly some of the benefits that will accrue to the national banks under:this bill. I will now give .my views as to how it will. affect the everyday business of the masses of the people. The gentlemen on the other side of the Chamberhave not discussed this phase of the subject. Theymake a great ado about thebusiness revival.which. through dispensations of Providence and in spite of atrocious Governmental policies. came just in time to save the farmers. shopkeepers. mechanics.. andlaborers of this country from utter despair. and seem to think that this will be taken as proof conclusive that this bill is precisely .what the country needs. It seems -never to occurto them that a .single turn of fortunes wheel may bring on adversity. Hard times may and unfortunately will come again. :Experience has .convinced the country that what it needs issuch a change in the banking laws as will prevent severe contraction of the volume of .money when credit is withdrawn and only money will save thou.sands from sinking from affluence to beggary. Mr. Chairman. periods of depression. with creditors clamoring -for payment. with debtors eager to sell property at any price. with gold flowing out of instead of intothe country. call for enlargement instead of diminution in the volume of money. Will -this bill furnish it? Laying aside for the moment differences of:opinion as to the .coinage law and keeping in view only features of the measure .which relateto the paper currency. we should be sure that this .enactment will. cure instead of breeding ipanics before giving it approval. I am thoroughly convinced that it will operate to contractthe volume of money when.money is most earnestly needed. Who ever heard of banks expanding note issues or any other form .of credit during a panic? I believe that the only cure for a stringency in the money market is more money. and if this position be correct. then this bill is about the worst that could have been devised. Under its provisions currency. when redeemed in gold. must remain under lock and key..and the gold thus abstracted from the Treasury will be sent out of the country. Nationalbank notes presented for redemption by the Treasury raiders will be redeemed in gold. or. what amounts to the same thing. in greenbacks or silver. which can be forthwith exchanged for -gold. So that by this bill Treasury raiding is simplified. Under existing statutes. in order to raid the gold reserve bullion dealers have been compelled to obtain and present greenbacks or Treasury notes. Under the pending measure this is unnecessary. When gold is wanted for export. any and every thing goes. and if the gold reserve be trenched upon the Secretary of the Treasury must sell bonds and lay in a fresh supply. Mr. Chairman. the taxpayers have not forgotten what it cost the Government to furnish to the bullion dealers of New York the large sums of gold sent abroad during 1893. 1894. and 1895 in paymerit of heavy adverse balances of trade due to foreign creditors. When. bY a conspiracy entered into by the President of the United States and his Secretary of the Treasury and the national bankers of New York. the great panic of 189394 was improvised as an object lesson. for the purpose of influencing legislation. we had an illustration of what may be expected from the operation of this law. There occurred a sudden and enormous contraction of available currency at a time when nothing but money would stay the ravages of the storm. It was the work of the bankers syndicate. Forced liquidation compelled the sacrifice of property. Everywhere thousands offered to sell. but for want of money few could buy. The country banks did everything in their power to relieve the situation. but the banks of the great metropolitan cities. evenwhen willing to extend accommodations. used their means to prop up the value of bonds and stocks. while the commerce and trade of a continent was withering and dying for want of money. Exceedingly low prices were the -inevitable consequence. This dirinished the exchange value of our exports enormously and correspondingly increased the balance of trade against us. Gold was exported in increasing quantities. Under similar conditions. do not gentlemen know this bill would fail utterly to meet the requirements of the country? Foreign governments discourage in every manner possible exports of specie. The plan of the American gold monometallist is to make the Treasury of the United States an auxiliary of the business. They have done this in the. past without authority or law. This bill makes it a compulsory duty. In 189394 the New York bankerswho make a specialty of exporting bullion reaped a goldenharvest at the expense of the American people. Theysolicited the business. applied to the Treasury for the -necessary gold to meet their requirements. and it was forthcoming. in exchange for greenbacks. which..under the law.couldhavebeen redeemed in silver. and the only consequence would have been a. premium on London exchange. Why. Mr. Chairman. right now.the Bank of France is protecting its gold reserve by recourse to the means I have here pointed out. To have resortedto it in1893 and 1894.would have entailed slight hardship upon thesmallnumber ofpersons and corporations owing balances abroad. but it would have mitigated the violence of a financial storm which brought ruin tothousands. I know it is contended that the bullion.dealersraided the gold :reserve because they lacked. confidence.in the ability of. the Government to redeem its obligations iin gold. but the:truth is they were money merchants. bullion dealers. carrying onthe business because it is. profitable. They made enormous profits and thetaxpayers footed the bills. All they had to do was to call on the Federal Treasury. :through the New Yorkbanks. for such sums as they desired and it was handed over. It was shipped out of the country. and next day the New York papers pointed to the transaction as evidence that confidence was lacking in the ability. of the Government to payits debts in gold. Thus Ikelheimer made money. and Clevelands objectlesson was kept constantly. before the country. -When the gold reserve became depleted. to replenish it bonds were sold. and the raiders went:to work again. My recollection is that two -hundred and sixtytwo millions was thus added to the interestbearing debt. and not the least infamous phase of this scandalous proceeding was that out of these bond deals the conspirators who brought on the panic made princely fortunes. The bonds were sold at .prices so low that even Goldbug papers. that justified their sale and defended the financial policy of the Adnlinistration. denounced the proceeding as infamous. And. Mr. Chairman. in this connection I direct the attention of the gentlemenwho are about to make these bonds. as well as all others. payable in gold to some pertinent facts with which the .people are entirely familiar. With the exception of the 8262.000.000 .issued during Mr. Clevelands Administration. the Government .bonds outstanding are a legacy of the civil war. They represent greenbacks worth in specie less than 50 cents on the dollar. By �the passageof the creditstrengthening act. making them payable in coin. their value was doubled. By the passage of this act you are about to make the bondholders another present of probably $200.000.000. Do gentlemen on the other side of the House demand proof in support of this statement? It is found in the history of Mr. Carlisles unsavory backroom bond deals. Mr. Cleveland strenuously urged the passage of a law conferring upon the Secretary of the Treasury authority to sell goldbearing bonds to replenish the gold reserve. and as an argument in favor of the enactment of the measure cited the fact that the coterie of favorites who in those days thrived so splendidly on the profits of backroom deals with his Secretary of the Treasury would pay higher figures. by which. on an issue of $62.000.000. $16.000.000 would be saved to the Government if only the magic word gold could be written in the contract. Congress refused to comply with his request and the purchasers paid the lower price for bonds payable in coin. And now. gentlemen. you propose to pass a bill which makes all Government bondsthose representing greenbacks. worth less than 50 cents on the dollar when the loan was made. and the bonds issued by Mr. Cleveland under the circunlstances I have detailedpayable in gold. Upon what theory do you justify this feature of the bill? Do you expect to satisfy your constituents by the use of lofty platitudes and resounding periods about sound money and the best money and dollars of equal value and the necessity of maintaining the parity? Do you expect to win your constituents approval of this act of reckless profligacy by lauding yourselves as guardians of the credit and honor of the country? You are about to place in the hands of the Secretary of the Treasury power to issue gold bonds. so that in case of its depletion he can replenish the gold reserve. Thus a single officer of the Government is to have power to lay upon this and coming generations everincreasing burdens of taxation. Mr. Carlisle carried on the backroom bond deals. which his countrymen have neither forgotten nor forgiven. under a statute long regarded as obsolete. a statute enacted for a particular purpose many years ago and which had not been thought of for twenty years. Now. instead of repealing that law you are about to enact one vesting permanently in the Secretary of the Treasury a power which in the past has been shamefully abused and which henceforth may be resorted to whenever the friends of the Administration  see fit to raid the gold reserve and compel an issue of bonds to replenish it. Mr. Chairman. without unduly extending my remarks I can not discuss at greater length the details of this bill. Viewed in its entirety the measure is a clumsy effort to establish the English system of finance in the United States. It establishes the gold standard. but does not require the banks to redeem their notes in gold. In England 170 banks of issue. called there provincial banks. may redeem their notes in Bank of England notes. and ultimate redemption is attained by presenting these Bank of England notes for payment. The $150.000.000 gold reserve and certain other Treasury assets set apart as a redemption fund by this measure. and by its provisions separated from other Treasury assets. finds its counterpart in the issue department of the Bank of England. which is in effect a department of the British Government as well as a department of a private corporation. The difference between the English system and the one here proposed is that there the burden of the ultimate redemption of the corporations promises to pay is thrown upon the bank. while this bill imposes that duty upon the Government. At this time I will not undertake to trace the analogy further. It runs all through the scheme except in this. that unfortunately the very best feature of the English scheme of finance is not included. Ireland. Scotland. Wales. and English cities outside of London have local banks of issue. some of which havebeen in existence for more than a century. The notes of these banks circulate almost exclusively in the neighborhoods where they are issued. forming a strictly local medium of exchange and measurably relieving the interior of the destruction of values andbusiness occasioned by panics which have their originin the puts and calls of the gamblers of the London Stock Exchange. The American people know by experience that nationalbank issues have not in the past and will not in the future serve this purpose. I believe that the Government should issue the paper currency of the country. The Constitution vests in this Congress the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof. and power to issue paper currency is no less an attribute of sovereignty than the power to coin money. I But the Republican majority in this House is determined to retire the Governments paper issues and are about to enact a law giving to private corporations this supreme prerogative. They seem to have attempted to adopt in its entirety a scheme of finance in vogue in a foreign country. and. lacking time to fully discuss this aspect of the question under consideration. I can only call attention to the fact that conditions here render it impossible for this country to avail itself of the best features of the English system. And now. Mr. Chairman. a few words as to the levity with which the gentlemen on the other side. nearly every one of whom has confessed that he is a recent convert to Clevelandism. have insisted that the passage of this bill will forever dispose of the question which separated the political parties in 1896. Let me warn the gentlemen who indulge in this illusion that never were they more mistaken. The question yet to be determined is whether the American people sanction a policy conceived by the small number who are benefited by the gold standard. and which has visited upon mankind more misery than all the wars and pestilences of recorded times. You are about to pass a bill intended to perpetuate a system devised for the avowed purpose of cheapening property and increasing the value of money. and think it will be acquiesced in. It never will be. At its inception the movement in favor of monometallism was based upon the preposterous notion that governments were under obligations to protect the value of money and fixed incomes by barring out of the mints the products of .the gold mines of California and Australia. This was to make money the mastereverything else the servant. The question at issue has not changed. The passage of this bill will not change it. Increased production of the gold mines will not eliminate it. Gentlemen say that bimetallism is a dead issue. that hence. forth gold alone is to be the money of final payment. that even though the wisdom of entirely demonetizing silver might have been doubtful at an earlier stage of the discussion. the recent large increase in the production of the gold mines has solved the problem. and therefore there will be general acquiescence in the action about to be taken by the lb cKinley Administration. Mr. Chairman. before entering upon a discussion of this. the crucial question. I desire to state in precise terms the basis of the demand for the demonetization of one of the precious metals: when and where it originated. and the motive underlying it. I believe that with a full understanding of indisputable historical facts there would be no division of opinion among the masses in this country concerning the matter. A great many Republican orators and writers have contended that the lpeople the world over grew tired of silver: that they longed to get rid of it. and that to gratify this desire it was demonetized by legislation. In other words. they ascribe the adoption of monometallism to evolution. the survival of the fittest metal. and insist that silver was discarded because the advAnced civilization had reached conditions where it was no longer suitable for monetary purposes. This argument. if argument it can becalled.has been madeplausible by the fact that in past ages iron. leather. shells. and other gross substances were used as money. and each in its turn abandoned on account of its unsuitableness to serve the purposes of more advanced civilization. In order to demolish this subterfuge and makeshift it is only necessary to call attention to the fact that in the earlyfifties. when first the agitation in favor of monometallism began in Europe. its advocates made war on gold and not on silver. Long before that period Ricardo. the great English economist. had advanced the opinion that silver was more suitable for monetary purposes than gold. and supported his contention with arguments of great weight. probably the most forceful of which was that the susceptibility of silver to subdivision into coins of small value adapted it to the daily transactions of ninetenths of thepopulation and the fact that by its use loss by abrasion was onetwentiethof that entailed by the circulation of gold. It would require a volume to even cursorily review the history of this controversy down to this the last act in the consummation of a scheme the sole purpose of which always has been and now is diminishment of the worlds supply of metallic money. The demand for the demonetization of gold nearly fifty years ago was incited by the rise in prices resulting from a large increase in the production of the gold mines. Germany. Austria. Holland. and. I think. Portugal actually demonetized gold. and in Europe the fear that it was about to become worthless as a money metal became so general that astute shopkeepers drew trade to their houses by hanging out banners offering to take gold for goods. A decline in gold production ensued and the agitation ceased. but not until writers in France. Germany. and England. voicing the sentiment of the affluent classes of that period. had published numerous books and pamphlets urging the demonetization of gold as a measure made necessary by the tendency to rising prices everywhere prevalent. The agitation in favor of monometallism was renewed in 1867. This time it was the discovery of rich silver mines that alarmed the money lenders. bondholders. and others living on fixed incomes. Extravagant stories had been sent out as to the wonderful productiveness of the Nevada mines. Numerous conferences ensued. and finally at the Paris conference of 1867. at which all favor this measureI desire tosay. first. that history mpjtions no the great European powers and the United States were represented. instance in which a plethora of specie has injured a nahion. but an explicit demand for the adoption of monometallism was pro- history does mention a score of great empires that have passed mulgated.

Sir. history abounds in reference to periods during price of living. therefore the upward tendency of prices must be which civilization languished because of a dearth of gold and arrested. silver. At this point I invite especial attention to a fact which it seems Such was the condition of the world when this continent was to me effectually disposes of the contention that its unsuitableness discovered. and when Spanish treasure ships. laden with gold and for monetary purposes occasioned the demonetization of silver.

It seems to have been reserved for this century to apply all that man had learned before to peaceful pursuits and to experience a realization of every hope indulged by the centuries of the past. In all European countries there has been an enormous increase in the volume of exchanges. domesti6 and foreign. During this century there has been a large increase in the area of civilized states. cities have sprung up surrounded by densely populated communities. in regions which. fifty years ago. -had not been explored. It requires a larger sum of money to operate the worlds railroads now than it did to pay all the expenses of all the Governments in the world one hundred years ago. The daily expenses of the newspapers and printing houses in Christendom now exceed the pay roll of the factories of the world a hundred years ago. The great State of New York contains a larger population than inhabited this continent a hundred years ago. The foreign commerce. including imports and exports. of the United States this year has exceeded the foreign commerce of all the nations combined a hundred years ago. The inspiration of modern industrial development has spread to the Orient. and the sleeping millions referred to by the great Napoleon as factors in the worlds affairs that were dormant. but not dead. have awakened from the slumber of ages. Industrial and commercial development is going on by leaps and bounds. not in the United States alone. but in every corner of the world. and before I conclude my remarks I think I will be able to demonstrate that. no matter what the output of the mines. it is not and never will be sufficient. even partially. to meet the demand for metallic money. Why. Mr. Chairman..stronger arguments for the doctrines contended for by bimetallists have never been made than have fallen from the lips of gentlemen on the other side of the Chamber who have spoken in favor of this bill. They have said over and over again that the revival in business which has recently taken place was attributable to an increased stock of the precious metals. They have attributed rising prices to an increase in the per capita circulation. - They have pointed to the enormous quantity of gold brought to this country by the favorable balance of trade. to increased issues of paper currency and the coinage of several millions of silver as blessings of incomputible value. The gentleman from Indiana presented and has printed in the RECORD elaborate tables and voluminous statistics. all going to show a considerable increase in the volume of money. and he and other Republican orators who followed him agree that renewed business activity. rising prices. increased production. and vast additions to the wealth of the country have resulted. Could recognition of the quantitative theory of money be more complete? And yet in 1896 you said we had plenty of money and denied that more would restore prosperity. Mr. Chairman. it seems to me that in trying to make a very strong case in favor of a bill that fastens gold monometallism upon the country the gentlemen have taken a position absolutely fatal to the theory on which the measure rests. They have laid much stress upon the large increase in our export trade. and with the native modesty of orthodox Republican statesmanship have taken unto themselves and their party full credit therefor. What. may I ask. have the p.eliticians had to do with bringing about the more favorable business conditions now prevailing? Did Republican stump speeches cause for three consecutive years. beginning with 1896. crop failures in India. Russia. the Balkan States. and AustriaHungary. our rivals in the production of wheat. thereby giving us a monopoly of European markets at prices made higher by abnormal scarcity? This. not Republican speeches. is what gave us a large favorable balance of trade and brought about accidental replenishment of our stock of metallic money. without which prosperity would have been impossible. By pointing to large imports of gold and consequent better times the Repub.icans admit that what we needed in 1896 was not confidence. but more money. It came to us. not as a result of anything done by the politicians or national bankers. but in payment for the products of the farms of the Mississippi Valley. Missouri. Kansas. and Nebraskathree States that cast their electoral votes for Bryan and bimetallismhad more to do with restoring prosperity than all New England. with New York thrown in for good count. Before entering upon an examination of the elaborate tables and voluminous statistics cited by the gentleman from Indiana I desire to call attention to some wellknown economic facts. The first and most important is that according to the very best authorities fully threefourths of the gold produced by the mines is absorbed by the arts or carried to oriental countries. from whence it never returns. Now. I know there is a disposition to brush this statement aside as incredible. but facts coming constantly under our own observation. as well as the history of the race. prove its correctness. Gentlemen may say that this might have been true when the mines were producing a much smaller quantity than now. but that South Africa. the Klondike. and Cripple Creek are so deluging the world with gold that now no such a thing is possible. I think it is only necessary to casually examine this assumption to prove its incorrectness. Other factors besides the extent of the production of the mines enter into the problem. It is in periods of depression that the largest additions are made to the volume of metallic money. In hard times economy is practiced by a large proportion of the population. Protracted periods of commercial paralysis compel a great many to forego the luxuries. The first pinch of hard times cuts down expenditures for things that can be dispensed with. and as long as hard times continue economy is practiced. During such a period the encroachment of the arts upon the stock of precious metals is at the minimum. Under such circumstances out of a relatively small output of the mines the money supply would be considerably increased. The converse of this proposition is true. General prosperity enables a large proportion of the population to gratify the whims of fashion or cravings inspired by love of the beautiful and unattainable. It results that at the zenith of a prosperous era the consumption of gold is at the maximum. and with large production the increase in metallic money- is small. And I think. Mr. Chairman. thatright here is found an explanation of what otherwise would be a mystery. We are told that gold and silver are durable metdls. and that since their preciousness is a motive for their preservation from destruction the aggregate stock is being constantly increased. Where. then. are the vast treasures that have been wrung from the mines by the toil and sacrifice of all the generations that have preceded us? To my mind the answer to this question seems very simple. As you walk down Pennsylvania avenue keep your eye on the shopkeepers windows and then bear in mind that the display of jewelry and works of art wrought in gold and silver there seen are duplicated in every city in Christendom. In the palaces of the rich and in the hovels of the poor you may find an answer to this question. which. I think. effectually disposes of the arguments made in support of this measure. The sfatistics presented by the gentleman from Indiana clearly prove tliat. notwithstanding the large increase in the production of the gold mines mentioned by him so boastfully. the addition to the worlds stock of coined money has not relieved the strain felt by the financial world in recent years nor ameliorated the intensity of the struggle which constantly for years has menaced the prosperity of nations and the fortunes of individuals. The gentleman from Indiana presents a table showing the production of gold from 1862 to 1898. inclusive. According to this table the world produced during this period gold of the value of $5.082.935.800. Mulhall gives the aggregate stock of gold money in the world in 1898 at$4.594.900.0U0. Adding. $150.000.000 as a liberal estimate of the sum of subsequent additions to that amount. we have $4.744.900.000 as the aggregate stock of gold money now in the world. Do these figures not plainly prove that there is now in use in the world as money a great deal less than the product of this century? Do they not in fact prove that the worlds stock of gold money is at this time barely equal to the product of the mines during the past thirtyfive years? They certainly do prove that gentlemen who have persuaded themselves that gold production has grown so large as to effectually settle the money question have reached that conclusion without investiuation or reflection. and that some of the orators of the other sidewho have sneered at bimetallism as a dead issue may be pardoned on account of their want of information on this subject. But. Mr. Chairman. in other respects the statistics presented by the gentleman from Indiana are absolutely conclusive on this point. According to the table showing the production of gold in recent years. the mines produced during the past ten years in round numbers $1.785.000.000 in gold. Statisticians say that this years product will amount to over $300.000.000. Let us place it at that sum. This added to the product of the past ten years. as shown by the table brought here by the gentleman from Indiana . makes the aggregate product since 1888 $2.085.000.000. This is a very large amount of gold. and if we accept the tableo as accurate. and I know they are drawn from the most reliable sources within our reach. it is equal to twothirds of all the gold money in the world in 1873. But I assert. and shall undertake to demonstrate. that studied in the light of current history these figures. instead ofproving that it is safe to rely upon the gold supply for a supply of metallic money. prove precisely the contrary. I have called attention to the product of the mines during the past ten years for the purpose of inquiring of gentlemen on the other side of the House what has become of it? It is true that recently our imports of gold have largely exceeded our exports. but it is also true that during the tenyear period referred to we sent abroad nearly a hundred million more gold than we imported. Why is it. then. thatwhen the United States reclaimed less than two hundred and eighty million of the three hundred and sixtyfour million sent abroad during the past ten years all European capitals experienced the shock? Vhen the gold went abroad we were engulfed in ruin. The gold recently imported into this country came to us in the ordinary course of trade. and when it came to us a wail was heard in every countingroom in London. Berlin. Paris. and St. Petersburg. To prevent gold exports the Imperial Bank of Germany advanced interest rates to 7 per cent. So did the Bank of England. and France took similar measures to prevent gold leaving that country. For three months or more the European papers have been discussing with alarm the prospects of further losses of gold. What. then. becomes of the pretense that enormous production has settled the question? If increased production has not relieved the situation. what may we expect when production declines? When the South African war broke out. the London papers. reflecting the views of English bankers. indulged in gloomy forebodings as to the effect the loss of the product of the Transvaal mines would have upon the money market. and this notwithstanding the fact that over $2.000.000.000 has been produced by the mines since 1888. Again I inquire. Where has it gone? What has become of it? While nominally all European countries have adopted the gold standard. Russia. Austria. Italy. and Spain use depreciated paper. Gold measures their debts. but the money of commerce used by their people is paper. Austria has been on a paper basis ever since the Napoleonic wars. with no prospect of returning to the use of specie as long as the gold standard holds sway. This observation applies also to Italy and Spain. where paper has been the money of commerce for a considerable period and is likely to remain so indefinitely. Russia has the largest gold reserve in the world. but ever since the Crimean war depreciated paper has been the sole circulating medium in that country. A year ago the great Empire began the redemption and retirement of paper. with a view to the resumption of specie payment. and thereby became subject to the evils which for a generation have afflicted every nation in which the gold standard prevails. 1 thus refer to the status of monetary affairs in European countries for the purpose of directing attention to the fact that whatever advantages have grown out of the enormous production of gold. so frequently referred to in this discussion. have accrued to the five leading goldstandard countriesthe United States. France. Germany. Great Britain. and Russia. Has the gold produced by the mines in recent years gone into the monetary circulation of these countries? Go read their newspapers for an answer. Read the foreign telegrams that appear day after day in the American newspapers. and learn that all Europe is threatened with a gold famine. When recently the Secretary of the Treasury bought twenty millions of the Government bonds in order to relieve the New York money market the London papers expressed thankfulness for the timely intervention and congratulated the capitalists upon the fact that this would relieve the stringency in New York and prevent our drawing large balances which stand to our credit in London banking houses. and added that this would at least temporarily relieve the pressure in London. but that at Berlin pronounced stringency existed. and that no means for the relief of Germany were in sight. Since then it has transpired that the action of our Treasury Department has enabled New York to go to Londons relief. Large shipments of gold are going from New York to the English capital. and our bankers are adding to their large English balances. Notwithstanding the stringency at home and the fact that they could tomorrow draw on London for many millions. they are exporting gold by the million to prop up the gold standard there. Mr. Chairman. the gen~tlemen on the other side of the Chamber look upon this great question from the standpoint from which Europe viewed it six or seven years ago. Then the balance of trade was against us. and in payment we were compelled to send large quantities of gold to Europe. The result was great stringency. Recently the balance of trade has been against Europe and part of our gold has come back to us and Europe is threatened with a financial collapse. I direct attention to current events for the purpose of again inquiring what has become of the deluge of gold that has poured out of the mines during the last ten or twelve years. I declare that it has not placed even the strongest money powers in the world on a strong financial basis. We contended in. 1896 that there was not enough gold in the world to furnish the great commercial powers with a sufficient stock of specie. Everything that has transpired since then has proven the correctness of that position. In conclusion. I desire to state broadly what I conceive to be the real problem involved. When first the bondholders and kindred classes demanded the demonetization of one or the other of the precious metals in order to make money scarce. the fixed debts of the world represented a comparatively small sum. I have seen in print the statement that at the end of the Napoleonic wars the worlds fixed debts and dividendbearing stocks in quasipublic corporations combined did not exceed twenty billions. It is probable that by 1850 the amount had doubled. and recent estimates place it at from one hundred and fifty to two hundred billions. Including State. municipal. corporate. and individual debts secured by mortgages. doubtless the aggregate is at least one hundred and fifty billions. Placing the earning power of this enormous sum at 4 per cent per annum. it exacts in dividends and interest every year the enormous sum of $6.000.000.000. Under existing conditions a large portion of the six billionsat least twothirds of it. and probably moreis added to the principal. and so the world sinks eeper and deeper into the bondage of debt. Every year the total sum of fixed charges becomes greater. The enactment of this bill is another step in the direction of compelling the world to go on compounding the interest on fixed debts. thereby fastening perpetually upon theworld the grasp of the money power. Mr. Chairman. gentlemen. usury is devouring the world. Everywhere the usurer is omnipotent. I firmly believe there is not in the world a single government that is not absolutely controlled by financial syndicates. corporations. and millionaire bankers. In this free Republic they have seized control of first one political party and then another in order to work out their evil purposes. They elect our Presidents. in many cases name the judges of our courts. and in every State in the Union employ the professional lobbyist to superintend politics. manipulate conventions. and control public policies. They seduce the weak. buy the vicious. and. by means of political enginery that only money will buy. strike down and destroy whoever is bold enough to dispute their sway. Centralized wealth is a menace to human liberty in every part of the globe. In these latter days it has achieved many victories beneficial to the few and oppressive to the many. It has made kings. presidents. legislatures. and courts the instrumentalities by which it is rapidly absorbing the wealth of Christendom. Grievous have been the sins of truculent rulers and public officials who have yielded to its blandishments. but of all the infamies ever perpetrated for its benefit the step about to be taken by this Congress is the most infamous. Sir. the impartial future historian will not fail to brand with dishonor the political party that is about to commit this crime. By the passage of this bill the scheme devised by the bondholders and capitalists of Europe fifty years ago receives the approval of the Republican party. It never has received the approval of the American people. and it never will. Today you gloat over this victory achieved by the flagrant violation of the confidence of the people. but a day of reckoning will come. Be sure thy sin shall find thee out. Throughout this discussion gentlemen have mentioned boastfully the general revival of business and industry throughout the country. the inference being that the country is indebted to Republican stump speakers for better times. My friends. prosperity is not the creation of politicians. The men who toil. and not the men who talk.perform the labor and produce the wealth that blesses mankind. To the miner who plies his weary task unblessed by the sunlight. to the sailor who braves the dangers of the deep. to the pioneer who fells the forest. to the husbandman plowing in the field. to the artisan to whose skilled hands we are indebted for every comfort that blesses our homes. to Gods creatures of the humbler sort the country is indebted for renewed prosperity. If the eloquent gentlemen vho have so immoderately praised themselves and their party as the authors of prosperity will look about them. without difficulty they may learn the cause of better times. The source of prosperity is told by the myriad voices of busy industry. the thunder of the locomotive. the whir of factory wheels. the song of the husbandman as he plows his field tell us whence it comes. To those who toil and are content. if so be it that poor privilege be given them. be awarded all the glory which Republican orators would take unto themselves. Blessed be they. the fruition of whose devotion is read in the sheen of golden harvests and seen in the product of field. forest. factory. mine. and shop.

President McKinley. when assuming the duties of the highest office in all the world. said: Economy is demanded in every branch of the Government at all times. but especially in periods. like the present. of depression in business and distress among the people. The depressed condition of industry on the farm and in the mine and factory has lessened the ability of the people to meet the demands upon theml. * . * These patriotic sentiments had hardly died away from his lips when this Congress assembled. Under such conditions. with the Treasury full to overflowing. with an excess in our vaults of money sufficient. under the present law. to meet the difference between our receipts and expenditures duriiing the whole term of this Administration. the country had a right to expect that the burdens now existing upon a taxridden people would not be added to and the expense of Government increased. We met. and $73.000.000 of the peoples money was voted away. $53.000.000 of which went in forty minutes. or at the rate of over a million dollars per minute. This bill was then presented with the complacent statement by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee that it was estimated to add thereby $113.000.000 per annum to our present revenue. which. under our indirect system of taxation. means an addition of more than $500.000.000 per annum of tribute laid upon a sorely oppressed people. There is not a business man in all the land who would adopt such methods in the conduct of his own business. There is not a member of Congress who does not know that the present difference between receipts and expenditures could be met for a long time by using the money available in the Treasury for that purpose. without increasing the tax burdens of our people. There is not a member of Congress who does not know that the expenses of Government could be safely reduced. without impairment of thepublic service. to a point where receipts under present laws would largely exceed expenditures. without an additional dollar of taxation. But. Mr. Speaker. the publicans who went forth armed with a Roman commission to take taxes for Rome from oppressed Israel. and as much more for themselves as they pleased. were less merciless in their exactions than have been the contributors to the Republican campaign fund. who are the beneficiaries of this bill. Zacchens at least was willing to restore. Not one of them is willing to forbear. To say that I expected a different result in the event of Republican success in the last campaign would not be true. I have never known the time when any good thing could come from the Republican party. True. even out of Nazareth good came. butit was by a miraculous combination of divine and human agencies that the lowly Nazarene came forth to bless the world. That theRepublican party is very human no man will deny. that. any touch of divinity ever attends its pathway all good men question. The Republican party has entered the field with a new proposition in political economy. that is. that when distress has spread its batlike wings over factory. store. mine. and farm. it is possible to restore prosperity byr increased taxation. We may well be pardoned if we doubt the success of this experiment. If successful. to say the least. the problems of government will be greatly simplified. Although not a physician. if called upon to diagnose this plan. I should pronounce it an effort to cross the modern faith cure upon the ancient school of bloodletting. surgery. which drafted upon the lifeblood of the patient for every ailment. The short time accorded me will not permit a proper discussion of this measure. Suffice it to say. that it is the worst bill and the highest rate of taxation ever crystallized into law. There is not a trust existing. or an embryo one. that does not find ample field for its rapacity within its folds. Never yet have the powers of Government been so perverted. the interests of favored classes so - advanced. and the rights of the masses of our people so trampled upon as by this outrageous and indefensible measure. As a Democrat and a partisan. I might find it in my heart to -urge on the Republican party in their wild orgie of robbery by taxation under the guise of law. Unlike the European brigands. who laid in wait for the rich and powerful and held only the noble and wealthy for ransom. sometimes even relieving the poor * and weak. the Republican party in this bill have pressed hardest upon the great laboring and agricultural classes. who brave the rude blasts of winter and swelter under the summers sun to poorly supply their families with even the necessaries of life. Why. they have not even permitted the Bible to come in on the free list. that oppressed humanity might seek help from on high to bear their heavy cross with patience and resignation. Why. sir. this bill is a declaration of commercial war upon the nations of the earth. It will not open a single market for anything we make or produce. it will close many to various industries. it will not add a customer to our mills or factories from abroad. and domestic consumption can not be increased by raising the cost of our own wares to a people without money to buy their present output at existing prices. Mr. Speaker. while I have no sort of sympathy with the idea that it is unDemocratic to raise a proper portion of revenue for support of Government by a tax on wool. hides. lumber. sugar. and other socalled raw materials. the product chiefly of the South and West. I have even less sympathy for those who. for the sake of a pitiful crumb from the Republican table. would add -to the enormities of this bill. frained purely upon protective lines. taxes upon some product of their own immediate section and clamor for export bounties with the cry that in the general game of grab all and steal all they want their section to have a fair share. When powerful enough to prevail. such sentiments will destroy free government. If inspiration can not come from a higher purpose. let them know in such a game the South and West must go to the wall. Nature. in common with the industry and wants of man. has decreed that the products of the mines and factories of the sterile East are such as the world has for sale. while the products of the South and West are those which the world must buy. High tariff must therefore mean that the South and West shall buy in the highest and sell in the cheapest markets of the world. But to my mind. Mr. Speaker. the most indefensible school of thought in either wing of the Capitol is that which professes to come here as the representatives of the people. and. after denouncing this bill as infamous in its provisions and a hotbed for trusts. yet fail to register their convictions. and sit in grand. gloomy. and peculiar silence when their names are called to vote. While I recognize the money question as the paramount one. I denounce a policy which. in order to emphasize that issue. will not vote for or against this infamous measure. There is no man in Congress more absolutely devoted to the cause of bimetallism and the free coinage of both silver and gold at the present ratio than I. and yet I am persuaded that even with free coinage prosperity can not be restored so long as measures like this are permitted to become laws. They add year by year to the difficulties that confront us. caused by unequal conditions and unequal opportunities. created by vicious laws. An increase in the volume of money under such conditions would bring temporary relief. but so surely as we live when we continue the privilege of special interests to levy tribute upon the lessfavored masses. in the end the few will gather the fruits of the toil of the many and billionaires take the place of the multimillionaires.. The Democratic party is a party of principles and not of issues. and is not willing to add to the burdens upon our people by passing this bill in the belief that in the hour of their distress the people will be willing to vote for silver in the hope of relief. Mr. Speaker. long after the silver question has been settled. long after bimetallism has become the established policy of the American people. so successful in its operation that its present opponents will be among its warmest defenders. the question of taxation will be here to plague us. The Democratic party is great enough. and good enough. and broad enough. and big enough to shelter within its folds every lover of our country and every advocate of bimetallism. Based upon the corner stone of equal and exact justice to all and special privileges to none. deeply imbued with the sentiments expressed by its immortal founder in the Declaration of Independence. it has. through victory and defeat. through plague. pestilence. and famine. through battle. murder. and sudden death. survived all its past adversaries. and will live to bury its present foes. Willing to join hands with the friends of silver to restore the money of the Constitution. it can not afford to abandon any of its cardinal principles to make new converts. According to every man the right to go the path wherein he thinks his duty lies. not desiring to offend hny. let me say it is fundamental among the tenets of the Democratic party that tariff taxes can not be justly laid for other than revenue purposes. and that man who believes that this Government has the constitutional right to lay and collect taxes for any other purpose than the support of  Government honestly and economically administered. whatever else he may be. is not a Democrat. The Republican party seems anxious to pass this bill in spite of the fact that its Gold Democratic allies. who made the election of President McKinley possible. feel that they have been buncoed . and that a campaign pitched upon the lines of socalled sound money had the victory thus won converted into a feast of tariff debauchery. Goldstandard tariff reformers will not be satisfied with protection robbery. opponents of trusts will find no comfort in this measure. organized labor has not yet realized upon Republican promises of more work at better wages. the business interests. which press for the passage of a bankruptcy bill. are not jubilant over the exploits of our bimetallic rovers or the belated message in favor of a farcical currency commission. delayed pension claimants will not glory in the invasion of Europe by General Miles. the striking miners will find no consolation in the Queens jubilee or Whitelaw Reids having slept in Windsor Castle [laughter . lovers of liberty will not accept the acquisition of the Hawaiian lepers as an atonement for the betrayal of Cuban patriots. [Loud applause.] The days of the Republican party will be few and full of trouble. and the wrath of an outraged people. which reached highwater mark in 1892. will come again and cover them in 1900. as the molten lava from Vesuvius did the ancient cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.

I am opposed to the passage of this bill. for two reasons. In the first place. I believe it will be detrimental to the interests of American labor. and in the second place. I believe that it will be destructive of all true sportsmanship. that is. of the true yachting spirit. as now shown by the investment in large steam yachts. I think it is rather objectionable. in the closing hours of this session. to attempt to rush through without consideration an amendment to the Revised Statutes. to a provision of law which was enacted some twentysix years ago and has remained in force ever since. in all the tariff agitations through which we have passed. I call the attention of the House to the provisions of the act of 1870. which will be found in seqtion 4216 of the Revised Statutes. That provision does what? It extends a privilege to foreignbuilt yachts. It gives certain privileges to the gentlemen who invest their money or have invested large sums of money in steam yachts built abroad. It is as follows: SEc. 4216. Yachts. belonging to a regularly organized yacht club of any foreign nation which shall extend like privileges to the yachts of the United States. shall have the privilege of entering or leaving any port of the United StatesWithout doing what?without entering or clearing at the customhouse thereof. or paying tonnage tax. This proposed bill is special legislation of a most objectionable kind. because. although it comes before us in the guise of an attempt to benefit American shipbuilders or yacht builders. it really strikes a blow at some eight or ten or twenty gentlemen in the United States who have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the purchase of their yachts under the guaranty of existing law. Now. as to the first question. the interest of American labor. you must bear in mind that the cost of running a yacht is far more than the initial cost. The man who gives a hundred thousand dollars for his yacht abroad and brings it into our waters keeps it here season after season. spends hundreds of thousands of dollars on repairs to the yacht. on the equipment of the yacht. and on the cost of the manning and continuous running of the vessel. So I say that if you pass this bill you will have no plausible excuse. no specious excuse even. before your constituents. You will tell them. IWe have stopped the building of these yachts abroad. but you can not say to them that these yachts will be built here. The reason is that the yards abroad are especially equipped for the construction of these steam yachts today. I have no doubt that within a few years the time will come when we shall build them just as well here. just as satisfactorily to the owners. and at an equal costthat is. not at the excessive cost that would be imposed upon the yacht owner today. But in the meantime I tell you that it can not be done. that the men whose ownership of these yachts built abroad you stop. and whom you force to give up the purchase of yachts abroad. will not go into your yards in Maine or elsewhere and buy a yacht. because the cost is too great. because thedelay is too great. and they will virtually be compelled to give up their whole interest in steam yachting. So I say to you that this will be a mistake even from that standpoint. and I believe as much as any man in the United States in the due protection of the interests of American labor. I do not think I have ever cast a vote which has not been inc favor of American labor or the interest of the American mechanic. Now. let us see.what will be the effect on the interest in yachting. on steam yachting in the United States. if you pass this measuire. You will strike a serious blow at that interest. because the interest in steam yachting. as in every kind of yachting. as in every sport which commends itself to the American people and to manhood throughout the world. depends largely upon emulation and competition. It is a noble thing to have these yachts. built in foreign yards. come into our waters and stimulate our American builders. If no English yacht had ever crossed the Atlantic. if no English yacht had ever entered the port of New York. you would have no yacht races today. you would have no general widespread interest in the spirit of yachting. So it has been with the introduction of steam yachts built abroad. They have stimulated the interest in steam yachting. and had those yachts not been permitted to enter our ports without the imposition of onerous and destructive charges I tell you that there would not be onehalf or onequarter or onetenth of the number of steam yachts in this country today. I should like to have a portion of this article read. or I shall read it. because it presents the view of a true American who is interested in these steam yachts much more forcibly than I can: That such abill would in the end result in any benefit to American designers and builders is a matter of serious doubt. and as a pplied to steam yachting it would work decided detriment to the sport for a long time to come. The yachtsman who contemplates the investment of several hundred thousand dollars in a steam yacht has only to look into the matter superficially to make sure of some very important facts. On the one hand. by going abroad he can secure in a comparatively short time a steam yacht of the highest possible class. designed. for instance. by Mr. Watson. whose long list of successful boatsMaria. May. Rona. Sapphire. and others larger and fineris a most satisfactory guaranty of the performance of a new vessel. The yacht will be built in a yard where such work is a specialty and by workmen familiar with all its details. and a thorough carrying out of all guaranties as to time of delivery and quality of work may be confidently looked for. If. on the other hand. the order be placed at home with the recognized builders of steam yachts. there is no guaranty as to who will design the vessel. when she will be completed. or that she will be other than a flat failure when nominally ready for delivery. If anyone is inclined to dispute this. there is ample evidence of its truth in two of the largest and most expensive of the recently built American yachts. one a failure in appearance. speed. accommodation. and all the qualities that a steam yacht should have. the other evei a worse example. and only accepted by her owner after a long litigation. The passage of this bill will make a square issue for American yachtsmen to consider. either to have no steam yacht or to pay- an excessive price for one that is practically useless. There are reasons which need not be quoted now for the unfortunate condition of steamyacht building in America today. a condition closely identical with that of the building of sailing yachts in I880. That these latter conditions were so altered as to lead in a few years to the design and construction of such American yachts as Puritan. Mayflower. Volunteer. Gloriana. Defender. and Niagara is due almost entirely to the introduction into America of a few English yachtsMadge. Maggie. Stranger. and Claraand the visits of Genesta. Galatea. and Thistle. And now I submit. gentlemen. that for these reasons you ought not. without due and careful consideration. to pass any such measure as this. I believe that a fair spirit of emulation and competition is best subserved by allowing a few of these English steam yachts to come in. There is no great danger. It does not affect the people at large to exempt these yachts. This bill will not bring in any revenue to us. Its purpose is not to bring revenue. Its purpose is to force an American who wants to invest $100.000 in a yacht to have it built in an American yard. at a maximum cost. and at the greatest possible risk. Now. whether you be in favor of protection. free trade. or tariff for revenue only. it seems to me that this sort of legislation is unwise. that it is unsportmanlike. and that it should not receive the approbation of the dominant majority."},{"1":"5.302188e+08","2":"1895","3":"H","4":"ERDMAN","5":"298","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"Mr. Chairman. this bill was prepared by the AttorneyGeneral. Having been referred to the Committee on Labor. it was considered by that committee in consultation with the labor chiefs who were most concerned in the passage of the measure. It has now the positive approval of the Commissioner of Labor. of all the labor chiefs. and probably of the AttorneyGeneral. though some of the amendments adopted by the committee have altered somewhat the character of the bill as originally presented by him. The purpose of the bill in the first place was to provide a tribunal which should endeavor to procure mediation and conciliation before arbitration was resorted to. That is made a special feature of this bill. It is believed that after the first blow has been struck. the settlement of. labor questions is very difficult. and that if mediation and conciliation be early resorted to. it will probably avoid in many cases the necessity of arbitration. In the next place. a permanent tribunal was not favored. yet the tribunal already partially organized has been adopted in order that speedy action may be taken on such questions as may arise. The body already in existence under the law. consisting of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Commissioner of Labor. has been selected as the tribunal before which the initiatory proceedings are to be taken. The method of selection of the arbitrators. the mode of action. the enforcement of the conclusions or judgments arrived at. are all succinctly and clearly set forth in the bill more clearly than I could state them. The bill contains no compulsory feature. It was believed by the committee that compulsory arbitration is not in accord with American institutions or American ideas.

Some of our Democratic friends seem more especially anxious for repeal. because. in the first place. they did not vote for the bill when it passed. and secondly. because they were prQfuse in the denunciations of the act in their national convention. which. in the language of the platform. should make all of its supporters. meaning fiiends of the act. anxious for its speedy repeal. Mr. President. in. my action I am not prompted by any political platform. I shall act as my judgment dictates is best. I will vote for repeal because it may help to restore confidence. even though the act did not have much part in producing the lack of it. Mr. President. there are other causes for the present situation. The Senator from New York in his remarks the other day suggested that. the question should be discussed in all its bearings. I shall ask the Senate to look at the subject from another standpoint. I do not regard it as out of place to look at the commercial questions which bear upon the general situation. A year ago the financial condition of the Government and its Treasury was satisfactory. and the credit of the nation at the highest point ever attained in our history. A year ago the gold bags of the world were ready to be poured into the United States Treasury in exchange for United States bonds at 2 per centcertainly at 21 per cent. Whether our credit still remains as good I am in doubt. I make no mistake when I say that the credit of the ation was higher and better a year ago than that of any other government or financial institution on the globe. A year ago our internal and foreign commerce waslarger than ever in our history. A year ago the manufacturing and mining industries were turning out a larger product than ever. a greater number of laborers were employed than ever. and the rate of wages was higher than ever. What is the. spectacle which confronts us now and commands our attention? The credit of our National Government called in question for the first time since the outbreak of the war. and the. commerce of the country reduced. factories closed or running on half time. mines shut up. and a million of men unemployed and willing to work for even half the wages they received a year ago. Mr. President. my object is to seek the cause of all this untoward condition of affairs. When Abraham Lincoln was inaugurated President of the United States. in 1861. it was the end of a period of hard times. It may be said to mark the end of an epoch in American history and the beginning of a new one. The old one went out leaving the people. poor. m ith no money and no work. The new one was inaugurated in a period of extreme financial depression among the people. with no national credit. and the country soon involved in the most expensive war ever waged on this planet. I shall not stop now to describe the financial processes by which the National Treasury was abundantly replenished. the expenditures of a great war met. and the national credit lifted to the high plane which it occupied a year ago. It may be of interest to stale that the expenses growing out of the civil war up to June 30. 1893. amounted to the enormous sum of $8.000.000.000. The bonded debt reached its highest point in August. 1865. now twentyeight years ago. On the 30th of June last it had been reduced to about $841.000.000. I state these facts to show the financial power of this Government when properly administered. At the beginning of this epoch in which the Republican party held substantial control a policy of taxation was inaugurated. both internal and customs. having one great object in view. the preservation of the life of the nation. The people bore taxation as the soldiers bore armsto save the Union. Money flowed into the National Treasury through the cbannels of internal taxation and customs duties. The nation entered upon a career of commercial and industrial vigor never before experienced. Protectivetariff laws had taken their place upon the statute books. Prior to the war no tariff law had been pronounced in favor of protection. and neither did a very long period elapse under a protective tariff to test its influence in favor of national prosperity or to demonstrate its influence in favor of American labor. Under the assurance that the needs of the Government would cause the policy of protection to be steadfastly maintained. there was seen an advance in every commercial and industrialpursuit. the like of which the world had never seen. I will not stop to give the statistics to prove what I state. they can be easily procured. I will say that. the total value of the property devoted to manufactures and mining in 1892 amounted to nearly $9.000.000.000. the result in large measure of the financial policy of the Government prevailing for the last thirty years. In November. 1892. an election came on and the party now in full possession of the executive and legislative branches of the Government triumphed. It came in. as speakers on the opposite side of this Chamber have repeatedly said. pledged to the 11.90 repeal of the protectivetariff laws of the country. pledged to overturn the policy under which our industries and resources had been developed. pledged to the proposition that any protective tariff is unconstitutional and is a robbery of the many for the benefit of the few. pledged to overturn the national banking system. which had furnished the best paper currency to the people the country ever had. by the repeal of the 10 percent tax on Statebank circulation. and the establishment of State banks with a paper currency different and peculiar to every State and current nowhere except in the neighborhood of its issue and afta discount everywhere. if history repeats itself. andit surely will. Down with the tariff. up with the reform tariff. whatever that may mean. Down with the Sherman law. up with free coinage. Down with the national banks. up with State banks. This is the bill of fare which will be put before the people if the history of the dominant party in the Senate and the utterances of its national conventions are an index of its future conduct. What wonder. Mr. President. when the country realized what had been done in securing this change of policy. by the election of a Democratic President and a Congress Democratic in both branches. distrust. hesitation. want of confidence seized the people. which has resulted in an almost complete paralysis of business and the hiding away of the circulating medium of the country. and finally in the President calling Congress together. We will repeal the act of 1890. because it is not wise to continue in force a statute providing for the purchase of 4.500.000 ounces of silver per month and issuing paper which the Government is bound to protect. I hope its repeal will be of service in removing the paralysis now upon business. but we will not soon have good times and good wages again it all the pledges made by the party now in power are redeemed in good faith. I hope I am mistaken. I am as anxious as any man to see confidence re restored. to see the hundreds of thousands of idle men given a chance to earn good wages. If the people could be assured of the policy that is to prevail for the next four years they would know what they had to meet. Mr. President. what is to be the policy of the Administration party on financial questions? I speak of the Administration party. because there are now two wings of Democracy in the Senate. Is the party simply to repeal the silverpurchasing act of 1890 and then take a rest? Are we to have the national banking system swept away. the circulation (the best we ever had) taken up. and greenback promises to pay substituted? The chairman of the Committee on Appropriations is headed in that direction. If these things are to come to pass you will find that instead of a renewal of the good times we had less than a year ago. that the gloom of stragnation. poverty. and. distress will settle down upon the country for years to come. Agriculture. manufactures. commerce. and navigation. thefour pillars of our prosperity. as Jefferson once said. will continue to languish. Our friends on the other side in this discussion have given much attention to the question of the construction of the money plank of their national platform. one side insisting that it meant unconditional repeal of the silver act of 1890. the other that it meant conditional repeal. Strong arguments have been made on both sides of the question. The Senator from North Carelina . on Friday last. made the very potent argument. from a. Democratic standpoint. that by conditional repeal that party would be united. I infer that he regards it as divided if unconditional repeal of the silver act is accomplished. This. Mr. President. would be a calamity the country could easily bear. Mr. President. the platforms of the two parties on the money question are not very unlike in either language or meaning. and the prominent feature of each was that every dollar. whether of paper or coin. issued by the Government should be as good as any other and at all times equal. And that is what the country wants. It wants whatever circulating medium we have. whether gold. silver. greenbacks. certificates. nationalbank notes. or what not. the best. As we have all these forms of currency. the policy of the Government ought to be. and muist be. if we treat the people right. that every dollar of whatever kind shall be as good as the best. Each of the two platforms recognized the importance of securing an international conference to adopt measures to insure a parity between the two metals. The special champions of the silverpurchase act say that act must not be repealed. because to repeal it would be the end of silver as a money metal in this country. O what value is the law now? The silver mines are closed. the smelters are reported to be shut down. while the silverpurchasing act still remains in force. Why? Because the product of the mines has become so cheap. notwithstanding the fact that the Government has been buying 4.500.000 ounces per month. that it does not pay to produce silver at its present price. In the face of this. while the mines are closed up. as reported. and the smelters are shut down. we are appealed to by the silver men to insist that the act of 1890 shall stay upon the statute book unless we are ready to give them free coinage. I want to say that free coinage will not be given to them. if I am any judge of the public sentiment of this country. until some arrangement is made by which. when we authorize the issuance of silver dollars. they will be as good as gold dollars or any other dollars in the world. If the Government continues the purchase of silver bullion under the law it will be mainly foreign silver instead of our own. Mr. President. the interests of the people require a sound. stable currency. We can not afford to experiment in the adoption of doubtful policies. We want no fiat money. We want a dollar which is intrinsically worth 100 cents the world over. I wish to say that there seems to be a growing disposition on the part of everybody apparently to find out some new financial scheme which he can thrust upon the country and disturb the business of the country. because that is the effect when such theories are thrown upon the country and have any particular following. We want a system of finance which will not involve the Treasury Department in constant danger. We want to rid ourselves of the idea that all that is negessaryto make money for the people is to print a promise to pay and put the Government stamp upon it. We want to secure to the country a sound currency and out it beyond danger of becoming debased. We will thus be serving the Government faithfully. and we will equally well serve the business men. the toilers. and all classes of our people. Mr. President. the business men of all classes appeal to us to pass the bill for the repeal of the silver act of 1890. Multitudes of laborers axe pleading for work. If there is anything we as legislators can do. consistent with national honor and linancial safety. to lift the clouds that darken the situation. remove the difficulties and start the wheels of commerce which are now rusting on the railroad tracks. in the shops. mills. factories. and mines. let us do it at once."},{"1":"5.200334e+08","2":"1892","3":"S","4":"STEWART","5":"1299","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I formed the acquaintance of George Hearst about forty years ago in Nevada County. Cal. He was then a prospector for mines and a miner. He followed that pursuit until the end bf his days. At the time of his death he was largely engaged in extensive mining operations. He was one of the best specimens of that vast army of goldhunters collected from the most enterprising young men of every city. town. and hamlet in the United States who laid the foundation for eight sovereign States and three Territories. He joined in the excitement of the explorations throughout that vast mining region from the City of Mexico to Alaska and from the Pacific Slope to the plains of the Missouri. He endured all the privations of the minerhard labor. coarse fare. fatiguing journeys over mountains and desertsfor twofifths of a century. He had the true instinct of a miner. The discovery and development of mines was a passion with him which led him to overcome what to others were insurmountable obstacles. In his investigation of mines he became one of the best geologists. for practical mining purposes. that this country has produced. His observations were so critical and his expbrience so extensive thqt in the last ten or fifteen years of his life he seemed to know at a glance whether geological formations were suitable for mines of the precious metals. When it is understood that hundreds of thousands of the best and brightest men the world has produced were engaged in the same business of exploring and developing mines and that not one in a hundred were successful. it must be conceded that a man whose judgment with regard to mines was surpassed by none and equaled by few. must have had great natural capacity and the will and perseverance to dare and do beyond what is allotted to ordinary men. George Hearst was no ordinary man. I knew him in prosperity and in adversity. He was the same simple. genial. cheerful. delightful companion under all circumstances. He made many fortunes during the long years of his miner life. The last fortune which he acquired. and it was large. he left to his family. With all the hardships and privations which he endured he by no means led an unhappy life. He enjoyed his occupation. was always buoyant. hopeful. and full of courage. He inspired all who came in contact with him with new hope and ambition. Adverse fortune did not sour his genial nature or make him think ill of his fellowmen. on the contrary. he was charitable to all. and in return was universally esteemed. loved. and respected by all who knew him. He made no distinction of person between honest people. but made all classes feel that he was a friend and wellwisher. His strong common sense inspired confidence and made him a leader of public opinion and of men. He also had a vein of humor which amused and faheinated the learned as well as the illiterate. He was at home in the company of men of all conditions. whether laborers delving in the bowels of the earth or millionaires enjoying the luxuries of wealth. He was a good judge of character. and readily distinguished the true from the counterfeit. His name is a household word throughout all the Paaific States and Territories. He was welcome everywhere. because he brought enterprise. thrift. and prosperity with him. There was no hamlet between the plains of the Missouri and the Pacific Ocean which did not welcome him. All were glad when he came and sorry when he left. because he always had something good to do or say. As a Senator he was not given to speechmaking. but in consultation his advice was valuable. There was no question affecting the general good upon which he could not throw some light when necessity required. He was particularly well versed in the resources and needs of the Pacific States and Territories. and whenever the interest of his constituents was involved it was certain that his voice and vote would be on the right side. He was a modest man. never obtruding his views. At first his character was not well understood by Senators. but gradually. as they came in contact with him. his sterling qualities inspired respect. His genial nature. generous and responsive heart made him many fast friends among his colleagues in this body. The same qualities of head and heart and originality of character. which made him a favorite in Washington. had interested and amused his comrades about the campfires of miners from the tropics to the frozen zone. No expedition in the mountains and deserts of the West. however hazardous or difficult. was looked upon with dread or misgiving when it was known that George Hearst was to be one of the party. His presence on such occasions not only promised success. but insured good companionship and good cheer. which banished all fear of discomfort or fatigue. The simple facts of his life. if written. would be a history stranger than romance. He was one of the 250.000 young men who left their homes in the East to seek their fortunes in the great gold discoveries of California. Such an opportunity can not again occur. such an emigration can never be repeated. The sons of farmers. mechanics. merchants. bankers. lawyers. and statesmen. from all the States of the Union. rallied in a grand army of goldhunters and rushed to the modern Ophir of California. a land not only rich in gold but of genial skies. balmy and salubrious climate. lofty mountains. fertile valleys. magnificent rivers. all presenting a new world for adventure and enterprise. The restraints of society were removed. The influence of family and tradition was unknown. Each man was estimated on account of his own individual worth. His character was weighed. hs standard was fixed by the impartial judgment of men without prejudice or preconceived opinions. A man who passed through that ordeal. who lived in those times. and maintained through an entire generation the love and respect of such a community. could not be a sham. but must of necessity be a sturdy. selfreliant. strong. and vigorous character. Such was George Hearst. His life was not only one of toil. excitement. and adventure. but it was most useful. He inaugurated and carried into successful execution vast mining enterprises. which gave employment to thousands of men and contributed largely in the production of both gold and silver. It was such men as George Hearst who converted the vast region between the plains of the Missouri and the Pacific Ocean from what was supposed to be an uninhabitable desert into prosperous and growing States. It was by the efforts of such men as George Hearst in the development of the hidden resources of the mountains of the West that the financial prosperty of the United States was secured and maintained. He led a useful and honorable life. In his death his constituents and the country suffered a great loss. But his works will live after him. The enterprises which he inaugurated. the good which he accomplished. will not be ephemeral. because by his efforts he contributed to that permanent and growing prosperity which makes the country he loved so well so conspicuous and prosperous a portion of the Union. His estimable wife and brilliant son. who mourn his loss. have the consolat.on of knowing that the husband and father who has gone was a brave. selfsacrificing. and useful citizen. that his memory is cherished and revered by thousands of comrades who knew and loved him in life and mourn with them his loss. and that he lived a useful and honorable life and left a name of which they may justly be proud."},{"1":"5.102082e+08","2":"1891","3":"H","4":"PEEL","5":"469","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"As far as practicable it confines it to Indian labor. d Mr. DORSEY. Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the last two words. I am surprised at my friend from Kansas . Ho is a e Western manand I supposed he understood something about the Western Indians. Now he asks that we send the beef to the Indians on the t hoof. That system was tried years ago. and fortunately it has betn stopped by the late Commissioner of Indian Affairs. on complaint made by officers of the Army. When the beef was issued to the Indians on foot. the Indians on the reservation gathered at the slaughterhoue and had a big buffalo hunt. Twelve or fifteen hundred wild Texas steers were in the corral. and would be run down the chute one at a time. Ten or fifteen Indians who were entitled to the issue of one steer were pub at the mouth of the chute. armed with their Winchester. The - steer was beaten on the back as he went down the chute. and as he sprang out onto the prairie the Indians started after him. They would chase him perhaps a hundred yards. when one of the Indians vould f fire his Winchester. and a horn would drop. Then another Indian brave would fire at the other horn and that would drop off. and after chasing the poor animal for half an hour perhaps they would end his misery by killing him. Then they would have a great powwow. as though they had shot a buffalo. The squaws would gather around that steer. strip him of his hide. gather up everything. and take it to camp. The issue lasted usually two days. During that time ten or twelvehundred steers would be turned over to the Ogalalla Sioux and other Sioux at the Pine Ridge and Rosebud agencies. We stopped that. and now we propose to continue what we are doing. that is. to issno the beef to the Indians slaughtered. We kill the steer and turn it over to * the Indians. and this amendment is in the right direction. Itisrecommended by the Indian agent. by the Indian Commissioner. by General Miles. that on these great reservations. where these people have to come 60 or 80 miles to get their beef. the slaughterhouses should be nearer their places of residence. and I am in favor of the amendment. M. MANSUR. Mr. Chairman. the gentleman from Nebraska has stated better than I could what I intended to state if he had not.

Under these circumstances the country will doubtless feel that Congress might profitably have addressed itself to the consideration of other and more important measures. and allowed the silver question to remain quiescent. This. however. has not been done. but instead it has been insisted that the proposition to open our mints to free coinage should be discussed at great length. to the neglect of matters of vastly more consequence. both to the moral and material interests of the nation. When the silvertongued orator from the argentiferous fields of Colorado made his exhaustive appeal to the House a few weeks ago in behalf of silver I sincerely hoped that the extreme bimetallists would be content to rest their case. but since then the talk has flowed with such unceasing and resistless force as to illustrate anew the maxim that while speech is silver silence is golden. Almost every day this Chamber has resounded with the fiery eloquence of the silver advocates. until one could not help recalling the words of the poet laureate: I chatter. chatter as I flow To join the brimming river. For men may come and men may go. But I go on forever. Until this House. after giving up to the advocates of silver much precious time that might have been better spent. deliberately voted to waste six days more in the discussion of this question. I had neither desire nor intention of participating in the debate. But as the advocates of unlimited silver coinage have throwndown the gauntlet it becomes the duty of those holding different views to give expression to their convictions. We seem to have all kinds of statesmen and almost every possible variety of financiers in this discussion. One man tells us that unless silver is as free as the air dire disaster is sure to overtake the country. while another argues that unless gold alone is used as coin the darkest possible days of business depression and financial ruin are inevitable. To sustain these differing views ancient and modern history have been put under tribute. the pages of mythology have been ransacked. Scripture has been quoted. poetry has contributed her quota. and rhetoric and grammar alike have been violently dealt with. Now. amid this deluge of words. this exuberance of meaningless 3090: rhetoric and gorgeous imagery. is there not some middle ground on which to stand? Every intelligent man in this House. not blinded by prejudice or controlled by local political considerations. knows that the prosperity of the country is not dependent upon the continued monthly coinage of two million silver dollars. much less upon the unlimited production of this kind of money. while on the other hand very few. if any. will deny that silver. as well as gold. has its uses as a oirculating medium. that to an extent. and under certain conditions. it is just as good money. and that any attempt to drive it out of circulation is neither wise. politic. nor possible. Personally I have no objection to silver except on the score of its inconvenience and the inevitable harm that will come from an oversupply of it. Gold is the worlds money. it is better money than silver because of this fact. But for subsidiary purposes silver is a necessity. and while we are all willing to accept it we do not want any more of it than we are absolutely compelled to take. I remember reading that when silver was denounced as poor money. in a former debate in Congress. an earnest advocate of silver coinage quickly retorted. If the gentleman does not want to take silver I am willing to accept his salary in that coin. I I whereupon there was a hearty laugh at the expense of the advocate of gold. It would be interesting to have this very thing happento have Congress paid off for one month in those huge silver orbs. apparently made to immortalize the raving beauty whose face adorns the cointhose legalized frauds and lies which pretend to be 100 cents when in reality they are only 79 cents. What an instructive study it would be to watch the faces of the members as they pocketed. or. more properly speaking. basketed their monthly allowance! What a broad smile would overspread the features of my distinguished friend from Iowa as. bending beneath the load of precious coin. he foresaw visions of silver fiatism equally as grand and triumphal as any that wrought upon his fancy in the days when he was the Presidential candidate of the men who then were crazy on the subject of greenbackism and fiat paper money! What a mellifluous smile would light up the benevolent countenance of the able gentleman from Colorado [Mr. SymES] as he saw. in this distribution of his pet coin. fresh encouragement to the mines of his State to do their best to supply the inexorable demands of impecunious Congressmen! How the genial gentleman from Missouri would rub his hands in glee and chuckle over this practical triumph of his profound financial wisdom! And the gentleman from Ohio . who had a little session of his own in Washington before the assembling of Congress. which was heralded abroad as a mission fraught with momentous consequences to the country. but who failed to convert President Cleveland to his way of thinking on the silver question. would doubtless be content if that high official (with a salary as large as ten Democratic Congressmen. each one of whom is sure that he would make a better President than the present incumbent) were compelled to take his monthly stipend in the same weighty coin. while the eloquent gentleman from Texas . who fairly staggered under the load of his mixed metaphors and classic quotations. Would find this a greater burden even than the one he then carried! Just imagine that solenin procession of the nations statesmen and lawgivers. and then have some degree of sympathy for the average American citizen who today is compelled to carry around a pocketful of this coin. and who is prohibited from enjoying the personal convenience and business advantage of one and two dollar bills because of the desire and demand to put an unnatural and unnecessary amount of this inconvenient and depreciated money into general circulation. Now. Mr. Speaker. it is seriously argued that the country needs more money. Is that really so? Men talkof cheap money. Congressmen in lengthy speechestell their constituents in effect. if not in words. that they are in debt. that their farms are mortgaged. that there is an abundance of silver in the mines of California. Colorado. and Nevada. and that the Government can and ought to make money out of that silver. distribute it among the people. and thereby better their condition. Doubtless some simpleminded people believe this talk. just as they believed the greenback heresies of a few years ago. But such persons should be reminded that a dollar (even a clipped silver dollar) can only be had in exchange for its equivalent in wheat. or cotton. or corn. or labor. or some other marketable commodity. It is true the Government can make dollars. or something that is called dollars. but no device has yet been discovered that will enable the Government safely to put those dollars into circulation except in accordance with the inexorable laws of trade. And just here is the fallacy of the talk about cheap money. What is cheap money about which the gentleman from Texas talked so earnestly and eloquently? The history of the world shows that socalled cheap money has in reality always been dear money. The financial schemes of George Law were based on the idea of cheap money. but his schemes came to naught. as all such schemes have. carrying disaster and suffering in their train. It is well to remember that things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour. and the history of the disasters that have invariably followed an inflated and depreciated currency have painfully illustrated the truthfulness of Shakspeares suggestion that When sorrows come. they come not single spies. But in battalions. We had in this country cheap money in 1868. In that year the national Republican convention declared that the best way to diminish the burden of the public debt. and thereby lift the burdens of taxation from the shoulders of the people. was to improve our credit so that money could be borrowed at a lower rate of interest. This was at a time when the Democratic party was even farther away from the sound financial principles that characterize the fiscal policy of President Cleveland than they are today. The Republican party was right. as the mighty financial events of the intervening period abundantly prove. Then the Government was paying $130.000.000 per annum interest on $2.169.000.000 of debt. whereas we are now paying $51.000.000 of -interest on $1.260.000.000 of debt. The principal of the debt has been reduced 414 per cent.. while the interest charge has been reduced 60 per eent. This grand achievement was the direct result of improving the public credit. and yet intelligent men. some of them Republicans. gravely propose to again depreciate the currency through the instrumentality of unlimited silver coinage. and thus renew the distress that the wisdom of the great Republican party lifted from the shoulders of the people by the grandest display of financial wisdom that the world has ever beheld. It must not be done. In this discussion the advocates of unlimited silver coinage have laid great stress upon the point that free coinage would necessarily benefit the laboring classes. while all history teaches the exact opposite. No better illustration of this can be found than in a very instructive address upon the money question. recently delivered by Mr. Joseph H. Walker. of Worcester. Mass.. before the Massachusetts Club of Boston. Mr. Walker is a practical man who has given great attention to the subject. and he produced a most interesting and instructive collection of facts showing the purchasing power of mens wages and farmers products in times of cheap money as compared with times when everything is upon a gold basis. his object being to illustrate the importance to workingmen of having the dollar of the country in which they are paid worth a hundred cents in gold. or. in other words. that a depreciation of the currency is always an injury to the laboring classes because. while inflation or cheap money increases their nominal wages. it increases the price of what they have to buy much more rapidly. For this purpose Mr. Walker takes the period from 1860 to 1885. during which this country tested the effects of inflation. its currency growing cheaper and cheaper until it took nearly three dollars of it to buy a go] d dollar. and then appreciating until it xeached a solid basis. As Mr. Walker says: The experiment of depreciating the currency was never tried in any country under circumstances more favorable to the wageworker than here. A war was in progress during four years of the time of such vast proportions that theconsumption of the aggregate products of labor was increased by fully onetenth. besides which more than onetenth of the men who competed with each other in the labor marketwere employed in military operations. which was the equivalent of increasing the market for the laborer by onefourth. Under these apparently favorable conditions for the wageworker the value of his wages to Jim ought to have materially increased instead of depreciating. if it is possible for him ever to save himself from loss in periods of a debased currency. But what were the facts? In 1860 a dyer in a woolen factory received 67 cents a day. and with this he could buy in a year the following necessaries which Mr. Walker assumes would keep a family of four persons just above the freezing and starving point: Articles. tity.

I shall not advocate the passage of abill to enconrage Americans to own ships merely als a matter of sentUneut. Witli may experience animd coining from theportion of the Union that I do. with the history Of ly St ate in my remembrance. I kcel tlint there is an infleece in the ownership of ships traversing the ocean and a sailors life which elevates aud makes more independent the charater of the citizens nf mny coutry. itwas one of the occupations of the most importance in the oldest Sttes ofthis Union. Before the 4Geverament of this country was established there was a little county in the State of Massachusetts. the county of Old Essex. which owned a larger amount of tonnage of ships than was owned in England in the reignof Queen Elizabeth when she successfully repelled withl her fleets the Spanish armada. From the earliest time. if we study history. we find that patriotisiti and heroism have always been found in the nien who traversed the %ast waters of the ocean. It seems to me. Mr. peaker. that the men of the pastvho spent their lives upon the sea were like the men who lived upon the mountains. and of whom it. has been said that they breathed into their souls with the pare and invigorating air the love of liberty and the rights of man. Certainly if wc follow the history of tiat contit y of Essex in Massachusetts. amd trace tIe lives of the men who spent their days upon time sea. we shall find. in fle history of the Revolutionary War. greater sacrifices in some instances than can he found perhaps in any other part of the United States. In this same county of Essex. iii tlne little town of Marblehead. where theyliadonly 1.2)00 voters. an entire regiment wassemit into the lexolttionary War. And while in 1 172 they had 1.203 voters. in 1780 that had been reduced to 544. and at tieclose of the levolutionary War there were in tle limits of that little patrio) ie seatiiring tow no less than 158 widows and 9Aw fatherless ihildren. I believe. sir. that the example of that patriotic town inspired others in the great struggle. I am proud ofthepast hisloiy oftthe ITnited States Navy and time mierchant marine. of the men who planued the voyages fbr American ships into remote and distant seas and developed the commerce of te world. and of the brave and hardy seamen who commanded and nammed the ships. and I believe it is possible in time to recover some of time commerce on the ocean that we ha ve lost. or that sails under other flags than ours. But. Mi. Speaker. not as a matter of senlmient but purely ts a qiestion of commercial importance do I approach the subject presented for our consideration today. I advocate in a general way the passage of th. bill reported by tile u. iority of the committee. I believe that. every section of it is of tIme trst imnportance if we expec to do aiiytiimg to relieve the earrying tade of this countiy. IYoh. not believe that we canomit at single .ection antI aceomplisli any practical result.. though we may improve by .amendments the practical working of tle law. And here. Mr. Speaker. I part from te majority of the comnittee ant would goa little tirtlier in my recommendations.. I shall at the proper time offer an amendment to the nInority report. and recommend that with the bill that gives the relief under all of it. sections for the general conduct of voyages. the improvement of seame.. reduction of charges. and the sailing of shipsthe bill that gives a bounty in the eighteenth section mustalso modifvand break some ofthtt fetters of the navigation laws of the United States. We must do something to thvor shipbuilding. We must do somethingto encourage antI fivor hipowning. It is ofuecessitythatyou shouldrecognize the conditions smroundiug the subjec t over the world if you propose to haveany pacticallegislation. or we inight its well abandon the attempt to restore our foreign carrying trade. The subject to my mind presents really but two real and vital que( tions fitrconsidemation. Thefirstis. is itof importancethatthe Americml nation. should own ships in the foreign carmyinug tra tle of the world If there are amy gentlemen who doubt tIat. they have a legiliate proposition to argue upon. For myselt I hav no doubt upon the question. I believe. as I have illustrated alrealy. that the sailing of ships upon the ocean is of advantage to the character and to the civilization of the people engaged ill it. I believe too that that nation only can fbllowout all of the avenues fbr increased commerce. and for its commercial development. that sends its ships abroad to the diffrentparts of theworld tinder its own flag at the main. with its own capital engaged in the enterprise. and its own citizens in command. I believe that commerce springs from the smallest beginnings. I can not tell when or how this man or that merchant originated his business. It is often from a very trifling circumstance. But I do know that the mere sending of an American ship manned by our own citizens to a foreign countxy brings often in return suggestions that come in different forms for new business to be fbstered and developed by the enterprise and the business skill of our people. You can not omit owning the ships in this vast country if you wish closer and more intimate relations with other countries all over the world. You can not pass all that carrying trade over to the Englishman or to the German and do justice to the growth and to the development not only of foreign commerce but to the domestic business concerns of the American people. And now I go further. This is not a question that concerns shipbuilders and shipowners solely. It concerns the people of every State. It is of the first importance that we should reduce the cost of transportation of our products to the lowest possible limit. and what do we trnaport across the ocean? We transport our grain. our provisions. our cotton. our manufactured goodsproduced everywhere. from the golden shores of the Pacific to the Atlantic seaboard. We bring back from the countries we visit tea. coffee. iron. and all the metals. We bring back all of the things that enter into the business enterprise of this country. We bring back the prime necessities of life to every household and to every community throughout the land. To do that ini the best way we must have ships owned by Americans. To do that hi the best way we must provoke and promote all the rivalries and competitions in shipbuilding that can possibly be afforded. and I am patriotic enough to believe that when you leave out of the contest the ingenuity and enterprise of American citizens you retard the growth and the development of shipbuilding and commerce all over the world. Today with 15 per cent. only of the great foreign carrying trade of the world firom our countrywe are leaving to England and to Germany the develop.ent and the exercise of their talent and ingenuity. and the genius of our people in this particular is slumbering. It is not speaking with too much national pride for me to say that I believed. when it was suggested perhaps very indifferently to our committec. that if Americans had been concerned in the shipowning interests of the world as Englishmen are we should not have had a single Great Eastern. We should have had a dozen steamships like the Great Eastern. and I do not know what propelling power we might have had or what propelling power there is that is better than steam. But I do believe that there would have been an advance in that direction. and that the American people would have contributed something to the world which would have tended to reduce the cost of the tmasportation of the necessaries of lifb across the ocean. I stand upon and affirm the general proposition that it is a commercial necessity that we should own and sail American ships. that it is of great importanee. and that we can not leave it with indifference to other nations of the world to own and transport 85 per cent. of the tonnage of our foreign trade. I shall not. Mr. Speaker. dwell upon the different sections of this bill. The necessity of them is almost stated in the reading of the provisions themselves. They refer to the subject of advance wages. to the reducing the fees of consuls. three months wages on discharge. extra pay. &.-the burdens in fact which our shipowners have had to bear and other nations have removed. and the necessity for removing which any one who runs and reads may understand. I shall not take the time of this House to dwell upon them. I believe you will agree with me that all but the eighteenth section. and perhaps that to which the gentleman from Maryland referred as to taxation. are not only a necessity. but it is a matter of justice on our part. There is one section. however. I have heard questioned. and that is in regard to advance wages. I will simply say that will not only relieve the owners of ships from burdens from which they ought to be relieved. but as a question of philanthropy and humanity it has been strongly urged for forty years. The only wonder is the evil has not been stopped before. I have. in the Committee on Commerce. a petition signed by 10.000 of the first merchants and citizens of this country. representing every city. I have the representations of thousands of clergymen. and the representations of all the seamens Bethels to the same tfect. I hold in my hand an article from the Sailors Magazineall to one purpose. I think that the section in regard to advance wages should and will be adopted without debate. The eighteenth section is one which proposes startling changes. It proposes in substance to give a bountyand. gentlemen. we might as well call things by their right namesin order to build ships. Why do we propose to give a bounty? Simply because in no other way mn we compete with other nations of the world. I know there has been an inclination not only on that side of the House but on this side to talk of triiti in connection with this subject. and when a man stands here iu his p ace and in coanection with this subject says anything about free ships the cry of wolf ! Icomes up and he is denounced as an immediate freetrader. without any justification whatever. There is no legtimate connection between this taking off of bounties or changing the navigation laws to admit someships free into thiscountryno legitimate cannection between that and free trade. You cannot properly consider the subject of meeting the rivalriesof the world upon the ocean without realizing that there is no comparison between ships that sail upon the ocean and ships thttsail coastwise. You can control the sailing from Boston to Philadelphia. and from Philadelphia to New Orleans. you can pass your laws to say what we shall do in the ports of Boston or Baltimore or Philadelphia. or in Chicago or the West. but when you send out your ships into the storm andthesunshine. fromone of your ports to cross the ocean. you are on the highway of the world. and have no protected or preempted rights over the pathless waters that your ship is to sail on. You have to meetEnglandon equal terms there. If you want practical legislation you must face the facts and adapt your legislation to meet them. When your ship is at the port of London or in Calcutta and its captain solicits cargo. because the American flag is at the main you have no other rightsthan the inexorable laws of commerce and trade give you. If the Englishman or the German takes his freight at onehalf dollir less there is nothing in the power of the American Congress that will take from the Englishman or the German hischarter. Our foreign commerce is governed by legitimate and imperative natural laws. and the only way to change the condition of things if disadvantageous to us is by equalizing the opportunities or advantages of placing your own citizens upon equal terms and like conditions with their competitors. -if it is in the power of Congress and wise and beneficial to the whole country to do it. This eighteenth section. MIr. Speaker. gives a bounty. and it seems a necessity. You might as well abandon the discussion. you might as well give up any idea of legislation as try to ignore the fact that we can not sail our ships ihe competition with foreign ones unless we have the same advantages as they have. It is impossible to do it. I do not know whether we can give all the favorable conditions the foreign shipowner enjoys. but as wise men let us give all we can and then take the consequences. But there is no justification for our continuing on year after year while our foreign commerce is thding away without lifting our hands or attempting any intelligent or effective legislation to stop it. In regard to that eighteenth section. it is not alone a necessity we should give a bounty in order that we may have ships built. It is a necessity we should give a bounty in order to have a certain kind of ships built. Today no nation can build up its foreign commerce in wooden ships. You have to own and sail iron and steel ships if you would compete with the -world. I wish to give you a statement of the actual difference between an iron and wooden ship. to show to this House why it is you can not sail a wooden ship by the side of an iron ship. for I think if that is forcibly and clearly put before your minds you will appreciate that the eighteenth section means not only a bounty. but a bounty to enable these people to meet the ships that do the business of the world. and that have driven out of the carrying trade our wooden vessels. I do not know but some of the friends of wooden ships may question my statement. nevertheless it is true. A prominent gentleman a very short time ago read a paper to the steel and iron institute in London. making a comparison which will very briefly show the advantages of iron ships. It is derived from the experience of British shippers who own these vessels. and is based upon their experience for a series of years. I will say here that it is strange that we should have year after yea seen our commerce fade away as it has done. that we should send to the different ports of the world our vessels and try to charter them there. and find threefourths of the vessels iron ships. taking the preference and securing the trade. and we have but one single iron sailing vessel under an American register today. Ndw this is what was said by Mr. Charles -1. Palmer. an eminent shipwright of the Tyne. in a paper lately read before the British iron and steel institutue on the relative value of iron and wooden shipping. Basing his calculations upon the experiences of British shippers for a series of years. he shows that for commercial purposesAn iron ship of one and onequarter inch thickness of skin is equal toawoden ship of six inches thick without joints. if such a thing were possible. This estimate is made on the wellestablished rules of comparative tensile strength of materials. In the matter of weight the disproportion between iron and wood tonnage is much greater than is commonly supposed. An iron vessel of 1.00 tons will weigh 85 per cent. less than awooden vessel of thesame measurement. the displacement of water being the same. but the iron ship has a further advantage in having more space for cargo and finer lines. An iron ship Is not likely to strain in a heavy sea. whereas the straining of wooden ships often destroys or damages valuable cargoes. The use of iron masts. steel yards. and wire rigging- effects a large saving in weight aloft. affords opportunities for the applieation of improved laborsaving apparatus. economizing in the runiing expenses. Bly carefully prepared statis. tics. lie claimed that an iron vessel ef 1.000 tons. taking first cost. repairs management and all other elements into consideration. will carry merchandise .5 per cent. cheaper than a wooden ship of the same capacity and last with fair usage from onethird to onehalf longer. It is for these reasons. well understood by shippers. that iron isfast superseding wooden tonnage in the comercial marine of the world. and our nation if it would compete for the foreign carrying trade with nations that now monopolize and control. it must do so with iron or steel ships. and not with wooden. Ironship buLding has as yet made but little progress in this country. nor cia 981) it he epected that this industry. requiring large capital. costly machinery. and highly skilled labor in all its branches. will develop as rapidly as those engeged in it have claimed. The causes which chiefly operate against ironship building in this country are high wages and the costly processes of iron manufacture. Even were the duties npon imanufactured iron practically abolished. and all these obstacles removed. many years must elapse before we can supply the demands of our shippers at hone. As I have said. if our nation wishes to compete with other nations we must meet this fact which has driven us from the ocean. In no other way can we possibly meet it today excepting by such a section of the bill as this to which I have referred. I know it is discussed on the other side here as a tariff proposition. and gentlemen make arguments in fhvor of reducing taxationand making an adjustment of the tariff as the true means to secure cheaply built ships and to restore our commerce. It does not seem to me a practical and commonsense way of arguing the question. There is no man within the sound of my voice who believes that we can make any tariff legislation and change the protective policy of this country so as to affect shipowning or shipbuilding in the foreign trade. within a period in which we shall have much to do with it. It can be done practically only by meeting the facts of the case as they are. by recognizing that in England they build ships cheaper than we can db it. and that they build them ofiron and steel. which we must do. We must in some form adopt the eighteenth section. or drop the whole subject. I propose to offer an amendment to the clause for free ships which has been offered by the minority of the committee. As I said a few moments ago. I know that when I take the position that you can not develop the fbreign carrying trade of this country without first giving a bounty to the shipbuilder and then encouraging the shipowner by giving him access to the markets of the world. to a certain extent. it is taking extreme grounds. when I couple these two propositions together I do it in the finn belief that in no other way can you improve your carrying trade. One reason why you can not improve it in any other way is because. without you give a merchant an opportunity to buy his ships in the cheapest market. you do not give him an opportunity to meet his competitors in the markets of the world. I believe that professional men. men who have had no experience in the business of buying and selling and owning ships. will appreiato that today in the methods of business an opportunity for quick exchange is one of the most essential elements that enter into prosperity. If you take from the merchant the opportunity of entering into the markets of the world where his competitors are. to buy his ships at the lowest prices lie can. and the kind of vessel he wants to buy. and sell in great markets of the world for ships when lie desires. you take front him an element of success the loss of which it is difficult for him to contend with. And another important reason why we should give that assistance to the shipowner is this: We have lost our carrying trade. commerce is something that a man can not take hold of unless lie does so prudently. le can not because he wishes to increase the tomage tnder the American flag buy a ship and sail it. The inexorable law of success or disaster obliges him to consider whether he can makemoney out of it. He may not think it prudlent to go to a shipbuilder in New Jersey and contract for a ship that may be -finished in four months or six months. costing him one hundred. two hundred. or three hundred thousand dollars. He may perhaps need to purchase a ship for a certain trade tomorrow. He may prefer a ship ten years old because he can buy it cheaper and it may be better adapted to a certain trade. Because of wars or disasters or something of that kind ships can be bought unusually cheap in England. He must avail himself of the opportunity. A merchant requires all these inducements to encourage him to enter into the business of the lbreign carrying trade as it is today. and if you deprive him of one single item in this count he isatadisadvantage with the foreigner. One reason why it is of more importance now than formerly is that the methods of business bave changed entirely. Fifty years ago our grandfathers in the great cities prepared their voyages after careful consideration. When they sent their ships out to the northwest coast or te Indies. perhaps. they knew they would have no tidings of them until they brought the inforuation themselves. After a years voyage they piled the cargoes into storehouses and they were a year selling them. They were great merchants and broad men. Today the grandsons of those men send a telegram from Boston to Calcutta ordering a ship to be chartered and naming the price to be paid for a cargo. tomorrow they have their answer that the ship has been chartered and the cargo bought. The next day they are glad to sell that cargo for an advance of 2 per cent. By reason of the introduction of steam and telegraphic communication our whole system of business is entirely changed. Business is now a matter of very small profit or margin of commission. The old Calcutta merchants of Boston are now superseded in a great deal of their business by lbreign houses that have opened establishments on our shores. Some of my colleagues will doubtless remember that one establishment in New Yorka Greek house with branches in Calcutta. China. London. and New York. is doing more business than any twenty of our houses put together. If an establishment of this kind can ship goods to an American port and save their bankers commission. they will do the business for that. With such a class of foreign business as that. you can not restore your carrying trade unless you meet allthese conditions. If you are not willing to do this your carrying trade will linger on in its present condition. I do not mean to say that this measure will not benefit the shipbuilders. I think it will. In view of the statement of the gentleman who preceded me in reference to the tonnage tax. and his estimate that a ship costing $1.000.000 would take from the Treasury a bounty of $300.000. or thereabout. I ask you how far will your million and a halfofdollars of tonnage tax go toward building ships in this country? What would be even $10.000.000 expended in that direction ? Why. Mr. Speaker. it seems to me when I hear somne gentlemen talk of increasing the carrying trade that a thousand years are as a day to them. for. with the shipyards we have. the simple advantige of promoting building in those shipyards would make no perceptible change in the carrying trade. These shipyards might build ships. but you want to encourage shipowning as well as shipbuilding. The ships they would build would in my judgnent be Very few in number. I will now read my amendment and give my reasons for offering it as a substitute for the amendment of the gnutleman from New York [Mr. Cox] in regard tofree ships."},{"1":"4.700379e+08","2":"1882","3":"H","4":"TAYLOR","5":"678","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"But.

I ardently desire the prosperity of my country. I wish it to endure. and I know that to be permanent it must rest upon a sound basis. and I know that a sound currency is essential4. and that real money is the only basis of a sound currency. I have said that I desire to effect a real resumption of specie payments. for I do not believe what is at present called resumption. is real or reliable. because. although since January 1st. 1879. United States notes are redeemable in coin at the office of the assistant treasurer of the United States in New York City. yet. by the act of May 31. 1878. when any of said notes may be redeemed or be received into the Treasury of the United Slates. they shall not be retired canceled or destroyed. but they shall be reissued and paid out again and kept in circulation. so that while there is a resumption of payment in specie. it is neutralized in all its resumptive effects. by the immediate reissue of the notes just redeemed. To resume by such a delusive process is as idle as to bail water with a sieve. I am for actual resumption and a restoration of real money in place of any substitute therefor. unless such substitute is voluntarily agreed upon by the parties to any contract. Plainly then this resolution is intended to secure the resumption of a standard of valuebased upon valueand not upon mere credit. It is not intended to destroy the convenience and assistance of the present paper currencybut as that paper rests upon the credit. that it is convertible. into specie and will be paidso do I feel assured that by letting men feel a confidence that a stable standard is ultimately to measure all their contractsthey will uaturally feel safer to enter into contractsthi will give them assurance that the lapse of time will not bring with it alterations in the basis upon which their agreemeits were formed. This will encourage capital to embark upon enterprises which will give employment to the laboring classes. and will insuro to labor an honest equivalent for every hour of toil. Such I believe will be a part and a part only of the benefits to flow from the adoption of this resolution. Mr. President. I would pause here. and ask the consideration of the Senate to a confusion of terms. which I am sure has led to a great confusion in thought. in dealing with this subject. It is nnfortunate that notes should be called mnoney. as it tends to produce confusion and injustice. at best. notes are a promise. and until that promise is paid in money. it is unperformed. When power was given to Congress to borrow saoney on the credit of the United States. the words lad a definite meaning. Not to borrow evidences of debt. but to give their evidences of debt for money. The issue of the notes was a proof that the Government had no money. that they thought it nnadvisable to tax the people to obtain it. and therefore. the United States notes were merely instruments of the Government to obtain supplies to carry on the war. without paying for them. The very issue of these notes. was a confession that the Government had no neoney. To make them circulate in tho place of money. and enable the holders to get rid of them. they made them at first convertible into the interestbearing obligations of the Government. and created them a legal tender for all debts. public and private. And let it here be noted that making notes legal tender. does not oblige any man to sell his property for such notes. it only compels him to receive them for a debt then due. In other words. legal tender is a debt epaying power. but can never be made a debt contractinlg power. and no amount of tyrannical force in the history of the world has ever been able to accomplish this last. To define the difference between money and its substitute. I will accept the definition of Lord Liverpool. in his famous report upon the coins of the realm of Great Britain. The money or coin of a country is the standard measure. lby which the value of all things. bought and sold. is regulated and ascertained. an it is itself. at the same time. the value or equivalent. for which goods are exchanged. and in which contracts are generally made payable. Paper currency in all its forms. bills of exchange. promissory notes. bank bills. are all useful auxiliaries of money. but are evidences of debt. and not of wealth. and possess no inherent value. A thoughtful and sensible writer. Mr. Gouge. of Pennsylvaniaput the truth in the following form : Some fancy that it is the authority of the Government that gives money its value. But the true value of money. as measured by the amount of goods for which it win honestly exchange. cannot be affected hy the edicts of princes or acts of parliaments. Stonarhs and ministers may alter the weight of their coin. or lessen their purity. but they cannot make a coin containing half an ounce of pour silver worth as much as a coin containing ace entire ounce. The stamp of the State isa nere certificate of weight and fineness. When Congress was authorized Cito coin money. what would have been the use of all the nicety and precision expressed so carefully in all coinage laws. if it had been believed that Government could by its mint stamp. or by a statute. give what value it chose to its coined money? Of what use are all the statutes carefully regulating the tolerane and abrasion of the coin. if the inherent value of the precious metals which compose such coin had not been their only value. Mint stamps are only to inform men truly. upon the honor of a Government certificate. that each piece contains a certain weight of gold or silver of a certain purity. in order to save citizens the trouble of weighing the coins themselves. In all of this careful regulation. is there not recognition of the value of the metallic coins? Every piece of money represents the value of the labor which it cost to produce it. and the experience of mankind from the earliest ages has accorded value to gold and silver. and their use for conducting and facilitating the exchanges of mankind has been shown by the manufacture of coins since nearly one thousand years before the Christian era. and the civilized nations of the earth having now in reality but a single market. with rapid and easy intercourse the precious metals being small in bulk and weight. are easily anti quickly transferred. so that a very slight difference in value in the markets of the world suffices to call them wherever the demand arises for their employment. The Supreme Court of the United States have. in cases comparatively recent. given an authoritative definition to the idea I am trying to impress. In the case of Bronson Vs. Rhodes. 7 Wall.. 249. the ChiefJustice. Chase. delivering the opinion of the court. after reciting the various coinage acts. said: The design of all this minuteness and strictness in the regulation of coinage is easily seen. It indicates the intention of the Legislature to give a sue guarantee to the people that the coins made current in payment contain the precise weight of gold or silver of the precise degree of purity doclared by the statute. It recognizes the fact. accepted by all men throughout the world. that value is inherent ie the pirocious metasi. that gold and slver are in themselves values. and being such. nd being in other respects the only proper measures of values. that those values ar determined by weight cnd purity. and that form and impress are simply certificates of valse. worthy of absolute i:oliance only because of the lmown integrity. ad good faith of the goverement which gives them. These propositions are believed to be incontestable. The coined dollar was a piece of gold or silver of a prescribed purity and weighing a prescribed number of grains . the note dollar wao a pomise to pay a coined dollar. but it was not a promise to pay on demand or at any fixed time. nor was it in factconvertible lao a coined dollar. It was impossible in the nature of things that these two dollars should be the actuaZ eqivalent onF eaf h ether. The Government byits statutes recognized these differences. in the very act an. thoizing the  note dollar.  by nmking some things (duties and interestail payable in coin and others in these notes. And in Bank vs. Supervisors. 7 Wall.. 31: The dolair note is an engagement to pay a dollar. and the dollar intended is the coinid dolarof th Uiited States: a certain quantity in weight and finenessof gold or silver authenticated by lhe stamp of the overnment: no other dollars had beore been recognivod by leg.istltion as lawful mona. These. note.% ar. obtiatioss. they hind the national faith. Theyare strictly securities. they secure tio payaeent stipulated to the holders by the pledge of the nationalefilth. the onl. ulliesoto security of all national obligations. whatever form they may assume. 8 Wallace. p. 607. December. 18(9. Hepburn vs. Griswold. per Chase. C. J.. coin dollars--note dollars: Theformer possess intrinsio value. determined by the weight and fineness of the metal. The latter have no intrinsic value. but a purchasing value. determined by (1) the quantity in circulation. (2) by the general oeont to its currency in payments. (3) by opinfon as to the probability of redemption in coin. To illustrate the exactness and care attending the manufacture of our coins let me read from the Revised Statutes: Sue. 3535. In adjusting the weights of the gold coins. the following deviations shall not b exceeded in any single piece . In the double eagle and the eagle. onehalf of a grain. in the half eagle. the threedollar piece. the quarter eagle. and the onedollar piece. onefourth of a grain. And in weighing anumbor ef pieces together. when delivered by the coiner to the superintendent. and by the superintendent to the depositor. the deviation from the standard weight shall not exceed onehundredth of an ounce in f5.els in double eaglee. eagles. half eagles or quarter eagles. in one thousand threedollar pieces. and in one thousand onedollar pieces. The value of any commodity can only be suteered by money. it does not de/ermine the value. but it expresses it when it has been agreed upon. and measures it. The first step in the increase of wealth is the organization. the combination. and division of labor. In this organization we find the steps of accumulation. and accumulation of the results of labor forms capital. Every product of labor hs a purchasing power. an actual value. exchangeable by its possessor for other values. Capital is thus the savings of labor. the result of its surplhs production. and therefore capital is the seed of wealth. Capital is the child of labor and born of its exertions. By the very law of its birth and origin. capital cannot be useful without the employment of labor. so that the laborer must share the advantages of capital. Increase of capital brings with it increased demand for labor. and. despite the false teachings of demagogues. capital and labor. having a common origin. are natural allies. and not enemies. For all the varied productions of human industry. a machinery and measure of exchange is requisite. A universal medium of exchange is necessary.-not of weight. or length. or height alone.-but of value. because. at the bottom of all human dealings. for the sake of security. honesty and justice must be found. As human labor alone creates value. so the results of human labor should alone be justly exchangeable for value. JALTuAPtY 27. In no civilized country can all the exchanges of property be carried on by the agency of coin alone. Paper notes are an essential auxiliary to coin. but never let it be forgotten. they are not coinare not moneybut are substitutes for it. They are not actual payments. but promises to pay.-evidenes of debt which tim law will enforce.-aud do not give value for value. and their acceptance must be based on their credit. on their convenience. and be always voluntary in order to be safe. When a paper note. an evidence of debt. is made a eompulsory tender in payment of a debt.-the great law of honesty.-the great laie of moneythat value is to be given for value. is broken and disregarded. Mr. President. we have heard in this Chamber allusions somewhat vague. but none the less alarming. to an unseen. undefined. but terrible. money power. What is meant by these ominous warnings against this invisible. intangible. immeasurable power? What is meant is. I suppose. the power of capital. How shall the law deal with it ? Capital is the result of labor and frugality. it is by the virtues of thrift. economy. and selfdenial. working under the instruction of intelligence and enlightened selfinterest. that capital is first created and then accumulated. Wealth and property of all descriptions are but forms of capital. Encouragement is given by the institutious of property. by the creation of government. by the enactment of laws. to induce men to exercise their faculties to gain wealth. Is all this founded upon fallacy and wrong? Is there to be discrimination. suspicion and assault visited upon those individuals of society who have been more successlul than others in the accumulation of property ? Is it not money power that enables a poor laborer to become the owner of the pickax or shovel. with which he prosecutes his daily task ? Is it not money power that enables him to procure a wheelharrow? Is it not  money power that enables his savings of a years labor. temperance. and frugality. to give him the means to purchase a horse and cart? Is it not money power that enables him to edncate his children and fit them for an improved condition in life? Is it not the same money power that crowns his life of honesty. sobriety. and industry. with an old age of comfort and respectability ? Such. sir. are the humble. but honorable and useful. careers that America offers to the poor of all lands. and. of all institutions to secure such results. a money having real value is the chief. because it is the trite and only road by which the laborer honestly becomes the capitalist. Mr. President. there are few assemblages of men to whom I could appeal with more conlidence to bear out the truth of my present utterances. than to my honored associates in this Chamber. so many of whom have illustrated in their own careers. the advantages and true glory of American republican institutions. I do not shut my eyes. Mr. President. to the fact. that tle equal and wholesome distribution of property. which it was hoped by the founders of our Government would be attained by the abolition of the rules of primogeniture. of entailments. of perpetuities. and the division of intestate estates among daughters and eons alike. has been greatly defeated. And Iam inclined to believe the system of incorporatiou which we have introduced into all branches of industrial pursuits will be found nearly equal to the effects of primogeniture and mortmain combined in its influence upon the aggregation of wealth into a single and neverdying grasp. But the millionaires of today. now to be counted by scores. where twenty years ago they were to be counted by unitswere twenty years ago penniless boys. and I cannot comprehend in this vague denunciation of their money power at what point of their accumulations condemnation and proscription are to commence. or should their riches take wings as they havein so many conspicuous instances. whether pardon will then await them in their poverty for their former pecuniary success. To no one thing. however. do I attribute this unequal division of property in this country so much as to the resort by the Government to the use of inconvertible legaltender paper money. and I believe with Thomas Jefferson thatThe abuses of paper money are inveterateby breaking up the oeasure of value that it inakes a lottery of all privat property cannot be denied. It is from such results that coitmunism is the outgrowth. and to the distress caused by unwise financial management I attribute the do ngerous projects. fallacious schemes. and attempts to array the force of numbers against property. which we witness all over the country. and which afford such oppwtunities for demagogues to ply their arts and excite an unthinking and suffering people to the adoption of false remedies and destructive measures of supposed relief. Mr. President. I do not propose at tials time to argue against the claim of power in Congress to make Treasury notes a legal tender for the payment of debts by the Government itself. or between private citizens. Nor do I care now to recite the sad history of the overthrow of one of the most deliberate decisions ever reached by the Suprenme Court. accomplished so speedily by the active interference and power of President Grant and Mr. Hoar. his AttorneyGeneral. by the change not in the opinion but in the personnel of the tribunal. and an increase of its numbers. I shall content myself by adopting the language of ChiefJustice Chase in his dissent from the newlycreated majority. in their last judgment. in May. 1871. in favor of the passage of legaltender laws in tames of dire emergency. when (touse the language of Mr. Justice Strong) it was.cortain that nothing else would have supplied the absoluto necessities of the Treasury. that nothing else would have enabled the Government to maintain its armies and Navy. that nothing else would have saved the Government and Constitution from destruction. I believe with Chase. Grier. Nelson. Clifford. and Field. thatIf the plain sense of words. if the contemporaneous exposition of parties. if common consent of understanding. if the opinions of courts. avail anything in do. termining the meaning of the Constitution. it seems impossible to doubt that the power to coin money is apewer to establish a uniform standard of value. and that no other power to establish such a standard by making notes a legal tonder is. conferred upon Congress by the Constitution. This was the view of five judges in opposition to three. in January. On May 1. 1871. this decision was overruled by the reconstructed court by at vote of 5 to 4. and their judgment is to be found in the twelfth volume of Wallaces Reports. It has of course been obeyed ever since. and as I think the action of Congress in the reissue of United States notes after they had been redeemed and become the property of the United States. is an extension of power. unauthorized even by the last judgment of the court. But I wish the Senate aud people of the United States to consider the injurious results to all private contracts and business of continuing such a power in perpetuity. I do not now speak of the constitutionality of the power although no otw has yet and I think no one. will rise in this Chamber and affirm his belief in the power in Congress to create its paper notes lawful money and legal tender for all debts public and private. But independently of the question of constitutionality consider for a moment the practical results and impolicy of exercising such a power over the private contracts of individuals. When the Constitution of the United States expressly denied to any State the power to coin moneyto issue bills of credit. to make anything but gold and silver legal tender for the payment of debts. and to pass any law impairing the obligation of contractswhat was necessarily intended ? Evidently to secure the inviolability of contracts against legislative powerand to promote the punctual and honest performance of all obligations of the citizens. The power to make contracts (when not in derogation of morals) was asared right of individual dominionone of the absolute and admitted rights of the citizen. State jurisdiction over him was thus restrained by the Constitution. and a common coinage and universal standard and measure of values was sought to be secured. Now is it reasonableis it possiblethat when thus carefully and strictly prohibiting invasion by the States of the personal right of contractby prohibiting coinage to the several States. in order to secure a common and general coinage for all. by giving the power to coin money exclusively to Congressit was intended that Congress should have the power to pass laws impairing the obligation of eontractsand instead of the plainly expressed power to coin money and regulate its value in order to secure inviolability to contracts by providing certainty and stability in their settlementthey should print paper notes having no intrinsic value. instead of coining metals which possess intrinsic value. and by compulsion interject them as a medium of fluctuating value. to breed confusion and uncertainty in all the transactions of the people ? One great object of legislation is to prevent uncertainty in the interpretation of contractsand it is requisite for the sake of justice and honesty that every contract expressed in money shall enable us to ascertain exactly howi uch of the precious metals. at their legal standard of purity and fineness is due from one person to another. This power was committed solely to Congresswhen they were authorized to coin money-and regulate the weight and fineness of the coins from which their value is to be determined. If paper notes will express the true amount of the precious metals due from one man to another on a contractthese being the representatives of gold and silver. they are equally useful. but if they are not actually the representatives of such metals then they cannot measure how anuach of sch metals is due upon any contract. and cannot therefore be relied upon to perform the necessary functions of money. It has been held by the Supreme Court that Congress as well as the States was forbidden to pass laws impairing the obligation of contractsand certainly by the provisions of the fifth amendment was expressly prohibited from  depriving any person of property without due process of law -and from taking private property for public use without just compensation. Is it not impairing the obligation of a contract? Is it not depriving a man of his property  without due process of law when Congress compels him to receive for his contract or for his property United States notes admittedly worth less than the stipulated amount of money he had agreed and was entitled to receive? What is the difference to a farmer who delivers you five hundred bushels of grain according to his contract. if be is compelled to receive a currency which because of its depreciation would buy in the market but four hundred bushels at the date of delivery. althoungh at the time of making the contract it would have bougbtfive hundred bushels ? He has also given you full value in grain as he promised. and you pay him onefifthless in value than you promised. Is henot deprivedof his property without due process of law. and is not the obligation of your contract with him impaired? If you can persuade yourself that a law permitting such things is constitutional. can you say that it is either honest or just ? A more arbitrary exercise of power cannot be imagined than that which interferes with and alters every contract whether for labor and service. or for lands or property of any description. It is fatal alike to honesty and certainty in human dealings. to the laborerwho is worthy of his hire. as it is to the negotiation of a loan for national defense. Yet such a power is now commended and sought to be continued as a law in a government called free! The right to property is as important as the right to life and liberty . when the first is not secure. the other two cannot be. I consider the construction of the Constitution by the Supreme Court in the legaltender cases to be alarming and most dangerous. for I understand it to rest the power to issue egaltender notes upon the existence of some great emergency of which Congress is the judge. By tihis rule there is no constitutional limitation upon the power of Congress. that in the heat of an emergency. of the existence and pressure of which they are the sole judges. does not melt away. As the Constitution was intended for the restraint of majorities. and to keep all power therein delegated within assigned limits. it is obvious that the necessity for maintaining its provisions is greater in proportion to the excitements and dangers of the hour. Yet by the interpretation of the Supreme Court the hour of the trial of the Constitution is the hour of its failureit is never so weak as when it should be most strong. The tiger of unlimited power in the majority is to be kept in his cage only until he becomes furious. and then the door is to be opened. Is not this like depriving a ship of her rudder just when the storm is at its height. and the power of control most needed? If this be the doctrine we cannot be too prompt. now that the storm has passed. the sea smooth. and the wind favorable to put our ship of state in a condition to weather future storms. Let us see where we now stand. By the act of June 30. 1864. the total amount of United States notes issued or to be issed was $400.000.000. Secretary McCulloeh in his annual report of 1865 having expressed the opinionThat the legal.tender acts were war measures. paed i a great emergency. that they should be -regarded only as temporar . that they ought not to remain in force a day lancer than would ho necessary to onoble thpeople to prepare for a return to the gold standard .and that the nork of retiring the notes which have been issued. should he commenced without delay. and carefu lly and persistentlycontinned until all are retired. the House of Representatives. under a suspension of rules. by a vote of 144 yeas to only 6 naysResolved. That this ouso cordially concurs in the views of the .Seretary In relation to the necessity of a contraction of the cuirrency. with a tow to as early a resumption of specie payments as the business interests of the country will permit. and we hereby pledge cooperative action to this end as speedily as possible. Amon g the one hundred and fortyfour supporters of this resolution (and there were but six votes in the negative) I find the following who are today memubers of this body: Messrs. ALLISON. CocNLING. DAWnS. lTey. sOnca ROLLINs. and VOOREEtS. The resolution of March 12. 1866. authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to retire and cancel $10.000.000 of these notes within six months. and thereafter not more than $4.000.000 in any one month. By January. 1868. Secretary McCulloch hadunder this authority retired and canceled $44.000.000 of these notes. and then Congress stopped their further retirement. In the fall of 1872. when Mr. Boutwell was Secretary of the Treaswry. $5.000.000 of these retired and canceled notes were put in .circulation by the Treasury Department. but on the meeting of Congress were called in again. In 1873 $26.000.000 of the same retired and canceled notes were .again reissued by Mr. Richardson. the Secretary of the Treasury. and the volume of United States notes thus increased to $382.000.000. was by the act of March 2:3. 1874. approved and legalized.

During the debate which attended the passage of the resumption act the present Secretary ofthe Treasury. Mr. Sherman. who had .ehargepf the bill in this body. was asked by several Senators. myself among the number. whether by the redemption of the United States notes under that act they were fially to be retired and destroyed. and he declined to give any construction whatever to the law on that point."},{"1":"4.600181e+08","2":"1879","3":"S","4":"FERRY","5":"958","6":"NA","7":"Yes","8":"I desire to add to what has been stated by the Sena- certained what the clerks they now have are doing. what labor they for from Indiana.. that this is confined to the Second Assistant Post- are performing. and the necessity there is for this increase. then. masterGenerals division. confined to the mail service which is in- perhaps. we should have reported favorably . but their sayso aloie creasing all the time..

Ihad a document here which shows by the admission of some southern men that the White Leagues and those other associations sprang out of the KuKlux. The KuKlux were suppressed by the law. which was onforced ill some of the States. and they abandoned it or probably abandoned it partly on the urgent appeals of such men as Mr. Pollard. who denounced them is a great disgrace against civilization. But the White League comes in. armed. organized. and disciplined. sworn to overthrow the State government of Louisiana. They say they are for protection. We know they are not.

Sir. you will have to convince the northorn people that this story is not true. Yon cannot do it. my worthy colleagne. by sneers or smiles . it must be done by sober facts. because here are indictnentswhich cannothe answeredlightly. Now. Mo. President. I wish to correct a misapprehension that might grow out of my remarks denunciatory of the White Leagues and the banditti. I do not say that all the people of Louisiana are of that mode of thinking at all. I know that we republicans sometimes neglect to give to these people in their present condition. due consideration for some of the circumstances by which they are surrounded. In the first place. in Louisiana the war has left its excitement. and sonc of tis scones of the war in the Red River country. in this very Coushatta region on the upper part of Red River. and in New Orleans. have left great animosities. ani we cannot expect these to (tie away in a monment. We must take that into consideration in viewing the conduct of the people of Louisiana. Besides. tley have a mixed population. We know that there is a portion of the population of French descent. a portion of Spanish descent. many and probably a majority of colored people. soeo from foreign lands. some from our own Northern States. some from other Southern States. Probably there is no portion of the people of tie United States that has a more mixed origin than the people of Louisiana. In all cases that tends to promote violence. because sometimes speaking different languages they cannot understand each other. sometimes being educated in different lands and under different institutions they cannot appreciate the institutions tinder which we live. All these things are to be considered. They have to encounter another great difficulty. in the novelty of foriier masters and slaves living together rsfreemen. This we know by all history is a most difficult problem. Those who were once slaves. whose wives and children were bartered and sold like sheep. are now citizens. The masters have been impoverished. they have bost their slaves. they have lost the use of their lands. all their labor is broken up. All these things are to be considered. cud we must not overlook them. We must not therefore expect from them the same orderly reguhirity. the same freedom from violence and fore that we sliould expect in a stable. orderly people like the peo1)10 of Ohio or Now York. All the sources of wealth. are dried np. When I was there last winter I conversed with gentlemen of all political parties. cal saw the great change in tho value of their property and the amount of their income. Some families hadincomes dependent upon the rents of real estate in Now Orleans. and the real estate would hardly pay the taxes. amd they were reduced to poverty. hardly able to gather money enough to pay their taxes. All that creates acerbity and bitterness of feeling. and no one felt it more than I did at that time. Thoughtful men I say should give heed to all these diseopiragements and difficulties. but after all. considering them all. we have a right to ask of these people to respect the law. to be obedient to the law. If they have a majority.in the uame of God let them have the power of the majority. I would not. I am sure. cud I do not believe aiy of my fellow Senators would. seek to deprive any State of the right to be governed by its own people. by home government. as they call it. Whatwe do sayis that they shall not trample down the rights of others. that when they are exercising their owi right in voting as they please. electing democrats. electing confederate geierals if they please. anybody they choose. they must not trample down the rights of the warls of the nation. who have been emancipated by our policy and by otr laws. Equal rights. equal privileges. equal facilities for education. for life. for liberty. and the acquirement and enjoyment of propertythat we demanid. aid in the name of God and by the agency of the republicall party we will have it sooner or later. There is no doubt about that. I will not now dwell upon the remedy. I intended to do so. but I ant already too wearicil to enter upon it. hut I do say that the Senate ought now to take up this matter ii a dispassionato way and do equal ad exact jastice tothese people. If a democratie house was elected there last November lawfully and fairly. in the name of Heaven given them the organization. reqiiing them however to organize according to law to obey the law and not obtain it by laiwlces violence. If they get the control of the house in a regular and legal way. let them have it. The republican party is strong enough and I hope brave enough to do justiceto our political adversaries. If. as I honestly believe. their soccess will be an unmixed evil to our country. it car be easily repaired. and the future is all before us. Then let them secure to all the people of Louisiana equal and just rights. and let us her no more of the wrongs. outrages. and murders that have wronged the State of Louisiana. Why can they not live in.peaco I cannot cocceive of a state of society where a whole population is overawed and intimidated. as undoubtedly the negro population ire to a very large extent in many parishes of that State. where murder cain be committed without punishment. The nere statemleut that a thousand miurdersonly take onethird of wlat General Sheridan saysthat a thousand murders have beei cumitted in Louisiana id not a single mian punished for them is a fact so atrocious. so terrible. so daninable. that I can hardly belinve it. Yettlieroit is. How that matter occurred at Coushatta. how the people there. democrats and all. did not rise and follow the murderers and take instant vugeance on them. or at least secure them and trythem before the courts. I cannot imagine. Yet four or live young men from the North who went there with capital. who went merely to buildu p a little village. were suddenly broken up and murdered after they had surrendered. The murderers violated even the code of honor which always secures a mai whr surrenders safety.

Again. sir. by perverting the Senate of the United States into a court of general jaildelivery. we seriously interfere with the discharge of those duties relating to great national questions which the welfare of the country demands. And farther. I remark that the position of Sonatorof the United States is one which heretofore has been coveted. Six years is a long time for ambition to keep itself waiting. Let it be understood that the Senate is always open and ready to entertain any charge that may be made by any one. and that we are to try the question ia the manner we know these investigations nust be conducted. and. I think. we are courting such a condition of things as will destroy that independence and that security which it was the great care of the Codstitution. by its various provisious directed to that end. to confer upon the Senato.

Lot no one think that the propriety of his conduct has been sach that he is impregnably secure when the rules of evidence and the proper organization of judicial tribunals are broken down. Those agencies were created as much for the protection of the ilnocent as for the conviction of the guilty. As another has said. one may be so popular today that the people east garments and garlands before him. and tomorrow he is the victim for the cross: Crucify him! erucify him! I object to the breaking down of the barriers of rules of citene. a justly organited judicial tribunal. and the safeguards which rur Constitution has cast around the trial of its citizens for crimes. and I claim for a Senator of the United States only the rights that belong to the humblest citizen of this land. but I claim them all. Again. Mr. President. there is no limitation to these charges. there is no statute of fence. Away from their witnesses. without the advantage of the constitutional tribunals of the country. the rules of evidence unenforced. long after the event is charged to have occurred. when the evidence is lost or memory become indistinct. and under circumstances in which you could try no one else. the impression seems to prevail that Senators may be tried. I have said this much to call the attention of the Senate to the general subject of investigation. Vhat I have suggested may have little to do with the case before us. for in that case the Senator admits the paying of $15.000 to induce a candidate to withdraw from tile eanvasss. . rhat fact needs no investigation. Permit a few words as to this particular case. I do not believe that we are an assemblage of embassadors from the States. but we are a coordinate branch of the national legislature. Under the old Confederation a State might send from one to seven delegates. and each State had but one vote. That was State representation. Now. it is true that. in order that the State may have a representation in the national councils without regard to population. each State has the same numberof representatives in the Senate. but when here we vote as individuals. as much so as do the Representatives in the House. We are not Senators of Pennsylvania or Rhode Island. but we are. when elected and sworn. Senators of the United States. For the purpose of removing the election a little further from popular infloence. Senators are elected. not by the legislative power. for that consists of the legislature and the governor. but are elected by the legislature. Whea a Senator presents his certificate here. signed by the governor. to the fact of his election. he is. priisafaeie. entitled to his seat. That has been frequently decided. Being seated. he is entirely beyond the control of his State. but can be unseated for any cause that makes his election void. as a discovery of the miscount of votes. fraud in conting them. duress. possibly deception. or discovering a want of the constitotional qualifications. Can his election be declared void for bribery I Before I listened to the exhaustive argument of the Senator from Now York. I for my own purposes wrote this short sentence. and I believe it true and shall act upon it: If the electors were legal voters. and voted freely and understandingly. the election is valid. I am not likely to change this conclusion after listening to the argument to which I have alluded. You cannot render an election void by attacking the motives of the legislators. You cannot prove that one legislator voted for a Senator because he was his cousin7 and that another voted for him in order to got him out of the way. that he might have his lawprartie. and that another voted for him because he was satisfied he would aid i obtaining a bounty for his railroad. It does not follow that the legislator would not have voted for the Senator without any of these considerations. The question of motive is beyond our reach. Can you declare the election void for bribery I I do not know tht I have anything to add to the argument which has been made on that point. Iean only state the one consideration upon which I made up my own conclesion on this subject. Suppose a Senator. elected in joint convention by one majority. and it is clearly proven that one member who voted for hin was bribid so to vote by an enemy of the Senator elected. That might readily he. That enemy might bribe a legislator so to vote. in order that the Senator would be out of the way as a candidate for governor. He might bribe a legislator to vote for the Senator for the very purpose of eventually defeating him. for if the doctrine he true that the bribery of the majority renders the election void. this would be a very effectual mode of dotat. It seems to me that to hold such an election void would be placing a premium on bribery. that it would be giving it the reward of sure success. and I cannot conceive that any Senator can hold that such an election would be void. If. however. that election would not be void. then bribery per 8c does not tender an election void. for it makes no differenee from whom the bribe comes. so far as relates to the influence of the bribe on the vote ofthelegislator. Do I. then. mean to say that a Senator. ifhe is the one that gives the bribe. can in this manner secure his election ? What I mea is. that it is perfectly clear that his being guilty of bribery is a question that goes to his character. and not to the fact of election. and is to be treated under the power of expulsion. If. thes. bribery does not render an election void any more than it renders a charter or a law void. is corruption to continue to run riot in our legislatures? No. sir. it is the law of the State that the legislator violates. and the States must vindicate their laws. must indict and punish . and. if they do not. then let the General Government. if it has the constitutional power. as perhaps it has so far as bribery relates to a United States Senator. enact laws and enforce them in the Federal courts of the judicial districts of the country. If the Federal Government has no such power. it cestainly has not power to reach bribery by declaring the authorized acts of independent States to be void. Again. the question is asked whether the guilty Senator is to go unpunished ? No. he is subject to the criminal code of his State. and is subject. too. in the manner I shall indicate. to the power of the Senate on the question of expulsion. The Senate by a votoe of twothirds may expel a member. Such is the brief constitutional charter of our power. There is no constitutional limit whatever to our discretion. and we naturally seek for direction. Lot us. then. romomberthat we are not charged with the administration of justice. If a crime is brought to the attention of a grand jury. they must act. If a case is presented to a court. it must acquit or condemn. We have no such imperative duty. If there be a case that is patent. acknowledged. or judicially determined. so as to convince twothirds of the Senators. we may expel. if we think the purity and dignity of the body demand it. We do not by any means give our sanction to the conduct of every Seintor we do not expel. For what may we expel? There is no sure chart or compass. in answering that question. to bring us to the safe haven of truth. The best that we can do is to suggest rules to guide our uncontrolled discretion. First. W may expel for disreputable conduct during the period one is a Senator. whether such conduct is connected with his senatorial duty or not. But when. while Senator. this disreputable conduct is not connected with his senatorial duty. the ground for expulsion should he laid by a record of conviction. There are many offenses that might be suggested for which Senators would freely give a vote for expulsion. yet they are offenses for which they would hesitate long before subjecting the accused to such trial as can be here given. When the offense. be it homicide. forgery. or bribery. is once judicially established. then the Senate will take action as to it. Secoudly.One may be expelled for disreputable conduct in the act of obtaining an election. But if that conduct is a crime and the Senator asserts his innocence. he is. as other men. entitled to a constitutionat trial in the State where the crime is alleged to have been committed. and this. because the Constitution declares in effec that every person shall have that right. I am aware that we are not bound by these constitutional provisions. I know that when we are exercising the power of expulsion. then we are putting forth a high prerogative power. We should. however. in the exercise of this discretion. extend the same protection to Senators as to other men. and be guided by the provisions of the Constitution. Let us do to others as we would that they should do to us. I now ask these Senators individually whether if yon. or you. or you. were charged with bribery in your respective States. you would be willing to have your cause tried. involving a reputation dearer to you than life. and involving. too. the good name of your childrenyon would be willing to have that cause tried in the Sbate of Kansas. eighteen hundred miles and more away from your home and from the vicinage where the crime is alleged to have been committedaway from the locality where the character of the witnesses is knownand this without an issue being formed and without court or jury ? No. there is no Senator that would not cry out against such an injustice being brought to his door. By my vote. sir. I shall administer to others. whether there is a storm of public sentiment or a calm. the same law and the same justice that I claim for myself. Thirdly. It may be that a Senator is so clearly guilty of misconduct connected with the obtaining of his office that it would be a mere farce to require a trial. Mallory. Davis. Toombs. Clement C. Clay. and others left their places in the Senate to join the rebellion. and their seats wore declared vacant."}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
