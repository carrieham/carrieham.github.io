As a resuit. we have had an increase in the total schoolconstruction costscaused exclusively and entirely by the interest rate increaseof 22.5 percent during this period. I checked with the staff of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. who told me that last year there was $2.800 million of publicschool construction. and the staff estimates there was a minimum of at least $200 million of privateschool construction. and probably much more. If we add the two. we arrive at a total of $3 billion of school construction last year. The fact is that to finance this $3 billion of school building cost a huge $675 million more last year because of the direct. deliberate. calculated. planned action of the Federal Reserve Board than it would have if the Federal Reserve Board had followed a policy of maintaining a constant relationship between the money supply and the gross national product. I am not going to charge that the Federal Reserve Board should have maintained an absolutely constant relationship. I frankly dont think they should. I believe they should have followed an orthodox position of neutrality. Instead of artificially restraining the money supply and shoving up interest cost. they should have permitted a free play of market forces. I think it a fair conclusion that the policies of the Federal Reserve Board have resulted. not in just somewhat higher costs of school construction. butas I have documented them herein a $675 million increased cost to our school districts in constructing their schools. This is a cost that wipes out twothirds of the benefit of the bill we have just passed. Now I know I will be accused of favoring a huge expansion of the money supply. I do not. I simply call on the Federal Reserve Board to recognize when they tighten the money supply that they are imposing an immense burden on school construction and education in America. I shall conclude this presentation by pointing out to the Senate that not a single dollar of that $675 million of additional costs. that 22 percent increase in costs. went to any workingman. not one penny of it went in higher construction wages. or in profits to any of the school building contractors. who are generally small business people. Every penny of it went to the money lenders. and came from the property taxes of hard pressed local citizens."},{"1":"1961","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. may I say again that I have found the Senator from New Jersey extremely cooperative. and while I would not want the record even remotely to indicate that I think the child labor provisions are ideally applicable to the employment of children on the farmand I wish more of them were employed on the farms. for if they were. I think we would have less juvenile delinquency and less lack of health among childrenat the same time I think the bill is much more reasonable now than was the reported measure. I think it will be livable. I think that considering the fact that the workmens compensation laws and other provisions of the law of the various States are so different. and also customs in the various States are so different that the bill will lend itself to the desired purposes much better than the original would have. I wish to thank the Senator for his cooperation in the last week. when he has certainly worked diligently to try to get away from the objections which were voiced on the floor of the Senate last week."},{"1":"1962","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"The San Luis contract is causing a great uproar among small farmers. labor. and political club groups in California. I have been getting considerable correspondence on the decision during the past few months. I also have received copies of protests sent to President Kennedy and Secretary Udall. A farmer from Dinuba. Calif.. writes a post card. postmarked March 1. 1962: DEAR Si: I am a small farmer in central California farming 20 acres of vines. I am very unhappy about the San Luis project. Without the 160acre limit we cant survive in farming. Please do what you can to apply the limitation."},{"1":"1963","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I wish to make a brief statement for future reference in opposition to the Senators amendment. but I shall not take long. and I will not raise any point of order during my statement. so the Senator from New York will have an opportunity to withdraw his amendment. Mr. President. I yield myself 10 minutes. I appreciate the cooperation I have received from the Senator from New York [Mr. KEATINGI concerning this amendment. There is no question about the Senators dedicated sincerity in support of his amendment. I have already explained what will be my position as the Senator in charge of the bill if the amendment is pressed for a vote. I suggest that the amendment is a far more appropriate vehicle for consideration before the Senate Finance Committee. for the amendment contemplates changes in the internal revenue of the Government. The Committee on Labor and Public Welfare really has no jurisdiction in this area. The House bill which we are debating is not a revenue bill. In my judgment. adoption of the amendment would make completely untenable an already difficult situation as regards a conference with the House I fear that if the amendment were to be adopted. the House might consider it repugnant. as an invasion of the jealously guarded prerogative of that body with regard to the initiation of legislation affecting the raising of revenue. For such procedural reasons. I do not think the amendment is in order. and. as the Senator from New York has pointed out. in due course of time he will withdraw the amendment. insofar as this bill is concerned. Later. in connection with other proposed legislation. he will press for the attainment of his objective. With regard to the substantive proposal. even if there were no procedural difficulties. I would be constrained to object to the proposed adoption of the amendment. for. in my judgment. it should be rejected. inasmuch as it is clearly class legislation. Second. the amendment would bring no immediate relief to educational institutions. nor in the long run would it assist the families or the college students. inasmuch as the probable increase in tuition charges would be found to more than offset any savings to the family. Third. we have no data on the cost to the Treasury. but in all probability it would be great. It could run into many millions of dollars. When the amendment was first suggested. I took up the matter with the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare. and discussed it with the Department. I now report to the Senate that the Department does not favor the use of tax deductions or tax credits as methods of aiding education. Some of the reasons given for this view by the Department are as follows: First. The progressivity of the rate structure of the Federal income tax. which is designed to further the objectives of tax equity. makes the use of the tax singularly inappropriate for the purpose of advancing educational and related social objectives. Deductions from gross income for tuition payments tend to favor the highincome groups. A highincome taxpayer might have a tax saving of 50 percent or more. a taxpayer at the bottom of the incometax brackets would have a maximum tax saving of 20 percent. Mr. President. when we realize that our objective in dealing with Federal taxation is to provide for taxation on the basis of the ability to pay. it is clear that we should always be on guard against inequities against various groups of taxpayers. A moment ago. when I said the amendment is class legislation. I had in mind that the point is an obvious one. because if the amendment were to be adopted it would mean that benefits would be given to the parents of prospective college students. yet comparable tax benefits would be denied those who are not parents. This would mean that the parents of young people who wanted to go to college would have a smaller tax to pay. However. the necessary revenue must be raised. This means that taxpayers who are not the parents of prospective college students would. in essence. have to pay an additional amount in taxes. In short. our tax burden would in considerable part be transferred from the parents of young people who intend to go to college to taxpayers who are not parents. In my judgment. this would result in a misuse of the income tax. That is why the Department makes the point that the amendment would produce an inequity in the administration of the income tax. and I think the Department is correct."},{"1":"1964","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. several weeks ago a New York newspaper story alleged that the federally supported project on the Lower East Side of New York. Mobilization for Youth. was riddiled with Communists. Since then. the organization has been subject to attack generally. There have been various charges and countercharges. numerous investigations. and a series of conflicting and confusing news reports. I think the time has come to treat the questions arising around Mobilization for Youth with the cool head of reason. The time has come to sift fact from fancy. to answer the myths and misconceptions. and to really discover what have been the fields of activity of this important organization. Mobilization for Youth was established in my congressional district several years ago to combat a serious problem of Juvenile delinquency. The program was undertaken after many studies by highly qualified authorities who were charged with the responsibility for formulating an attack which would get to the root of the problem rather than by hacking away at its branches as had previously been tried with little result. The program that evolved received the closest scrutiny from Federal and municipal agencies. as well as from philanthropic foundations and private individuals. As a result of this careful study. investigation. and evaluation. the program received funds to tackle the Job. The Federal Government provides 58 percent of the money. the Ford Foundation provides 14 percent. and the city of New York contributes 28 percent from various municipal agencies. The key words of the Mobilization program are that it is a social experiment offering social services combined with research and evaluation. It views delinquency as a byproduct of such basic problems as poverty and discrimination. Its laboratory is in my district. the Lower East Side of Manhattan. and it spans 67 blocks and an area high in social problems. The action part of the Mobilization program is divided into four partswork. education. community organization. and services to individuals and families. Mobilizations youth employment and training program is a pioneer effort which has already influenced the direction of youth employment programs throughout the country. It approaches this problem through vocational counseling. work sample assessments. subsidized work experience. onthejob training. formal trade training. job placement. and a remedial program to help basic language deficiencies which often result in bars to employment. Ninety percent of the young people who apply at Mobilizations Youth Job Center are school dropouts. Ninetyfive percent are Negro and Puerto Rican. Many come from families on public welfare. Eightyfive percent of them were unable to obtain or hold jobs in private industry without training and work preparation. Mobilization established an Urban Youth Service Corps to provide paid work for unemployed. outofschool. young people. From October 15. 1962. until December 31. 1963. 661 boys and girls participated in this Youth Service Corps. 522 of them full time and 139 part time. Major corporations. such as Shell Oil Co.. for example. from whom Mobilization has leased a gas station to train young men for jobs in service stations and as auto mechanics. have cooperated in this project. In the spring of 1964. 252 young people were enrolled. 167 of them full time and 85 part time. Mobilizations youth employment effort has developed new forms of onthejob training. It has focused particularly upon young people who are the most difficult to place and. indeed. it has found jobs for them in private industry. often in small businesses. with employers sharing the cost for initial training. As of December 31. 1963. 230 young people had been placed in onthejob training and 73 more were enrolled in the spring of 1964. While it is too early to assess the results of Mobilizations efforts. one interesting fact has emerged: a large percentage of young people in the program had been either on probation or on parole. Many had been gang members. Yet. in the employment program. disciplinary problems have been rare. Even members of rival gangs have worked side by side. Apparently. working together reduces conflict. And so. in this vital area of youth employment and training. Mobilization must be considered a success. The second major area of Mobilizations work is education. Here. too. Mobilization has scored impressive results. Its homeworkhelper program pays bright high school students to tutor failing elementary school youngsters. In February 1964. 240 high school students were tutoring 570 elementary school students. directed by 13 master teachers. Its early childhood program. involving 20 kindergarten and 20 firstgrade classes has been an effort to help children from the most problemfilled homes get off to an even start in school through special attention. In February 1964. 1.252 children and 42 teachers in 12 schools were involved in this program. Two reading clinics have been organized to help elementary and junior high school children. Classes for the parents of retarded readers have been provided. Nine Mobilization reading teachers are working with 768 moderately retarded readers. Special materials have been developed in this program. Various other laboratory schools and programs have been developed to increase understanding between the school system and the community. Here. too. the Mobilization effort has been a pronounced success. In this area of services to individuals and to families. Mobilization has opened two coffeehouses. which serve as social and cultural centers. The membership of these shops cut across gang lines. with the youths themselves playing a large role in building and managing these facilities. Young adult action groups have been organized. which give a hearing to the point of view of the adolescent and attempt to shift the thinking of minority group youngsters into positive channels for democratic social change. Mobilization for Youth has conducted institutes on education. problems with the police. and civil rights. Seventy members of this group visited Washington in February of this year to support the Youth Employment Act. and met with Secretary of Labor Wirtz. Attorney General Kennedy. and Members of Congress. An Adventurers Club has been formed involving children between the ages of 8 and 13. About 300 boys and girls are enrolled in this club whose activities Include a marching band. sports. and camping trips. Programs designed to break the pattern whereby younger boys are recruited to gang life have been developed under which youngsters are shifted into more positive roles in community life. Leaders work with small groups of 8- to 12yearolds. As of this year. 306 youngsters were being served by this program. In these three areas. of the four main areas mentioned. there has been no hint of any criticism. Far from it. These programs have more than justified Mobilizations costs and activities. The newspaper headlines and the newspaper criticisms deal with the fourth area and with only a small part of it. The newspaper criticism deals with the socalled community action portion of the Mobilization program. Let me say. first. that this portion comprises about 5 percent of Mobilizations activity and uses about 5 percent of the Mobilization budget. I do not want to minimize its importance. however. by these percentages. Community organization was. and is. one of the functions of the Mobilization program. Briefly. the purpose of this aspect of the program is to help people to help themselves. Its philosophy is based upon proven fact that bringing needed. traditional. and new services to the poor. or offering bigger and better services is not enough. These efforts must be coupled with efforts to get people motivated to want to do something for themselves.. While I would agree with some of the objectives of the socalled community action portion of the Mobilization program. I regret I do have to say that some of the methods used in attaining these objectives have sometimes been devisive and harmful. I can understand tenants cooperating for the purpose of ameliorating indecent. unsanitary. hazardous. and otherwise miserable living conditions which are injurious to themselves and their children. however. I do not condone the misuse of organized rent strikes. While I can understand the feeling of parents who advocate action that may appear momentarily beneficial to their children. I do not believe that children should be used in organized school boycotts as pawns to attain these ends. An example of appropriate community action was the march on Washington last summer. It was a demonstration supported by President Kennedy and by scores of Governors and mayors. including own own Mayor Wagner. It was also supported by scores of Senators and Congressmen. many of whom attended. in a body. and had seats of honor at the Lincoln Memorial. The city of New York. itself. gave many of its employees time off to participate in the march. Insofar as Mobilizations being riddled with Communists is concerned. this is now under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. the New York City Department of Investigation. and Mobilization. itself. has retained the services of Philip W. Haberman. Jr.. a wellknown and highly respected attorney with broad experience in such matters. No one in Mobilization will accept or condone employment of subversives. Any who are found will be separated from the program. Of this there is no doubt. and of this there is no question. The fact is. however. that the attack on Mobilization has been a broadscaled rather than a narrowscaled attack. The present controversy can have destructive effects. I would not wish this program to be stifled. nor would I wish this program to be jeopardized. I do not hesitate to criticize Mobilization for Youth where I believe it is wrong. but at the same time. I do not believe that the child should be thrown out with the bath. Especially where it is. and has been. universally recognized -that an overwhelming proportion of the efforts of Mobilization for Youth has served my neighborhood so well. Therefore. I believe we must take the view that. as in all experiments. trial and error are implicit. This must hold true in social experimentation. as well as scientific experimentation. I said earlier that one of the key words to the Mobilization program is that it is a social experiment. Just as Thomas Edison said he found 1.732 ways not to make an electric light bulb. so must we be tolerant that an experiment which deals with as many people as this does. in as deprived. underprivileged. and depressed a community as this is. that as in all experimentation trial and error are implicit. If error has been made. it should be found and it should be corrected. We are assured by Mobilization officials that if errors. indeed. are found. they will be corrected. The overriding fact. however. is that the Mobilization program. in the brief years of its existence. has already clearly demonstrated its basic and inherent values. Its contribution to our young people has already been significant. It has developed programs of national significance in the field of employment. education and services to individuals and families. If we find that one or two aspects of its community organization program are weak. this can be. and should be. and will be corrected. As a Representative of the district in which this pilot project is taking place. I feel I should report to the Congress upon its progress. as well as upon its difficulties. and let you know that. in my considered judgment. more than 95 percent of this program warrants the high hopes that we hold for it. This is a percentage that compares far more favorably with that of any other field of experimentation. I am confident enough in the leadership of Mobilization to know that any weaknesses will be overcome. any errors corrected. The program has my support and. I am sure. the support of all enlightened. intelligent. well meaning citizens as well. Under the recently enacted Economic Opportunity Act of 1964the antipoverty legislationa program for community action projects is being started which will have a much broader scope than that of the Lower East Side. I believe it is necessary to establish certain guidelines. I would not wish for these guidelines to stifle the creativity or initiative of the people who benefit most directly from this program. But we must maintain a sense of responsibility to the whole communityto its larger needs. to its greater good. and to the maintenance of peace and lawful activity. We must all remember that the freedom we have is not license for unbridled action. but the liberty to do the most responsible job in a publicminded way. In sum. let it not be forgotten that this is a pilot program. One whose raw edges are in the process of being smoothed out. This will eventually be done."},{"1":"1965","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I thank the gentleman. I would like to ask another additional question in another area. A number of people in my district employ young summer students. very young students. And in our State of Georgia the laws are such with regard to child labor that with the permission of the school superintendent a number of these youngsters have been getting jobs in the past that have not been covered under the Minimum Wage Act. The particular company that I am thinking of right now employs 40 young boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 16. They are doing healthful outdoor work. I have been told that they will not be able to employ any of these youngsters at the minimum wage because they are paying a lesser amount for these students who are not only unskilled but they are young children. A great many of them earn a part of their livelihood or at least earn the means by which they are able to go to college. This particular company that I refer to has been employing such young students for a very long time in this resort area. I wonder if there Is any thinking on the part of the committee as to any possibility in some way to exempt these young boys and girls who are between the ages. as I said. of 14 and 16 who now have this opportunity with their lesser skills to earn money to go to college but who would not be able to compete with more skilled people who would be paid at the minimum wage rate."},{"1":"1966","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman.

That the Secretary is authorized to determine the fair value of such board. lodging. or other facilities for defined classes of employees and in defined areas. based on average cost to the employer or to groups of employers similarly situated. or average value to groups of employees. or other appropriate measures of fair value.

There has been no criticism of this formula. I do not know wnat purpo.e this Congress is going to serve in trying to revise that formula now and bring in 50 different standards all across America and Puerto Rico. I say to the members of the Committee that if this is done. we are going to create more problems with that kind of formula than we will solve. The Secretary of Labor has the experience. There has been no complaint. There has been no testimony in support of this. and I believe at this moment that to rewrite this basic original law is to do what we have previously done when we see what we have done later. it was a mistake.

Lending his unsurpassed legislative ability and articulate advocacy to Senate Joint Resolution 81 tells only part of the story. He assured its overwhelming acceptance by the Senate. But his keen appreciation of the issues involved in this labor dispute. his vast knowledge of the problems facing both labor and management and his broad understanding of the ramifications that surely would grow out of a breakdown in our rail transportation industry at this time served more than anything else to develop the sound measure just adopted. Senator MORSE brought to the Senate a proposal shaped carefully out of the vast reservoir of his experiencean experience spanning nearly 30 yearsfrom his service on the Railway Emergency Board in the early 1940s right down to the present. He steered the proposal first through the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare and obtained swift and favorable action with the same high degree of skill that has characterized his many legislative triumphs. He today presented it to the Senate in the articulate and astute manner that compelled a strong endorsement. For this achievement a grateful nation will remain forever in his debt. Valued equally in the discussion leading to the success of this measure was the strong and able support of the senior Senator from New York . As the ranking minority member of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare. Senator JAVITs has consistently worked to satisfy the vital needs of the national interest. His response in this instance demonstrated the same high caliber of effort that has characterized his many years of public service to the Nation. We are deeply grateful. We are grateful also to those Senators who. while urging a somewhat different course of action. in no way impeded the prompt and orderly disposition of the measure. I refer to the senior Senator from Texas and the senior Senator from Massachusetts . They have always expressed an abiding devotion to the resolution of problems facing both labor and management. That concern was shown in this as in every instance. They urged their views with deep sincerity and with articulate understanding. At the same time they cooperated to permit the most efficient disposition of the measure. for which they deserve the highest commendation. Other Senators joined to assure the Senates overwhelming approval. Noteworthy were the efforts of the Senator from Vermont . whose views are a welcome addition to the discussion of any proposal. The Senators from Iowa . Michigan . and Arizona also joined to assure an outstanding success. as did the Senator from Rhode Island . whose eloquent assessment of the issues involved is always highly valued. Of course. the chairman of the committee. the senior Senator from Alabama and all of the committee members deserve the praise of the Senate for performing this task effectively and with dispatch.

The issue is not the usefulness or the desirability of marine sanctuaries. As I will show later. marine sanctuaries are very desirable in certain circumstances. But the issues are how to establish them. to whom they will apply. and with what ramifications on other interests of the United States. In raising the question of marine sanctuaries in international waters. we are caught in the middle of one of the most complex international legal arenas known today. And when all the interests are weighed in balance. I feel that we must reject the proposal. The committee believes that the establishment of marine sanctuaries is appropriate where it is desirable to set aside areas of the seabed and the waters above for scientific study. to preserve. unique. rare. or characteristic features of the oceans. coastal. and other waters. and their total ecosystems. We envision such sanctuaries as natural areas set aside primarily to provide scientists the opportunity to make baseline ecological measurements. In coastal areas such measurements will be essential to many coastal and estuarine zone management decisions that will have to be made. as well as helping to predict and measure the impact of human activity on the natural ecosystem. Such sanctuaries should not be chosen at random. but should reflect regional differentiation and a variety of ecosystems so as to cover all significant natural variations. Scientific research and ecological data can aid significantly in providing a rational basis for intelligent management of coastal and estuarine areas where such sanctuaries might be located. They could be used to monitor vital changes in the estuarine environment. or forecast possible deterioration from anticipated human activities. In our hearings on coastal zone management. Dr. Eugene Odum. director of the Institute of Ecology. University of Georgia. likened such sanctuaries to pilot plants. He told us: Scientists have to have pilot plants to check out broad theories on a large environmental scale. just as an industrialist would not want to market a product directly from a laboratory. he would want to have a pilot plant study first. And it was with these thoughts in mind that the Committee on Commerce reported out favorably S. 582. the National Coastal and Estuarine Zone Management Act of 1971. which contains a provision for estuarine sanctuaries and authorizes $6 million to be appropriated for them. Sanctuaries authorized under that act. however. could not extend seaward farther than the outer limits of the territorial waters of the United States. And therein lies the principal difference between our committees provision and the Nelson amendment. As presently written. the Nelson amendment purports to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to designate marine sanctuaries in international waters which are not subject to the jurisdiction and control of the United States. This is the fatal flaw. It would extend American jurisdiction in violation of international law and contrary to the very interests that the United States is trying to promote in the 1973 law of the sea conference. The 1973 conference on the law of the sea has been called by the 25th U.N. General Assembly to produce agreements on a wide spectrum of outstanding. unresolved oceans issues. The United States is actively involved in the preparations for that conference and has proposed a draft seabeds convention. among other things. But central to American objectives in that conference is the need to obtain international agreement on a narrow territorial sea and guaranteed transit through and over international straits. so as to insure the continued mobility of our military and naval forces and merchant fleets around the world. These objectives can best be achieved through multilateral agreement. and are most seriously threatened by unilateral coastal state claims over areas of the high seas. It is very important that we do not attempt to exert control over ocean areas beyond national jurisdiction unilaterally. without multilateral international agreement. thereby encouraging other countries to do so. Advocates of the marine sanctuaries argue that the Nelson amendment would not be a unilateral grab of high seas areas. which would exclude foreigners from the sanctuaries. They argue that the amendment would only apply to Americans. Perhaps. But it completely avoids the international issue and our historical experience. This thinking is very similar to the fine distinctions that the United States made when President Truman declared that the Continental Shelves surrounding the United States are subject to the jurisdiction and control of the United States. We claimed that we were not asserting full sovereignty over the shelves. We claimed that the rights of freedom of navigation in high seas areas were unimpaired. We claimed a number of international legal niceties to justify and limit the extent of the American claim to the resources of the Continental Shelves. No other nation complained. In fact. many thought we had a good idea. So good. that they went well beyond. and the rest is history. The claims of Latin American countries to full sovereignty over the oceans and seabed and subsoil extending 200 miles from land grew from that original limited U.S. claim. And you can see some of the results every time Ecuador or Peru hauls in one of our tuna boats for violating their territorial waters. even though they may be 150 miles from land. The advocates for the Nelson amendment have a legal nicety when they say that our unilateral designation of marine sanctuaries in high seas areas would govern only Americans. But. in fact. what they are trying to achieve is well known in the literature as creeping jurisdiction. And it puts the United States in an untenable position in our international negotiations. On the one hand we would be nibbling away at the international freedoms of the high seas. unilaterally asserting authority to regulate activities in high seas areas. On the other hand we are taking the position in international negotiations that our best interests are served by narrow territorial claims and the greatest freedom of navigation. The two are diametrically opposed. Mr. President. there are methods by which we can create marine sanctuaries in high seas areas without violating international law and without taking an inconsistent stance in international negotiations on the law of the sea. But the methods involve use of the treaty power under our Constitution. and not the unilateral assertion of authority through domestic legislation alone. The Committee on Commerce has already reported a bill that would provide estuarine sanctuaries. And it would provide for those sanctuaries in an area where the United States has exclusive jurisdiction. recognized by all nations of the world. and consistent with our national objectives on the law of the sea. For this and the reasons that I have just stated. I recommend that the Senate vote to reject the Nelson amendment."},{"1":"1972","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. the Civil Rights Act of 1964 made clear that every person in this Nation is entitled to equal treatment with regard to a job. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. under the provisions of that act was charged with a responsibility of making that policy a reality. But the only enforcement power granted the EEOC was the authority to seek voluntary compliance with the law. a weakness which the legislation before us today would correct. I think it is clear that the majority of this Nations employers recognize the intent of Congress to insure fair employment practices and have abided by the law. But it is also clear that unemployment discrimination still exists today. a situation which fairminded people cannot and should not tolerate. Mr. President. the Immediate issue before us is not whether the EEOC should have enforcement powers. Rather the issue is what procedures must be used in the exercise of that power. As the Senate is aware. the House of Representatives has approved a measure which requires the EEOC to go to court to enforce their rulings. The legislation before us here. however. would authorize the EEOC. following an investigation of unlawful employment practices and an administrativee hearing on such complaints. to issue an appropriate enforcement order. That order would be subject to a full and complete review in the U.S. Courts of Appeals. It has been argued that this grant of authority is without precedent in the law. But that Is not the case. The National Labor Relations Board and the Federal Trade Commission have similar authority. For each of these Agencies. this grant of authority has improved their capability to protect the public from unfair labor practices and consumer fraud and deception. Mr. President. the technical nature of this issue should not confuse the fact that this is a matter of civil rights. It is a matter Which tests our commitment to equality and basic human fairness. My record In the Senate on civil rights legislation is one which reflects. I believe. a commitment to these values. And though some would ask me to do so.

I rise in enthusiastic support of H.R. 11510. I have reached that conclusion not because I happen to be a member of the Committee on Government Operations. but because I recognize that this bill is an effort to consolidate and reorganize the most important functions of the Federal Government in a new Energy Research and Development Administration to promote more efficient management of those functions to truly get us on the road to a status of independence from any other country in the world for our energy needs. Someone has said that this divided country of ours is united on at least one issue or one objective and that is to try to arrive at a solution for our longterm energy needs. During all of the preliminary discussions and during the debate on the floor. the bill today has become best known as ERDA. Energy Research and Development Administration. The objective of that Administration is to coordinate nearly all of the energy research and development functions now scattered about in other Federal agencies and also to assign to ERDA the responsibility for the nonregulatory functions of the present Atomic Energy Commission. The AEC would be renamed the Nuclear Energy Commission under the bill and would continue to perform its licensing and related regulatory functions. Mr. Chairman. the really important as well as the interesting and hopefully productive provisions of this bill are found in title I which provides for the appointment of an Administrator and five assistant administrators. Each of these five administrators is given jurisdiction over a separate field of research including. first. fossil energy. second. nuclear energy. third. environment safety and conversion. fourth. research and advanced energy systems. and fifth. national security. The Office of Coal Research is taken from the Department of Interior and quite properly put into this new agency. It will be recalled that the purpose of OCR was to conduct research on conversion of coal to cleaner fuel forms. Another function taken from the Bureau of Mines of the Department of Interior is fossil fuel research and development including the very important pilot coal gasification plant now under construction. Title I also selects those programs now under the Science Foundation and places them in this new agency that have to do with solar heating and cooling of buildings and geothermal research. and finally. in title I is a provision which permits the Environmental Protection Agency its present functions that are working on the development of alternative automotive power systems. What will we achieve when this bill becomes law? One answer is to make ERDA into a central energy research policy and planning agency empowered to conduct and coordinate research into all forms of energy development and to encourage such research outside of ERDA by private institutions. My chief regret concerning this legislation is that no funding is authorized and that these authorizations will be left to the regular authorizing committees. Certainly the exciting results from ERDA will not come about without cost and certainly not low cost. ERDA is a beautiful lady but it will take money to make her something more than a paper doll. Mr. Chairman. I suppose the principal reason that I am so enthusiastic about ERDA is that I am convinced the time has come and even past due for a new crashtype program to solve our longrange energy needs. I foresee in ERDA the vehicle to accomplish such an objective. Oh. there are so many proposals that may very well have merit. Between the sensible and the ridiculous there are many expedients which should be exploredwhich means researched. One is the burning of industrial wastes including boxing crates. used wrapping paper. broken wooden pallets. et cetera. That will. of course. require some plant conversion. Then we hear such other interesting and thoughtprovoking proposals as stretching heating oil 10 percent by adding used crankcase oil. It is not beyond the realm of mans imagination that there may be developed something close to the once ridiculed perpetual motion machine in the form of a permanent magnet to produce needed power. It has been suggested that it may be possible to perfect an installation of conversion units enabling motor cars to burn animal wastes and other organic material to produce methane gas fuel. The field of research that may redeem us all from fuel shortages in the future is the development of solar energy. While this source of energy has been scoffed at in the past it is today considered a feasible and major source of power. The President of the Society of Automotive Engineers in a recent speech said that we should not give up schemes to harness both the winds and tides such as the Passamaquoddy to produce hydroelectric power. Of course. this is no time to let up on research and development of nuclear breeder plants. While I have no idea whether this new research administration can accomplish it or not. one of the most truly grave problems is the efficient storage of energy in order to use intermittent energy sources. What does this mean? There must be developed some yet undiscovered improvement in metallurgy that would permit the efficient storage of energy. We could thus save sunlight that could not be used or consumed at the moment the energy source becomes available. If this could be accomplishedsome way to store energywe might very well have made a giant step toward the ultimate solution of our longrange energy problem. All of the beautiful talk of what we are doing today will not amount to much unless ERDA can someway be able to bring forth a national energy plan of action and that means an annual commitment to invest some money on the scale of a NASA program that resulted in the Apollo moon landing or of the magnitude of the Manhattan project which resulted in the creation of the atomic bomb. Money is needed for masstransit programs. intercity commuter rail and bus systems. and incentives for the production of more buses. In the field of coal research alone well over a billion dollars could be used productively to convert coal as a usable. efficient. and clean replacement for gasoline fuel and other petroleum products. We need funding for better recovery methods of oil shale and some kind of incentives for homeowners and small business people to improve their insulation to provide heating and reduce fuel consumption. We cannot forget the incentives necessary to expand domestic oil and gas exploration. A lot of funding will be needed foi. solar. nuclear and thermal energy research. It is my judgment. Mr. Chairman. that the lions share of this should be spent on solar research and development. This may well be the ultimate answer to our problems. Energy from the sun is abundant and inexhaustible and nonpolluting. Every day enough energy falls on the United States in the form of sunlight to supply our power needs for an entire year. Every day we delay the funding of solar energy as a top priority will prolong the problems that we face. All of us who support this bill can go home proud that we have done something productive about our grave energy situation. With a present energy research program operating among several agencies. we can point with pride to our vote to consolidate these efforts and direct them toward the goal of energy self -sufficiency for our great country."},{"1":"1974","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. the amendment I am introducing today to S. 2744. the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974. has a simple objective: to establish the Energy Research and Development AdministrationERDAas a nonnuclear R. & D. agency. It would leave the AEC intact to carry out its developmental work on nuclear fission. It would not alter the sound decision of the Government Operations Committee to separate the regulatory functions of the AEC from its promotional aspects. But it would ensure that the nonnuclear research and development activities of the Government are carried out by a nonnuclear agency. Under S. 2744. all of the AEC. including the Division of Military Application. is transferred into ERDA. except for the number of people in the AECs Directorate of Regulations which is transferred to a newly created Nuclear Safety and Licensing Commission. While most of the AEC. with its national laboratories and extensive contractor network go into ERDA. transfers from other agencies are minor by comparison. These include the Department of Interiors Office of Coal Research. fossil fuel energy R. & D. conducted by the Bureau of Mines. and solar and geothermal research of the National Science Foundation. The following table shows the personnel and budgets which will be transferred to ERDA from each agency: People Money AEC -------- 15.988 1 $3.779.000. 000 Interior ---- 116 $372.000. 000 NSF -------- 13 $37. 000. 000 An additional 1.9co people and $140 million in fiscal year 1975 funds will be transferred to the newly created Nuclear Safety and Licensing Commission. In addition to the 7.000 AEC employees. there are 88.000 employees at AECowned facilities. The AECs National Laboratories. which are operated by private firms under contract with the AEC. employ 33.000 individuals. All of these contract employees would come into ERDA. under S. 2744. to continue the work they have been doing for the AEC. It is obvious that the AEC will be the dominant agency in ERDA. Indeed the nuclear proponents in the House would never have rushed the ERDA bill through that body in such haste if it did not put the AEC in charge of energy development. I think it should be apparent to everyone by this time that putting the AEC in charge of developing nonnuclear energy technologies is like putting the fox in charge of guarding the chickens. AECs record is one of outspoken advocacy for nuclear power against all other forms of energy. Let me cite a few examples. First. On June 11. 1974. the AEC unveiled its geothermal energy program. The resources it has devoted in the past to the program are pitifully small. and its announced 1985 objective woefully inadequate. The program was started only in 1974 with a funding of about 4.5 million. Its aim is to do R. & D. work on the construction and operation of small pilot plants with 10megawatt capacity. The program hopes to stimulate commercial production of 20.000 MW by 1985. Contrast this with the report geothermal energy produced in September 1973 by about 50 scientists under a grant sponsored by the National Science Foundation. The report concluded that with adequate R. & D. funds 132.000 megawatts could be produced by 1985. the equivalent of more than half of all the electricity now being generated in the United States. Second. A report on the potential for solar energy. prepared by an outstanding panel of experts assembled by the CXX1308Part 16 AEC. was almost completely ignored in the AECs December 1973 report to the President on a national energy program. The experts concluded that: At an average energy conversion efficiency of 5 per cent. less than 4 per cent of the U.S. continental land mass could supply 100 per cent of the current energy needs. Thus solar energy could contribute significantly to the national goal of permanent energy selfsufficiency while minimizing environmental degradation. In addition. this technology will be an exportable item for use by other energy deficient areas of the world. Although the full impact of solar energy probably wont occur until the turn of the century. the economic viability of several of the applications. e.g.. heating and cooling of buildings. wind electric power. and bloconversion to fuels could be developed and demonstrated in the next 5 years. Ultimately. practical solar energy systems could easily contribute 1530 per cent of the Nations energy requirements. The panel recommended a 5year funding program beginning in 1975 with $409 millionminimum viableto $1 .056 millionaccelerated-having a high probability of early success. By contrast the report of the chairman of the AEC to the President assigns the lowest priority to solar energysolar is ranked last out of 10 technologies consideredthe report recommended 5year R. & D. budget is less than onefifth that of the accelerated. orderly program and less than half the minimum viable program advocated by the solar energy panel of experts. Third. The December 1973 AEC report to the President on a national energy R. & D. program is overwhelmingly biased in favor of further development of nuclear energy and against the renewable energy sources. The report singles out nuclear fission for the largest share of the R. & D. pie24 percent as against 9 percent for solar geothermal combined and hydroelectric and nuclear fusion combined. The bias is even more pronounced in the short- and midrange R. & D. budget projections-$5.3 billion is recommended to achieve short and midterm objectives for nuclear fission as compared to $430 million for all renewable energy technologies. These huge sums recommended for nuclear fission R. & D. are all the more astounding in light of the fact that nuclear power plants are now in production in large numbers and the R. & D. phase at the program should have been passed long ago. This year the Senate passed by unanimous vote S. 1283. a 10year. $20 billion program to make the country selfsufficient in energy by 1985. The House is working on a companion measure and it appears certain that a comprehensive energy R. & D. program will be passed by the Congress in the next few months. Most importantly. this landmark legislation provides not a single cent for nuclear fission research and development. Indeed the House sponsors of the bill are relabeling it as the NonNuclear Energy Research and Development Act. It is simply incomprehensible that the Congress should pass this major legislation for the development of nonnuclear energy technologies and then turn over the management of the programs to the Atomic Energy Commission. The AEC has. over the years. developed a dogma regarding nuclear power that approaches a religious faith. And the more vocal critics have become in pointing out the inherent dangers of nuclear technology. the more entrenched and determined has the AEC bureaucracy become. And this intense commitment to the promotion of nuclear energy is paying off for its adherents: 44 nuclear power plants are on line now. Two hundred twentyfive are scheduled to be in operation in 10 years. 1.000 in 25 years. Out of a $2.2 billion fiscal year 1975 energy budget. nuclear power received the lions share-$1.5 billion. Now much of the AECs efforts is being directed to finding ways to bring nuclear plants into operation quicker. from 10 to 6 or 7 years. How can we possibly expect top AEC personnel who have devoted all of their lives to the promotion of nuclear power to reverse gears and to start pushing nonnuclear energy sources? They have not done so in the past. they have given no indication that they believe renewable energy technologies can play a significant role in this century in meeting our energy needs. their commitment to nuclear power is complete. Well. one of the answers being given is that S. 2744 as reported out by the Government Operations Committee would assure that ERDA would not be dominated by pronuclear people. even though the AEC would overwhelmingly dominate the new agency by its sheer manpower and personnel. What are these controls in the bill. and how effective can we expect them to be? First. section 2(b) states that: The Congress intends that no energy technology be given an unwarranted priority. Second. Section (102) (c) prescribes that: The President shall appoint the Adminisstrator from among individuals who. by reason of their training and experience are especially qualified to manage a full range of energy research and development programs. Third. a separate assistant administrator is established for solar. geothermal and advanced energy systems. Does anyone believe that these generalities will suffice to give nonnuclear technologies a fair shake in an agency dominated by nuclear proponents? What real protection do these sections of the bill provide? For example. who is to determine what constitutes an unwarranted priority for an energy technology? The technical competence for evaluating new possibilities will be in ERDA. and if that agency decides that solar or geothermal have only limited possibilities in the near and midterm. as they already have. who will gainsay them and provide for bigger R. & D. budgets than the agency wants? If ERDA does not undertake needed research in nonnuclear areas because of its preoccupation with nuclear power. who will correct the balance. OMB? The Appropriations Committees? The Legislative Committees? Maybe. But lets not count on it. With regard to the second point above. that is. the Administrator and Deputy Administrator specially qualified to manage a full range of energy research and development programs this has already been interpreted in Committee as not excluding any of the present members of the Atomic Energy Commission even though most of them are specially qualified to manage only one R. & D. program. the nuclear one. How seriously this amendment is being taken by the administration can be seen from the fact that the White House has already floated the name of one candidate for the job of ERDA Administrator. John Simpson. president of a Westinghouse Division involved in the design and production of nuclear reactors and one of the most outspoken advocates of nuclear power. Finally. the designation of an assistant administrator for Solar. Geothermal. and advanced energy systems. insures only that the funds allocated to his office will be spent on these technologies. It does nothing to insure that he receives a proper share of the total resources allocated to the agency. In an AEC dominated ERDA run by personnel who have already indicated their low opinion of solar and geothermal energy. the chances for the assistant administrator to get a fair share of the funds available to the agency will be poor indeed. Another effect of the amendment I have introduced is to keep the AECs military weapons program out of ERDA. Under the committee bill. a Military Applications Division is established in ERDA as a consequence of the transfer of most of the AEC functions to the new energy agency. The development of nuclear weapons has no place in a civilian R. & D. agency which has as its principal responsibility the development of energy technologies. All of the ERDA Administrators time and that of his immediate staff will be required to set up and run this new program aimed at solving the Nations energy needs. This is an allconsuming and an allimportant task. Why burden these people with the job of managing a military weapons program? My amendment would not prevent the utilization of AEC resources by ERDA for energy research. There is no doubt that the AEC. in its contractoroperated national laboratories and in its tens of thousands of professional contract employees. possesses a capability of inestimable value. For example. AEC contractors at Los Alamos Laboratory. at the Lawrence Lab in Berkeley. at the Livermore Lab at Aerojet Nuclear and elsewhere have an excellent potential for geothermal energy. R. & D. ERDA would be encouraged to contract with these organizations to undertake research efforts appropriate to their capability. Indeed. ERDA would be encouraged to seek out and utilize all available resources in the Federal Governmentincluding the National Aeronautics and Space Administration which is omitted in S. 2744government. in private industry. and in the great universities. to placing R. & D. contracts with those organizations best fitted to carry out the t sk of developing new energy technologies. To sum up the arguments for establishing ERDA as a nonnuclear energy R. & D. agency: First. The AEC will inevitably dominate ERDA by virtue of its overwhelming preponderance of manpower and budget. Second. The AEC has provided ample evidence of its intense bias in favor of nuclear power and against other forms of energy technology. Third. Putting the management of a major nonnuclear energy R. & D. act in the hands of an AECdominated ERDA and expecting these nonnuclear technologies to be aggressively promoted indicates a faith in the nuclear bureaucracy that passeth understanding. Fourth. The controls supposedly contained in the committee bill cannot be expected to prevent a pronuclear bias in the new agency. There is nothing in S. 2744 that provides real assurance that the ERDA management will promote nonnuclear energy technologies to their fullest potential."},{"1":"1975","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President.

The Federal Reserve System. or the Fed as it is commonly called. has an enormous influence on the shape and functioning of our economy. Its primary responsibility. under the Federal Reserve Act. is to control the growth of the money supply and thus set monetary policy. In addition. the Fed is responsible for administering an extensive and sophisticated check clearing system. regulating bank holding companies and supervising member banks. The Fed has also been assigned responsibilities by the Congress in the Employment Act of 1946. and in House Concurrent Resolution 133 for promoting economic growth. high employment. and stable prices. Mr. President. the performance of our economy is crucially dependent on how well or badly the Fed does its job. If the money supply grows too fast. we get inflation. if it grows too slowly. we get recession. And if the Fed switches suddenly from too fast to too slow. then we experience the phenomenon of recession in the midst of inflation that has haunted us in the past year. So Congress must do all it can to insure that the Federal Reserve System not only functions but functions well and in the interest of the Nation as a whole. The Fed is influential and also relatively autonomous. Deriving its authority from the constitutional power delegated to it by Congress to coin money and regulate the value thereof. the Fed operates outside of both the legislative and executive branches. This means it can actively promote or totally frustrate the economic policy goals set by Congress and the President. While it is vital that the Fed be able to exercise its independent judgment. there also needs to be sufficient congressional oversight to insure that the Fed is open and responsive to the complex problems and diverse currents of opinion present in our economy and our society. Without this openness and responsiveness. the Fed cannot perform its job effectively. The acute ills of inflation and recession which have plagued our economy in the last couple of years have brought the Federal Reserve into the spotlight and focussed attention on the actions of the Board of Governors. the Federal Open Market Committee. and 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks which comprise the systems policymaking bodies. Criticisms of the Fed abound. There are frequent charges that its policies are exacerbating the recession and responding more to political pressures than to the genuine needs of the economy. Tempers run high on both sides of the issue. Mr. President. the legislation I am introducing today will do a great deal to dampen this controversy and restore public confidence in the Federal Reserve. The amendments to the Federal Reserve Act contained in the bill will accomplish two major objectives. First. they will make the Fed more accountable to Congress and to the public. by strengthening congressional oversight of the System. This is done in two ways: by requiring Senate confirmation of nominations for Chairman of the Board of Governors and for Presidents of the various Reserve banks. and by limiting spending by the Board and Reserve banks for administrative and operating purposes to amounts approved by Congress in appropriations acts. Second. the bill will promote wider representation of interests on the Board and the expression of a broader diversity of opinion. It adds labor and consumer interests to the list of groups which are already supposed to be represented on the Board. that is. financial. agricultural. industrial and commercial interests. In addition. it authorizes members of the Board to appoint their own personal staff. so that each member will have the means to develop and present alternative independent views on monetary policy and regulatory issues. Mr. President. the reforms in the structure and functioning of the Federal Reserve System which I am proposing today are necessary changes to help the Fed adjust to 40 years of dramatic change in the economy and in its own operations. so that it can successfully promote maximum employment and stable prices in the years ahead. The proposed reforms also are a logical complement to the changes in the Feds monetary policy procedures made by Congress earlier this year in House Concurrent Resolution 133. which requires the Federal Reserve Board to consuit with the House and Senate Banking Committees twice yearly regarding targets for growth in monetary and credit aggregates in the upcoming 12 months. Let me describe my proposals in more detail."},{"1":"1976","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"It does take a considerable amount of line operating authority close to the head of the Office. I do not believe that that requires the program executive to report directly to the Commissioner of Education. for if every program that was thought to be important and needed to be coordinated across Office of Education lines reported directly to the Commissioner. the Commissioner would have an impossible job of administering his agency. What we are talking about here is judgment based on what the span of control should be for the Commissioner of Education. I am sure you would agree that too many people. and too many programs reporting to one executive really weakens the manner in which the program can be operated rather than strengthening it.

And when we sought answers to questions about the effects of oil pollution on fish and other life in the seas. knowledgeable scientists tell us that little is really known. There are differences of opinion and certainly nothing that can be called definitive. Therefore. in S. 682 we called for a comprehensive program of oceanI underline oceanpollution research and monitoring. Yet. Mr. President.

Ocean pollution research does. of course. relate to environmental research and to the public works jurisdictional mandate. Consequently. I believe. and I hope. this will be cleared up sooner or later before we run into this problem again. which will stop important bills over a jurisdictional argument: It does not make much difference whether the bill passes or not. we want our jurisdiction. I do not think we should be doing business that way here. and if there is some question about jurisdiction we should get it cleared up. I thought Senate Resolution 4 did. clear up the problem. I carefully looked at the hearings on it and the testimony we gave. but apparently there are a lot of people around here who want to look around and grab more jurisdiction. We do not get good legislation passed that way. Senators know who I am talking about. too. I do not like to have a contest between. for instance. the Senator from Maine and myself over who has some jurisdiction because it ends up being some kind of contest between who has the most influence on Senators. and it will end up putting us between some staffs that maybe sometimes make mistakes.

USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. U.S. Department of Agriculture. Washington. D.C. DEAR MR. MULHERN: This correspondence is in reference to Federal Register Volume 42. number 247 and dated December 23. 1977 concerning the sale of sows and boars. We are unaware that an emergency swine brucellosis situation exists. This would seem the only justification for the drastic procedures indicated by this regulation. The program has been introduced on two other occasions in 1974 and 1975. In both instances the participating parties were notified. hearihgs were held and the programs were dropped with just cause. In this instance participating parties were not given the opportunity of a hearing and most stockyards were not even notified of the filing of the regulation until February 21. 1978. and then we were notified only by our own state departments of agriculture. The types of swine involved are highly excitable and are prone to heart failure and heat death with even minimum handling in unfamiliar surroundings. Under normal conditions we presently have death losses in these classes. With weather temperatures varying from a low of 50 degrees to highs of 108 degrees in the South. we can expect heavy losses in the maximum handling in unfamiliar surroundings that will be necessary in order to mark the swine. Sows and boars are extremely dangerous to handle and employees are highly reluctant to risk their safety in having to closely handle these animals. A local yard worker was bitten while handling these type hogs and subsequently his leg was amputated three times. The costs to volume stockyards would be excessive. Throughout the process of unloading. separating. tagging and penning of swine all for tatoolng. and in addition to the regular process of grading. weighing and selling swine through the auction ring and again repenning them. the animals would be handled at great lengths. This will cause undue delay in the normal operation of processing.all other swine at a substantial loss of time and added labor costs on the yard. There is also the probable loss of life in highlybred meat type hogs who have an extremely nervous temperament. It would require two to three additional men to process the sows and boars for handling. marking and doing on the spot bookwork. It would also require additional office procedures and bookwork. All this would be expensive for the stockyards to absorb in addition to probable death losses. We would suggest that should the U.S.D.A. desire a sustained observation of the swine brucellosis situation. the department would consider the alternative method of on the farm spotchecking. The animals will be more easily handled in their familiar surroundings and will be less nervous.. Checking at the point of origin would also resolve the situation whereby the swine may be traded several times by hog traders before reaching a kill plant. This also brings up the fact that tatoo marks will be eliminated when these animals are skinned as ninety percent are in killing plants. In the use of ear tags on lighter weight hogs. these tags will be destroyed by the dehairing process used in butchering this size hog. We hold great respect for the progress made by the U.S.D.A. and our state departments of agriculture in the emergency situations with swine cholera and cattle brucellosis. The Georgia Commissioner has been highly complimentary of our state yards cooperation and support in these programs. We were aware of the urgency of this situation and we voluntarily absorbed the handling costs of these programs. However. we feel there is a limit. We do not have a state of emergency in swine brucellosis that warrants this action and we are reluctant to enter this dangerous and costly program at this time. As President Carter has implied. committees never seem to dieout. they just keep growing. We can even visualize this program expanding to include marking of all swine in interstate shipment and the prospect is frightening. As a last resort. should we be forced into compliance with this regulation. we request the following: That the federal government assume and appropriate sufficient funds to handle swine mark costs and to cover the cost of death indemnity of same to stockyards or dealers. Further. should federal funds become unavailable. the program should be dismissed immediately. As representative of the Georgia Stockyard Operators Association. Inc.. I respectfully submit this letter for your consideration and immediate action of delay of implementation of the abovementioned regulation for hearings. or complete dismissal of the regulation. Yours very truly."},{"1":"1979","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"If IDCA is created. I would watch its growth with interest so it does not grow as some of these agencies have. I would now like to quote from the testimony of Elmer Staats. Comptroller General of the United States. before the Committee on Governmental Affairs. Mr. Staats stated that: The creation of IDCA in itself will do little to i..crease the focus upon interprogram coordination. One approach to this problem would be to develop sectoral policy papers designed to provide guidance for both U.S. bilateral programs and U.S. participation in multilateral programs. He concludes this particular comment by saying: Developing such papers and strengthening the multiyear country papers will require more staff effort and. therefore. does potentially. run afoul of the Presidents decision to reorganize within existing personnel ceilings. So. what we are doing is creating more overhead instead of expanding and improving expertise. Since we are not creating additional positions. we must be taking these people out of productive jobs. perhaps decisionmaking jobs. in which they are presently engaged. In the letter of the Secretary of State. which was read by my distinguished colleague . the Secretary does reference the congressional mandate for IDCA. I remember very distinctly that there was no such specific mandate by Congress. One assertion which is made by proponents of the IDCA is that the reorganization is a direct response to a congressional mandate contained in legislation proposing that the President create this agency. Mr. President. the International Development and Food Assistance Act of 1978 calls for a strengthened system of coordination. but makes no mention of a new agency. That is what it said. a strengthened system of coordination. It did not say anything that I could find anyplace about creating a whole new agency. The language in the accompanying conference report suggests that the President consider establishing an International Development Cooperation Administration. and I would assume that this is the mandate we hear about. However. the conference report goes into more detail about what this IDCA should be. and I suggest the plan before us falls very short of the mark: First. the 1DCA suggested in the conference report was to supersede the Agency for International Development. We are not superseding it at all. We are keeping it intact. We are just borrowing a few people. putting them upstairs in other professional categories. but leaving the Agency for International Development intact. Supersede means to take the place of. to replace. to succeed. Now. if we were talking about that kind of reorganization plan. then we would possibly have something substantive. The administrations plan simply places another layer on top of AIDAID continues to exist in a very recognizable form. Second. the IDCA suggested in the conference report was to have within its organizational framework the maximum possible range of U.S. Government agencies and programs related to international development. It is my contention that the IDCA has only a lopsided group of agencies and programs under its wing. and that it is far from the reorganization suggested by the authors of the conference report. I think we have to draw the line between what can be justified as even a step in the right direction. and what Is simply not worth the trouble. I have to put this reorganization proposal in the latter category. I must put it in the latter category. It just falls very short of the mark. Let us not approve this plan just for the sake of appearing to do something. In the Secretary of States letter. It is also indicated that. IDCA will improve coordination among all our foreign development activities. No single agency currently in charge. The proponents of the IDCA have claimed the administration has claimed. that it will bring greatly improved coordination among our bilateral and multilateral development assistance programs and U.N. developmentrelated activities. They also make the point that no single Federal agency is now in charge of all these activities. I would point out to my colleagues that an organizational framework already exists for this purposethe Development Coordination Committee. or DCC. established by legislation just a few years ago. It is very difficult to see how a staff of 30 professionals. mostly transferred from AID. will be able to make -a significant new contribution. The DCC is an Interagency coordinating body. The Departments of State. Treasury. Commerce. Agriculture. and Labor. plus the Executive Office of the President. ExportImport Bank. OPIC. and the Speial Trade Representative are all represented on the DCC. IDCA itself would be composed of few components. It would only have real authority over AID. Both OPIC and the Institute for Scientific and Technological Cooperation. if it is created. would be virtually autonomous. As a result. IDCA would. in reality. be a super AID. In March of last year the President strengthened and expanded the DCC. chaired by the AID Administrator. who also chairs the OPIC board. In addition. the Chairman of the DCC was given the following responsibilities: Serve as chief adviser to the President and the Secretary of State on development policy. Serve as chief spokesperson for development aid before Congress. Prepare an annual development policy statement providing overall policy guidance for each component of the AID program. Advise State Department on the policies and proposed budgets for all U.N. developmentrelated activities. Generally speaking. the responsibilities of the IDCA Director will simply be transferred from another administration official who heads an organization which already exists to coordinate U.S. development activities. It seems logical that any strengthening of and changes in the coordination system could just as easily be accomplished within the existing organizational structure. and does not require the formation of a new agency. Finally. Mr. President. IDCA will bring boxshuffling but no fundamental change in philosophy or operations. It will be perceived abroad as business as usual. Bruce Stokes of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington has chgrged that the proposed IDCA will make little substantive difference abroad. He points out that the reorganization has failed to bring what he feels is a necessary change: some shift away from highly centralized programs toward communitvlevel efforts to encourage selfreliance. In a Christian Science Monitor article. Stokes makes some very important points which should be considered by everyone who is seriously interested in constructivenot cosmeticchange: Despite the pro forma rhetoric about the value of a more efficient management of international assistance. the administrations reorganization plans could turn out to be no more than a case of musical chairs at AID . .. Without a shift in foreign aid philosophy toward greater support for selfhelp and local problemsolving. the proposed International Development Cooperation Administration may Icok better in Washingtonbut it will look like more of the same old thing in Africa. Asia. and Latin America. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of Mr. Stokes article be printed in the RECORD at this point."},{"1":"1980","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I support the passage of H.R. 5164. in the form unanimously reported by the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee on March 19. 1980. The bill is designed to clarify and improve inspection and manning laws applicable to small commercial vessels. primarily those serving the offshoresupply industry. Due to excessive manning and licensing requirements of existing laws which were drafted long ago for large oceangoing vessels. there is a severe shortage of personnel on these small vessels. The rigorous length of service and manning levels required for deep sea vessels engaged in foreign commerce are not necessary for safety on small vessels that primarily serve offshore rigs less than 50 miles from the coast. The bill modifies the minimal requirements for licensed officers. engineers. and able seamen to make them in line with the particular vessels type of service. For example. law now requires all seamen to have 3 years sea service before they may be rated as ablebodied seamen. The bill modifies that requirement to 18 months or 12 months. and. as originally enacted by the committee. to 6 months for vessels of less than 500 gross tons engaged in support of offshore mineral or energy exploration or production. Under current law. some 3.000 small vessels are required to be inspected by the Coast Guard and others are not. largely depending on the legal fiction of whether or not they are for hire. that is. serving as common carriers. H.R. 5164 brings all small commercial vessels over 15 gross tons under Coast Guard inspection. but again the inspections standards are to take into consideration the characteristics of the vessels. their method of operations. and the service in which they engage. Unless the Coast Guard determines it would be unsafe. existing vessels and personnel would be given a temporary grandfathering until they can be brought into compliance with the new standards. This bill is supported strongly by the Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board. two organizations specifically charged with overseeing marine safety. Under pressure from maritime labor. the chairman has agreed to delete the second sentence of section 13(b) (3) as originally reported out by the committee on March 19. As the chairman of the full committee. the gentleman from New York . stated in his additional views in the report on H.R. 5164. he felt the 6month service of ablebodied seamen on offshore oil supply vessels to be inimical to the progressive positions pursued by organized labor. In the chairmans view. They established an ominous precedent. I do not believe very many Memvers share this view. and I believe we could obtain the necessary twothirds vote on the original bill. The desire of organized maritime labor to preserve the ancient practice of featherbedding has twice been defeated in the full House. in recent years. I suppose that we should not abandon 261/2 pages of a good billone that at long last reforms an antiquated law over 100 years oldin order to insist on one sentence. however meritorious. I regret. however. that maritime labor still feels it can muster onethird of the House merely by sounding the alarm. I suspect that even if the maritime unions pulled out all the stops and brought maximum pressure to bear on the House. we would still be able to get a twothirds majority in favor of suspending the rules and passing this bill as originally reported by the committee. The full Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. not exactly an enemy of maritime unions. was able to agree by much more than a twothirds majority after hearing the evidence on both sides of this issue. I think the full House would do likewise. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the remainder of my time."},{"1":"1981","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. as chairman of the Subcommittee on Interna- tional Finance and Monetary Policy oJ the Senate Banking Committee. I am pleased to announce that there will be hearings on S. 144. the Export Trading Company Act of 1981. on February 11 and 18. 1981. in room 5302 Dirksen Senate Office Building. beginning at 9:30 a.m. This bill to promote the formation of export trading companies is the same. with only minor changes. as S. 2718. which passed the Senate last September 3 by a vote of 77 to 0. S. 144 presently has 55 cosponsors. The Export Trading Company Act is the product of nearly 3 years of concerted effort by the subcommittee. chaired by former Senator Adlai Stevenson. which has held hearings including witnesses from virtually every segment of our economy. from academia. from business people. from labor and consumers. from exporters and importers. Witnesses for the new set of hearings will include representatives of the administration. the Federal Reserve Board. the business and financial communities. and other expert witnesses. It is my belief that this bill can substantially and permanently expand U.S. exports. particularly by small and mediumsized firms that are presently not involved in exporting. The legislation would revise Government policies which have tended to discourage formation of U.S. export trading companies in the past. It aims at long term improvement in Americas trade posture through improved export intermediation by private American export traders. Witnesses testifying at the hearing or submitting statements should direct their comments to the issues raised by S. 144. including but not limited to: The necessity for bank participation in trading companies. The circumstances under which banks should be permitted control of trading companies. and what safeguards. if any. are necessary over that control. Whether an antitrust immunity is necessary to encourage the formation of export trading companies. and The method by which the antitrust immunity is to attach to the formation of export trading companies. Witnesses should also comment on how the various sections of S. 144 resolve the above issues and whether. if the legislation were enacted. the financial provisions of the bill are adequate to successfully implement it. Any questions regarding this hearing should be directed to Dr. Paul Freedenberg. counsel to the subcommittee. 5300 Dirksen Senate Office Building. Washington.

I rise today in opposition to the labor protection provisions contained in the August 12. 1.982 COT conference report to H.R. 5930. the war risk insurance bill. Under these provisions. airlines engaging in a merger. acquisition or sale of as little as 20 percent of their assets would be required to pay demoted employees the difference in their salaries for up to 4 years. and furloughed employees up to 60 percent of their salaries for 5 years. Moreover. these provisions would virtually require the appropriate regulatory agency to impose equivalent sanctions in the event of a mere transfer of routes. Mr. President. these provisions appear to me to be special interest legislation at its very worst. While I would oppose mandating such labor protection provisions in almost any industry. I believe they are particularly inappropriate for the airline industry. Airline employees are among the most highly paid workers in our Nation. In 1981. the average annual compensation for pilots approached $100.000. The average annual compensation industrywide exceeded $35.000. Yet these are the workers who will be accorded protections virtually unknown in any other industry. if we enact these provisions. To make matters worse. these provisions were adopted by the conferees on this bill without hearings in either House of Congress as to their necessity or probable impact on the industry. The airline industry is already reeling from everincreasing fuel costs. decreased ridership. and flight cutbacks in profitable routes resulting from the illegal PATCO strike. Merger or acquisition may in many cases prove to be the only salvation from bankruptcy. These provisions. however. could very well have the effect of extinguishing this last ray of hope. leaving employees in even worse shape than they would have been without them. Another matter that concerns me greatly as chairman of the Judiciary Committee is that the conference amendment provides Federal question jurisdiction over any controversy arising out of the application of these illconceived provisions. Federal courts are now straining under unbearable caseloads attributable in large measure to the expansive grants of Federal jurisdiction Congress has made over the past decade. This amendment can do nothing else but increase this caseload. and without any inquiry even as to the propriety of Federal jurisdiction in these matters. much less as to its necessity. Mr. President. the labor protection provisions included in this bill are matters at which we should look long and hardnot adopt without any inquiry or inspection. I call on my colleagues to sustain the ruling of the Chair."},{"1":"1983","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the Wirth amendment. A great deal of attention has been focused throughout the past year on the problems at the Environmental Protection Agency and indeed. there have been many issues raised during the course of our debates in congressional hearings. There has been talk about mismanagement that occurred and indeed. I think that was the case. There has been talk about abuse by generators of hazardous wastes. There has been talk about the fortunes that have been expended to clean up. There have been charges of sweetheart deals and indeed. political manipulations. But very. very little attention has been given to the question of enforcement and prevention. It is in these areas where we must make greater efforts and where EPA must have adequate funding. The amendment. we are considering are a step in this direction. Allow me to give just a few examples of what it has cost this country because inadequate funding has been allocated to enforcement and prevention. We all know about Love Canal. It has received a great deal of publicity over the years. It would have cost. by some estimates. less than $2 million in 1979 dollars to prevent that occurrence. Right now. there has been over $36 million spent so far at Love Canal and the estimates for remedial and cleanup work alone run over $100 million. Hopewell. Va. The Life Sciences Plant in Hopewell could have safely produced kepone at a cost of about $200.000. To date. the cleanup costs total about $12 million and are still going up. Stringfellow in California. the acid pits. The likely costs for proper treatment would have amounted to about 20 cents per gallon or about $6 million. They are now estimating the cleanup costs between $40 and $60 million. a remedial cost 10 times as great as the cost of prevention. Times Beach. Mo.. one that has been in the media a lot lately. It would have cost that generator less than $100.000 to legally dispose of the dioxin at that plant. We know they spent over $30 million in a buyout. Now we are told the total cost of cleanup at Times Beach will be in excess of $100 million. I could go on and on with comparison figures of what it would cost to legally dispose of toxic and hazardous substances and what it is going to cost today and in the future. I want to emphasize that none of those figures take into consideration the medical costs. the personal property costs. and if we want to talk in the most dramatic of terms. the number of lives that have been and are going to be lost in the future. Are we going to sit back and say that we have budgetary restraints and we are going to permit a cut from 1981 to today of 45 percent. as the administration would request. or of 31 percent as the committee bill mandates in the areas of abatement control and compliance? Is there any Member of Congress who is willing to say hat the fiscal year 1981 figures. which this amendment still does not fully restore. were enough to do the job? I doubt that very much. I share the views of the previous speakers that we have a new Administrator in there who is very competent and capable to do the job. However. Mr. Chairman. if we do not give him the funds to do that job. then we cannot expect the results that we have been demanding for the last couple of years."},{"1":"1984","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I was one of those privileged to serve on the House Education and Labor Subcommittee with jurisdiction over this particular bill. When it first came before our subcommittee I thought this was one of the better intentioned. but more improperly guided missiles we had seen in this Congress. It was trying to help the cause of education in this country by establishing a pilot project that could last 8 or 9 years. giving out 10.000 scholarships each year. It was going to give those scholarships to the best qualified students academically among our high schools to receive a year of free college education if they would take 2 years in teaching. Well. one could quickly figure. if these people had any of the brains that we hoped they would. by earning these scholarships they would quickly receive 4 years of free academic training. and they would have an 8year obligation in the school as a teacher. But as soon as their 8 years were up. they would go into the private sector and earn more money. So. I thought that it was a nice idea. but it simply is not going to solve the problem we have in getting the best people in our country into the teaching field and keeping them. Clearly. pay is the issue. I think. and we must continue to focus on it as the primary concern. If you want good people to get into teaching and to stay there. we are going to have to raise the pay for our teachers across this country. But. through the strenuous efforts. diligence. and commitment of the gentleman from Oregon. the sponsor of the bill. and others. we were able to sit down and work out some concerns about this bill. We were able to come up with some various amendments that I think much better direct the bill toward the problem of teacher shortages. On the one hand. we were able to target the scholarships. On the other hand. we were able to make sure that it truly was a pilot project. that it was not a 9year experiment. My first amendment. adopted in the committee. was to require that the State educational agencies would determine the needs for teachers in their particular State. In some States it is math and science. But if you look at some statistics. they will tell you in the early 1990s the critical teacher shortage is going to be at elementary level. The bill as amended allows each State to determine exactly what their teaching needs are going to be and to use the Carl Perkins scholarships to provide an incentive to get the best young people we have in those disciplines most in need. My second amendment. agreed to by the committee. and the gentleman from Oregon. was to put a limit of 10.000 scholarships totally over the duration of the program. not 10.000 a year where we would have up to 40.000 scholarships out at one time and that we would have an expenditure of probably around $700 million for the scholarship program alone.

Mr. Chairman. a budget is in fact a compilation of numbers that reflect philosophy. economics. but it also is people and faces. The HumphreyHawkins part of this debate is designed to focus not simply on numbers or economic or philosophical posturing but what it is that we are doing to the people who comprise this Nation. In my part of northeastern Ohio. a part that I share with my colleague from Ohio [Mr. TRiFICANTI. we have not yet shared in the blessings of whatever this national recovery is. In fact. In Mr. TRAFICANTs district and mine we are fully 1V2 times higher than the national level of unemployment in northeastern Ohio. And in one county.

Legislation that is part of this budget. from displaced workers to Mr. HAwKINs Community Renewal Employment Act. to requirements of educational opportunities for senior workers. in effect a job bill of rights. are important and must be important components of this budget today. To focus on numbers alone denies to us the true opportunity to do what a budget is supposed to do. that is. help people and set priorities for this Nation.

Displaced. out of work. that is a fancy term for being unemployed with no job for over 3 years. Sixty percent of them are reemployed but at a substantially lower rate.

Mr. Chairman. they have not gone into a black hole. they have not become part of some number somewhere. They are searching. they are scratching. they are hoping and waiting for a budget from this House and from this deliberative body that is more reflective of their needs. We talk a lot about defense. Mr. Chairman. but I submit to you that you will never have a firstrate military with a thirdrate economy. My constituents do not want a dole. They want the dignity of a Job.

I believe. the Nation as a whole."},{"1":"1986","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I am pleased to support the conference report to accompany H.R. 4421. the Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1986. This bill continues several very important education and community service programs for 4 more years. I want to commend the chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. Senator HATCH. for his work and especially the gentlewoman from Florida. Senator HAWKINS. the chair of the Subcommittee on Children. Family. Drugs. and Alcoholism. who has really seen this initiative through and has worked very hard on the legislation. Senator HAWKINS has spent many hours on this bill. and I know hgw personally committed she is to ensuring the best possible programs in these areas. Contaifed in H.R. 4421 is one of the Nations most popular and successful programs. the Head Start Program. For years. this Federal program has helped lowincome and disadvantaged 3-. 4-. and 5yearold children receive the strong education foundation that they need to succeed in later school life. Head Start allows caring professionals to provide personal attention to children to build a strong base educational skills as well as in the value and importance of education. in selfconfidence. in social skills. and in areas of health and nutrition. Head Start also works to bring the family of the child into the educational process. and uses many parents as volunteers and teachers aides in the classrooms to reinforce the concept that parents must take an active part in their childrens education if the children are to be successful. The Head Start Program has worked well. and many studies show the benefits of early childhood education. Because the program has worked so well. and is flexible enough to allow communities to design the programs that best fit their needs. H.R. 4421 makes very few changes to the act. One change that is made is to require more coordination between Head Start programs and other education or community projects that the State or locality may be conducting to help disadvangaged youngsters. H.R. 4421 also reauthorizes the Follow Through Program for 4 more years. the Community Services Block Grant for 4 more years. the Dependent Care Program for 3 more years. and the LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP] for 4 more years. All of these programs provide important services to needy families and children through schools or community based organizations. The LowIncome Home Energy Assistance Program has been a crucial program to Indiana. and many thousands of elderly and lowincome families depend on this energy assistance to see them through the winter months. Project SAFE. as the Indiana program is called. has served 151.271 households in the 1986 program year. I am somewhat concerned about the authorization level for this program being reduced based on the reports that energy costs have decreased. While it is true that energy costs have decreased. many of these decreased prices are not passed onto the consumer. but are only passed on to business and industry. and those large enough to avail themselves of direct access to pipelines. I will. therefore. be watching carefully the LIHEAP Program in Indiana to ensure that the needs of Indiana residents are being adequately met. Another area of interest in the Senate version of the Human Services Reauthorization Amendments of 1986 had been my proposal to make changes to the Fair Labor Standards Act to permit 14- and 15yearolds to serve as batboys or batgirls during baseball games with certain restrictions. This provision is not contained in the final version of H.R. 4421. however. a new provision is added to require the Secretary of Labor to issue a report on whether a change in the permissible hours of employment for batboys and girls would be detrimental to their wellbeing and whether such a change should be proposed. I am disappointed that the conferees did not agree to include my original amendment. but I look forward to receiving the report of the Secretary of Labor. which I hope will be timely. reasoned. and complete. Additionally. I have written to the Secretary of Labor regarding this important study and will ask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter be printed in the RECORD following my statement. Again. Mr. President. I am pleased to support the conference report to accompany H.R. 4421. The Head Start Program is one that we are all proud of and anxious to have reauthorized. so that the good works can be continued. I urge my colleagues to support this conference report. I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I referred be printed in the RECORD."},{"1":"1987","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. I rise today in support of annex V of the MARPOL Treaty. This treaty is essential in that it will ban the dumping of plastics and other garbage into the ocean by ships. The dumping of plastics into our oceans has reached epidemic proportions. Recent studies indicate that each year approximately 640.000 plastic containers are dumped into the ocean by the worlds shipping fleet and approximately 52 million pounds of plastic packaging material and 298 million pounds of synthetic fishing gear. including nets. lines and buoys are discarded by fishing vessels. Over the past few years. our beaches and coastlines have been bombarded with the plastics and other garbage thoughtlessly tossed overboard by marine vessels. On October 10 of this year. the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation organized a group of volunteers to scour four of New Yorks beaches. - The amount of garbage recovered by these volunteers was astounding. At Breezy Point Beach in Queens alone. over 4.000 separate items. or 1 ton of garbage. was collected. 90 percent of this garbage was plastics. The items included: 600 small plastic juice containers. untold quantities of plastic stirrers. hundreds of styrofoam cups. 18 automobile tires and countless quantities of automotive products containersan unsavory beachcombers take. if a hefty one. Mr. President. how can we allow our children to swim in waters that are brimming with garbage? The dangers posed to humans and marine life are immense. Ships are damaged by plastic sheets picked up in water intakes and from ropes and nets that foul propellers. This problem is worldwide in scope. Ratification of this treaty by at least 25 countries would virtually eliminate this desecration of our precious. and all to fragile. oceans. This international agreement would become effective 1 year after at least 25 nations representing 50 percent of the worlds shipping tonnage ratify it. The United States accounts for about 4 percent of the worlds shipping tonnage. Twentyseven countries. representing 45 percent of the worlds shipping tonnage. have already ratified the treaty. U.S. ratification would increase the tonnage to 49 percent. Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to ratify this treaty. Cleaner and safer waters. and beaches we and our children can safely enjoy. will benefit us all. Thank you. Mr. President."},{"1":"1988","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I rise to indicate my strong support for the amendment by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. Senator BRADLEYS amendment would delete the provision in the bill which conditions the purchase of the Aegis system by Japan to their purchasing the ships on which the system would be installed. In an ideal world. it is preferable that Japan purchase the ships as well as the naval battle management systemAegisand related technology from the United States. The cold truth before us. however. is that the Japanese will not buy the ships or the battle management system from us under the sales conditions now in the bill. They will purchase none of this from us. They will look elsewhere. If we fail to approve this amendment. we will not only fail to sell the ships to Japan. we will also fail to sell the Aegis system as well. In the end. we will lose a potential multibillion dollar sale. deny this country some 5.400 manyears in our labor market. and legislate away an opportunity to help keep our defense industrial mobilization base warm and ready. These are all direct and clear benefits to the United States from this sale and we should be guided in our deliberation by what is in our best interests. The most important consideration. however. is not the jobs. not the revenue that would be generated through our exports and not even the fact that we would be missing a chance to help maintain our defense production base through foreign military sales. The most important considerations are strategic. We have to ask ourselves if we are prepared to assist the Japanese perform the naval defense role we urged them to take. a role which is in our security interest and one which responds to our request that they assume a greater defense burden. The sale of the Aegis system and of the ships will enable the Japanese to perform their maritime role with effectiveness. This is in our national interest. If we compel them to purchase similar naval vessels elsewhere to perform this defense role. they will not be able to perform their naval role with as much effectiveness as they would if they made the purchase from the United States. We would be retreating from our requests that they assume a greater share of the defense burden in the Western Pacific. We would be lessening their ability to play an enhanced martime role in that part of the world. Mr. President. this sale makes good sense strategically. it makes good sense economically. it makes good sense commercially. it makes good sense for our own Armed Forces. and it makes good sense to support an ally. a friend and a fellow democracy. It doesnt make good sense to bluff Japan into buying our ships. however desirable that may be. They simply wont do it. We dont live in an ideal world where we are the only country able to produce and willing to sell sophisticated technology abroad. Others will do it and the advantages that we stand to gain from this sale will be lost and gained by someone else. The arguments in favor of this sale and in favor the Bradley amendment are compelling and. in my judgment. selfevident. I support the Bradley amendment and hope it is agreed to by a strong vote."},{"1":"1989","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. I am pleased today to join Senator WxrTH In cosponsoring a resolution designating January 19. 1990 as National Ski Day. It has been my policy throughout my service in the Senate to encourage economic development in an environmentally responsible way. This day will help citizens foster appreciation and respect for the outdoors and. at the same time. afford economic growth in the many ski regions throughout this country. Skiing is a vital part of recreation and tourism in my States economy as well as the economies of many other States. Nationally. ski areas bring in over $1.6 billion a year. In Utah alone. the ski industry employs an estimated 6.000 workers in manufacturing. distribution. and resort positions. Utahs ski resorts have evolved into yearround mountain resorts providing both winter and summer activities. Skiing in Utah brings in over $360 million. and over $27 million in combined State and local tax receipts. Of the 2.5 million lift tickets sold in Utah. over 53 percent are sold to outofState skiers while 47 percent of the lift tickets are purchased by Utah residents. In a family oriented State like Utah. skiing is excellent recreation for the entire family. Utahns are extremely fortunate to have seven world class resorts within 30 minutes of downtown Salt Lake City. Skiing has had a positive effect on our canyons by increasing both recreational value and commercial use of the national forests. providing employment opportunities and economic development. and creating an appreciation for the beauties of nature. In fact. because of the lack of humidity in our desert climate. Utahs snow is light. dry. and plentiful. That is why Utahs license plates claim ours as The Greatest Snow on Earth. This resolution is good for the vitality of America. No sport can so clear the senses and invigorate the body. as can skiing.

I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 216 offered by the gentleman from Connecticut . The Tariff Act of 1930 states clearly thatAll goods. wares articles. and merchandise mined. produced. or manufactured wholly or in part in any foreign country by convict labor and/or forced labor * * * shall not be entitled to entry at any of the ports of the United States. Notwithstanding United States law and assurances to President Bush that goods made with forced labor are strictly for domestic markets. China continues to openly and cavalierly export prisonermade goods. Many of my colleagues may have watched the NBC news segment last Thursday which provided more evidence of Chinas gross violation of United States trade law and internationally recognized human rights standards. Last week at a trade fair in San Francisco. Chinese businessmen. calculators at the ready. were eager to do business. Among goods available for export were products made at plants in Laiyang. Talan. and Dezhous. all listed in official Chinese documents obtained by Asia Watch as being labor reform enterprises. If any of my colleagues are hesitant about these Internal documents. take a look at the brochure which was being distributed at the trade fair. The page devoted to Dezhou Shengjian Machinery Plant has a picture of the plantguardtowers and all. Another advertisement for the Shandong Laiyang Heavyduty Machinery Factory includes a photograph of the factory gatAs where the Chinese characters for labor reform are visible. Congressman SMITH and I saw the Chinese prison labor system at work when I visited Beijing Prison No. 1 earlier this year. After offldais refused to let us visit imprisoned prodemocracy demonstrators. we toured the prison and watched Inmates making goods which likely were intended for Western markets. While I appreciate the administrations stepping up efforts to stem the stream of prisonermade goods entering United States ports. it Is time for the United States Government to enforce its laws and make it clear to the Chinese and any other country producing goods with forced labor. that these goods will not be permitted in the United States. Should we stand by as consumers. unknowingly contributing to the oppression of Chinese citizens imprisoned for professing their religious faith. or who crusaded for democracy In 1989? Should we stand by as American companies and labor unions competing with foreign exports made with little or no labor costs? The reply from this Congress should be a resounding no. Every elfort should be taken to end these abuses. Secretary Bakers trip to China has resulted in few concessions by the Chinese on human rights. In fact. Chinas Immediate reaction to Mr. Bakers demands was the detainment of two prominent dissidents. Timidity and weakhearted responses will not be enough.

I am pleased to rise in strong support of this resolution which designates August 1. 1992. as Helsinki Human Rights Day. The signing of the Helsinki accords on August 1. 1975. marked the start of a dynamic process which has led to historic changes in Europe over these past few years. When the leaders of 35 countries met in Helsinki to sign the Final Act of the CSCE. tensions between East and West were strong and cooperation between the two sides on matters relating to human rights and the rule of law was virtually nonexistent. Now. 17 years later. the countries of Eastern Europe are free. the Soviet Union has collapsed and democracy and peaceful change through free and fair elections Is taking root through the region. The CSCE process deserves credit for its role In bringing about a common commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms across Europe. Although the cold war Is over. the work of the CSCE Is not over. It can now play a critical role in helping to address the issues facing postcold war Europe. such as the tensions over nationality which have arisen most notably in Yugoslavia and in newly independent countries of the CIS. The CSCE can also develop its role to ensure the full implementation of human rights guarantees In each of the 52member countries. The task of the Helsinki process should now be to make irreversible the democratic advancements that have been made in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and to consolidate mechanisms for preventing conflict and preserving peace throughout Europe. Because the CSCE process has been such a useful forum to monitor international compliance to the Helsinki accords. I believe that model of the Helsinki Commission should be applied to other International agreements. For this reason. I have recently Introduced legislation to create a Rio Commission. The Rio Commission would oversee progress toward the policy goals produced at the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development [UNCED in Rio de Janeiro In June. Uke the Helsinki Commission. the Rio Commission would be composed of Members of Congress and the executive branch and would keep track of how the United States and UNCED conferees are implementing the commitments they made at the Earth summit to achieve environmental protection and sustainable development. It is my hope that by establishing a Rio Commission. we will make as much progress on Earth summit goals as we have made on the commitments that were included in the Helsinki accords.

Senator HOLLINGS. I would like to ask certain questions. Unfortunately. Senator MOYNIHAN has had to leave the floor. There may be others on the floor who could answer these questions. Some of my concerns were best highlighted by the excellent remarks and presentation made by the President pro tempore of the Senate. our distinguished colleague from West Virginia. Senator BYRD. I want to compliment him on his usual excellent presentation. He went right to the heart of the problem. I have not made up my mind for sure how I am going to vote on several of the votes that are going to take place. But I do want to compliment him for bringing up one of the many concerns that I have about the new World Trade Organization that we are going to be asked to vote on. and certainly aside from everything else a key vote obviously will be a vote on the waiver of the budget requirement that he properly within his rights brought up. with regard to the breaking of the budget on the approval. if that Is what the Senate body as a whole is to do. I would like. though. to ask Senator BYRD about some of the testimony that was receivedand I have a record of it herein the Commerce Committee. initiated by Senator HOLLINGS. and of which I was pleased to be a part. There were several questions of the balanced panels that were brought before that committee for the pros and cons on the matter. I. too. asked several questions of several witnesses over and over again on a whole series of matters. and I came to the conclusion that was so well brought out by Senator BYRD in talking about the figleaf that has been advanced with regard to if we do not like what we are into with this. we can relatively easily get out. In fact. we made it so easy that we have set up a meaningless panel to help us get out. and the panel absolutely would do nothing. I saw in the Washington Post this morning a story. and there was a statement in the story that was not attributed to anybody. just a reporters view. where it said Senator DOLE had worked out an arrangement whereby we could pull out of the treaty. Well. the arrangement that has been worked out has already been in the treaty. or the agreement. whatever you wish to call it. I simply point out that when the matter was sent over by the administration. there was a provision that is in the treaty that any nation. within 6 months notice. can withdraw from the treaty. So I think that the figleaf or window dressingcall it what you wishis not something that anybody can stand behind by saying the sovereignty issue has therefore been settled. it is over and done with. there is no problem. It is phony and it should not be given any serious consideration. But I recognize if somebody wants an excuse. at least it is an excuse but not a very good one. One of the things that I think the Senator from West Virginia did not bring up that I would like to mention. in the testimonyand I may be getting into this a little further. and maybe the chairman of the Commerce Committee will alsotime and time again. witnesses. when pressed on the situation as to how do we get out--I think the bottom line of summation of what we heard was you are not going to get out. Once you are in. you are in. So either now you make the decision as to whether you think it is right that you go in and. if so. right or wrong. we are in. If we do not go in. we do not have to worry about getting out. I think we should not finesse that. I think we should lay it right out on the line. One of the other things I think aboutlet us assume that 3 or 4 years from now. after all of these procedures. after we go through the song and dance of having retired Federal Judges making determinations and recommendations. and say that was sent to the floor of the U.S. Senate and it was passed to pull out. then it could be vetoed by the President. as Senator BYRD has very well pointed out. And then we would have to override the veto. Even if all of that were to be done. can you imagine the dilemma we would be in as a nation? Could you imagine the hue and cry of the many corporate giants in the United States and not so large corporate giants that know full well that they are going to foreign countries to make substantial investments that they would hope and probably would receive a return on if we are a part of the new World Trade Organization? Can you imagine the hue and cry that would go up? We would have many companies in the United States that would come to the Congress of the United States and say. What are you doing? If you do go through these procedures. if you do finally pull out. as Senator BYRD pointed out very eloquentlythe art of the impossible. if it were accomplishedthese companies would say. You are going to bankrupt our company. You are going to pull us out of the World Trade Organization after. because of the strengths of it. we have gone over and established plants in these other countries. and now you are going to. for all practical purposes. make our substantial investments in plants and equipment null and void because you have pulled out of the agreement. I simply say that maybe that is not a salient point. I say that this is one more proof positive that it is a lot easier to get into this agreement. and we may well be going into it. But it is going to be extremely difficultthe art of the impossible would be tried and tried over and again on something like this. So I think none of my colleagues should be lulled into the conclusionand they have the right to vote however they want. and there are some good reasons. I might add. why we should go into this agreement. and I may address that later. But let us not be fooled. Let us be forewarned. I simply would like to amplify the other excellent point that the Senator from West Virginia made. the sovereignty issue. I believe the sovereignty issue probably is one that my constituents are very much concerned about. I would say. Mr. President. from my view. that the constituents in Nebraska arc probably pretty equally divided on this issue. It is not an easy call as to what we should do. I have told all of them that I will be asking questions. and I will be making statements. and I will be involved in this process. I have studied it a lot and I have spent as much time. I guess. as anyone. with the possible exception of my friend. Senator HOLIANGS. in committees that have studied this. and I have listened to experts. One of the experts I listened to with great interest. though. on this sovereignty issue that first brought it home fully to mealthough I had some concerns about it--was Professor Tribe. who testified in front of the committoe. I inquired of him in some detail about the World Trade Organization. the threemember secret tribunal that would make the final decision on whether or not sanctions could be imposed against the United States. He clarified it when we were talking about the oneman/onevote principle. Let me emphasize this once again so there is no misunderstanding. While I have been assured by many people in knowledgeable positions that we should not worry about this sovereignty issue. that it is something that should not concern anyone. the facts of the matter are very clear that under the World Trade Organization. we are taking and removing all of the protection we have had under the GATT agreements up until now by going into this new World Trade Organization. Certainly. I think it is true. as the defense says. in this: Look. it explicitly says in this agreement that no laws of the United States or any of the States of the United States can be changed. That is true. But let me give an example of what I think is not fully understood. Let us say. for the sake of discussion. that the State of Nebraska had a widget manufacturing company that was very important to the economy of our State. and let us suppose that the State of Nebraska had laws preventing the importation of widgets into Nebraska for strictly parochial reasons. lot us suppose. for example. that Bangladesh could make widgets cheaper than we could because they have about oneseventh to onetenth the labor costs that our widget manufacturer in Nebraska would have. So. no. I do not believe that Bangladesh can change the law of Nebraska. But certainly under the World Trade Organization. unless I could be corrected by other people. Bangladesh could bring an action that the Nebraska law is in violation of the World Trade Organization. They could not make Nebraska change the law. but if it could not be worked out by negotiations and if it cannot be worked out by negotiations it is explicitly spelled out in this agreement that there would be a threemember panel that would meet in secret. as Senator BYRD has said. They would make a determination. If they decided with Bangladesh. then the only way that the United States could overturn that is not by oneman. onevote and a 50 percent of the 113 or 130 nations that would be part of the World Trade Organization. The United States could make an appeal that the 3man tribunal was wrong. but to overturn the 3man tribunal you have to have a unanimous vote of all of the nations involved. whether they are 113 or 127 or 131. including Bangladesh who brought the charge in the first place. They would have to vote against their own interests which is another way of saying that let us not be too sure that everything is just hunkydory and there would not be any problems on down the line. In this regard. I asked Lawrence Tribe the question as to how he viewed this. This was his answer published on page 327. Committee of Commerce hearings. S. 2467. GATT implementation legislation: Professor TanIB. Senator. I think there is a mistaken premise in your question that I really want to be as clear about as I can. and I think the chairman may have stumbled onto the same issue. Yes. it is true that under article 9. paragraph 1 of the WTO agreement. there is the onepersononevote approach in certain circumstances. and I think the question you raise is a very good one. Does that give enough protection to us? Is it unusual? But what perhaps you have not focused on is that when it comes to decisions by WTO panels that find that one of our laws. either an act of Congress or a law of a State. is Illegal under one of the GATT agreements. that decision is treated differently. and not In a way that gives the United States more voice. It is less than onecountryonevote in this sense. That is. I think you all have this fat volume that was distributed a couple of days ago. and just for your convenience. I will tell you that what I am quoting from appears on page 1.670. It is in article 22. paragraph 6 of the dispute settlement understanding. Though It is buried in fine print. it is going to make a huge difference in the future of this country. It makes very clear that the trade sanctions that are to be imposed within 30 days of a certain period of time will be imposed unless the DSBthat is. the decision body decides by consensus to reject the request for sanctions. Then It explains that consensus means unanimity. So. that means that if 113 countries say. we think that was outrageous to find Nevada or California or South Dakota or Alaska or the United States of America guilty in these circumstances. the fact that there are votes the other way prevents the sanctions from being lifted. That is not onepersononevote. That is much worse. and that is the way this works. With respect to sanctions imposed upon an offending State or country. the only way that one can reverse the decision to sanction is to get unanimity. Now. I do not know how long the U.S. Trade Representative thinks people will not focus on that. but I sure hope they do now. I simply say that there is time remaining if anyone would like to use time. I would like to have someone if they could assure me that what the understandings of Senator BYRD. the understandings of Professor Tribe and others have and the concerns that they have about the loss of sovereignty under that threeman secret tribunal whether or not there is some explanation for that that I have missed."},{"1":"1995","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I thank you and I thank the Senator from Hawaii for his constant courtesy E 33341 and helpfulness to all of us here in the Senate. I also regret that I must rise in opposition to this conference report on the Defense appropriations bill. It is clear to me that the bill should be vetoed. and that the President is going to veto it. Let me quote from a letter that the President sent to Congressman LIVINGSTON dated October 18. It said: However. by appropriating $8.9 billion more than I requested. the conference report did not address my fundamental concerns about spending priorities. As the bill now goes back to conference following its defeat on the House floor. it is important that the conferees understand where I stand. Absent a broader agreement with Congress that adequately funds crucial domestic programs in other appropriations bills. I will veto any defense appropriation bill that adds extra billions for defense programs not in my request. Mr. President. the conferees did not address the Presidents fundamental concern about misplaced priorities in their second conference. And this conference report. like its predecessor. is full of unrequested. unneeded. and unsustainable addons. As for funding of crucial domestic programs in other appropriations bills. particularly the Labor. HHS. the VAHUD and the Commerce. State. Justice bills. it is absolutely clear that we have made virtually no progress since the President wrote. The fiasco of closing down the Government has only widened the gulf between the majority party and the President on what our domestic priorities should be. Indeed. the majority partys interest in cutting programs for education. the environment. civilian research. heating assistance for lowincome citizens. national service. Indian programs. and many others seems to grow as we proceed through this budget debate. I voted against the bill when the Senate passed it early in September. I thought it was worthy of a veto then. In my view. the conference has not improved it. In fact. it has made it worse. This bill has truly become a weaponsforeverybody bill. When it left the Senate. the bill was $6.45 billion above the Presidents request. It is now $6.9 billion above the Presidents request. But that figure alone understates the net addition because. according to press reports. the conference report that we are here considering takes back Si billion that the National Reconnaissance Office. [NRO] had accumulated in unspent funds. That money was spent on unneeded. unrequested. unsustainable weapons that were not in the Senate version of the bill. just as the other $6.9 billion were. If you adjust for the NRO money. this bill is in fact about $8 billion above the Presidents request. not $7 billion. The conferees had enough money to buy ships. planes. trucks. helicopters of every description. some of whichlike a $20 million Cyclone class patrol craftwere in neither bill prior to going to conference. The total addon package is in the range of $10 billion. There are offsets in the range of $2 billion as well. The obvious question is what is it that justifies this extraordinary increase in defense spending. and I for one cannot point to a threat. We spend twice as much as all of our potential adversaries combined. If we put together the budgetsour budget with those of our NATO allies and Japanwe and our allies are outspendIng our potential foes by more than 3 to 1. Of course. it will be argued that much of the additional spending in this bill is somewhere in the Pentagons budget for the next 6 years. That was the argument that was made for the $1.3 billion HLD7 amphibious assault ship that the Senate debated when we passed the bill in August. The Navy planned to buy that ship in the year 2001. That will undoubtedly be the argument that is used to justify the $900 million LPD17 amphibious transport dock which the House insisted on in conference. The Navy planned to buy that in 1998. Mr. President. this is really an extraordinary argument. Essentially those who make it are saying that they can pick and choose anything in the 6year plan that the Department of Defense has that helps their State or district and that plan when you add it up totals about $1.6 trillion. Where else in our budgeting this year are we finding the ability to do that? The answer clearly is nowhere. Everywhere but in this case of the Pentagon we cannot find enough for this first years budget. let alone find money to add $1 billion projects in the States or districts of powerful members of the Republican leadership. But worse are the programs that do not even fit in the 6year plan. Some of these have huge budgetary implications. The B2. which was not in the Senate bill. has an outyear requirement for tens of billions of dollars. National missile defense. which my colleague from North Dakota spoke about. will require tens of billions of additional dollars not in the 6year plan. There is certainly no money in future year budgets for the Hellfire2 and the CBU87 antiarmor munitions. The Pentagons own inspector general told Congress that we already had enough of these munitions to cover every target in a 2 major regional contingency scenario. and yet the Senate voted to continue to buy these unneeded weapons. and the conferees agreed to spend tens of billions of dollars on them as well. There certainly is no money in the 6year plan for most. if not all. of the member interest addons in the research and development budget. which always seems to have an outyear requirement that goes on and on. I have in mind items that the Senator from Arizona has on his earmark list. like the curved plate technology program. the Center for Astronomical Adaptive Opticswhich presumably should be funded by the National Science Foundations astronomy program. if at allthe Pacific Software Research Center. There are many others. It is frankly disconcerting to me that the Technology Reinvestment Project. which is a competitive and a cost shared program. was cut by $305 million while noncompetitive. noncost share programs like those I referred to flourish in these supposedly austere budget times. Obviously. austerity stops at the door of the Pentagon as far as this bill is concerned. Mr. President. we cannot afford these addons even under the Republican budget. There is no money in the outyears to sustain the programs. As Congressman OBEY has repeatedly pointed out. the Republican defense budget over the 5year period from fiscal year 1998 to 2002 is less than the Presidents. Let me repeat that. The Republican defense budget for fiscal years 1998 to 2002 is less than what the President has asked for. According to an article from the November 6 issue of Aviation Week. the Republican majority is considering reducing the net 7year addition to the defense budget from $20 to $8 billion in the final negotiations over the budget with the President. whenever that negotiation occurs. I ask unanimous consent that that article from Aviation Week be printed in the RECORD following my remarks."},{"1":"1996","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. first I have to take a moment and compliment Chairman REGULA and his staff. They have done a tremendous job. I sometimes see him as having tremendous responsibility and wisdom in this process and he has been more than fair to me. he has been very fair to the State I represent. Florida. and very fair to the environment. I also would be remiss if I did not thank Secretary Babbitt. I flew up during the Easter recess and met with him. He responded to an environmental concern in Florida. And this Congress has responded to environmental concerns in my State. which is being pressured by environmental problems and concerns. When we come to Congress. however. we have an important responsibility. and that responsibility is to make choices. This is a tough choice because there are good. worthwhile programs. But I cannot think of anything that we do in the long term for so few dollars that makes such a big difference to what we are going to leave behind. In a few decades. most of us will be history. Some of us will be pushing up daisies and some of us will be someplace else. but the legacy that we leave behind will be determined today by this policy. When you have a program. and I consider myself a fiscal conservative. and I get up with some folks of a little bit different philosophy. last year I was here with the gentleman from California and now with the gentleman from California . certainly a little bit different philosophy. but we agree that this is a sound investment with our dollars. that we have a surplus in the fund of $12 billion and that we get S900 million in. and this is an investment for the future. My colleague. Mr. SHAW. from south Florida came up and spoke about what was happening in our State. I grew up in south Florida. I saw what happened in south Florida. I saw the mistakes that were made in south Florida. Today we can see where we developed to the Everglades and now this Congress has to appropriate a quarter of a billion dollars to take back some of that land. In my district. I am in central Florida and the same thing is happening there. We see the mushroom. Since I have been in office for a little over 36 months here. I have 2 new cities. one of 68.000 people. the third largest city in central Florida. in my district. I have another new city. The growth is phenomenal. And I will not get another chance. This is not a program where we are saying buy land and you do not want land out West. This is a program where local governments and State governments in concert with the Federal Government. and the way this darned thing should work. acquire land. We say that for children. I will not be here to enjoy it. We will not have another opportunity. I can tell you the developers are waiting with their plow. We are asking when you make these decisions. and I know they are tough decisions. I know the chairman is pressed to consider us. consider the legacy. consider these choices. and consider what we are going to leave behind us for this next generation and consider also that we will never get another chance in States like Florida and other areas. and again that this is a voluntary program and that is it a program of cooperation. I urge my colleagues. whether liberal. conservative. independent. moderate. Republican. Democrat. this is the chance to make a big difference in the environment that our children and grandchildren live in. This is a chance for them to inherit the earth. a part of that earth. and leave it a little bit better than we found it. I urge Members. I beg Members to consider this amendment to expand the funds in this particular provision offered by the good gentleman from California and let us vote for this and vote for opportunity for the environment for the future."},{"1":"1997","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Well. I thank my colleague from Maryland. Mr. Speaker. as I was listening to my two colleagues from California. I thought some Incredibly valid points were made this evening in this Chamber to the rest of the American people. My colleague from Orange County pointing out In a very poignant fashion the human toll. the emotional equation that was sacrificed in the name of accounting brought about by this radical redistribution of wealth. this success tax. this death tax. and my colleague from northern California. the first vintner to work in elective office as a constitutional officer since the third President of the United States. Mr. Jefferson. history will provide us the answer whether or not my colleague from northern California will follow Mr. Jefferson as time passes. but you ask the question historically. what would our founders say. not only explorers such as Meriwether Lewis. not only figures such as Thomas Jefferson. but one of those great men who really had a life that in many ways paralleled Jeffersons. overlapped. Jeffersons indeed one of the other founders of this Nation. Dr. Franklin of Pennsylvania. Benjamin Franklin. not only one of our founders but. at the time of this emergence on the American scene. one of our great humorists and philosophers. And I believe it was Dr. Franklin. in his writings for Poor Richards Almanac. who said there were two certainties in this life: death and taxes. But I do not believe even Dr. Franklin. with his prescience. could have told us that today this constitutional republic would tax people upon their death. Of course. in the wake of the largest tax increase in American history visited upon the American Nation of the 103d Congress. when our current majority was in the minority. when three of us amongst the four were private citizens. a retroactive tax increase at that. Mr. Speaker. colleagues. I have been acoss the width and breadth of the Sixth District of Arizona. visiting with a variety of constituents in a variety of town hall settings. And from retirement communities In Sun Lakes to high school classes in Fountain Hills to gatherings in Flagstaff and. indeed. this Saturday In Payson. AZ. on topic continues to come up. It is this death tax so onerous. so oppressive that we pay with a human toll that even as eloquent as the numbers my colleague from Maryland offered tonight. takes a human toll not only on the families affected. as my colleague from Orange County. CA pointed out. but also upon what could be the creation of new jobs. the expansion of wealth. the preservation of small businesses. That is why I am so pleased that my colleague. Mr. Cox. has introduced his legislation. That is why I am honored. as the first Arizonan to serve on the House Committee on Ways and Means. where we have jurisdiction over these issues of taxation. (-J 2115 While I am so enthralled with the majority on that committee. the gentleman from Texas. Mr. ARcmcs. and many others. who want to throw off the yoke of oppressive taxation to offer true compassion to the American people. not some formula for the radical redistribution of wealth that would tell the American public that Washington knows best. but a notion that people could truly put their families first and In so doing could provide for others through the virtues of our free market. that is the challenge that confronts us today. From Fountain Hill to Sun Lakes to Flagstaff. I am hearing from constituents of all ages of their very genuine concern about the death tax. their very real reservations about our entire system of taxation. and a notion that. yes. some tax must be paid. of course. but why would we punish success? Why would we punish people who have taken risk. who have provided Jobs. who have helped to build the economy? What is inherently selfish about that? For it is not greed. it is. instead. benevolence and true compassion through the free market to offer jobs. While many in this Chamber may disagree. and If there is a major philosophical divide In this 105th Congress amidst this era of good feelings and bipartisanship. it is of course the notion that our opponents believe. many of them. that a centralized government redistributing the wealth knows what is best. We say the contrary is true. that the American people. working families. since this tax extends now not to the super wealthy but to those of moderate means. who have worked all their lives. to. yes indeed. working families. by allowing those families to provide for themselves. by allowing the fruits of their labor to be invested. we will in fact continue to build this economy and continue to be the envy of the world. So I am honored to be here. I ccrtaily appreciate the efforts of my colleague from southern California. and I thank the gentleman from northern California. and my good friend. who makes. in essence. a half an hour or 45minute commute from his district in Maryland. and we invite him out West to catch up on his reading from time to time and also visit with some of our constituents. I think we understand what is a truth which stretches from coast to coast and. indeed. to the 49th and 50th States of our Union as well."},{"1":"1998","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. reluctantly.

Mr. SMITH. and his slaft have been extremely patient In working to address my concerns and I am disappointed to not be able to support the end result I understand that the Chairman is trying to improve the management of our national forests but I do not feel that this bill provides the best moans. I believe the substitute amendment Io tei bill greatly improves the public participation and the environmental review of the recovery areas and projects authorized in the bill. Specifically. the public comment and notice pedads added to the rocovoy area designation phase will provide in Importan opportunity for Interested parties to provide Input on those areas designated for potential treatments.

In one of the Ianst drafts of this legislation. any funds generated by recovery projects were deposited back In the Fund established by this bill. I raised concerns that this process would provide incentive for projects to be revenue generating instead of promoting a trealment that. while more appro. piiate to improve Ith health of Ihe forest. would operate at a cost. The Committee worked tirelessly to address this concern and. in the end. I believe that this money should simply be sent back to the General Fund of the Treasury My remaining concerns with this legislation are the use of tis bills funds for the construction of roads. either permanent or temporary. and the lack of protection of roadless areas. These concerns are obviously directly linked. I am not against all road building in our national forests. However. the $10 billion backlog in road maintenance and obliteration estimated by the Forest Sorvico for the transportation system within our national forests is a crisis In its own right. The solution to this need Is not the construction e1 more roads Further. and I realize that there is disagreement on this issue. I believe that roadless areas provide Important habitats and are imperative in main. taining balance in ecosystems and should therefore. be left undisturbed. The areas of the national forest system in greatest need of attonlion are these that are In close proximity to urban centers and areas Ihat have not been properly managed after resource extraction Since Itia program authorized by this legislalion is only for live years. I believe that these areas in urgent need should be highlighted as a priority and roadloss area left untouched. Again.

As reported by the Committee last Congress. the legislation would have created an industry committee to establish minimum wage levels similar to committees that had been created for other territories and that still exist for American Samoa. The legislation would also have established a mechanism for the extension of federal immigration laws if the government of the Northern Marianas proved unable or unwilling to adopt and enforce an effective immigration system. The legislation that I am introducing today does not include any provisions dealing with wages. I continue to believe that an industry committee is preferable to outright extension of federal wage rates. but the Northern Marianas. the Administration. and some of my cosponsors would prefer to have that debate on another vehicle. Immigration. however. is at the heart of the problems facing the Northern Marianas. This legislation reflects the recommendation of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources last Congress. What appears on the surface to be a prosperous diversified economy in the Northern Marianas. is in fact a far more fragile economy that is becoming ever more dependent on a system of imported labor. Unemployment among US residents remains high and the public sector is rapidly becoming the only source of employment for US citizens residing in the Marianas. The public sector workforce has doubled over the past several years and payroll is the largest expense of the government. The recent downturn in tourism as a result of economic problems in Asia has only served to aggravate the situation in the Marianas. increase the pressures on public sector employment. and tighten the dependence of the Marianas on imported labor for the private sector. mainly garment manufacturing. The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) is a three hundred mile archipelago consisting of fourteen islands stretching north of Guam. The largest inhabited islands are Saipan. Rota. and Tinian. Magellan landed at Saipan in 1521 and the area was controlled by Spain until the end of the Spanish American War. Guam. the southernmost of the Marianas. was ceded to the United States following the SpanishAmerican War and the balance sold to Germany together with the remainder of Spains possessions in the Caroline and Marshall Islands. Japan seized the area during World War I and became the mandatory power under a League of Nations Mandate for Germanys possessions north of the equator on December 17. 1920. By the 1930s Japan had developed major portions of the area and begun to fortify the islands. Guam was invaded by Japanese forces from Saipan in 1941. The Marianas were secured after heavy fighting in 1944 and the bases on Tinian were used for the invasion of Okinawa and for raids on Japan. including the nuclear missions on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In 1947. the Mandated islands were placed under the United Nations trusteeship system as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI) and the United States was appointed as the Administering Authority. The area was divided into six administrative districts with the headquarters located in Hawaii and then in Guam. The TTPI was the only strategic trusteeship with review by the Security Council rather than the General Assembly of the United Nations. The Navy administered the Trusteeship. together with Guam. until 1951. when administrative jurisdiction was transferred to the Department of the Interior. The Northern Marianas. however. were returned to Navy jurisdiction from 19521962. In 1963. administrative headquarters were moved to Saipan. With the establishment of the Congress of Micronesia in 1965. efforts to reach an agreement on the future political status of the area began. Attempts to maintain a political unity within the TTPI were unsuccessful. and each of the administrative districts (Kosrae eventually separated from Pohnpei District in the Carolines) sought to retain its separate identity. Four of the districts became the Federated States of Micronesia. the Marshalls became the Republic of the Marshall Islands. and Palau became the Republic of Palau. all sovereign countries in free association with the United States under Compacts of Free Association. The Marianas had sought reunification with Guam and US territorial status from the beginning of the Trusteeship. Separate negotiations with the Marianas began in December. 1972 and concluded in 1975. In 1976. Congress approved a Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States (PL 94241). The Covenant had been approved in a United Nations observed plebescite in the Northern Mariana Islands and formed the basis for the termination of the United Nations Trusteeship with respect to the Northern Mariana Islands in 1986 together with the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. Prior to termination. those provisions of the Covenant that were not inconsistent with the status of the area (such as extension of US sovereignty) were made applicable by the US as Administering Authority. Upon termination of the Trusteeship. the CNMI became a territory of the United States and its residents became United States citizens. Under the terms of the Covenant certain federal laws would be inapplicable in the CNMI. including minimum wage to take into consideration the relative economic situation of the islands and their relation to other east Asian countries. Although the population of the CNMI was only 15.000 people in 1976 when the Covenant went into effect. the population now exceeds 60.000 and US citizens are a minority. The resident population is probably about 24.000 with about 28.000 alien workers and estimates of at least 10.000 illegal aliens. Permits for nonresident workers were reported at 22.500 for 1994. the largest category being for manufacturing. Tourism has climbed from about 230.000 visitors in 1987 to almost 600.000 in 1994. Total revenues for the CNMI for 1993 were estimated at $157 million. The 1995 census statistics from the Commonwealth list unemployment at 7.1%. with CNMI born at 14.2% and Asia born at 4.5%. Since no guest workers should be on island without jobs. the 4.5% suggests a serious problem in the CNMI. The 14.2% local unemployment suggests that either guest workers are taking jobs from local residents. or the wage rates or types of occupation are not adequate to attract local workers. The Covenant established a unique system in the CNMI under which the local government controlled immigration and minimum wage levels and also had the benefit of duty and quota free entry of manufactured goods under the provisions of General Note 3(a) of the Harmonized Tariff Schedules. The Section by Section analysis of the Committee Report on the Covenant provides in part: Section 503.-This section deals with certain laws of the United States which are not now applicable to the Northern Mariana Islands and provides that they will remain inapplicable except in the manner and to the extent that they are made applicable by specific legislation enacted after the termination of the Trusteeship. These laws are: The Immigration and Naturalization Laws (subsection (a)). The reason this provision is included is to cope with the problems which unrestricted immigration may impose upon small island communities. Congress Is aware of those problems .... It may well be that these problems will have been solved by the time of the termination of the Trusteeship Agreement and that the Immigration and Nationality Act containing adequate protective provisions can then be introduced to the Northern Mariana Islands ... The same consideration applies to the introduction of the Minimum Wage Laws. (Subsection (c). Congress realizes that the special conditions prevailing in the various territories require different treatment ... In these circumstances. it would be inappropriate to introduce the Act to the Northern Mariana Islands without preliminary studies. There is nothing which would prevent the Northern Mariana Islands from enacting their own Minimum Wage Legislation. Moreover. as set forth in section 502(b). the activities of the United States and its contractors in the Northern Mariana Islands will be subject to existing pertinent Federal Wages and Hours Legislation. (S. Rept. 94433. pp. 7778) The Committee anticipated that by the termination of the Trusteeship. the federal government would have found some way of preventing a large influx of persons into the Marianas. recognizing the Constitutional limitations on restrictions on travel. In part. the Covenant attempted to deal with that possibility by enacting a restraint on land alienation for twentyfive years. subject to extension by the CNMI. The minimum wage issue was more difficult. especially in light of the Committees experience in the Pacific. The extension of minimum wage to Kwajalein was a proximate cause of the overcrowding at Ebeye in the Kwajalein Atoll as hundreds of Marshallese moved to the small island in hope of obtaining a job at the Missile Range."},{"1":"2000","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"All right. Mr. President. I have such a good feeling about Interior appropriations bills. My friend. Senator BYRD. and Senator DOMENICI and Senator GORTON have worked hard on this Interior bill. For California it is so important. It is wonderful. I just got a reminder note from Senator BYRD on the wonderful things in this bill. for which I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Funding for the historic Presidio. for Lake Tahoe. so many others the Manzanar historical site. For those of you who may not remember. it was the site where JapaneseAmericans were essentially interned. We are going to make a monument out of it. So when I see an antienvironmental rider come on this beautiful bill. it is always distressing because. to me. the Interior appropriations bill. it seems to me. should be a positive statement of good things that we are doing for the environment. So when I heard a rumor that Senator CRAIG would offer his amendment. I decided at that time I would try to talk the Senate out of adopting it. And this has become unnecessary. So let me quickly say. I am pleased that what is before us does nothing to stop this roadless policy from going into effect. As Senator WYDEN has stated. there have been countless meetings on it. The fact is. the roadless areas are the remaining gems of a forest system that has been degraded by centuries of logging and other types of heavy use. If we look at the big picture. we are really talking only about setting aside 2 percent of all our land in this country as roadless areas. What an important thing that is for us to do because it will in fact preserve our beautiful. priceless environment for future generations and preserve the fishing industry. stop erosion. It is a very important environmental initiative. So there is no misunderstanding. we know there are many inroads into these roadless areas. In the next 5 years alone. we are going to see more than 1.000 miles of roads inventoried. We are moving into these pristine areas. At some point. we have to say enough is enough in terms of destruction of our natural wilderness and our wonderful natural heritage. I think the U.S. Forest Service has taken a bold and positive step forward with its effort. I am very glad that nothing in this bill will stop them. Let me cite a couple of poll numbers. A recent poll done by some pollsters from the other side of the aisle found that 76 percent of the public supports the protection of roadless areas. and in my home State. asking Republicans and Democrats that question. 76 percent of Californians support roadless policies. We have editorials that I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD."},{"1":"2001","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. I rise today to express my strong support for the Presidents nominee for the Secretary of the Interior. Gale Norton. I know there are some groups out there that have mischaracterized her record and have indicated some fears or concerns. I remember similar fears and concerns being expressed about me. It didnt seem to work out the way some thought it would. They have resorted to name calling. misrepresenting her record. making false accusations. We are probably going to hear some of those accusations repeated on the floor today. regretfully. I begin by trying to set the record straight. I think this business of personal attacking and trying to destroy people personally is a mistake that is uncalled for. It is one thing to disagree on the issues. It is another thing to begin to get into name calling and making accusations about peoples character that are not justified. Let me stick to the record. Gale Norton has a strong environmental record. Certainly. if we look at the facts in Colorado at Rocky Flats and Rocky Mountain Arsenal. she has a strong record of enforcing Federal and State environmental laws vigorously and fairly. As attorney general of Colorado. she fought to make the Federal Government and private companies clean up hazardous and nuclear waste left behind at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal and Rocky Flats. At the Rocky Mountain Arsenal. she fought all the way the U.S. Supreme Court for the States right to hold the Federal Government to the same stringent cleanup standards that she applied to private companies. She sued not to try to weaken the cleanup standard but to strengthen it. Today the Rocky Mountain Arsenal is a national wildlife refuge. That is not an accident. That is strong leadership on the part of this nominee for Secretary of the Interior. The extreme environmental groups also blame Ms. Norton for the Summitville mine disaster and suggest that she didnt do enough to enforce the law. Again. their facts are wrong completely. Ms. Norton did go after the mine operator shortly after she took office. Because of her actions. the mine operator was forced to operate a water treatment facility to prevent contamination from spreading. She also brought an enforcement action against the mine operator recovering millions of dollars to pay for the cleanup. She did not let the polluter off the hook. To the contrary. she made the polluter pay. This let the polluter off the hook is a favorite expression of the left to somehow assume that if you try to work to get cleanup and you are not extracting every last dollar from every person who has it. somehow we are letting polluters off the hook. As we know. we have crossed this rubicon in the past. We have crossed that threshold. and it depends on which polluter we are talking about. What is a polluter? Is a polluter somebody who throws a ballpoint pen in a landfill? Under some definitions. yes. We have to be very careful how we throw that term around. We are going to hear it a lot today in the debate. that somehow she let the polluters off the hook. The facts are. she did not. These are just a few examples. Anyone who looks at her recordinstead of the environmental groups characterizationswill see that Ms. Norton enforced the law and she protected the environment at the same time. She appreciates the value of preserving our land. She grew up in Colorado. She understands what wilderness means and what it means to live in a beautiful. pristine area such as central Colorado. The extreme environmental groups have also suggested that Gale Norton cannot be trusted to protect our public lands. our national parks and refuges and wilderness areas. That is not true. Her record demonstrates that Ms. Norton values our public lands and she will protect them. Again. just look at the record. As attorney general. she worked with Congress to craft the Colorado wilderness bill that established 19 new wilderness areas in the State. That doesnt sound like somebody who is opposed to cleaning up our environment and protecting our wilderness. That bill was enacted in part because of Ms. Nortons efforts to build consensus for the preservation of those lands. Her record at the Department of the Interior. where she was Associate Solicitor for Conservation and Wildlife from 1985 to 1987. shows once again that she was an effective advocate for protecting our public lands and natural resources. including endangered species. Let me name just a few of her accomplishments in the Solicitors Office: She represented the Fish and Wildlife Service in its successful effort to add 80.00090.000 acres to the Big Cypress National Preserve. She was involved in an effort to add 5.000 acres to complete the Florida Panther National Wildlife Reserve in Florida. She fought to ensure the success of the captive breeding program that saved the California condor when environmental groups sued to try to stop it. If they had succeeded. the condor would now be extinct. She fought for the acquisition of land to extend the Appalachian Trail. She worked on the regulations that banned lead shot for migratory birds. saving millions of birds. She secured funds for the restoration of Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty. And she negotiated the original agreement with Senator MCCAIN to restrict overflights in the Grand Canyon. Again. these are just a few of her accomplishments over the past 15 years. but they paint a clear picture. They paint a picture of someone who has dedicated her life to public service. to preserving the environment and natural resources. and to enforcing the law. They paint a picture of an individual who is highly qualified to be the next Secretary of the Interior. and the first woman to serve in that position. I urge my colleagues to consider the facts. not the distortions. in making their decisions about Gale Norton. I strongly support Ms. Nortons nomination to be Secretary of the Interior. and look forward to working with her on the many challenges that lay ahead."},{"1":"2002","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. the General Accounting Office has recently completed a study on the cleanup of Contaminated Areas in the Great Lakes. While it is no surprise to those of us who live in the Great Lakes region. GAO found that there has been slow progress of cleanup efforts. For those of you who live outside the Great Lakes region. Areas of Concern are sites in the Great Lakes that do not meet the water quality goals established by the United States and Canada in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. The primary reason that these areas fail to meet water quality goals is the result of contaminated sediments. a result of the industrialization of the midwest. In order to meet the water quality goals. the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement binds us to an identified cleanup process focused around Remdial Action Plans. RAPs. RAPs define the environmental problem. evaluate remedial measures. and identify a process for moving forward with cleanup. The RAP process relies on State and public involvement. and RAPs need the financial support of the Federal Government. The GAO reports that the RAP process is often disregarded by the states and EPA. The progress that is being made to cleanup the Areas of Concern is being made not under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement but under other laws such as Superfund. EPA has failed to provide oversight responsibility for RAPs and does not provide nearly enough financial resources for RAPs. In addition to these problems associated with EPA. there is no way to implement RAPs because there is no pot of money to do so and no established procedure to follow. There are 13 areas of concern in the State of Michigan which result in fish advisories. degradation of fish and wildlife populations. taste and odor problems with drinking water. beach closures. and bird and animal deformities or reproductive problems. These environmental problems are too grave considering the fact that the Great Lakes holds onefifth of the worlds freshwater. supplies drinking water to 33 million people. and provides a $2 billion fishery. So today. with my colleague from Ohio. Senator DEWINE. I am introducing the Great Lakes Legacy Act to authorize $50 million per year in grants to States to cleanup Areas of Concern and implement RAPs. This legislation will also require EPA to report to Congress within 1 year on how it plans to provide the oversight needed to make sure that the Areas of Concern will meet water quality goals. The problem of contaminated sediments in the Great Lakes has been known for decades. and I hope that my colleagues will support this legislation to hopefully cleanup Areas of Concern."},{"1":"2003","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. my colleague from Idaho has described accurately the provision in the freetrade agreement dealing with immigration.

I am sure. that a senseoftheSenate resolution that says. in effect. you better watch it. is the equivalent of hitting someone on the forehead with a feather. The reason there has to be a senseoftheSenate resolution at the moment. if we are to express displeasure. is because we cannot offer any amendments to a freetrade agreement. It is brought to the floor under fast track. This Senate. in its wisdomor in its lack of wisdomsaid we agree to put our arms in a straitjacket so whatever the trade ambassador negotiates anywhere in the world. he can bring it back here and we agree to prevent ourselves from offering amendments. That is fast track. I do not have any big issues with Chile or Singapore. The freetrade agreement coming to the Senate floor is not even a very big deal with respect to Chile and Singapore. the two countries with whom the agreements are made. The big deal to me is that we have made agreement after agreement in international trade. In each case. this country has lost. and lost big time. We have lost jobs. We have lost economic strength. We have massive problems in previous trade agreements. None of them are being fixed. None of them get solved. What gets done? Well. new trade agreements seem to emerge on the Senate floor. Rather than fixing old trade agreements and beginning to support this countrys interests. what we want to do. according to the trade ambassador. is bring new trade agreements so we can debate and vote on those. What I want to do this morning is talk a little bit about some of those old trade agreements and talk about what ought to be done rather than debating new trade agreements at this point. First. it is worth noting what our trade deficit is at this point. This is an article from the Washington Post. It shows the trade deficit the end of last year. It is the highest trade deficit in history. The trade deficit soared to $435 billion on an annual basis In 2002. and it is worse now. of course. Nearly onefourth of the years deficit in goods trade was with China. which sold $103 billion more goods to the United States than it bought here. I will talk about China. It is a story in itself. They ship us all their trinkets. trousers. shirts. and shoes. and they come into our KMarts and our WalMarts and our grocery stores and we buy all of these things from China. Guess what. Chinas market is not very open to the products our employees and our businesses produce. They are not buying very much from us. What does it mean to us? It means we do not have jobs. It means we have people today looking for work who cannot find a job in this country. Now. it is interesting. there was a story recently about this being a jobless recovery. Of course. we do not have much of a recovery. It is pretty anemic at this point. We have very slow economic growth. So this economy is just sort of bumping along. just hiccuping from day to day. week to week. and month to month without much strength at all. So they say. this is a recovery that is jobless. Well. they miss the point on that. Oh. there are jobs created by American enterprise. There are jobs created by ingenuity that comes from U.S. firms. It is just that the jobs that are being created are not being created in this country. This is a recovery. all right. an anemic recovery with jobs. but the jobs are not here. The jobs are overseas. More and more. we see jobs in factories that are moved overseas that used to be good American jobs. So if in fact this is a jobless recovery. it is jobless only to the extent that it is jobless in the United States. We have millions of Americans who desperately want a job. they want to go to work. but there are not enough jobs available. Twoandahalf million people who were working a couple of years ago now are not working because this economy is not producing the jobs here. Too many American corporations are producing the jobs in Asia and elsewhere. I want to talk a little about that. Ambassador Zoellick is a perfectly nice person. He is our U.S. trade ambassador. Most people would not recognize his name from a cord of wood. but he serves in a pretty important role. He is the trade ambassador. He goes overseas with his staff and they negotiate trade agreements. These are the agreements by which we trade with other countries. They negotiate behind closed doors. We are not there. Our constituents are not there. These are trade negotiations behind closed doors in which they decide what kind of trade relationship we will have in the future. Then they come back to us with a trade agreement and they say. here is our agreement between our country and China. our country and Japan. our country and European countries. Then they say to the Congress. because the Congress previously agreed: you cannot change the agreement. We negotiated it in secret. but you have a responsibility to vote on it. up or down. yes or no. with no changes. no amendments. And the Congress was foolish enough to agree. Here we are. This morning we are talking about a senseoftheSenate resolution to say to the trade ambassador: Better watch it. Why? Because he went off to Singapore and negotiated a freetrade agreement with Singapore that said: By the way. in this freetrade agreement having nothing to do with trade. we will insist that a provision will allow 5.400 immigrants from Singapore into the United States under 1year visas that will be renewed indefinitely. What are they going to come here for? To work. Will they come to see movies. drive around on Sundays? No. they are coming here for a job. to work. We have millions and millions of Americans who need a job. who are out of work. who are struggling every single day. And this trade agreement says: What we would like to do. in addition to creating the trade circumstances that exist by this agreement with us and with Singapore. we agree 5.400 people from Singapore will come here to work. Usually. if one disagrees with thatand I certainly dowe would offer an amendment to strip this from the trade agreement. But we cannot in this instance. because of the fast track authority we handed to the executive branch. If ever you want a description of why it is dumb for the Congress to decide to put itself in a straitjacket. this is it. We are going to vote. probably Monday or Tuesday. on a freetrade agreement with Singapore. That freetrade agreement has a provision in it that will have 5.400 people from Singapore coming to this country to take jobs in this country. when we have 8 to 10 million Americans out of work. and we cannot do a thing about it--not a thing. Frustrated? Sure. as I am sure are many others. Can you do anything? No. what we can do is say to Mr. Zoellick. the ambassador. with the senseofasenate resolution: You better watch it. I will vote for it. but it is like beating someone over the head with a feather. It does not mean anything. Let me talk about what they should be doing instead of creating new fasttrack agreements. Instead of rushing off to create new trade agreements. let me make a couple of suggestions. I will vote against these trade agreements because we ought to be fixing old problems before we create new ones. That is not a judgment about Singapore or Chile. It is a judgment about what I think the obligation of our trade ambassador is. Under Republican and Democrat administrations. they have systematically failed in the obligation to correct trade problems. Let me mention a couple. Japan has a very large trade surplus with us. We have a very large trade deficit with Japan. Each year. we have a $50. $60. $70 billion trade deficit. One of the products that we would like to export more of to Japan is beef. Fifteen years ago we reached a new beef agreement with Japan. We had negotiators over there negotiating. and they finally reached an agreement. It was frontpage headlines in the American newspapers. You would have thought they won the Olympics. They were celebrating and rejoicing and feasting. Big beef agreement with Japan. It is 15 years later. Where are we 15 years after a beef agreement with Japan. a country with whom we have a very large deficit? Every single pound of American beef going to Japan has a 38.5 percent tariff on it 15 years after the agreement. And that is set to snap back to a 50percent tariff on every single pound of beef we send to Japan. Does Japan need more Tbones? Of course. More hamburger? Of course. But every single pound has this extraordinary tariff on it. Why? Because the Japanese are trying to keep it out. They do not want as much as we should be sending at a time when we have a huge trade deficit with Japan. It is unforgivable. Do you hear complaints from our country about it? No. no one is talking much about it. It is fine with most people around here to run a huge yearly trade deficit with Japan. It is not fine with me. The trade ambassador. it is fine with him. They are so busy negotiating new agreements with new countries that they cannot seem to resolve these issues. A country with whom we have a $60 to $70 billion trade deficit ought not apply 38.5 percent tariffs on the products our ranchers want to send to the dinner table in Tokyo. What about wheat with China? We just did a trade agreement with the country of China. in order for China to join the WTO. China has a $103 billion trade deficit with us. They send us everything. They send us their trousers. trinkets. shirts. and shoes. They send us everything. Our marketplace absorbs it all. But the fact is. their marketplace is not open to us. What does that mean? It means jobs move from this country to China. People here are unemployed. out of work. and we are running up this huge trade deficit with China. Let me mention the agricultural side of trade with China because I care a lot about that. I come from a wheatproducing State. And our trade officials dealing in agriculture on our side recently stated that China has failed miserably to live up to the promises it made when it joined the WTO in 2001. In fact. before he resigned. the top U.S. trade official dealing with agriculture in China said we should file a trade complaint against China. but we are not doing so. Despite a recommendation that we should. we are not doing so for foreign policy reasons. We do not want to upset the Chinese. God forbid we should upset the Chinese. So we have a $103 billion trade deficit with China and our jobs are evaporating in this country. moving to China for lower wages. And we do not want to upset them. We do not want to demand their market be open to our products. Instead of having a trade ambassador working on that problem. we have new trade agreements. I do not understand that at all. Automobiles and China has always been interesting. Our trade negotiators. a couple years ago. went to China regarding the bilateral trade agreement under a Democratic administrationall the Democrats and Republicans in the White House have the same trade view. But let me give you a description of the bilateral trade agreement on automobiles. China is a country of 1.3 billion people who want substantial additional growth. Our trade negotiators said we agree. after a phasein. China can have a 25percent tariff on any automobiles we send into China. and we will have a 2.5 percent tariff on any Chinese automobiles sent to our marketplace. Our negotiators said they agree to a tariff that is 10 times higher on U.S. cars being shipped to China than we would impose on a Chinese car coming to the United States. Why on Earth. on a bilateral agreement in this sector. would our negotiators ever agree to something like that with a country with which we have a $100 billion trade deficit? I dont have the foggiest idea. This is a 1.3 billion person country that will need automobiles at some point in the future. and we say: We will give you a deal. You have a huge surplus with us. or we have a big deficit with you. We will give you a deal. On automobile trade. we will agree you can have a tariff 10 times higher than ours to keep our cars out. Unforgivably incompetent. I must say. I am not talking about people. I am talking about the policy. Something also of interest to meagain. I mention China. but I will get to a couple of other countriesis movies. Our country is pretty good at making movies. the best in the world. Do you know that before China entered the WTO. China allowed 10 movies into the Chinese marketplace a yearjust 10? Not 11. not 12but 10. That was the limit. But when they joined the WTO in 2001 there was this giant liberalization of trade by China. Do you know what they do now? They allow 20 movies into the Chinese marketplace. I guess that is all right with us. In fact. I had people in that industry say we have really made progress here. big advantages. double the movies into China10 to 20. We have such low expectations of our trading partners it is incomprehensible to me. Let me talk about beef with Europe. turning to Europe for just a moment. The occasions in which I have traveled to Europe and opened the pages of the European newspapers. I hear the concerns of the Europeans about growth hormones in American beef. Here is the way they picture American beef: Twoheaded cow. Right? Growth hormones. God forbid you raise twoheaded cows and you cant eat them because it will ruin your health. Of course. none of that is true. But nonetheless they have effectively kept U.S. beef out of Europe. So we filed a trade complaint and our trade complaint on European beef was upheld. And Europe is supposed to let our beef in. But they have not. So we said: All right. Europe. you are not letting our beef into your marketplace and you should. the WTO says you must. we won the case. and since you are not going to abide by the decision. we will play hardball. Do you know what we did? We said: All right. we are really going to whip you into shape. we are going to take tough. nononsense enforcement against you. We said: We are going to impose tariffs on your truffles. goose liver. and Roquefort cheese. That will scare the devil out of a country. wont it? Take action against truffles. goose liver. and Roquefort cheese. Is there a reason people think we are wimps in international trade? I think so. It is bizarre. When the Europeans want to get tough with us. they pick sectors like steel and textiles. That sounds robust. doesnt it? But we are going to go at them on goose liver. Shame on us. We ought as a country to decide we are going to protect our marketplace. not against competition. but against unfair competition. that we are going to demand of other countries. if our marketplace is open to them. their marketplace be open to us. I am not a protectionist. I dont believe we ought to put walls around our country. I believe our consumers are advantaged by expanded trade. But by the same token I believe very strongly that trade ought to be fair. It is not fair trade with respect to the Chinese and the circumstances I mentioned. Let me mention Korea. just for a moment. I talked about China and Europe. Let me talk about automobiles in Korea. Do you know in the last year we sent automobiles to Korea. about 680.000 Korean automobiles came into this countryDaiwoos. HyundaisKorean automobiles. They are probably wonderful cars. I dont know. I have not driven them. But 680.000 Korean cars came into the United States. Do you know how many U.S. cars we got to Korea? We sold 2.800 cars to Korea. They shipped us 680.000. we sent them 2.800. Do you know why? Because Korea doesnt want American cars in its marketplace and they put up barriers and impediments to keep them out. What are we doing about that? Nothing. We dont do anything about anything. All we do is go negotiate a new agreement and bring it to the Senate and say. Oh. by the way. we have stuck some extraneous things in and if you dont like it. tough luck. because you cant offer amendments. Does anyone care about the imbalance in Korean automobile trade? They sent us 680.000 cars and we only get 2.800 to Korea. Does anybody care about that? There is an interesting example about the Dodge Dakota pickup. just recently. In February of this year. DaimlerChrysler started to sell the Dodge Dakota pickup in Korea. The pickup is made in Detroit. by the way. Korea doesnt manufacture pickups like the Dakota. so DaimlerChrysler thought it had pretty good potential in Korea and the company started marketing to small business owners. It was initially quite successful. It got orders for 60 pickup trucks in February and another 60 in March. Guess what happened? In March an official with the Korean Ministry of Construction and Transportation decided Dodge Dakota pickup trucks represented a hazard. He said some people were even putting optional cargo covers on the vehicle and that might be dangerous if passengers rode in the back. so he announced that cargo covers on pickups on Dodge Dakotas were illegal. and drivers of the pickups would be fined if they put on a cargo cover. And the Korean newspapers had huge headlines: Government Ministry Finds Dodge Dakota Covers Illegal. Guess what happened. Korean consumers got the message. They canceled 55 out of the 60 orders they had placed for March. The Korean Government has done this time and time and time again. to shut down our exports of automobiles to Korea. On the subject of trade with Korea. I could tell you if you try to send potato flakes to Korea from this country you will find there is a 300 percent tariff on potato flakes used to make confection food. I could go on for some length at the barriers we face sending Americas products overseas into markets that ought to be open to us because our markets are open to them. But we as a country dont seem to think too much about that. we are so busy doing new agreements. I have a chart here that shows where we are with trade deficits. With almost every country in the world. we have very significant trade deficits. And ironically. the U.S. trade ambassador has been negotiating with the very few countries with which we have surpluses. like Singapore and Australia. I expect those will soon turn to deficits. given our proclivity to negotiate trade agreements that dont work for our country. Let me talk just for a moment about Canada. We face wheat coming into this country from Canada. sold by an entity that would be illegal in this country. called the Canadian Wheat Board. It is a statecontrolled monopoly that would be illegal in the United States. Yet every day we have Canadian wheat shipped into our country at what we allege are prices below the cost of acquisition. dumping in our country. It is unfair trade. It has been going on for a decade and you cant stop it. You just cant stop it. It is enormously frustrating for our farmers because it takes money right out of their pockets. One day some while ago I went to the Canadian border with a man named Earl in a 12yearold orange truck. He and I went to the Canadian border with about 200 bushels of durum wheat. All the way to the Canadian border we met 18wheel semitrucks loaded with Canadian wheat being shipped into this country. When we got to the Canadian border. we couldnt take a small amount of durum wheat in a 12yearold orange truck into Canada. They stopped us cold. We couldnt move. At the same time. we had all of these semitrucks coming into this country loaded with wheat. Unfair? You are darned right it is. In fact. Canadian wheat is dumped into our country below the cost of production. Yet we are not able to get satisfaction. Regrettably. the same is true in almost every circumstance. Instead of trying to resolve these issues for our producers. for our employers. and for our employees in this country. we have this free trade fever to negotiate all of these new agreements. and we are correcting none of the problems in previous agreements. Those who speak as I do. we are often referred to as protectionists. The papers will not print oped pieces by someone like me on this subject. They will print reams extolling the virtues of this trade policy that comes from Republican and Democratic administrations. but they will never print an oped piece by someone who speaks as I do about the need to enforce trade laws. The view of most around here is that there is a globalization going on and that there are some of us dont get it. we are the xenophobic. isolationist stooges who simply cant see over the horizon. that they know better. and. if we understood all of this. we wouldnt be critical of it. But the question that is fundamental to me is this. Should we not require that trade be fair? Let me give an example of what I mean by fair. Our trade relations are unfair in so many different ways. Is it fair. for example. for a worker in a manufacturing plant in the State of Georgia to compete against a 14yearold young man or a 14yearold young woman working 14 hours a day. being paid 14 cents an hour in a manufacturing plant in Bangladesh or Indonesia to produce a product that is then sent to our marketplace to sit on a store shelf in a small town in Georgia? Is that fair competition for the company in Georgia that makes the same product. that pays the minimum wage. that prevents the dumping of chemicals and sewage into the water and air. that makes sure they have a safe workplace because they understand those are requirements in this country. because there are prohibitions against child labor and prohibitions against working people 100 hours a week? Is it fair competition to allow into that store and onto that store shelf for the consumer a product made by somebody who works 14 hours a day and is being paid 14 cents an hour? This is a true story. A worker in Bangladesh is paid 1.6 cents for every baseball cap she sews. which is then sent to a store in this country to sit on the shelf and is sold for $17. Is there a company in this country that can compete with that? I dont think so. Is it fair trade? Let me give you an example. if I might. The story is entitled Worked Till They Drop. It tells of a woman named Li Chunmei. Unfortunately. it is not a very unusual story. Li Chunmei was 19 years old. She worked in a toy factory in China. They made stuffed animals for the U.S. marketplace. Let me read from the article. On the night she died. Li Chunmei must have been exhausted. Coworkers said she had been on her feet for nearly 16 hours. running back and forth inside the Bainan Toy Factory. carrying toy parts from machine to machine. Long hours were mandatory. and at least two months had passed since LI and the other workers had enjoyed even a Sunday off. It had been two months since she and other workers had a Sunday off. The factory food was so bad. she said. she felt as if she had not eaten at all. I want to quit. one of her roommates. Huang Jiaqun. remembered her saying. I want to go home. Her roommates had already fallen asleep when Li started coughing up blood. They found her in the bathroom a few hours later. curled up on the floor. moaning softly in the dark. bleeding from her nose and mouth. Someone called an ambulance. but she died before it arrived. The exact cause of Lis death remains unknown. But what happened to her last November in this industrial town in southeastern Guangdong province is described by family. friends and coworkers as an example of what Chinas more daring newspapers call guolaosl. The phrase means overwork death. and usually applies to young workers who suddenly collapse and die after working exceedingly long hours. day after day. Li worked for 16 hours. running back and forth on the factory floor. and had not had a Sunday off for 2 months--not even a Sunday off. I dont know the wages Li made. but I can tell you that I have gone to some of those places in the world. There are circumstances in which 12yearold kids are working 16 hours a day and are being paid 14 cents an hour. It is not. in my judgment. fair trade. If they take the product of their work. send it to our store shelves. and tell American workers and businesses. Compete with this. it is not a standard with which we ought to aspire to compete. We ought not be racing to the bottom on the question of workers standards. on the question of child labor. and on the question of basic fairness and wages. We ought not be racing to the bottom. Yet that is what we are being set up to do with some of these trade agreements. Let me say again that this trade ambassador and others have a responsibility to be solving trade problems created by past trade agreements and not presenting us with new trade problems in new agreements. My main interest today is not Chile or Singapore. My interest is that this country has the largest trade deficit in human history. and this country is suffering a mass exodus of jobs that used to be held by Americans. which are now moved to plants and factories where they can pay pennies on the dollar for an hours wages. My concern is that the rules of trade have not kept up with the galloping globalization of trade. The winners are not. as some would have us believe. poor people in other countries who now have jobs. There are plenty of studies and evidence showing that in the last 20 years of globalization. the poor have not improved their lot in life. These trade agreements are about raw profits. These profits have increased because those who produce those toysin this case. from a toy factory in Chinadont have to pay a decent wage. But it has not improved the lot and life of those who work 16 hours a dayteenage kidsand dont have a Sunday off for 2 months. My question is very simple to this trade ambassador and others: Why will you not begin to solve some problems. demanding on behalf of the workers of this country and demanding on behalf of the businesses of this countryyes. from Japan. from China. from Korea. from Europe. and othersdemanding fair trade rules and understanding there is an admission price to the American marketplace? This marketplace of ours we fought for. for 100 years. When I say fought for. there were men and women who died in the streets of this country fighting for the right to organize as workers. We have had major battles in this Chamber on the issue of child labor. on the issue of minimum wage. and on the issue of safe workplaces and polluting streams and the air shed. We fought those battles. and this country has come to grips with the understanding that you shouldnt put 12yearold kids in factories and work them 16 hours a day and pay them 12 cents an hour. We dont do that because it is not right. It is not right either to ask American workers to compete with unfair trade practices. Unless this country starts to stand up for its interests. we will not soon have a manufacturing base left and we will not have family farmers available in the future. I know when I speak this way. there are those who take a look at it and say: Oh. again. another protectionist. Again. I believe expanding trade is beneficial to this country. but only if it is done under circumstances in which the rules are fair to those of us in this country. We ought never. ever be concerned about standing up for our interests. If we have trade agreements. trade ought to be mutually beneficial. Too often in the past our trade agreements. with country after country after country. have not been mutually beneficial. We had a trade surplus with Mexico. did an agreement with Mexico. and turned it into a big deficit. We had a modest deficit with Canada. did an agreement with Canada. and turned it into a huge deficit. It has been the same with Europe. the same with the GATT legislation. All of it has been a colossal failure. in my judgment. The biggest trade deficit in human history: $1.5 billion every single day. 7 days a week. That is what we purchase from abroad more than we ship abroad. And it means we are moving Americas jobs overseas at an accelerated rate. The question is. who will be the consumers in the future? If Americans do not have access to good jobs. who will be the consumers in the future for these cheap imports into this country? We better come to grips with these trade issues. and soon. I am going to come to the Chamber on Monday and speak more about trade when we have the vote on the Free Trade Agreement. But let me again say. as I conclude. the reason we are having this vote this way is because this Congress. imprudently. in my judgment. decided to tie its hands with something called fast track. It says: Oh. yes. lets offer up our hands. put handcuffs on them so we cannot offer any amendments. So now Ambassador Zoellick brings us the Singapore Free Trade Agreement. which says we will allow 5.400 citizens from Singapore to come to this country to take jobs. We have some folks who dont like that. so they are going to do a sense of the Senate resolution. Oh. my God. that is going to make Ambassador Zoellick shake in his boots. It is like hitting him in the forehead with a feather. Sense of Senate: You better not do that again. The fact is. nobody in this Chamber can do a thing about it because this Chamber decided long ago it would. not allow itself to offer an amendment. It is fundamentally at odds with our constitutional responsibilities. in my judgment. But enough Members of this Senate decided to embrace that foolishness and we are now stuck with a circumstance where this agreement will say 5.400 folks from Singapore can come here and take 5.400 American jobs. at a time when we have 8 to 10 million people who are looking for work. Boy. that doesnt add up. where I come from. I intend to speak at greater length on Monday and try to get some of this trade frustration off of my chest. at least. and see if we cant try to push peopleif not pull theminto beginning to stand up for this countrys economic interests. No. we dont want an advantage. we just want to stand up for our economic interests and demand fair trade on behalf of American workers and American businesses. Mr. President. I yield the floor."},{"1":"2004","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. this week. a conference committee filed its report on legislation that was originally designed to repeal provisions in the tax code that have been found by the World Trade Organization to be illegal export subsidies. Months ago the European Union began imposing retaliatory tariffs on select American exports. including such important Rhode Island exports as machinery and jewelry. The targeting of the jewelry industry is especially troubling because Rhode Island is among the three biggest jewelryproducing States. and this sector accounts for 36 percent of the total trade targeted by the retaliatory duties. Without congressional action to repeal these export tax provisions. these tariffs would grow progressively until reacing 17 percent by March of Unfortunately. I have serious concerns that the conference agreement before us today would not even provide immediate relief to our jewelers and other businesses targeted by these tariffs. The Senatepassed JOBS Act included a carefully crafted transitional benefit for those firms currently receiving FSC/ETI assistance. However. the bill before us includes transitional relief that is still exportcontingent and could be challenged by the EU as still not being WTOcompliant. In fact. according to an article yesterday in the Washington Post. EU spokesman Anthony Gooch suggested that this legislation would not accomplish its central goal of lifting European sanctions due to the transitional assistance. This is the reason we have this legislation in the first place. and I am disappointed that the House conferees have potentially set up a repeat of tariffs on our Nations domestic manufacturers and exporters. That brings me to the other compelling reasons for the original JOBS Act: the bill. as passed by the Senate. replaced the Foreign Sales Corporation and Extraterritorial Income regimes with a more robust set of incentives for domestic manufacturing. At a time when domestic manufacturing. long the backbone of the American economy. is bleeding prized jobs to foreign countries. it is incumbent on Congress to put forward a responsible economic plan and provide important assistance to manufacturers that keep their operations here in the United States. While the conference agreement does include a tax deduction to provide assistance to a broadbased group of manufacturers. unlike the Senatepassed legislation. it does not make a distinction between manufacturing domestically or abroad. It removed the socalled haircut that would have provided an incentive for companies to do their manufacturing here at home instead of shipping it abroad. Yet again. we see that House Republicans are unwilling to stand up for those manufacturers. small and large. that have kept their operations here in the United States. In fact. if we look at the bill as a whole. we see that of the broadbased tax incentives. a larger net amount of money would be dedicated to international provisions than those targeted at production here at home. It is difficult to reconcile the very real challenges facing domestic manufacturers with the inclusion of huge tax breaks for multinational corporations. Ultimately. providing tax breaks to multinationals means that manufacturing jobs are going overseas. The corporate repatriation provisions in H.R. 4520 are responsible for a significant amount of these costs. but there is little evidence that they will ultimately help to create jobs. Even Secretary Snow. speaking for the Administration. seemed to understand this inequity. He wrote in a letter to Chairman GRASSLEY. and I quote: [T]he Administration also has concerns regarding the fairness of the repatriation provision included in both bills. This provision would offer international corporations a partial tax holiday for repatriating foreign income that Is currently held overseas. U.S. companies that do not have foreign operations and have already paid their full and fair share of tax will not be able to benefit from this provision. Moreover. the Council of Economic Advisers analysis Indicates that the repatriation provision would not produce any substantial economic benefits. The Administration believes the S3 billion revenue cost of this provision could be better used to reduce the tax burden of job creators in the United States. This is not the only place where this bill failed to live up to its full potential to help domestic manufacturers. I am deeply disappointed several months ago that lastminute lobbying by multinational corporations were effective in removing from the Senate bill a commonsense provision to help reduce offshore outsourcing termed contract manufacturing. Similarly. House Republicans voted to leave out the Dodd offshoring amendment. which would have prevented Federal taxpayers dollars from being used to support outsourcing in future government contracts. This is a commonsense measure to make sure that the Government does not actively contribute to outsourcing. and its rejection by the conferees is a sign of their strong disregard of the practice of buying American. This brings me to the subject of corporate tax shelters. We have been fighting to close these loopholes benefiting large companies for a decade. A recent study commissioned by the IRS estimated that abusive corporate tax shelters cost honest Americans as much as $18 billion annually. or $180 billion over 10 years. Put another way. every month that the majority and the administration obstruct efforts to shut down corporate shelters. it costs honest taxpayers over $1.5 billion. It has been several years now since the Enron debacle. and yet the majority has still not sent to the President a tax bill to shut down these shelters. While the Senate has taken actions over and over again to target shelters. they have been blocked by the majority party. For example. in June 2002. the Senate passed tax shelter legislation as a stand alone bill and as part of the CARE Act. The other chamber did not. The Senate passed it again in April 2003 as part of the CARE Act. and the other body rejected it. The Senate passed shelter legislation as part of the energy bill in July 2003. and the other chamber rejected it. The Senate passed shelter legislation as part of the Jobs and Growth stimulus bill in May 2003. and it was stripped out in conference. So I was pleasantly surprised to hear that tax shelter provisions were included in the conference agreement. Then I had a chance to look a little more closely. The conference bill is a shadow of the Senatepassed version. raising $40 billion less by closing corporate tax loopholes than the Senatepassed version. $15 billion of this lost opportunity to make the Tax Code fairer for all Americans would have eliminated phony transactions that have no economic substance and have been used by companies like Enron to avoid taxes. Another measure modified by the majority conferees would continue to allow those individuals who promote tax shelters to make profits while doing so. In contrast. the Senate would have levied a 100 percent penalty to prevent them from making any such profit at the expense of taxpaying Americans. Sadly. while the underlying core components of the bill are flawed at best. much of the rest of the bill is deeply defective. I am perhaps most disheartened over the section on tobaccoand the notable absence of language authorizing the FDA to regulate it. This might just be the largest childrens health issue facing Congress. The tobacco industry spent more last year than ever before on advertisingover $11.5 billionand children continue to become hooked on smoking while they are young and unable to understand the health ramifications of smoking. It is now believed that smokers could lose on average 10 years off their lifespanan entire decade. At a time when we are talking about soaring health care costs. it is vital that we regulate a substance that causes 440.000 deaths each year and results in more than $75 billion in direct medical costs annuallymuch of which is paid for by taxpayerfinanced health care programs. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that tobacco is perhaps the single most significant threat to public health in the United States and has effectively reaffirmed that the FDA is the most appropriate agency to regulate tobacco products. given the general scope of its authority and its emphasis on protecting the public health. It is now that Congress must act to clearly give the FDA the long overdue authority it requires to protect Americans. and particularly our children. I was willing to accept the inclusion of a tobacco buyout under the clear understanding that it would remain linked to giving the FDA regulatory authority over tobacco. Americans want us to take this important step. and but this report falls short. We all know that tobacco is a substance that reduces the quality of life and results in untimely death with lifelong use. We had a unique opportunity with this bill to make a real difference in helping to protect our nations children and the majority conferees killed this bipartisan effort that Senators KENNEDY and DEWINE spearheaded. The conference agreement left out other very important and widely supported worker protections that would have prevented President Bushs regulations that will deny overtime protections to 6 million hardworking men and women. including registered nurses. cooks. clerical workers. nursery school teachers. and many others from taking effect. The Senate has voted against the Bush overtime rule three times. and the other Chamber twice. The Senate FSC bill included two amendments that preserve workers overtimethe Harkin amendment that would block only the parts of the overtime rule that strip workers of overtime rights. and the Gregg amendment that passed 99 to 0. which would preserve overtime for 55 job categories. Majority conferees. at the behest of the White House. stripped the overtime protections from the report. Even after the Senate conferees voted yet again to retain the Harkin amendment. it was stripped out. The Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted in the 1930s to create a 40hour workweek. and it requires workers to be paid fairly for any extra hours. American workers work more hours than any others in the worldl.900 hours per year. Yet. still. they need more to get by and make ends meet. With 8 million Americans out of work. and with so many other families struggling to make ends meet. cutbacks on overtime are an unfair burden that Americas workers should not have to bear. Especially in times like these. its an incentive for job creation. because it encourages employers to hire more workers. instead of forcing current employees to work longer horns. I am amazed that the majority has again stripped this provision which has overwhelmingly passed both the House and the Senate on 5 separate occasions. This is a clear example of how the majority and this administration continue to turn their backs on working families. Now. in addition to leaving out a number of the important provisions that Ive just enumerated. it also contains many costly and extraneous ones. $101 million for NASCAR by changing the tax treatment of grandstand facilities. $44 million for importers of Chinese made ceiling fans. $28 million for cruise ship operators. $231 million in taxpayer funds to finance bonds for four socalled Green Bond mall developments. $247 million in bonus depreciation of some jets and planes. $5 billion over only two years for a new deduction for state and local sales taxes in a select few states. and $27 million for horse and dog gamblers. This one is especially interesting because it exempts foreign gamblers from paying taxes up front on their winnings at horse and dog tracks. My question is: Wheres the special tax break that will help struggling working families in my state? How does it help American workers by giving tax breaks for Chinese fans to be imported tax free to the United States? The Administration seems to agree. and Secretary SNOW also wrote in his letter to Chairman GRASSLEY that: Both the House and Senatepassed bills include a myriad of special interest tax provisions that benefit few taxpayers and increase the complexity of the tax code. Legislation taking up more than 1000 pages of statutory language (or even 400 pages) goes far beyond the bills core objective of replacing the FSC/ ETI tax provisions with broadbased tax relief that is WTOcompllant. At the same time. the majority party voted to strip the legislation of an amendment offered by Senator LANDRIEU that would provide a tax break to companies for paying the salaries of activated National Guardsmen and Reservists. Lastly. it continues to employ the same budget gimmickry as previous tax bills put forward by the majority party and the administration over the past 3 years. For example. a dozen of the tax cuts in this report will expire between 2005 and 2008. Assuming that these provisions are extended. the cost to the Treasury will increase by an estimated $80 billion! This bill could have been an ideal vehicle for bipartisan efforts to shape a comprehensive economic policy for our nations manufacturing sector. Unfortunately. it proved to be too alluring for the special interests who just could not restrain themselves. At a time of a record Federal budget deficitsmost recently pegged at $422 billion for Fiscal Year 2004this bill contains too many giveaways to corporations and not enough to help domestic manufacturers and working families. Most regrettably. its passage does not seem to guarantee that the EU will lift its harmful sanctions against numerous United States products. Companies in our home states are hurting from EU retaliatory tariffs. like jewelry manufacturers in Rhode Island. and the conferees should have taken the responsible path in assisting those who are struggling. But they did not."},{"1":"2005","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. I yield myself 7 minutes. I will explain very quickly what this amendment does. We just voted a few moments ago a sense of the Senate that we should take mandatory action with respect to global warming in the United States. We did not specify what the action was. Obviously. the McCainLieberman mandatory action failed earlier. but we at least went on record acceptingI think it was about 54 votes on the tabling motionthat we should do something with respect to domestic. What my amendment seeks to do is express the sense of the Senate specifically. and let me quote from it: ... that the United States should act to reduce the health. environmental and economic risks posed by global climate change and foster sustained economic growth through a new generation of technologies by (1) participating in international negotiations under the Convention with the objective of securing United States participation in fair and binding agreements that (A) advance and protect the economic interests of the United States. (B) establish mitigation commitments by all countries that are major emitters of greenhouse gases ... ) establish flexible international mechanisms to minimize the cost of efforts by participating countries. and (D) achieve a significant longterm reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions. The whole purpose of this is to get the United States of America engaged in an international process that will get all nations simultaneously working toward the same goal. Let me remind my colleagues we have heard some questions about the science raised over the course of the last hours. Just yesterday the scientific evidence on climate change was addressed by the G8 scientific panels. all the panels of the G8. including our own National Academy of Sciences. All of these science academies of the G8 nations said that the evidence on climate change is now clear enough for the leaders of G8 to commit to take prompt action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. I ask unanimous consent that this statement from the G8 science academics be printed in the RECORD."},{"1":"2006","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. I thank the chairman for yielding. The Chabot amendment is not about fiscal responsibility. The costs within this program. the cost of appeals and litigation. attempts by the agency to bulletproof all of its documents from those lawsuits amounts to 75 percent of the cost of running the program within the agency. In fact. if you took out those costs that are incurred because of lawsuits. the litigation. the appeals. and attempts by the agency to bulletproof their environmental documents. the Tongass forest sales would actually produce a 13 percent profit margin. In an effort to gain support from fiscal conservatives. some group called the Taxpayers for Common Sense has tried to couch this as a fiscal argument. and again 75 percent of the costs are brought in by many of the same groups that are supporting this amendment. These outside groups. because they have not been able to achieve their goals legislatively of completely devastating the forest program and eliminating any kind of timber sales. have now tried to do it in this manner. in bringing it before the appropriations bill and trying to limit the ability. Li 1730 Again. if you look at the actual cost in this entire program. 75 percent of the costs associated with these timber sales are because of the NEPA reviews. the appeals and the litigation. Only 25 percent is the actual cost of preparing the sale. Yes. I guess if you run up enough lawsuits. if you appeal all of those lawsuits. if you continue to badger the Forest Service. you can run up the cost to make this program unprofitable. But this is a long debate we have had in this House and trying to couch this as a fiscal debate. I believe. is just a smokescreen over what the true intention of most of these outside groups is. and that is just to try to eliminate the timber program completely. So I urge a no vote on the ChabotAndrews amendment."},{"1":"2007","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I rise today to ask for my colleagues support for this amendment. to improve Early Head Start. The amendment revises the training and technical assistance system by enSuring that these services are provided by entities with specific expertise in infant and toddler development. It also directs at least 50 percent of training and technical assistance funds directly to the grantees. These are the people on the ground working with children who are best able to prioritize their training needs for the purpose of program improvement. In our hearing on the bill in the Committee on Education and Labor. we heard that Head Start providers are not getting the assistance they need under the current system. One program director said that it had been 10 months since she saw her technical assistance specialist. The current system centralized control often results in the assistance specialist spending more time filling out forms for their supervisors than directly helping the program directors in the field. The bill we are debating today solves this problem for the Head Start program serving preschoolers by directing the responsibility for training and technical assistance responsibility into the Statebased system that can better meet the needs of the local providers. Early Head Start directors experience similar problems. and. therefore. should get a similar solution. This amendment provides that solution and. furthermore. requires that these Statebased technical assistance providers include individuals with infant and toddler expertise available to work with Early Head Start providers. Rigorous evaluations show that the Early Head Start program has made a positive difference in the lives of participating children and their families. This bill expands the Early Head Start program. which currently serves only 3 percent of eligible infants and toddlers. And as Early Head Start expands. we must ensure that individual programs have the knowledge and skills to provide positive outcomes for participants. This amendment will do that. and I urge all of my colleagues to support it."},{"1":"2008","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Madam Speaker. I come to the House floor tonight to talk. like I often do. a little bit about health care. And this is the first day that the Congress is back in session after the December recess. And legitimately. someone might ask is it maybe a little early to begin this type of discussion. But the reality is. since we didnt finish our work in the last year. it is entirely appropriate for us to begin this year talking about some of those same things that were left undone at the end of 2007. Specifically. the reauthorization of the State Childrens Health Insurance Program. An 18month extension was passed at the end of the last Congress. I was grateful for that. I voted in favor of that. But the reality is this Congress should do its work and reauthorize this program for the full 10 years as it was intended when the reauthorization was up last September. We had a lot of opportunities to do this in my committee. the Committee on Energy and Commerce. but we failed to have a markup in subcommittee. We had a markup in full committee that was little more than a charade. We brought a very bad bill to the House floor in August. It was passed. but was not taken up by the Senate because the bill was so flawed. Then we had the Senate bill come to the House floor and it was a new bill. not a conference committee report. We had ample opportunity to debate that and take it back to committee and have a subcommittee hearing and subcommittee markup. a full committee hearing and a full committee markup. but we chose not to do that. We brought that same bill to the floor and voted on it. The House passed because they have a majority on the other side. and the President vetoed It and the veto was sustained. 18 CONGR The same bill was brought up a second time in early October. The same result. The bill was passed. and the bill was vetoed and the veto was sustained. In the interim. many of us worked to try to overcome some of the obstacles to passage for this bill because we felt this was the correct thing to do. But the reality was that politics trumped policy. And at the end of the day. the best we could muster. at the end of December. at the very last minute. was to pass an 18month extension. Madam Speaker. perhaps I should be grateful for that. because with an 18month extension we will be past the next Presidential election before we are forced to look at this bill again. But I hope this Congress does not take that tactic. I hope this Congress takes seriously its obligation to study this problem and find out where the difficulties occurred last time and see if we cant come to the floor with a bill that could be broadly supported by both sides of the aisle. I think that is a possibility. But the reality. again last fall. some people thought the politics were more important than the policy. And the end result. well. we saw what the end result was. The same thing happened with our Medicare proposals. We have every year this mad scramble at the end of the year. If Congress doesnt do something because of the odd formulas by which we pay physicians in this country. physicians that we have asked to take care of our Medicare patients. but we have a very odd formula by which we reimburse those physicians. And as a consequence. every year at the last minute we are left scrambling. seeing if we cant do something. It is called the physician fix. It is almost like something that will happen on the winter solstice every single year. because if we dont do something by January 1. massive pay cuts are administered to the physician corps in this country. Again. the very physicians whom we have asked to take care of some of our sickest and most complex patients. and these physicians this past year faced a 10 percent pay cut. Now. at the last minute. we. did do something to forestall the pay cut. We passed a rather modest bill to give a onehalf percent positive update to physicians who take care of Medicare patients. But we only did it for 6 months time. which means we literally kicked the can down the field. And the reality is we will have to face this again in June. And guess what? The deeper we go into this year. the more politics will take over. because it is a Presidential election year. and it is a Presidential election year the likes of which this country has not seen since 1952. or perhaps even 1928. when both sides are running for essentially what is an open seat in the United States Presidency. Well. I did come to the floor tonight because I wanted to have a candid conversation about health care. I think many in this Congress know I had a life before Congress. I was actually a practicing physician for 25 years back in my home State of Texas. So I feel I can approach this problem from both the provider level. on the basis of that 25 years in practice. as well now as the policymaking level. the legislative level. because obviously we do deal with a lot of health care here on the floor of the House of Representatives. I want to talk in some greater detail about the issues pertaining to Medicare. and I will get to that. but let me step back and talk about where the status of health care is in this country. because when you watch the Presidential debate. it seems everyone is talking about health care. Perhaps that is a good thing. In reality. the conflict in Iraq is not as divisive as it was a year ago. And as a consequence. you hear less talk about this countrys Involvement in Iraq. And as a consequence. you hear more talk about domestic issues. Health care and the economy have replaced some of the rhetoric that we beard during the 2006 fall election and some of the rhetoric that we heard on the floor of the House a scant year ago regarding this countrys foreign policy. In reality. that is a good thing. It is a strange phenomenon when this country is prevailing in a conflict that we stop talking about it. I cant think of any other time in American history when that was the mindset. Nevertheless. that is what is occurring now. Again. as a consequence. we are talking a good deal more about health care. When you bear the talk about health care out on the campaign trail. you recognize there are some fairly different ideas that are out there and being talked about. And it is not that one person has any quarter on the best ideas. but it certainly lays the issue at the feet of the American people that there are very different ways of dealing with this problem. very different ways of setting the goal. very different ideas about what the goal should be. and obviously very. very different ideas about how to accomplish that. In fact. there is a lot of discussion about should we talk in terms of reform of our system of health care or is. in fact. the situation beyond the reform and we need to talk about actually transforming our method of health care in this country. And we will hear that debate play out. We will hear talk about things like mandates and universal coverage. Those are debates we should have at the national level. and those are debates where there should be broad participation. Madam Speaker. we lost a very good friend in Texas at the end of December. Ric Williamson was the chairman of our Texas Department of Transportation. He died rather suddenly at the end of year. an individual who was 54. Pt. 1 January 15. 2008 younger than I am. so needless to say. it was unexpected. During the memorial service that was held for Mr. Williamson later that week. a lot of discussion of how he had been a State legislator before he took the position with the Texas Department of Transportation. and many of his friends and former colleagues got up to talk about Ric Williamsons life. And almost to a person they talked about how Ric Williamson regarded politics as a full contact sport. That is you went at it with everything you had. but you do it openly. You do it in the committee room. You do it in the light of day. You dont do it behind closed doors in some secret conference in the middle of the night and cut a deal one side with the other. That is what this debate should be. It may be hard. We may come at each other again with full body contact in this debate. but it should be done on the floor of the House. It should be done on the floor of the committee rooms and not in a back room where a deal is cut at the last minute. Many options face us in this country. And again. we will bear a great deal of debate about things like universal coverage and mandates. We will hear a great deal about things like do we in fact craft policies that people actually want. or do we decide what policies people want and then administer them accordingly. But. Madam Speaker. freedom is the foundation of life. In my home State of Texas. that is very much the case. We thrive on unlimited options. Two years ago when we had the great Medicare part D debates. I remember at first there was a lot of criticism that no one will sign up to deliver these plans. There will be no plans. There will be a default government plan. So guess what happened? In my home State of Texas. we had 45. 46. 47 companies sign up to provide these drug plans. And then we were told there were too many choices. The reality is Americans thrive on choices. And choices are what this debate. in my opinion. a lot of what this debate should be about. It is what has made this country great. And. in fairness. it is what has made. at least from a scientific basis. the health care in this country the envy of the world. Well. again. the same kinds of options are going to be out there facing Americans during the debates. and I urge them to pay attention at every level. I know I must direct my remarks to the Chair. Madam Speaker. but if I could speak directly to the American people. I would encourage them to pay a great deal of attention to what is talked about. who is offering what. are they believable. and. in the end. do we think anything will really change no matter how many times they mention the word. When it comes to innovation. the United States of America is undisputably the worlds leader. In the last 25 years. 17 of the past 25 Nobel Prizes in medicine have been awarded to American scientists working in labs. That is a phenomenal record. Four out of the six most important discoveries of the last 25 years have occurred in this country. things like advanced scanning techniques. things like statin drugs to lower cholesterol. things like coronary artery stints and bypasses. things that have extended life to citizens who 30 years ago. quite frankly. there might not have been any help. there might not have been any hope. Now. innovations can improve health and life expectancy. It certainly does not mean that cant improve on a good thing. that we step back and rest on the accomplishments that are already there. But it certainly means in the environment that we provide in this country. quite honestly an environment that tolerates uncertainty from time to time. an environment that rewards risktaking from time to time. that environment is a good thing for the furtherance of the science of medicine and ultimately a good thing for health care in this country. Madam Speaker. one of the lead articles in this weeks New England Journal of Medicine. and I apologize. I have forgotten the authors name. I just read it briefly on my way up here this morning. but it talked about how doctors now need to be prepared for a patient coming into their office and saying. I just had extensive genetic testing done on my own at a low cost. and now I have some information about my own human genome. and I would like you to help me interpret that. Indeed. that day has arrived. And doctors in this country do need to be aware of these changes and do need to be prepared to answer their patients questions and provide insight and direction where insight and direction occur. and be able to provide the type of environment that will allow continued learning about this new science that has just arrived on our doorstep. Two companies now offer genetic testing. genomic testing. more appropriately. simply taking a swab of the inside of a cheek and sending it off to a company and waiting a few weeks and they come back and tell you all kinds of things about what your genomic makeup is. Madam Speaker. when I think back to when I first entered the doors of Parkland Hospital in July of 1977. I would have never believed. never believed that this type of technology would be available in my lifetime. let alone that this type of technology would be available for a reasonable cost. and such a reasonable cost that people just simply elect to have it done to find out a little bit more about themselves and perhaps underscore some risk factors that they already knew were there and perhaps alleviate some concern about risk factors that may not carry the weight that the patient thought they did. Its a phenomenal time that weve entered into. truly a transformational time in medicine. And it has happened before. During the last century. I can think of three times when the scientific advances were so rapid and so solid. and at the same time. there was so much social change brought by bodies that legislate. bodies that govern. that the practice of medicine was forever changed. Look what happened back around 1910. We were coming from a time where blistering. burning and bleeding were thought to be the peerreviewed. the evidencebased proper treatments to administer to patients who were in distress. And very abruptly. the world changed. And the world changed because we found out more about the practice of anesthesiology. The world changed because we found out a little bit about bloodbanking. The world changed because we found out a great deal more about the science and manufacture of vaccines. And then at the same time when all of that science was consolidating in the practice of medicine. we had the Flexner Commission and subsequently the Flexner Report commissioned by the United States Congress. And those activities now administered more at the State level. but suddenly we had that consolidation of medical school curricula across the country. Medical schools used to be able to teach all manner of things. Suddenly. they were conscripted or somewhat conscribed in what they could teach. but they began to teach evidencebased scientific fact in the medical schools. And it was just at the right time. because the scientific body of information was changing very rapidly. And if we fast forward to the middle of the 1940s. a country at war. 10 or 12 years before. Sir Alexander Fleming had found an unusual curiosity in his laboratory petri dish: a penicillin mold could inhibit the growth of bacteria. Well. that was an astounding discovery. but it was really little more than a laboratory curiosity until an American company came up with a method of producing large quantities of this substance that inhibited bacterial growth. and thus began the modern pharmaceutical industry in this country. But it was a good thing. because we were a country at war. And. indeed. that infectionfighting antibiotic went from a laboratory curiosity that was intensely labor intensive to produce and intensely expensive to administer. and it went to something that was available to the average person in this country. And. indeed. antibiotics were available to treat our soldiers who were injured during the landing at Normandy. and I dare say many life and limb were spared because of the availability and the inexpensive availability of that antibiotic. Another rather astounding scientific accomplishment that occurred at the same time. cortisone had been discovered several years before but cortisone was not commercially available. The way they got cortisone back then was to extract it from the adrenal gland of an ox. Well. if the ox was not anxious to give up their adrenal gland. you can imagine that was a pretty laborintensive process. But an individual that we honored on the floor of this House during the last Congress. Dr. Percy Julian. a Ph.D. biochemist. came up with a way of producing cortisone from a plant precursor. from a soybean precursor. Again. same situation: Suddenly you had a medicine that was profoundly useful. but only in limited application because it was so expensive and so hard to obtain in the amounts necessary to treat a patient. and now suddenly it was readily available and it was available at a very low cost because it now could be mass produced. Well. these two striking phenomena occurred in the 1940s. And what else happened in the 1940s? Again. were a country at war. The President wanted to prevent an inflationary spiral. or an inflationary cycle. so he enacted wage and price controls. Employers wanted to keep their employees working. They didnt want someone else stealing their employees away. because employees were at a premium. The vast majority of Americans were off involved in fighting the war. So employers came up with the idea of maybe lets offer some fringe benefits. health insurance. retirement benefits. And wait a minute. Dont think we can do that because of the wage and price controls. But a court case ensued. as so oftentimes happened. and the Supreme Court ruled that indeed these benefits could be offered. and not only were they not in violation of the wage and price control statutes. but they also could be administered as pretax expenses. So suddenly we had the vast social change of employerderived health insurance arriving rather suddenly in the 1940s. and at the same time you. doctors. for the first time in the history of medicine had a cheap. inexpensive way of combating infection and treating people with other inflammatory conditions with cortisone. Again. fast forward to the 1960s. Big changes were on the horizon. In fact. in 1945. President Roosevelt died of malignant hypertension. died of a stroke. In the mid1960s we were beginning to develop medicines that treated accelerated hypertension. or malignant hypertension. We were developing medicines that could treat psychoses. We were developing the first medicines that were now known as antidepressants. a lot of changes on the horizon. And what else changed in the mid1960s? For the first time. the Federal Government got involved in a big way. In a big way. in paying for health care with the passage of Medicare in 1965 and. subsequently. Medicaid thereafter. And now were at a time in our countrys history. where almost 50 cents out of every health care dollar thats spent originates right here on the floor of the House of Representatives. because of the vast expansions of the expenditures in Medicare. Medicaid. VA system. Federal prison system. Indian Health Service. a lot of different ways where the Federal Government has a participatory role in health care. one that quite frankly was never envisioned 40 years ago. So the world indeed has changed because of some of the social changes that was brought about by changes in this Congress. Well. I submit. Madam Speaker. that the world of medicine is on the brink of another such transformational change. Ive already alluded to the changes that are going to happen in the realm of genomic medicine. a lot of advances in the types of scanning that are available. the types of imaging that are available. Medical care in this country is going to become a great deal more personalized with the development of genomic medicine. It is of necessity going to be more participatory. but at the same time more preventive. And these are good things. These are reasons to make one excited about a career in health care and in some ways Im envious of the young people today who look up from their desk in high school or college and say. I want to do that. I want a career in health care. I know it takes a long time. I know the governments interfering at a lot of different levels. but I want a career in health care because its so exciting. And theres still that basic altruistic feeling inside of a lot of us in health care that we want to do that because Its the right thing to do. Well. we are on the cusp of a true transformational time in health care in this country. Now. can Congress properly interact with that transformation as it occurs? Its very difficult. and our history is not great in that regard because Congress is inherently a transactional body. We take money from here and we move it over here. We create winners and losers in this system. And all too often the transactional can be the enemy of the transformational. And it is our job. our job. every one of us who sits here in a seat in this House of Representatives. to ensure that our transactional bias does not interfere with the transformation as its occurring under our very feet. Congress cant legislation the transformations going on in health care. Its happening anyway. Its happening whether we want it to or not. But Congress can certainly interfere with that transformation if we dont set the proper regulatory tone. if we dont provide the proper liability environment. if we dont provide the proper incentives. Congress can actually be the enemy of transformation. And. Madam Speaker. there are several more things that I want to cover this evening. But I see Im joined by one of my colleagues. one of my colleagues in the House of medicine as well as one of my colleagues in the House of Representatives. And I would like to yield to the gentleman from Georgia such time as he may consume to likely address the issue of medical liability. because that is a big aspect of when we talk about health care reform in this country. Its a big part of the equation. So Ill yield to my friend from Georgia."},{"1":"2009","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee and his staff for their hard work on this years budget resolution. I regret. however. that the discretionary spending level is less than President Obamas request. The Obama administration. to its great credit. recognizes the serious consequences of the previous administrations lack of investment in American infrastructure. I will continue to support President Obamas full discretionary budget request. I look forward to working with the chairman of the Budget Committee on this matter as the resolution moves forward. I also compliment the chairman for making the right decision to forego reconciliation instructions in this budget. Unfortunately. the House budget resolution does include reconciliation instructions. and that should be of concern to every Senator. The House provisions open the door in conference to language requiring as many as five Senate committees to report reconciliation legislationthe Commerce. Science. and Transportation Committee. the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. the Finance Committee. the Environment and Public Works Committee. and the Health. Education. Labor. and Pensions Coinmittee. While the House reconciliation instructions are ostensibly for health reform and education bills. they could also be used to report other bills under the jurisdictions of those committeesincluding climate legislationas long as the bill complies with the budgets net deficit reduction instructions. Whatever legislation those committees decide to report. their bills would require only 51 votes for Senate passage. Under the Budget Act. debate is limited to 20 hours. and amendments are sharply curtailed. I am one of the authors of the reconciliation process. Its purpose is to adjust revenue and spending levels in order to reduce deficits. It was not designed to cut taxes. It was not designed to create a new climate and energy regime. and certainly not to restructure the entire health care system. The ironclad parliamentary rules are stacked against a partisan minority. and also against dissenting views within the majority caucus. It is such a dangerous process that in the 1980s. the thenRepublican majority and thenDemocratic minority adopted language. now codified as the Byrd Rule. intended to prohibit extraneous matter from being attached to these fasttrack measures. The budget reconciliation process will not air dissenting views about health and climate legislation. It will not allow for feedback from the people or amendments that might improve the original proposals. If there are rulessuch as the Byrd Rulethat frustrate Senators. I hope that they will take the time to understand that those rules exist for a reason. They protect every Senator. regardless of whether they are in the majority or minority party. because even a Democrat in the majority today may have a viewpoint in the minority tomorrow. I understand the White House and congressional leadership want to enact their legislative agenda. I support a lot of that agenda. but I hope it will not require using the reconciliation process. Again. I commend the chairman of the Budget Committee for excluding reconciliation instructions. and look forward to working with him to ensure those instructions are not included in conference."},{"1":"2010","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. I rise today to talk about our military construction program and some concerns I have about an apparent shift in strategy. what this means for our American soldiers and their families and for the growing debt and deficits we are seeing on the taxpayers of this country. Without question. our military construction program should be fiscally responsible and driven by the future security posture of the U.S. forces. Dating back to the end of the Cold War. the U.S. military determined that our Armed Forces would be best trained and equipped for service when stationed at installations on U.S. soil. Our military adopted a force projection strategy that allows our U.S.-stationed service men and women to deploy from home rather than being based primarily overseas. This Congress has been very supportive of the Armys transformation to a more modular and expeditionary force structure. allowing more troops to be stationed in the United States. In 2005. the Overseas Basing Commission reaffirmed the force projection strategy. It applauded the vision behind the Pentagons efforts to transform the military and restation tens of thousands of military personnel back on U.S. soil. So the Pentagons strategy. endorsed by the Overseas Basing Commission. has guided the way Congress directs resources and funding for military construction facilities. We have invested more than $14 billion to build housing. stationing. training. and deployment capabilities at major military installations in the United States. We have proven we can best train and deploy from the United States and do it more costeffectively. Despite these taxpayerbacked investments. the Pentagons current MILCON program is shifting military construction projects. military forces. and taxpayer dollars overseas. Strategically. this would set in motion a worldwide transformation of U.S. basing that would actually expand our overseas presence. and this at a time when the aid given to American efforts in the war on terror is. with a few exceptions. not impressive. Fiscally. the Department of Defense is pursuing expensive and. in some cases. duplicative military construction projects in Europe. Korea. and Guam without demonstrating adequate cost efficiencies or projected future costs. This shift in global posture fundamentally disconnects with stateside basing capabilities and reverses the Overseas Basing Commissions recommendations. Europe: In Germany massive plans are underway to move U.S. Army headquarters from Heidelberg to Wiesbaden. I question this move because European and African Commands already have substantial infrastructure in Stuttgart where efficiencies would be available. The Government Accountability Office does not believe the Army will achieve any cost savings. Not only would these huge and costly projects create thousands of foreign jobs. but they would require continuous taxpayer funding to maintain facilities and training capabilities. The United States has averaged spending $278 million per year in Germany in the last 5 years. but the Department of Defense now plans to raise that spending to $750 million per year. It costs nearly 15 percent less to build in the United States than to build in Germany. and while American taxpayers have invested $1.4 billion in German infrastructure from 2006 to 2010. Germanys contribution has averaged $20 million per year. or less than 10 percent. This is a poor taxpayer investment considering the serious limitations to U.S. military training and deployment capabilities overseas. It would also create duplicative headquarters at several locations in Germany. Our troops must have access to training areas where they can maneuver freely. conduct livefire exercises. and work with night vision devices. Many overseas locations prohibit such intensive training. Others allow only certain aspects of the training to be done under closely monitored circumstances. These limitations hinder the readiness of our troops while taxing our citizens more. Deployment impediments also exist in Europe. During times of peace and war. our troops face restrictions traveling through many countries. In 2003. deploying American forces from Germany into Iraq was complicated when several European countries denied U.S. troops access to air and ground routes. Merely having our troops forwarddeployed is no guarantee they will be available when and where we need them. Korea: The Department of Defense is also planning to spend millions to build deployment facilities in Korea. The Pentagon is proposing to shift 1year deployments for troops alone to 3year tours that include their families. This change would expand U.S. presence in Korea from 30.000 service personnel to approximately 84.000. counting dependents. Substantial taxpayer funding would be required to build adequate housing. schools. hospitals. fitness centers. childcare facilities. commissaries. and more. We have asked for the numbers that would be projected for this. The Department has not given us any numbers nor any projections on the costs of adding 50.000 more people into Korea than we now have. Investing these resources into Korea makes no sense when we are already building up infrastructure and deployment capabilities at U.S. bases where amenities support military families and are well established. Guam: Plans to shift Marines currently stationed in Japan to the tiny island of Guam are also problematic. There are significant environmental concerns with trying to accommodate such a large number of military personnel in such a small space. and the island lacks sufficient existing infrastructure. In addition to that. the timeline for transitioning marines stationed in Japan is implausible and the costs are staggering. They are now estimated at $16 billion. With these considerable barriers. better basing alternatives should be explored. Again. we have asked the Department to look into this. to give alternatives. We have suggested alternatives. but we have received no feedback from the Department. The Department of Defense has indicated this new military construction program is intended to build partnership capacity. Some argue that U.S. presence overseas provides assurance to our allies and deterrence to our adversaries. History has shown this is not always the case. Basing American military personnel at key locations in Europe did not deter the Russians from conducting military operations against Georgia in 2008. Even with our 30.000 troops in Korea. North Korea did not hesitate to attack a South Korean naval vessel in May of this year. Lets look at what the partnership agreements we are seeking have given us so far. We are in a war on terror in which the United States now has more than 78.000 troops. Germany has 4.350. The United Kingdom has double what Germany has. So the United Kingdom. which has a smaller population. has more troops by double than Germany. Yet we are looking at all of this buildup in Germany for building partnership capacity. Germany contributes 4 percent of NATO troops to Afghanistan. but they have strict rules of engagement that include not going on offense and restrictions on night operations. So if we are going to do so much ourselves. does it make sense for the American taxpayer to be building what would be about a billion and a half more in Germany. in facilities that we already have in the United States? Or if there needs to be more Army building in Germany. at least do it in Stuttgart where the Army already has a headquarters. instead of a whole new operation in Wiesbaden. If the United States wants to make sure our assure our allies and deter our enemies. we should do it with strong military capabilities and sound policy. not by keeping troops stationed overseas. siphoning funds from equipment and arms. and putting it into duplicative military construction. Instead of breaking ground on military projects abroad and advancing the Departments new goal of building partnership capacity. we should be building American infrastructure. We are carrying the heaviest load by far in the war on terror. and we are carrying it for freedomloving people throughout the world. We need to build up bases in our country which we have already done to accommodate the strategy since the Cold War. Yet now we appear to be reversing that strategy. and I am asking why. I have asked the Department of Defense. I have asked the Secretary of Defense for answers and have not yet been able to receive anything that would show why we would make such a huge investment in these foreign bases. with training constraints and deployment constraints. when we could do the same thing at home and deploy our troops at will. Following World War II. the United States constructed bases in Europe to establish a strong presence as nations rebuilt. We stayed in Europe and placed bases in Korea to protect the interests of America and its allies during the Cold War. The world has changed. and with it our Nations military priorities must also change. Our military construction investment should reflect our strategic principles. It should meet the needs of military families. It should maximize the force flexibility of our modern military. and it should demonstrate the fiscal discipline that taxpayers rightly expect. Secretary Gates has made fiscal discipline a priority at the Department of Defense. He has said we are going to cut defense spending. So this military construction plan is puzzling. I am not sure the military and the Department heads are on the same wavelength because we are looking at $1 billion of foreign construction we do not need with capacity we have already built in America. So I am asking the Department of Defense to look at this and to make sure we are in every way having respect for the taxpayers and making sure our military and our families have"},{"1":"2011","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I yield myself 2 minutes. Mr. Chairman. this amendment that is before the House this evening is an amendment that shuts off the funding within this continuing resolution to what we know as the DavisBacon Act. The DavisBacon Act is an old and archaic act that was generated during the Depression era. the early years of the Depression era. in about 1931. It was designed to keep the African American workers out of the trade unions in New York. Thats the source of it. I have dealt underneath this law for my working life as a construction contractor. so my handson experience with DavisBacon. I believe. is as strong as anyones in this Chamber. The costs that are added to our construction projects are what we should be thinking about here in this 112th Congress. in this Congress of austerity. on this night that weve had of cutting spending and cutting spending. and its this: According to Heritage Study. the extra wages that are paid out unnecessarily total $10.9 billion. I have done this study within my own construction company. and have looked at the difference in the cost of the DavisBacon Federal wage scale. They will call it prevailing wage. I will tell you we know its union scale. mandated by Federal law. and there is no reason for us to adhere to a union scale mandated by Federal law. My numbers show this: It increases the cost of a project between 8 and 35 percent depending on how much is materials and how much is labor. Other data out there show an increase of 9 to 37 percent. Our numbers match well. The costs of compliance for contractors are over $190 million a year. and it distorts the relationship between management and labor. We are. Mr. Chairman. in an era where our question becomes this: Do we want to create jobs or do we want to cost jobs? Do we want to build 4 miles of road under DavisBacon or do we want to build five? Do we want to build four schools or do we want to build five? Do we want to have an inflation of wages by an average of 22 percent. which is according to some of the wage and hour studies? Do we want to see the price go up? Do we want to see a construction industry that reduces workers by as much as 25.000 a year in minority workers? I reserve the balance of my time."},{"1":"2012","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chair. I rise today in strong opposition to the socalled Conservation and Economic Growth Act. H.R. 2578. On behalf of my constituents and millions of other Americans who believe in protecting our public lands and natural resources. I am opposed to this bill. This bill is yet another in a long string of antienvironmental assaults that the Republican majority has put forth relentlessly throughout the last two years. Most of its 14 titles do nothing to promote conservation or economic growth. Rather. they advance ineffective and unnecessary policies that undermine longstanding. successful laws like the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. the Endangered Species Act. the Wilderness Act. the National Environmental Policy Act. the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. and the American Indian Religious Freedom Act. One of the most concerning provisions of this bill seeks to create a 100mile zone along the northern and southern U.S. borders that would allow U.S. Customs and Border Protection to circumvent laws protecting Native rights. clean water. clean air. wildlife habitat and recreational opportunities in areas rich in hunting. fishing and outdoor recreation opportunities in National Parks. Forests. refuges and recreation areas. This undermines the balance between security and preservation of public lands. putting at risk some of Americas most renowned natural treasures such as Joshua Tree National Park in my home state of California. And the Department of Homeland Security doesnt even want it. calling this provision unnecessary and bad policy. Another provision would reverse. for the first time in Congressional history. the National Wild and Scenic River designation for part of the Lower Merced River in California. The Merced River was given this designation in 1992. under the administration of George H.W. Bush. and Wild and Scenic River protections have successfully preserved miles of pristine U.S. waters. enjoyed by a vast outdoor tourism. sporting and recreation industry. The Merced River runs through Yosemite Valley. one of Americas most popular natural wonders. and is a tributary to the San Joaquin River that provides most of the water supply for Californias agricultural industry. This provision would remove vital protections for one of Californias most important water lifelines in a neverbeforeseen manner. and undermine valuable economic activity among some of the most hardhit California communities. The bill would allow the clearcutting of Americas largest remaining oldgrowth temperate rainforest in the Tsongas National Forest of Alaska. reverse the prohibition of vehicle use on the fragile habitats of Cape Hatteras National Seashore. and mandate the killing of sea lions in the Pacific Northwest in order to protect endangered fish species ... This is the Republicans conservation and jobs bill: killing sea lions and destroying landscapes and habitat across the nation. As a leading member on the House Small Business Committee and a firm defender of environmental protection. I believe striking the right balance of policy has always been key to our economic growth and our strength as a nation. H.R. 2578 does not accomplish that goal. In fact it does much to undermine it. H.R. 2578 is wrong for America. I strongly encourage my colleagues to oppose this bill. and any measure introduced that undermines the conservation of Americas treasured public lands and natural resources."},{"1":"2013","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President.

It is something that I would encourage a lot of the Members to participate in and express the wishes of their constituents and their opinions here on the floor so that not only you can turn an ear and listen to this presentation here tonight. but also so that it inspires dialogue all across America. We will remain a free country and we can remain a constitutional Republic if we have open debate and open dialogue and if the values of the American people remain consistent with our roots. I would first. Mr. Speaker. start out with listening to the dialogue of the gentleman who spoke ahead of me. and I would note that his statement that there are people that went ahead of him and his family that are blue collar. it seems to me to be maybe a generation removed from the real America that most of it is blue collar. And I think it is important to note that this country that we are is not going to continue to prosper unless we have people whom people respect and honor and who produce goods and services that have a marketable value here at home. For those that get paid to pontificateI. among them. okaythat is an important function also. For those who get paid to sit on the couch. that is not so important a function. But those that produce goods and services that have a marketable value here and abroad are the ones that grow our economy. In the private sector. it allows us to be competitive with the countries around the world. I think of my neighbors. many of whom are engaged in agriculture and how we compete with the most competitive economy in the world and we compete in a favorable way and we set the pace. We set the pace in productivity. We set the pace in efficiency. We set the pace in quality and in food safety. That is the circle around my neighborhood that you can see in any direction looking out from my house. I am proud of those neighbors who produce those goods and services that have a marketable value here at home. A lot of that. most of it is the kind of thing we would call bluecollar work. I am impressed by the professionals that come here to Congress. I came from the construction world. handson. in the ditch. shovel in hand. grease gun. wrench. steering wheel. yes. pencil and calculator from the lowest guy on the totem pole to the guy who started a company to now a secondgeneration King Construction Company. We have been engaged in this economy for I believe this will be our 40th season that we are engaged in now. You see the flow of the economy. and you have respect for those who put their hands. their back. and their mind to work every day. I appreciate. also. a great deal these values of America. the roots of who we are as a people. I was observing this morning. as I was getting ready to leave my place. that there was an individual who was interviewed on FOX this morning in their morning show by Steve Doocy. and it was Mallory Factor. an author I happen to know. an individual I count as a friend. He laid out the four principles of conservatism. and I thought it was a useful thing. I took the notes down and put them in my pocket because I believe he is exactly and succinctly right that this country needs to be rooted in those principles of conservatism. Without them. we are cast adrift. Here are the four principles that he laid out: The first one is respect for the tradition and wisdom of our past generations. That is a fairly succinct way of saying our Founding Fathers got it right. They laid down a foundation. a foundation in faith. free enterprise. and fidelity that has been the foundation for America becoming the unchallenged greatest Nation in the world. And if we are to stay that way. we need to remain respectful to the traditions and wisdom of past generations. The second one is a rule of law. Mr. Speaker. you have heard me speak often and consistently about the rule of law. Lady Justice is often portrayed as blind. The statue of Lady Justice is of her holding the scales of justice. perfectly balanced scales of justice. weighed equally on either side. But Lady Justice is blindfolded because she doesnt see class or race or ethnicity or sex. She sees simply here is a human being before the court to be treated the same as any other human being. regardless of where they might sit in the social stratification by wealth. by race. by ethnicity. by sex. whatever the qualities might be. Whatever the qualifications might be. Lady Justice is blind. and the rule of law must apply to everyone equally. That is number two. The third one is the belief in an individual freedom and liberty. And I will go a little further than Mr. Factor in that these rights come from God. Our Founding Fathers understood. articulated. and wrote: We hold these truths to be selfevident. all menand that means men and women in the vernacularare created equal. and they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. It is an individual belief. the belief in individual freedom and libertynot a freedom that is granted to you by government. not one that is bestowed upon you by the sovereign or the king. but this Godgiven individual liberty that comes from God that we then entrust from the people to the government. We loan our sovereign rights to the government to organize our society. Government doesnt have the power. It is we the people that have the power. and we loan that to government. And if it is the other way around. if government grants rights. then government can also take those rights away. If that is the case. we would be similar to many of the other governments. many of the other civilizations. and we are not. We are the United States of America. founded upon four of these conservative principles. All of these principles are conservative principles: the respect for tradition and wisdom of past generations. the rule of law. the belief in individual freedom and liberty. and the fourth thing is a belief in a law higher than mans law. That is Gods law. Mr. Speaker. those are the four principles of conservatism. A little tidbit of wisdom that came out this morningand I made a little note and slipped it in my pocketI think it is important that we here in this Congress reflect upon those values that made America great and what it is going to take to strengthen those values. restore those values. and carry America to the next level of our destiny. When this Congress deviates from those principles. when this Congress deviates from the Constitution. when the Congress deviates from individual rights. and when the Congress decides they can tax some people and transfer that wealth to other people and somehow be a leveler or some kind of a wealth transfer that resolves this class envy issue. then America is diminished because what it does is it diminishes the vitality of our people. If you get out of bed and go to work every day and you know that Uncle Sam is going to get his share. the minute you punch that timeclock. Uncle Sams hand comes out. and when he gets what he wants for the day. it goes in his pocket. Then the Governors hand comes out. and he puts it in his pocket. Then you have some other taxes to pay along the way. and when that is all done. some time in the afternoon. you get to actually work for yourself and your family. Well. that is a little bit depressing to think you dont get to work even in the morning. If you go to work at 8 in the morning. you are taking your lunch break before you are getting anything for you and your family. Now. what if the government is sitting there taking it all? What if it was we are going to confiscate all of the money you earn? Then we will deal it out to these other people. and you will get your government welfare check just like everybody else. and we will all have the same resources to work with. We are all going to have the same amount of food. clothing and shelter. and recreation. We are all going to have the same health insurance policy. We are all going to drive an equalvalue car. but some have to work. and those who dont want to dont. Think about that. I have heard that. I have heard that debate on this floor. People will sayfrom over here on the leftist side of the aisle. they will say those that want a job should have a job. which implies that those who dont want to work shouldnt have to. So if they are ablebodied and ableminded. then they should be contributing to this economy or have earned and stored up the wealth to sustain themselves. not tax the other person that is punching that timeclock or going to work for that salary because what happens is. pretty soon. the one who is being taxed to fund the one who is not working figures out that it doesnt pay so much to work. It happens in the margins. so people start moving across from one side to the other. and over time. you will have good. smart. productive people who are smart enough to figure out that it doesnt pay for me to do this any longer. so they will drift over into maybe a parttime job. maybe work under the table. maybe some black market stuff. or they will tap into some of the 80 different meanstested Federal welfare programs we have in this country and take their standard of living up above that they might have if all they did was work. That is where this country has gone. The welfare program has grown so great that it has discouraged some of our most productive people. It is a disincentive. It discourages me that. if we are maybe a generation removed. as I listened to the gentleman from the Hudson Valley. he is a generation removed from blue collar. I would like to think that we are always going to need bluecollar people. We are always going to need for this country to have a middle class. a middle class that is growing in numbers and increasing in prosperity in relation to the productivity that they are putting out. and this country is always going to need to compete with the other countries in the world. We cant just collapse down into the idea that we are going to be an economy that has professionals that live in gated communities that hire servants at a cheap rate. and then they will have the people that are a diminishing middle class and the unskilled and the low skilled that will make a meager wage. always keeping that meager wage down by a refueling of legal and illegal unskilled immigrants coming into this country that can only compete in the unskilled jobs. The highest level of unemployment that we havethe double digit unemployment in this country are the people in the lowest skilled jobs. So how is it that almost every Democrat and a pretty respectable number of Republicans can leap to this conclusion. which is we need more unskilled workers. we need more of these workers to come in because it will grow the economy? Well. just because you have somebody. if you bring in 1.000 peopleand we know that we are going to have to educate the children especially and the youth. we will have to provide health care and housing and nutrition. the food. clothing. and shelteras I said. 1.000 people could come in. and if one of them does a days work. that contributes to the GDP. the gross domestic product. So if the days work of one in 1.000 contributes to the GDP. they. by their definition. say the economy is growing. The economy will grow if you have more and more immigration. and they dont say unskilled. Well. we have an opening here for some skilled people to come into this country. We have an oversupply of unskilled. We have 101.4 million Americans of working age who are simply not in the workforce101.4 million. that is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The numbers total this: those 16 and up who are of working age. plus those who are on unemployment todayofficially signed up on unemploymentadd those two numbers together. 101.4 million. A third of our population is of working age and not in the workforce. Yes. some are retired. and some are handicapped. and some are homemakers. and some of them are in school. but a whole lot of them could actually be recruited to come into the workforce and produce that good or service with marketable value and increase our GDP. What is the cost to our society for putting more of the peoplethe 101.4 million that are not in the workforce. what is the cost to our society? What if we called 10 million in? What if we called 20 million in? What if we brought 30 or 40 million of the 101.4 million in and put them in the workforce? What does that do? Well. a significant percentage of them are on welfare and unemployment. so they are off the welfare and unemployment rolls. That reduces the burden for the taxpayers. When they go to the workforce. they are in the productive sector of the economy. They take their wage. They pay their own payroll tax. That means they are paying their Social Security and their Medicare and their Medicaid. so we get a twofer. We reduce the welfare rolls. We get more and more taxpayers. We bring Social Security into balance just simply by virtue of more people going to work. and we have less of a deficit in our entitlementsMedicare and Medicaidbecause they need less of it. That is what happens if you get this country going at the right direction. There are a number of ways to do that. You cant do it with a President who doesnt believe in work. for one thing. and when they learned. according to the CBO score. that ObamaCare would cost this economy the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs. in other words. 40 hours a week timesand that is 40 hours. not the 30 hours that are in ObamaCare40 hours a week times 2.5 million workers. that is the reduced amount of productivity that comes because of the disincentives to work that are associated with ObamaCare. That is the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs. What does the administration say? They say: well. that is going to be a good thing because. if you are a homemaker. now you get to make more home. If you are an artist. you get to paint more paintings. If you have hobbies. you get to pursue your hobbies. and if you are a parent. you get to spend more time with your children. This is the first time. I believe. in the history of this country. that a President of the United States and his administration have taken the position that less work was good for America. which just goes to show you that human beings have an almost indefinite capacity to selfrationalize. Mr. Speaker. That is what happened with the Obama administration. They have exercised their almost infinite capacity to selfrationalize on piece after piece of this. They moved their socialist agenda. and then they selfrationalize along the way. and now. we are watching as ObamaCare has been a mess. It has been a debacle. and we are watching these numbers. The administration says we got 7.1 million people to sign up. That was their goal of 7 million. Miraculously. they overshot it by a little bit. What we dont know is how many of those 7.1 million were insured before ObamaCare. how many decided that they would opt out of their existing policy and into an exchange policy. how many of them lost their insurance because of ObamaCare and had no choice. if they wanted to remain insured. but to opt into an exchange under ObamaCare. and what percentage of the 7.1 million were actually uninsured without affordable options and found their way onto an ObamaCare exchange and purchased insurance. Once you go through all that. how many of them were not subsidized out of the 7.1 million? What would be the point. Mr. Speaker. and if we look at a society that supposedly had 48 million people without their own health insurance policy. I really wasnt alarmed by that because I dont know where the right comes from to own your own health insurance policy. but we provided health services to everybody in this country. at a minimum. to those who show up at an emergency room. So somehow. they twisted this around to everybody has a right. everybody needs to own their own health insurance policy. I stood on this floor 4 years ago or so and made the argument that. of the 48 millionwhen you subtract from that those who qualify for Medicaid and. from that. those who make over $75.000 a year and presumably could buy their own health insurance. those who qualify. those who are unlawfully present in the United States. and you subtract from the 48 million. down to the number of those who are uninsured. your 48 million became 12.1 million. which is 4 percent of our population in the entire health care system of the United States. the insurance system and the delivery system. is entirely redirected. transformed under ObamaCare. to try to get at that 4 percent number. Meanwhile. it looks to me that we will have more people uninsured. not less. By the way. if you want to sign up in the rest of this year. sorry. you are out of luck. you missed the signup deadline. Now. except for some narrow conditions. you will not be able to get insurance in this country. It is a calamity. It is one of the calamities. Another one of the calamities. in the time that I have remaining. is a reflection upon the hearing today where Attorney General Holder came before the House Judiciary Committee. His testimony comes about once a year before the Judiciary Committee. It is our job to have oversight over the Justice Department. We have done that for a long. long time. As each of the members of the panel questioned Attorney General Holder under oath. here is how I reflect upon this: I asked Eric Holder if he still held the position he did when I last questioned him. in that the Department of Justice is an independent department that doesnt take directive from the President. and his job is to provide equal justice under the law. He agreed with that statement. I think it is a proper way to frame the job of Attorney General. but to argue that the Attorney General is not politically influenced by the President of the United States is a pretty tough argument to make when you think of this. Mr. Speaker. I take you back to 2008. This was in the last weeksor. actually. the last months of the Bush administration. Senator Ted Stevens. for 40 years. represented Alaska in the United States Senate. There were charges brought against him that were evaluated and investigated by Federal officers of the FBI. On October 27. 2008. Senator Ted Stevens was found guilty of charges of corruption brought against him. Eight days later. he lost his election to nowSenator BEGICH in Alaska. In October of the following year. formerSenator Stevens was killed in a tragic plane crash. but here is the modern news. Mr. Speaker: on March 27 of this year. it is announced. in a little news story that hardly got any play. that at least one of the FBI agents. Mary Beth Kepner. has been severely disciplined. and that discipline has been imposed forlet me say violations during the investigation and the prosecution of Senator Ted Stevens. Now. he is dead. He cant speak for himself. He was convicted in a trial that took place and was concluded 8 days before his election. He narrowly lost the election in Alaska. This prosecution. if it was investigated and operated in the fashion that would be reflected when you see the language that Mary Beth Kepner. one of the FBI agents. was severely disciplined. and that discipline has been imposed. what is the discipline? What did they do? Do we think Eric Holder is prosecuting. now. Mary Beth Kepner for her involvement in the prosecution of Ted Stevens. which may or may not have. but likely did bring about a change in the election of the United States Senate. so that it gave the Senate a 60vote Democrat majority. and they were able to cram through components of ObamaCare that they would not have been able to cram through otherwise? This. you would think. would be worthy of at least a comment on the part of Attorney General Eric Holder to look into and see: Is it worthy of. now. investigation and prosecution? Or could you at least release a statement as to the acts that she committed and the investigation that you did? If the case is closed. tell us. When you have FBI agents improperly conducting themselves to the extent that the Holder Justice Department severely disciplined them. you have to wonder if it didnt change the course of history. You have to wonder. if the FBI had not conducted themselves in that fashion that brought about the severe discipline. would Ted Stevens have been reelected? Would that have changed the results in the United States Senate? Would we. maybe. perhaps. not be living under ObamaCare today if those actions had not taken place inside this Justice Department? You would think the Attorney General would look into that or at least have a comment. That is number one. The second one would be the very aggressive overreach of the investigation of Aaron Swartz. and that topic is something that brought about his suicide. and there has been much dialogue in this country about that. Another one that I brought up to General Holder is this: the investigation and prosecution of Conrad Barrett. Now. we have all. Mr. Speaker. heard about the knockout game in this country. It is when youth. generally speaking. will go pick someone and decide. I am going to punch them and knock them out in the street. and see if I can do it with one punch. and my buddies are going to see me do this. Sometimes it is videotaped. and we see this on television. In the cases that I have seen and in the cases that have been reported. it is almost always black on white crime. The knockout game appears to be black on white crime. I fought against. as well as did LOUIE GOHMERT of Texas. the hate crimes legislation because that just turns into a tool. and when you punish someone for what you think they think rather than for the overt act that they commit. you are getting into an area of law that allows for a lot of discretion on the part of the prosecution. and it may or may not result in more justice. I believe we ought to severely punish the people who are committing the overt acts. but we should not have gone down the road of the hate crimes legislation because that becomes a tool that can be used now to divide people against each other based upon whatever particular minority group we might be in. You would think. with a country full of black on white crime and with a knockout gamesomething that has been all over the news for months nowthat Eric Holder could find a way. if he wanted to prosecute a hate crime. to pick one of those African American youths who has gone in there and slugged and punched out someone on the streets who was targeted because of their difference in race. Instead. the Justice Department picked Conrad Barrett. a white guy who punched an African American. in order to play his side of the knockout game. If he is guilty of this. of course that is wrong. and he should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. We have States that can prosecute those kinds of assaults and violent acts. but it strikes me that the others didnt fit the profile of the Holder administration. so they went after the one example of the white guy and the African American victim instead of all of the white victims and the African American alleged perpetrators. That stands out to me. The next one is the prosecution of Dinesh DSouza. who did the movie Obama 2016. Yes. that hurt the administration. It brought some things out about where this administration is going. the Obama administration. He is no friend of the administrations. but it is alleged that he directed $20.000 through friends to be given to a U.S. Senate campaign in New York. That is alleged. I dont know if it is true. but that is the allegation. Yet it must be true that there are thousands of Americans who have done a similar thing for a lot more money. The Holder Justice Department couldnt find them. but they found Dinesh DSouza to target for prosecution. They also targeted for Federal prosecution Governor Bob McDonnell. in Virginia. who has five former Virginia attorneys general who have vouched for the language of the law and who have said they believe the Holder Justice Department has stretched the limits of that. We shall see how that comes out. Governor Chris Christie had a problem with the traffic being closed on a bridge. and it created a national furor. but within a week. the Holder Justice Department was investigating Governor Chris Christie for his use of the funds for the Sandy relief fund. Now. how is it that the Holder Justice Department isnt going to look into the FBIs transgressions in the Senator Ted Stevens investigation. which brought about. I believe. a change in the result of that Senate election and a change in ObamaCare? How is it that they are not going to look into the overzealous prosecution of Carmen Ortiz and Aaron Swartz? They are going to prosecute Conrad Barrett for a hate crime. and they are going to continue to prosecute Dinesh DSouza. but it is just a coincidence that he produced Obama 2016. They are going to continue to prosecute Republican Governor Bob McDonnell and Republican Governor Chris Christie while they let people off the hook. like the New Black Panthers in Philadelphia. James Clapper. who contradicted himself under oath. which would be. if proven. a perjury charge. Governor Jon Corzine. a Democrat from New Jersey. while there is $1 billion missing in Global Crossing. and we cant find a way to investigate him. Lois Lerner. who is manipulating the IRS to persecute the Presidents political enemies. and the investigation has to take place by subpoena. in contempt of Congress. because the Holder Justice Department has turned a blind eye because the President has said there is not a smidgeon of corruption in the IRS. and exempting entire classes of people from prosecution. like illegal immigrants who havent committed serious crimes. They are exempt from prosecution and removal. and with marijuana. huge companies are exempted even though it is Federal law. With DOMA. Attorney General Holder has refused to defend DOMA before the Court. Voter fraud instead. by the way. they prosecute. They bring action against States like Texas. which simply want voter ID. and they allege that Texas is imposing a poll tax and that it is a racist plot. That is what we have. Mr. Speaker. in the Justice Department today. It is hard to call it justice. It is going to be hard to take this country to the next level of our destiny. These values that I have brought out in the beginningthese values of respect for tradition and wisdom of past generations. the rule of law. individual freedom and liberty. and a belief in a law higher than mans lawwe must restore in this country if we are to restore the pillars of American exceptionalism. With that. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time."},{"1":"2015","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. we have begun the new year of the 114th Congress with a Republican majority and a fresh commitment to get Congress working again. Overwhelmingly. Americans supported the progrowth ideas of the Republican Party in the polls in the November election. sending a strong message about their frustration with the gridlock we have experienced in the Democratic-led Senate. So it is time to get to work. time to return to regular order and to debate openly legislation. to move bills through committee. to allow Members on both sides of the aisle to offer amendments. and to get the Senate back on track passing bills the way it should be. The American people deserve a Senate that works. and the new Republican majority intends to deliver. That is why it is so disappointing that President Obama would threaten to veto the very first bill Republicans plan to bring to the Senate floor for a vote--a bipartisan vote to authorize the Keystone XL Pipeline. a bill that was introduced here in the Senate with 60 cosponsors. The Keystone XL Pipeline enjoys widespread public support. and that is not surprising. Polls have demonstrated that the American people are concerned about jobs and the economy. and they want to get the country working again and to strengthen our energy independence. The Keystone XL Pipeline will help do just that. Yet President Obama would rather hold the economy hostage to the far leftwing of his party than put American workers first. His war on energy runs counter to what this country needs--jobs and the affordable energy that will support them. I have shared time and time again on the Senate floor what President Obamas own State Department has said about the project. The State Department has concluded the pipeline will not only support 42.000 jobs during construction. but it will do so without significant impact on the environment--and. I might add. without spending a cent of taxpayer money. The Keystone XL Pipeline has been stuck in limbo for over 6 years and has become more than just an energy issue. In my own State of South Dakota. rail backlogs have caused tremendous delays for farmers trying to get their harvests to market. The Keystone XL Pipeline will help alleviate this backlog by taking 100.000 barrels of Montana and North Dakota oil off the rails. freeing up nearly two unit-trains per day of capacity that is sorely needed by other rail shippers. The pipeline will also bring tax revenue to South Dakota. The State Department estimates that in my home State of South Dakota alone. the construction of the pipeline will support 3.000 to 4.000 jobs during construction and generate well over $100 million in earnings. It will bring more than $20 million in annual property taxes to South Dakota counties. Places like Jones County. where I grew up. could greatly benefit by having this added tax revenue for their schools. The Keystone XL Pipeline will also decrease our reliance on oil from dangerous countries such as Venezuela. Yet President Obama and some Democrats continue to downplay all these benefits. They say the jobs are mostly temporary. Well. construction jobs are temporary by nature. but that doesnt mean they dont matter. Rather. it means we need to keep new projects such as Keystone XL coming to spur growth and to develop new infrastructure. By shutting down what would be a routine energy infrastructure project. President Obama is creating a difficult environment for future development and projects. The far leftwing of the Presidents party claim the pipeline will increase greenhouse gases. but reports from the Presidents own State Department undermine his claim. In its final supplemental environmental impact statement. the Presidents State Department noted that the Keystone XL Pipeline is unlikely to significantly impact the rate of extraction in the oil sands or the continued demand for heavy crude oil at refineries in the United States. In other words. the emissions associated with the oil sands extractions will not change whether or not the pipeline is built. While oil prices may impact the production rate of oil sands. the State Department also found that the dominant drivers of oil sands development are more global than any single infrastructure project and that the industrys rate of expansion should not be conflated with the more limited effects of individual pipelines. And mind you. this is again from one of the five exhaustive reports we have seen from the State Department about this project. In fact. the State Departments final environmental impact statement also compared the operational greenhouse emissions that would result from the pipeline to those that would result from various transportation alternatives such as rail. rail and pipeline. and rail and tanker. The report found that the annual emissions from these alternative transportation modes would be anywhere from 28 percent to 42 percent greater than if the oil were shipped through the pipeline. Plus. a pipeline is safer than truck or rail. The American people have been clear on their feelings about this project. Poll after poll has shown their strong support for it. Republicans support the pipeline. Democrats in both Houses of Congress support the pipeline. and unions support the pipeline. The only people who seem to oppose it are President Obama and members of the far leftwing of the Democratic Party. After the Senate passes the bill. it will have one final hurdle to clear--the President of the United States. I very much hope he will reconsider his veto threat and listen to the voices of American workers and the bipartisan majority in both Houses of Congress. If the pipelines economic benefits. the support of the American people. and five successful environmental reviews have not yet convinced the President to approve this project. I am pretty skeptical that he ever will approve it. but I hope I am wrong. I hope even more Democrats here in the Senate will join us and send a message about their readiness to work with Republicans in this 114th Congress. My colleagues can help show the American people that Congress has heard their demands for change in Washington and that their economic priorities will be addressed. I am sorry American workers have had to wait years for this project. but I am hopeful we can resolve this issue once and for all. The new Republican Senate majority is about creating jobs and economic opportunities for the American people. and it starts right here. right now with the Keystone XL Pipeline. We hope Democrats and the President will join us. I yield the floor."},{"1":"2016","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. the Republican leader celebrates the opioid legislation and the FAA bill. but both are missed opportunities. There is no funding in the opioid bill. There were editorials all over the country yesterday about that. I read here on the Senate floor. it is in the Record. about The New York Times saying it was really wrong to try to claim credit for doing something on opioids when there is no money to do it. The FAA bill--I will talk about that in a little more detail in a little bit--is another missed opportunity to do what is right to help. to help the Republican leader keep his word. CARA. the opioid legislation. has no real funding to solve the real problem. Over the last week. Democrats have exhausted every avenue to try and work with Republicans on a Zika funding measure. Democrats had the audacity to expect the Republican leader to live up to his promise in April of bipartisan work on Zika. This is what the Republican leader said in April: We all are very much aware that this is a serious crisis. Well be working with the administration. with Democrats. But his actions. especially over the last couple of weeks. clearly illustrate that he was never really interested in a bipartisan solution. For example. the President offered a meeting with Senator McConnell. Speaker Ryan. Secretary Burwell. and Director of OMB Shaun Donovan. to work on the Zika crisis. The Speaker and the Republican leader refused that meeting. We offered to reintroduce the Senates bipartisan Zika compromise from what we sent to the House. We would do it again as a freestanding bill. That bill had 89 votes. Eighty-nine Senators voted for it. We have offered Republicans legitimate compromises in the hopes they would join us at the negotiating table. but it is clear that they dont want to stay in DC. They want to rush to Cleveland and wave the flag for Donald Trump. That is why they are imposing imaginary deadlines on Zika legislation. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell today rejected that offer. saying the time for such negotiations had passed--talking about our offer. our latest offer. The Republican leader is saying there is no time to work on Zika. Well. I would suggest that I disagree with that. Starting this Friday--right here. July 15--we are going to begin the longest recess in the Senate in 60 years. Sixty years ago. there was not much going on in this country. relatively speaking. We had far fewer people. 100 million fewer people. We had a less complicated government in many ways. so there was an opportunity at that time to take the time off. but 60 years later. there is no time to do that. To say there is no time to work on Zika--give us all a break. There is plenty of time--7 weeks. to be exact. I guess a couple months of paid vacation is more important than protecting pregnant women and their babies from the terrible birth defects caused by Zika. There is no reason we cant stay here and work on protecting women and their babies. but Republicans are in such a hurry to coronate Trump in Cleveland. they are willing to sacrifice helping their constituents. The Republican leader announced yesterday that he will be speaking at the Republican convention next week. I guess the Republican leader is rushing for the exit without funding Zika so he will have time to prepare his speech and polish it because I am sure it will really help Donald Trump a lot in his election efforts. The Republican leader cares more about his time off and cheering Donald Trump than protecting the women of America and their babies from this horrible virus. Lets be clear. It is obvious that Republicans are choosing Trump and some time off over protecting American women from the Zika virus. This is a really bad. revolting set of priorities. and every Republican in this building and the office buildings surrounding this Capitol should be ashamed. They shouldnt fool themselves--every Republican in Congress should know that if they walk away without funding Zika. the repercussions are going to be severe. I cant recall ever. having been around here a long time--even before I came to Congress. I worked here--watching a party so willingly move to its own destruction. That is what Republicans seem to be intent on doing. Maybe they dont like being in the majority. It is hard to be in the majority. We are trying to save the Republicans from themselves. but they wont let us. We have pursued every avenue possible to find a bipartisan Zika bill path forward that can pass both Houses and be signed by the President. It shouldnt be hard. Women and babies across America are counting on Republicans to come to their senses and pass a bill before we leave here on a 2-month vacation. but if Republicans refuse. if they cant see the writing on the wall. we cant make them read the writing on the wall. It is up to them to open their eyes and read the writing on the wall. Look at the time we have to do something on Zika. Look at the time-- July 15. August. See all these big black lines? We are not here. We come back on September 6. July is gone. August is gone. and part of September is gone. We have a lot of time to be here and do some work. I say to my Republican colleagues. sit down with us. We have offered compromise after compromise. To hear my friend talk about. oh. I cant understand why they wont accept preventing Planned Parenthood from taking care of these women--if there were ever a time in the history of America where women wanted to do something about birth control. how about now? My Republican friend says: I dont understand why they are concerned about Planned Parenthood not being able to take care of these women. I dont understand why they are concerned about changing the environmental laws dealing with the Clean Water Act. I dont understand that. Their legislation takes $500 million from veterans that we were going to use to process claims. For him to come and say we are increasing veterans money is just not true. Everyone knows that the $543 million they have here is an offset from ObamaCare. I could raise a point of order right now. and it would fall automatically. Everyone knows that. Taking money from Ebola--there is not much left there. Ebola is still a crisis. We know that. We remember that from 2 years ago. But what is always so interesting is why in the world. if they are so interested in doing something about this. would they stick a provision in their legislation that they reinstate the ability to fly the Confederate flag over military cemeteries? How is that for a compromise? So this calendar is going to stay here. Lets look at it for a while and see what time we have left. The Republican Senate is being defined by its unfinished business. It is not just Zika. we could go on for quite some time. I will mention a couple things. How about giving serious consideration to protecting Americans by funding our military and our national security. addressing gun violence. or providing the necessary resources to attack our Nations opioid crisis. Through their historic inaction. Republicans are refusing to treat the Federal judiciary with the respect it deserves and the Constitution demands. The senior Senator from Iowa has turned the once proud and independent Judiciary Committee--my friend--we have been together for 34 years in the Congress of the United States--the senior Senator from Illinois is a member of that committee. He loves his work on that committee. he has told me numerous times. But that once proud and independent Judiciary Committee has been turned into a partisan Republican opposition research operation. The Republican Judiciary Committee now has a singular focus: winning the White House for Donald Trump. The Judiciary chairman has wasted millions of taxpayer dollars trying to embarrass Hillary Clinton during her stalwart term as Secretary of State of this great country. They failed. of course. Senator Grassley wrote countless letters demanding State Department documents. He even once went after a woman who worked at the State Department and was having a baby. He wanted the records to make sure he could document that. He scoured sensitive records belonging to Secretary Clintons aides. He was obsessed with digging up political dirt. He found none. But. like the Benghazi Committee in the House. Senator Grassley has wasted millions of taxpayer dollars and produced zero. Now that the FBI has closed the book on Secretary Clintons emails. Senator Grassley is resorting to questioning the integrity of career FBI officials. calling their investigation suspect. Senator Grassleys efforts to elect Donald Trump dont end with his partisan attacks regarding Secretary Clinton. The senior Senator from Iowa has obstructed qualified. consensus judicial nominees in the hopes that Trump will win in November and remake the judiciary in his image. Think about that. Unlike past Judiciary Committee chairs. Senator Grassley is content to put partisanship above a functioning judiciary. The number of vacancies under President Obama has skyrocketed. Republicans obstruction is putting them in the history books--but for the wrong reason. Last year. Senate Republicans made history by confirming the fewest judges in a long time. This year. they seem determined to shortchange the judiciary even further. We have a myriad of judicial emergencies around the country. meaning the judges cant get their work done. These courts have more cases than judges can handle. and that has more than doubled. Justice is being denied for millions of Americans. but under Chairman Grassley. the Judiciary Committee spends its time playing politics. not confirming judges. It seems the only thing deserving the chairmans attention is electing Donald Trump. ensuring he gets as many judicial appointments as possible. Nowhere is that more apparent than with the current vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court and Grassleys obstruction of the highly qualified Chief Judge Merrick Garland. No one can find anything dealing with his education. his qualifications. his judicial temperament. his integrity--he is top of the line. as was indicated some time ago by Orrin Hatch. President Obama nominated Garland 100 days ago. He serves as the chief judge of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. He was unanimously rated as well qualified by the American Bar Association--the highest rating possible. By any measure. he is exactly the type of fairminded. consensus nominee the Senate should be considering for the vacancy. But Judge Garland cant make his case to the American people because Senator Grassley refuses to even hold a hearing on the nomination. Chairman Grassley has come up with a myriad of excuses to block the nomination. none of which hold water. As the Des Moines Register said recently. Grassleys excuses are purely political. Iowans arent being fooled. They know that the chairmans real goal is holding the Supreme Court open for Donald Trump to do with what he wants. The Judiciary chairman has already said Trump would appoint the right type of people--boy. I will tell you. that must be a real stretch--the right type of people to the Supreme Court. The senior Senator from Iowa obviously places a high value on Trumps judgment. which has proven to be so good the last year. Senator Grassley is holding a Supreme Court vacancy for a man who accused an Indiana-born judge of being unable to do his job because of his racial heritage. His parents came from Mexico. Apparently he would like to see that brand of thinking brought to the Nations courts. It is time for Senator Grassley to stop playing politics with his committee and give Judge Garland a fair hearing. It is time for his committee to address the numerous lower court vacancies and damaging judicial emergencies throughout the country. The American people deserve a functioning judicial system led by the Judiciary Committee in the Senate. They have had enough with Republican excuses. Iowans and the Nation are waiting. It is time for Senator Grassley and Senate Republicans to do their job. Mr. President. I would ask the Chair to announce what the Senate is going to do the rest of the day."},{"1":"2017","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chair. I also include in the Record a letter from the National Association of Counties. NACo recommends that Congress address some of challenges posed by the EPAs Clean Water Act permit for pesticides to allow counties to more quickly respond to the mosquito- based public health threats. Counties have reported either significantly scaled back or discontinued mosquito abatement programs due to the additional. duplicative. and expensive paperwork and monitoring obligations required by the program. National Association of Counties. Washington. DC. May 21. 2017. Hon. Paul D. Ryan. Speaker. House of Representatives. Washington. DC. Hon. Nancy Pelosi. Minority Leader. House of Representatives. Washington. DC. Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: As the U.S. House of Representatives moves forward with the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017 (H.R. 953). we would like to highlight the impact that U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Pesticide General Permit (PGP) program has on county governments ability to respond promptly and effectively to emerging public health threats. As the summer months approach and we enter mosquito season. counties are concerned about the health and safety impacts of mosquito-borne illnesses such as Zika. The Zika virus is an emerging mosquito-borne illness. primarily stemming from the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes. and there is no vaccine. Since mosquitos and their breeding habitats pose the largest threat to public safety. counties can play a major role in minimizing the potential spread of the virus and other mosquito-borne illnesses through public education and mosquito eradication. However. since EPAs PGP program was instituted in 2011. counties have reported that they have either significantly scaled back or discontinued mosquito abatement programs due to additional. duplicative and expensive paperwork and monitoring obligations required under the permit. We recommend that Congress address some of the challenges posed by EPAs PGP permit to allow counties to more quickly respond to mosquito-based public health threats. We thank you for your leadership on this issue. We look forward to continuing to work with you on issues important to counties. Sincerely. Matthew D. Chase. Executive Director. National Association of Counties."},{"1":"2018","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. the Consumer Product Safety Commission is a small agency with a major mission. Its goal is to protect the public from the threats of injury or death associated with defective and dangerous products. That mission is more important today than ever before because consumers face dangers from fire. electrical. chemical. or mechanical hazards--not only consumers but their children and families. The agency is already resource-starved. It is already depleted in terms of the support that it needs in Congress. and already it needs zealous and relentless advocacy. The individuals who are members of that board should be dedicated to that mission and to the safety and well-being of consumers above all. That is their mission. So. today. when we consider the nomination of Dana Baiocco. we should keep in mind that no matter how able and skilled and experienced a litigator she is. the question is whether she will devote those skills. ability. and experience to the mission of this agency. Unfortunately. every sign that she has given indicates that her goal will be contrary to the agencys mission. I say that. first of all. because of her experience. She has participated in cases that are of extraordinary concern to Americans. In 2007 she represented Mattel as a member of their litigation team when lead was discovered in the paint of 83 different Mattel toy products. I think nearly 1 million toys. In 2007. when she represented Mattel. I was the attorney general of the State of Connecticut. I remember that well because it was known as the Year of the Recall because of the frequency and the number of recalls involving unsafe products. In 2007. there were more than four recalls. on average. each week. and more than half of them were for childrens products. It was a time when our Nation was facing this crisis in dangerous toys. Mattel ultimately was fined $2.3 million for violating the Consumer Product Safety Act and knowingly selling childrens toys with contaminated paint or surface coatings. This decision was an important win for consumers and children. The Consumer Product Safety Commission did its job. Ms. Baiocco was on the wrong side of consumer safety in that case. Similarly. in representing the Yamaha Motor Company. a manufacturer of off-road vehicles. she was on the wrong side. standing with the industry that violated basic safety standards. causing multiple injuries and lawsuits when consumers were seriously maimed. injured. and harmed in operating Yamaha Rhino off-road vehicles. Those injuries occurred while the CPSC was conducting a campaign on ATV safety. Ms. Baioccos defense of Yamaha put her on the wrong side of that issue at a time when there were more than 330 ATV-related fatalities and 101.000 ATV-related emergency department-treated injuries in the United States. Another area that I know well where she was clearly on the wrong side related to Big Tobacco. Ms. Baiocco represented R.J. Reynolds in the early part of this century--2007--in a class action lawsuit in Florida brought by injured smokers who were seeking to recover the damages they suffered as a consequence of Big Tobacco deliberately and purposefully addicting them. leading to lives of disease and addiction. She was on the wrong side of that issue as well--on the side of injury and industry against consumers. She was instrumental in those lawsuits. and R.J. Reynolds has been instrumental in lobbying to encourage the extensive use of flame-retardant chemicals in upholstered furniture to deflect pressure on cigarette makers to make a fire-safe cigarette. That issue is squarely within the CPSCs jurisdiction. She lacks that dedication to this agencys mission that is critical for any Member to have. She may have skill. ability. and experience. but if it is devoted to the industrys well-being rather than consumers. she should be working for a different agency or continuing to work for a law firm that represents these industries. In fact. she has worked for a very large law firm that represents many of those clients and industries. but she has refused to provide a full list of the clients and companies she has represented. The only way we have gained full knowledge of these clients is to go to the law firms website--where. by the way. her profile cites as follows: She is known for strategic business advice and high-intensity trials involving mass torts. consumer and industrial products. and medical devices in federal. state. and international courts.

I rise in support of H.R. 1500. the Consumers First Act. which restores the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. so it can carry out its mission of protecting consumers from unfair. deceptive. or abusive acts or practices by financial institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created by Congress following the financial crisis in order to ensure that there is an agency in place with the sole. dedicated purpose of protecting every consumer of financial products and services and holding bad actors fully accountable when consumers are harmed. Under the leadership of its first Director. Richard Cordray. the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was a resounding success. During that time. the agency put nearly $12 billion back in the pockets of over 30 million consumers who were harmed by financial institutions. The agency put in place important new protections so that consumers no longer had to worry about exploding mortgages. hidden prepaid card fees. or unnecessary foreclosures due to weak servicing standards. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also helped to take the confusing jargon out of various financial products. such as student loans. by creating tools students can use to compare financial aid and costs when deciding where to go to college. But Donald Trump and his appointees have made it their mission to destroy the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from within. Mick Mulvaney. who was Trumps Director of the Office of Management and Budget before Trump inappropriately installed him as Acting Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. made it his mission to dismantle the agency from the inside. In fact. enforcement actions have fallen by 75 percent under Trumps appointees. there have been zero public fair lending enforcement actions. Mulvaney originally requested zero dollars from the Fed to fund the CFPB. and the number of employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has declined by 10 percent. I introduced the Consumers First Act to fix the damage that Mulvaney caused at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. For example. Mulvaney stripped the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity of its supervisory enforcement powers. The Consumers First Act restores those powers. Mulvaney fired the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus consumer advisory board. The Consumers First Act restores and strengthens the advisory panel to ensure consumers are heard by the agencys leadership. Mulvaney stacked the senior leadership of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with ideological political appointees. The Consumers First Act limits the number of political appointees at the agency. Mulvaney stopped the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from supervising its regulated entities for compliance with the Military Lending Act. which is in place to prevent servicemembers from being ripped off. The Consumers First Act directs the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to promptly resume Military Lending Act exams. Mulvaney worked to hide the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus consumer complaint database from the public. The Consumers First Act requires that the consumer complaint database remain publicly accessible so that there is transparency about the complaints consumers are making about financial institutions. H.R. 1500 puts consumers first by reversing the harmful actions Mulvaney took that we are aware of one by one. Over 50 consumer. civil rights. and labor organizations support the Consumers First Act. The harm at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is continuing under Director Kathy Kraninger. who appears to be following Mulvaneys lead by rolling back payday lending protections and reducing the collection of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. or HMDA data. which is used to identify discrimination in lending. And she is just getting started. Following general debate on the bill. the House will debate several amendments to undo the harmful actions taken by Director Kraninger. Congress will not tolerate the Trump administrations anticonsumer actions. and H.R. 1500 will ensure that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is able to fulfill its statutory mission to put consumers first. Mr. Chairman. I reserve the balance of my time. Committee on Education and Labor. House of Representatives. Washington. DC. May 17. 2019. Hon. Maxine Waters. Chairwoman. House Committee on Financial Services. Washington. DC. Dear Chairwoman Waters: I write concerning H.R. 1500. the Consumers First Act. This bill was primarily referred to the Committee on Financial Services. and secondarily to the Committee on Education and Labor. As a result of your having consulted with me concerning this bill generally. I agree to forgo consideration of the bill. so the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor. The Committee takes this action with our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1500. we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation. and we will be appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation moves forward so we may address any remaining issue within our Rule X jurisdiction. In agreeing to forgo consideration. I respectfully request your support for the appointment of outside conferees from the Committee on Education and Labor should this bill or similar language be considered in a conference with the Senate. Finally. I would appreciate a response confirming this understanding and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during floor consideration thereof. Very truly yours. Rep. Bobby Scott. Chairman. ____ House of Representatives. Committee on Financial Services. Washington. DC. May 21. 2019. Hon. Bobby Scott. Chairman. House Committee on Education and Labor. Washington. DC. Dear Mr. Chairman: I writing to acknowledge your letter dated May 17. 2019. responding to our request to your Committee that it waive any jurisdictional claims over the matters contained in H.R. 1500. the Consumer First Act. that fall within your Committees Rule X jurisdiction. The Committee on Financial Services confirms our mutual understanding that your Committee does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation. and your Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues within your jurisdiction.

Pursuant to your request. I will ensure that this exchange of letters is included in the Congressional Record during Floor consideration of the bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you as this measure moves through the legislative process. Sincerely. Maxine Waters. Chairwomen."},{"1":"2020","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. negotiations on the third phase of the coronavirus legislation went late into the night last night and will continue through the day today. I have spoken to Speaker Pelosi and Secretary Mnuchin several times. as well as President Trump. to keep them apprised as we continue the work through a number of issues. In fact. I just had a very good. very detailed phone call with Secretary Mnuchin--or Steve and Chuck. as he prefers to call it. We discussed many of the outstanding issues. and we are making very good progress. I have every expectation that this progress will continue throughout the day. Democratic negotiators will meet with their Republican counterparts throughout the day to continue hammering out the details. The Senate is here. we are working. and we are all eager to come to a bipartisan agreement as soon as humanly possible. There are still a number of priorities that Democrats continue to fight for in the package that is now being assembled. As I have made clear. Democrats have two primary goals. broadly defined. in this next phase of coronavirus legislation. One is to address the impending public health crisis head-on with a massive infusion of resources to our hospitals. our medical facilities. and our other public health infrastructure. The second priority is to put workers first. In fact. our proposal. which we laid out as early as Monday. is entitled Workers First. Democrats want to do as much as possible to prepare our healthcare system. and we want to give Americans who are most immediately affected by the economic slowdown ample relief so they can weather the storm over the long haul. So. on healthcare. Democrats are fighting for a Marshall Plan for our public health infrastructure. We need hundreds of billions of dollars for ventilators. testing equipment. gloves. masks. ICU beds. and PPE. or personal protective equipment. for our frontline medical workers. I spoke to the head of the nurses union in New York yesterday. They are short of masks. These brave nurses are going to work. doing their job. but they dont have the right equipment that they need. Money must go to our hospitals and our nursing homes. our community health centers. and our State and local governments. This can neither wait for a future bill nor a supplemental package. We need it right now. not 2 weeks from now. A senior doctor at Maimonides hospital in Brooklyn. NY. wrote to me yesterday. Here is what the doctor said: Im writing to you in a move of desperation. Currently. we have severe shortages in the basic necessities needed to fight the disease and protect health care workers. Disposable masks and gowns are in such short supply. we re-use them until they fall apart. We dont have adequate supplies of supportive medicines. Beds. ventilators. nurses and critical care doctors are also needed. We need a national response to this disease. I urge my colleagues to hear the urgency and strain in this brave doctors voice. the desperation in his warning. If we dont provide these resources right now. what is already a dire situation will--not could--become catastrophic. It will affect hospitals everywhere: big- city hospitals. medium-sized suburban hospitals. and small rural hospitals. Many of them will go under in a short period of time. So we need a Marshall Plan for our public health infrastructure. and it must be in this legislation. in the opinion of the Democratic caucus. As we have made clear from the beginning. we must also put workers first. That means a dramatic expansion and reform of unemployment insurance. We need unemployment insurance on steroids. Some are calling it employment insurance. It must be easier to access. It must cover many more Americans during this crisis. including Americans who have nontraditional employment. It must provide more generous benefits. Workers who are laid off should receive a paycheck equal to what they were receiving while employed. Workers must be protected. whether they work for businesses small. medium. or large. The plan we have would allow them to get unemployment insurance quickly. They would be furloughed. So they would stay as employees-- even though they werent working--of their employer. so that when. God- willing. this crisis ends. they can go back to their employer and the businesses that are now closed and decimated can start running again. We propose that this be not just a one-shot deal but a paycheck every work period. and it should go for as long as the crisis lasts. We want to fund it for at least 4 months. maybe 6. If the crisis ends more quickly. of course. we might be able to terminate it. but we need to give the workers of America the assurance that they will have paychecks. The same amount of resources that they had before this crisis they should have now. and it will occur ongoing until we beat this horrible disease. There are other things we must do for American families as well. We should greatly expand paid sick leave and family leave. We need to expand food assistance. The kids who go to school get their best meals. many of them. at the school lunch or school breakfast. They need to be fed. Others who lose work. they need food help right away. I believe our students are under strain. Many of their colleges are gone. Those who have just gotten out of school have difficult employment possibilities. We should cancel student loan payments during the course of the crisis. both principal and interest. I spoke to the President about this yesterday. He said he was sympathetic. He said at the podium yesterday that interest payments he would cancel. but I think we need to do more. We also must rescue small and medium-sized businesses with a generous loan program. so long as they protect their workers. They have other expenses. We will take care of their workers under the expanded unemployment program and on the small business program. but they have other expenses. We dont want them going under when these are good. ongoing businesses that did nothing wrong. They have to come back. So small business really needs help. And. if we are going to bail out any industry. particularly the big companies. we have to include strict conditions that put workers first: no layoffs. no salary cuts for workers or salary increases for corporate executives. guarantees that workers be rehired at their previous wages once the crisis abates. and no stock buybacks. I have heard the President mention that he is against stock buybacks in the past. So when I called him yesterday. I said: Make it clear. It is not in the bill that has been put before us. but Democrats will insist that it be in any proposal once we come together in a bipartisan way. as we are doing now. Democrats have several other priorities. as well. and we are working through each of them with our Republican colleagues even as we speak. As I said. I had a wonderful--well. I had a very good--conversation. I will not go too far. but I had a very good conversation with Secretary Mnuchin. and we are making good progress on many of the issues that we Democrats feel are important. One other need. by the way--because we do have other needs--is that I want to emphasize that one of the issues that is quickly emerging is that State and local governments are running out of cash and may soon be broke. Governors. mayors. county executives. county officials. town officials--Democratic and Republican alike--are clamoring for help. We must provide it. They are on the frontlines. So. in conclusion. I have no illusions about the difficulty of putting together legislation this momentous in this short a period of time. but all parties are working in good faith and as fast as possible to see that we accomplish the task at hand. Of course. far greater than our challenges here in Congress are the challenges that now confront the American people. Working families are at home without a paycheck. with no knowledge of when the next one might arrive. Small businesses are watching the labor of their lives teeter on the brink of collapse. I spoke to a small business owner. He had spent 8 years getting his business to be successful. It just had begun to be that way. and now his doors are closed and his employees are furloughed. We have to help people like that. Our healthcare workers. men and women who perform extraordinarily difficult jobs even in ordinary times. are now asked to bear additional burdens. But know this. healthcare workers: You are our heroes. America stands with you. and Democrats are fighting to help every one of the emergency workers during this crisis. So. to our healthcare workers and to every American out there finding their way through these challenging times: Stay strong. We are working to provide you the relief to see you through the crisis. We will get it done--Democrats. Republicans--together. Once the scourge of this virus has passed. we will come back stronger and even more resilient. President Franklin D. Roosevelt told a generation facing its own national crisis: This great Nation will endure as it [always] has endured. It will revive and it will prosper . . . [because there] is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. With wisdom and with courage. we will endeavor to finish the job here in Congress--whatever it takes. I yield the floor."},{"1":"2021","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. James Freeman of the Wall Street Journal on October 19 wrote an editorial on how Americans should not be complacent living with less. as jobs are destroyed while inflation accelerates: Selling the Joe Biden-Bernie Sanders era of scarcity wont be easy. And its going to get much harder if the President and his legislative coauthor enact their massive new plan to discourage productive labor. Examining the House version of the plan. economist Casey Mulligan estimates that by reducing the incentives to work. the bills planned expansions of Federal benefits will cost nine million jobs. Already. the COVID-era combination of astronomical government spending and money creation has resulted in too many dollars chasing too few goods. Generations of them. American consumers. built the largest economy in the world and various online commenters have suggested a slogan for Democrats running in 2022: Expect Less. In conclusion. God bless our troops. who successfully protected America for 20 years. as the global war on terrorism continues moving from Afghanistan to America."},{"1":"2022","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. I thank my colleague for not objecting. Lets just stop for a moment before we vote. The National Environmental Policy Act was not signed into law by FDR. not signed into law by Lyndon Johnson or John Kennedy. not signed into law by Barack Obama. It was signed into law by Richard Nixon. with bipartisan support--strong bipartisan support--some 50 years ago. The reason for the law was that they wanted--President Nixon and those who served in the Congress at the time--to make sure that. as we are proposing to build. we will say. large infrastructure projects around the country with Federal support. they wanted to make sure that the voices of the people whose lives would be affected by that would actually be heard. That was the idea behind doing this. I have been in the Senate about 21. 22 years and served on the Environment and Public Works Committee with Senator Simpson and others. and am privileged to chair the committee now. And about every year or 2. we pass major infrastructure legislation. and. a year ago. the largest infrastructure bill in the history of the country--roads. highways. bridges. water. drinking water. wastewater. you name it. Just last week. we passed. with one dissenting vote. the Water Resources Development Act legislation to reauthorize the Army Corps of Engineers to do projects all over America. I live in Wilmington. DE. I-95 goes right through Wilmington. DE. It cuts my city in half. I-95 is being rebuilt for about a 5-mile space. from Route 202. which goes up into PA. on down to Route 141--5 miles. right through the middle of our major city. It is going to be done in. I think. less than 2 years. Imagine that: 4 lanes. 6 lanes. all the exits. done in 2 years. They are talking about not being able to get a big project done. We are doing big projects in a little State all the time. The last thing I would say is that our colleagues Joe Manchin and Lisa Murkowski cohosted bipartisan meetings a month or 2 ago--6 or 7 or 8 of them--in the afternoon to talk about a path forward on reconciliation and infrastructure legislation. but also to talk about permitting and permitting reform. Every time we do a major infrastructure bill. we do permitting reform. and we do streamlining. We have done it. We did it last year. and we are going to do it again with the WRDA legislation too. Later. sometime this fall. in September. October. we will do permitting reform debate and legislation again. We cant do it in the context of reconciliation because the Parliamentarian wont let us do that. It has to be as stand-alone legislation. We will have the opportunity to do that. People can offer their ideas. We will debate them. We will vote them up. and we will vote them down. I just wanted to add that for the record. With that. I guess we ought to ask for the yeas and nays."},{"1":"2023","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chair. Republicans polluters over people act is a disaster of a bill. Not only does this legislation prioritize massive giveaways to Big Oil. gas corporations. and mining companies. but it sells out hardworking families who want nothing more than to breathe clean air and drink clean water. If Republicans are successful in making this legislation law. those corporate polluters will deplete our natural resources and destroy millions of acres of wildlife. and they will do it for pennies on the dollar. New pipelines will be constructed without the input of critical Federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency. These massive corporations could be exempt from lawsuits when they spill toxic chemicals or contaminate our drinking water supplies. This bill has the fingerprints of Big Oil lobbyists all over it. Perhaps the most embarrassing part of this bill is how good of a return on investment it is for fossil fuel companies. Last year. a Big Oil CEO admitted during an Energy and Commerce hearing to cashing in on stock he owned in his own company at a time when people were feeling maximum pain at the pump. He told me he did it at a 9 percent markup. That predatory behavior clearly hasnt swayed the authors of H.R. 1. I would imagine that is because the same Big Oil corporations that stand to benefit most from this bill have donated millions to Republican politicians over the years. They will make that money back in a matter of minutes if this legislation becomes law. Mr. Chair. Congress job is to serve the hardworking folks that we represent. not pad the profits of oil barons who run ExxonMobil or Shell. Mr. Chair. our constituents deserve better. and I urge my colleagues to vote no."},{"1":"2024","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in support of A Stronger Workforce for America Act. I thank Ranking Member Bobby Scott for his bipartisan work on behalf of Americas workforce without which this bill would not be on the floor today. Bobby and I decided on day one that while we will not always agree on every issue. we will work diligently in the areas in which we find common ground. It is safe to say we agree that workforce development is too important an issue not to get something done. { I thank each and every member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Due to their efforts. we were able to pass the bill through the committee on a wide. bipartisan vote. Now it is the turn of the full House. Mr. Speaker. A Stronger Workforce for America Act owes its bipartisan appeal to two main features: its principles and its promises. The principles of this bill are firmly rooted in increased efficiency. innovation. and accountability in the workforce. A Stronger Workforce for America Act will bolster the efficiency of the workforce system by dedicating 50 percent of funding to upskilling workers. Skills are becoming the currency of the labor market and the key to unlocking career success. yet too few of the taxpayer dollars provided to the workforce system currently are being spent developing the skills of our workforce. By elevating skills development. this bill will deliver more opportunities for Americans to prepare for good-paying jobs. Moreover. this bill gives States more flexibility to innovate and to support employer-led initiatives. Empowering States and employers is the best way to ensure the workforce system is nimble and adaptive in the modern economy. Also. it will enhance the performance accountability system in the law that has suffered from nearly a decade of delayed implementation and low expectations. meaning States and local workforce boards will truly be held accountable for the labor market outcomes they produce. Efficiency. innovation. and accountability are the shared bipartisan principles A Stronger Workforce for America Act rests on. Now for the promises: A Stronger Workforce for America Act is a bill for those who believe in the incredible. boundless potential of the American workforce. This is the American workforce that smelted the steel that built the engine that propelled man to the Moon in a Saturn V rocket. This is the American workforce that has repeatedly dropped its tools and its livelihoods on a moments notice to go fight in service to our country. This is the American workforce that put the world in our pocket when it created the iPhone. a transformational tool that has revolutionized the way we communicate and that has enabled drones. smart homes. self- driving cars. and more. It is our constant duty and our promise never to forget. neglect. or discount the American workforce. American workers built this great Nation. They deserve nothing but the best opportunity to succeed as rapid changes in the modern economy necessitate new skills in order to keep pace. Therefore. the legislation before us today should be seen in that light. It is a promise that as the economy changes. we will always ensure that workers have an opportunity to gain the right skills for the job. Therefore. Mr. Speaker. I urge passage of A Stronger Workforce for America Act. and I reserve the balance of my time."}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
