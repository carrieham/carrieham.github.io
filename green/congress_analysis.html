as a cosponsor of our legislation. the reason he did so is because this absolutely dysfunctional system of fighting fires has resulted in important priorities for new york state not being in a position to secure the funding they need. that is because the rising costs of fighting fires keeps raiding all these other programs in the forest service that are needed to help prevent fires down the road. the raids take place two different ways. certainly. in my part of the world. we are very troubled by the fact that you have prevention getting short shrift. then it gets really hot and dry. we have lots of thunderstorms in our part of the world. and all of a sudden we have an inferno on our hands. then what happens is the agencies end up borrowing from the prevention fund to put the fire out. and the problem gets worse because you have repeatedly shorted the prevention program. this is what is called fire borrowing. and it happens not just in the west. that is why the senior senator from new york wanted to be a cosponsor of our legislation. because programs that were important in new york state. thousands and thousands of miles away from the forests of eastern and central oregonthose were a problem for programs he cared about and to secure their funding as a result of this dysfunctional system. just like it has been for people in the west. it is time for the congress to find a solution to ensure that. one. wildfires can be fought. and. two. to control the cost of fighting these wildfires by better preparing our forests and making them healthier. i am very pleased that the chair of the energy and natural resources committee. the committee i had the honor of chairing in the past. senator murkowski. and ranking member cantwell are committed to working on this issue. and i wanted to once again reaffirm my commitment. i know senator crapo shares this view to work with them to find a solution to wildfire funding that can pass in this congress. i certainly have some ideas. and i am very interested in welcoming my colleagues ideas and i have been for some time. for example. last year in the summer. it was pretty clear that it was going to be a tough fire season. what i and others essentially sought to do was to find a way to get our colleagues working together to try to find some common ground and get this resolved. we couldnt quite get it done. we are now going to be at this day in and day out. week in and week out. senator crapo and i will be working with our colleagues and their staff on the energy and natural resources committee and on the budget committee and with members from the other body to find a solution that works for all sides of the issue. we saw last summer that this was going to be a problem. a big group of us got together and said we have to get it resolved. we couldnt quite thread the needle. this time we have to make sure that gets done. there are not a lot of certainties in life. but the fire season is one of them. and the congress simply cannot let this problem continue. i wanted to come to the floor. particularly today. to take note of the fact that the fire in the shenandoah area ought to be a wakeup call to everybody. if they are having one of the biggest fires they have ever had this early in april. that is a signal of what is to come. it has been the story of summer after summer. now we are learning. as i indicated earlierand it appears it is not just in the westthat we are thinking about the seasons and talking about the seasons of yesteryear because now it is fire season all year round. my colleague is here. i yield the floor."},{"1":"2015","2":"CAPPS","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. chairman. i offer an amendment that will take a modest step forward to improve pipeline safety. this issue is of particular importance to me and to my constituents. two weeks ago. more than 100.000 gallons of crude oil spilled from the ruptured plains all american pipeline along the treasured gaviota coast. in my district. just north of santa barbara. the oil quickly flowed under the highway. onto the beach. and into the ocean where the oil slick spread south for miles along the coastline. affecting pristine environmental habitats. recreational interests. and commercial fishing operations. while the exact causes of this spill are still being investigated. it is already clear that woefully inadequate federal pipeline safety standards played a significant role. but it didnt have to be this way. in 2011. the house worked in a bipartisan way to pass the pipeline safety. regulatory certainty. and job creation act. this law. which passed the house unanimously. directed the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration. or phmsa. to update and strengthen key pipeline safety standards. the law called on phmsa to issue a rule requiring automatic shutoff valves on new pipelines and to strengthen requirements for the inclusion of leak detection technologies on pipelines. the law required these rules to be finalized by january of last year. yet. here today. we are still waiting. phmsa has not even issued a proposed rule on these commonsense regulations. which passed the house unanimously. phmsa continues to drag its feet. and communities like mine continue to pay the price. it is time for phmsa to follow the law and the bipartisan will of congress. my amendment is simple. it would set aside $1 million of phmsas own budget for the finalization and implementation of these overdue pipeline safety and spill mitigation rules. my amendment would simply help ensure that section 4 and section 8 of the bipartisan 2011 pipeline safety law are finally implemented so that our federal regulations are in line with todays reality. my amendment does not cost a dime. and it does not authorize any new programs. section 4 requires new pipelines to install automatic shutoff valves. and section 8 requires pipeline operators to use the latest leak detection technologies. both of these provisions were enacted unanimously by this house in the pipeline that burst in my district did not have an automatic shutoff valve despite the fact that other comparable pipelines in the area do use this technology. an automatic shutoff valve would not have prevented the spill necessarily. but it certainly would have minimized it. it took over 2 hours for the pipeline operator to even identify where the pipeline had ruptured. let alone to actually stop the flow of crude oil. that is unacceptable. if the standards required under section 4 and section 8 had been required of the plains pipeline in my district. the spill likely would have been much less severe. my amendment would take a small. yet important step forward to address these troubling issues by pushing phmsa to get its act together and finalize these rules. mr. chairman. oil and gas development. by its nature. is a dangerous and dirty business. the mere fact that the plains and other companies have oil spill contingency funds shows that there is no such thing as a safe pipeline. spills do happen. and they will continue to happen as long as we depend on fossil fuels for our energy needs. we have a responsibility. therefore. to do all we can to make these pipelines as safe as possible. congress has repeatedly directed phmsa to strengthen its standards. yet this agency has done little. my amendment would help hold their feet to the fire and get commonsense safety standards finalized and implemented. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment. i yield back the balance of my time. the acting chair. the question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from california ."},{"1":"2014","2":"BROUN","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. chairman. my amendment would eliminate all funding provided in the bill for the watershed rehabilitation program. across the united states. 11.000 dams have been constructed in local communities under this program for the purpose of mitigating flood conditions. most of these dams were built in the 1940s and 1950s. and thousands of them are suspected to be in need of attention. of this amount. only about 120 dams have been repaired so as to extend their use into modern times. indeed. given the advances of engineering technology in the last 50 years. these refurbished dams may last well into the next century. but federal funding to maintain these manystate infrastructure projects is simply not sustainable. under the farm bill passed earlier this year. the watershed rehabilitation program was authorized to receive both increased mandatory as well as discretionary funding. however. the president has not requested funding for this program in over 3 years. in large part because he recognizes that the responsibility to maintain these projects must ultimately fall on the local project sponsors. likewise. over in the senate. zero dollars has been provided via discretionary spending in recent years. and according to the congressional research service. it is expected that the mandatory spending will ultimately be canceled permanently. in fact. the watershed rehabilitation program has never been allowed to spend mandatory funding. so why is the house falling all over itself to fund this program? mr. chairman. as long as the federal government is involved in this dam program. the process of identifying problem dams and implementing rehabilitation plans will be much like everything else the federal government undertakes. it will be slow. painstaking. and way too expensive. in my home state of georgia. we have many dams that we depend on to mitigate heavy rains and prevent floods. i have to say. mr. chairman. that i agree with the president here. i dont agree with him sometimes. and i do agree with him many times. but in this place. i agree with him in that we ought to leave the maintenance of these projects to the states. they know better than the federal government what works for their communities. i urge my colleagues to support this amendment. which is to limit spending money that we just dont have. i reserve the balance of my time."},{"1":"2013","2":"WHITEHOUSE","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. president. i rise again for the 41st time to ask my colleagues to wake up to the threat of climate change. today i come to discuss the serious risks that climate change poses to our energy sector. it is no controversial idea that our climate affects our energy infrastructure. in the northeast. when we think about what causes power outages. we naturally think of bad weather. in fact. the american society of civil engineers reports that between 2007 and 2012. weatherrelated events were the main cause of electrical outages in the united states. that same report said: \"the average cost of a onehour power outage is just over $1000 for a commercial business.\" just for 1 hour. this takes a serious toll on our economy. a recent department of energy report has highlighted how sensitive our energy sector is to climate change and to extreme weather. in september 2011. the department of energy reports: high temperatures and high electricity demandrelated loading tripped a transformer and transmission line near yuma. arizona. starting a chain of events that led to shutting down the san onofre nuclear power plant with power lost to the entire san diego county distribution system. totaling approximately 2.7 million power customers. with outages as long as 12 hours. earlier that summer: consecutive days of tripledigit heat and record drought in texas resulted in the electric reliability council of texas declaring power emergencies due to a large number of unplanned power plant outages and at least one power plant reducing its output. the report says the browns ferry nuclear plant in athens. al. \"had to reduce power output because the temperature of the tennessee river. the body of water into which the plant discharges. was too high to discharge heated cooling water from the reactor without risking ecological harm to the river.\" this happened in 2007. 2010. in 2011. and. in some cases. the power production was reduced for nearly 2 months. the department of energy reports that \"the cost of replacement power was estimated at $50 million.\" it is not just power generation. energy exploration has been affected too. the doe report explains that last july: \"in the midst of one of the worst droughts in american history. certain companies that extract natural gas and oil via hydraulic fracturing faced higher water costs or were denied access to water for six weeks or more in several states. including kansas. texas. pennsylvania. and north dakota.\" it was a similar story in the fall of 2011: due to extreme drought conditions. the city of grand prairie. texas. became the first municipality to ban the use of city water for hydraulic fracturing. other local water districts in texas followed suit by implementing similar restrictions limiting city water use during drought conditions. in july of 2011. the report recounts that: exxonmobils silvertip pipeline. buried beneath the yellowstone river in montana. was torn apart by floodcaused debris. spilling oil into the river and disrupting crude oil transport in the region. the property damage cost was $135 million. senator vitter. our ranking member on the environment and public works committee. has told us that 18 percent of the nations oil supply passes through his home state of louisiana at port fourchon. a recent government accountability office report found that the only access road to that port is closed 31/2 days a year on average because of flooding. effectively shutting down that port. with sea level rise climbing due to climate change. noaa is now projecting that within 15 years portions of that highway will flood an average of 30 times each yearagain shutting down access to that port 30 times a year. vital infrastructure such as powerplants. power lines. roads. and pipelines are all designed to stand up to historical weather patterns. what happens when the weather stops following historical patterns? according to the draft national climate assessment: u.s. average temperature has increased by about 1.5 degrees fahrenheit since 1895. more than 80% of this increase has occurred since 1980. the most recent decade was the nations hottest on record. oceans and other bodies of water are warming right along with the atmosphere. the seasons are shifting. research shows that in the last two decades the frostfree season has increased in every region of the contiguous united states compared to the average between 1901 and 1960. in the southwest. the record shows the frostfree season has increased 3 weeks and the western wildfire season has expanded by more than 2 months since the 1970s. precipitation patterns and the availability of water are changing throughout the nation. one study concluded that snow in the western mountains is melting. on average. 1 to 4 weeks earlier now compared to the 1950s. the draft national climate assessment shows that the amount of rain falling in what we call heavy precipitation events or. more colloquially. downpours is up in every region of the nation. it is up 45 percent in the midwest and 74 percent in the northeast. sea level is rising about 8 inches. on average. globally. but in some parts of the country it is much higher. noaa reports that mean waters off the galveston. tx. coast are rising more than 2 feet per century. at grand isle. la. the rate is nearly 3 feet per century. these arent just projections of what is to come. these are actual measurements of changes that have already happened or are happening around us. the result is that we have an energy infrastructure built for a different climate than the one which now exists and the one which is to come. conditions are only predicted to get worse. the threat to our energy sector from changes in the climate should be neither controversial nor partisan. there are a lot of commonsense solutions here. adapting our infrastructure for climate change is smart. and it will save us from costly repairs. investing in energy efficiency by reducing the demand for power will relieve pressure on the burdened systems. investing in a diverse energy sector will protect against the unique vulnerabilities of specific types of power sources. rhode island is part of the regional greenhouse gas initiative. nicknamed reggie. along with eight other northern states. our region caps carbon emissions and sells permits to powerplants to emit greenhouse gases. which creates economic incentives for both states and utilities to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy development. these efforts also reduce load demand on the regions electrical grid. we are proud of the effort we are making in new england. i know a lot of states are working just as hard. i say to my colleagues. our home states are hampered by the inaction in congress. we have received credible and convincing warnings. we have received compelling calls to act. the overwhelming majority of the scientific community recognizes climate change is real and we are causing it. our national security and intelligence community. our faith leaders. major american corporations. including the insurance and reinsurance industry and most americans all agree we need to act. it is time for congress to wake up. do its work to slow the onslaught of climate change. and to prepare for what are now unavoidable. inevitable effects. yet here in congress we sleepwalk on. this is an issue i know hits home in your home state in very different ways than it hits home in my state. but in each of our own ways. our states are already experiencing the hit from climate change. it is caused by carbon pollution that we are putting into the air. that our companies. our smokestacks are launching into the atmosphere. it changes our weather. changes our temperature. changes our seasons. changes our oceans. changes our waterways. changes our weather. and changes our lives. the tragedy is that we sleepwalk on because we are unwilling to address the special interests that are preventing us from taking the action that all americans need. this is the archetypical fight between the public good. between an important public security issue and a private special interest that is defending itself. that is defending its right to pollute. that is defending its ability to compromise our atmosphere. compromise our health. and compromise our great oceans and waters. this should be an easy struggle. this should be an easy struggle. but it is not. and it will be a mark of shame on this generation. and it will be a mark of shame on this building that given the choice between the clear information from the scientists. the clear experience of what is happening in all of our states and the power of the special interests. we ignored the first and yielded to the power of those special interests. i yield the floor."},{"1":"2012","2":"WHITEHOUSE","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. president. we were here two winters ago. in february. when washington was hit by a snowstorm that achieved the nickname snowmageddon. the city and. in fact. much of the midatlantic was buried under feet of snow. it was the biggest snowstorm in 90 years for this area. people in washington were struggling to get to work and school. and people went without power for days. this being washington. some of our colleagues in the senate seized on that opportunity to mock climate change and to suggest these winter snowstorms were inconsistent with the projections of what would happen from global warming and climate change. as an initial matter. that is a false comparison from the very getgo all by itself. climate science models have predicted consistently that as polar icecaps and glaciers melt and more water enters the system. we can expect heavier precipitation events. one of the ways it has been described is that if you have a pot on the stove and you have the heat under it and it is simmering. when you turn up the heat. you get more activity in the pot. you add energy to a dynamic system like a pot of boiling water. and it creates more energy in the dynamic environment. in the same way. the extra energy coming in because of climate change. our carbon pollution in the atmosphere. is energizing our atmosphere and our weather. and we are getting weather extremes as a result. there was an article in science daily. headlined \"arctic ice melt is setting stage for severe winters.\" it says this: the dramatic meltoff of arctic sea ice due to climate change is hitting closer to home than millions of americans might think. thats because melting arctic sea ice can trigger a domino effect leading to increased odds of severe winter weather outbreaks in the northern hemispheres middle latitudes -think the \"snowmageddon\" storm that hamstrung washington. dc. during february 2010. i ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the record at the end of my remarks."},{"1":"2011","2":"MARKEY","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"i thank the gentleman. so heres where we are. the republicansthis is unbelievableare blocking any legislation from passing that is going to have new safety rules for drilling off of the beaches of the united states 1 year after the bp spill. theyre blocking any new safety legislation to make sure that the united states. which has four times the fatality rate of countries in europe in drilling off our shores. has rules that are put on the books to make sure that those worst of all safety violators. these companies that drill off of our shores. have those new safety rules. number two. the republicans are fighting any attempts to take away the $4 billion in tax breaks which the american consumer gives to the oil companies each year. even as the oil companies report exxonmobil. $10 billion. shell. $8 billion. bp. $7 billion. chevron. $6 billion. et cetera. for the last 3 months. thats how much money they made. the republicans think thats not enough money. even as people get tipped upside down and have money shaken out of their pockets at the gas pump. no. not enough money. they also need to give the oil companies tax breaks. thats the republican perspective. what else do they do? they also slash the renewable energy budget. the clean energy budget. by 70 percent. so youre a kid out there in america. youre in the sixth grade. youre looking to america for the 21st century. heres what the republicans are doing: theyre slashing the solar and wind budget by 70 percent. they are saying to the oil companies. you dont need any more safety off of the beaches to drill. theyre saying that your profits are not windfall profits. which. of course. they are in the oil industry. but instead. heres what were going to let you do: we are going to let you drill off of the beaches of california for oil. off of the beaches of florida for oil. were going to let you drill off the beaches3 miles off of the coast. by the wayoff the beaches of cape cod. of georges bank. were going to turn georges bank into exxonmobils bank. were going to turn. not shellfish into a product that we sell. but shell oil will be out there. thats the agenda for the republican party. this is almost surreal that they want to take the tax breaks that the oil industry has. fight like the devil to protect them. even as they want to cut medicare for grandma and cut wind and solar as the energy sources for the future. its almost like they think its 1958 and gasoline is 28 cents a gallon and were all cruising around pretending that were not part of the rest of the world. this debate today is kind of a microcosm of whats wrong with republican policies. that before. i think. people want themselves to see oil rigs off of their beaches in california and north carolina. in massachusetts and maine. the least i think that you owe these people is that you have new safety rules that reflect what happened. you have that bp commission report implemented. but you guys are just running ahead as though nothing has happened. by the way. do you want to know what else is really wrong here? we know because of goldman sachs that this $20 to $30 a barrel of oil of increase in price over the last 11 weeks comes from speculators. what youre doing is you guys are trying to kneecap the speculator cops on the beat so that theyre not even out there policing these speculators. and youre trying to reduce the budget for the speculator cops. the people who will be chasing down these speculators. so its all so exxonmobil. its all so shell and bp and chevron and conocophillipsand. by the way. at least youre true to your colors. at least this is really what you believe in. you dont believe in wind and solar. so youre cutting that budget by 70 percent. and you want to open up the beaches as well for drilling in the states that dont want oil rigs off their beaches. i mean. my goodness. this is something that at least you should be able to respect. you also disapprove the using of the strategic petroleum reserve as a weapon to tell speculators. you could go bankrupt because were going to use the strategic petroleum reserve. the 700 million barrels of oil that the u.s. has stored. this is a very important debate to have. im glad were having it today because this \"drill. baby. drill\" just says. yeah. your policy is not all of the above. its oil above all. everything else gets defunded."},{"1":"2010","2":"BURGESS","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. speaker. i rise tonight in strong support of h.r. 1362. which i authored with mr. van hollen. there are over 400.000 americans living with ms and millions of more americans who live with some form of neurological disorder. as cochairman of the congressional ms caucus. i have been working to further research into the development of ms and other neurological disorders to help the population of americans living with ms. i firmly believe that a national surveillance system will be a critical first step toward allowing our researchers access to information that could be the key to finding cures. the other night. i was told that we are running for second base in our efforts to cure neurological diseases and that we have never tagged first. this bill. h.r. 1362. the national neurological diseases surveillance system act of 2010. is our first base. currently. there is no formal coordinated system to track and collect data on these diseases. and the lack of comprehensive data collection impedes progression to finding a cure. in fact. the last national study of the prevalence of ms was conducted 34 years ago. this integrated research will help drive innovation and will provide a solid understanding of how factors such as gender and age influence disease prevalence. as diagnoses are made. we will have the ability to create progression markers. allowing for the compilation of the data and the construction of treatments for future patients with similar backgrounds. through these efforts. we will be able to disseminate information and to encourage highrisk populations to connect to the available resources. this legislation will emphasize the study of the epidemiology of neurological diseases. it is vital that we examine previous trends of the disease as they relate to geography. environmental factors. and heredity in order to forecast future trends. in order to advance. we must create a foundation of research for the millions of americans suffering from ms. parkinsons. alzheimers. and other conditions. the national neurological diseases surveillance system act of 2010 has wide support. including by the national ms society and the parkinsons action network. among many others. the bill before us reflects countless hours of negotiation. i want to thank anne morris and ryan long. who are with the committee. as well as ray thorn. who is with mr. van hollens office. for their work. this bill went through regular order. it passed the energy and commerce committee unanimously. and it has come to the floor a better product because of the bipartisan work. i have spoken to medical students several times recently. and i have told them that the tools and technologies they will have at their disposal will revolutionize the practice of medicine. this bill is part of that future. a surveillance system will aid doctors on the ground right now who are struggling with ensuring a proper diagnosis. for example. with an ms examination. it generally reveals evidence of neurologic dysfunction. often asymptomatic in other locations. it is not science fiction to think that. in the future. a scientist noticing a genetic or blood marker in certain patients will be able to use surveillance systems like the ones created under this bill to link genetic factors with occupations. environmental and other demographic information. as diagnoses are made. we will have the ability to create progression markers. which will help researchers compile the data and construct treatments for future patients with similar backgrounds. that is how we will get the vaccines. the treatments. and the cures for the next generation. future physicians will be able to tailor treatment to patients based on previous results and will be able to disseminate the information and encourage highrisk populations to connect to available resources. but we need to put in place the first building blocks. the epidemiologic evidence supports the role of environmental exposure to conditions like multiple sclerosis. ms also correlates with high socioeconomic status. which might reflect improved sanitation and delayed initial exposure to infectious agents. but we will not be able to be sure until we can monitor on a statistically significant basis. again. i want to reiterate my strong support for the bill. and i urge my colleagues to support it. i yield back

been here a little over a 100 days. about 120 days now. and weve all got some first impressions of what this body is all about. what our work is all about. and its been kind of an eyeopening experience for me coming from the midwest. my little community in my district i think is a true slice of americana. in that its full of small towns and its where you kriow your neighbors and where you wave at them as they go by. you know. we still have gun racks in the back of pickups where i come up. but we also have some great people. and thats the reason that i was excited to be able to represent those folks. you know. where i come from people still believe in limited government. lower taxes. selfreliance on the individual. common sense. and balanced budgets. whether theyre their own or the local political entity. its kind of ironic. though. when you get here. things seem to change. in my mind. what a difference 2.000 miles make in the way governance takes place. coming from the statehouse in missouri. i know its completely different. but yet its the same type of process. although that kind of seems to be completely different. you know. here. instead of limited government. we seem to be content and intent on expanding government by leaps and bounds into every aspect of peoples lives. into the businesses. instead of lower taxes. were about to consider the largest tax increase in the history of this country. which i think will push us off an economic cliff. i have some grave concerns about it. as i go home and talk to my constituents about th6 carbon tax. the capandtrade bill thats coming up shortly. theyre alarmed and theyre very con: cerned. another one that i mentioned was selfreliance. its interesting that today we passed another bill which adds to the government payroll. the government bailout. the government. people on our payroll. instead of allowing people to be able to take care of themselves. and if youd mind. ive got a little story to tell about some good folks at home that are just like everybody elses. but its interesting to see and to note we had a terrible tragedy that ran through my district a few weeks ago. we had a tornado that went through and actually killed three folks. very tragic. did thousands of dollars worth of damage. it happened during the week when i was here in dc. so i called up my folks at home and asked a couple of my guys to be sure and go out and talk to those folks and give them some help. whatever help they needed. and assure them wed be there to help them in whatever way we could. i went there the next day when i did get home and met with the local leaders and it was amazing. all the emergency folks. the community leaders had everything under control. and it was amazing how ordered and. how orderly they were. there was no federal government running in there to tell them what to do. they were all doing it themselves with their own plans. then i went out and talked to the local folks who had sustained the damage. who had endured this tragedy. and while they were upset and distraught and certainly you know. not in the best frame of mind. they still were very thankful because they had a community of folks that was around them. that was giving them the support that they needed to be able to withstand this ordeal and get through it. and the strength of the community is a thing that really was impactful to me. from the standpoint that that community came together. and there was such an outpouring that there was probably more help than they actually needed to help with the cleanup and to give them the support they needed to get back on their feet. and thats the kind of people that we have in this country. all over this country. given the chance. they can be that selfreliant people that can bring this country back to what it is. with regards to the common sense i mentioned a minute ago. its one of the most often heard comments i hear when i go back home. what in the world

thatbut i am one of those that will say that everybody in this congress doesnt want cheaper energy prices. some people in this congress want higher energy prices. i think that goesall the way up to the leadership. and i can say that because i have watched these energy bills come to the floor. every single thing thats affected the price of energy. at least that i can recall. drove the price up. not down. shut down and blocked the drilling and the access to energy across this country. across this continent. when i came into this congress. i was not convinced that anybody thought that gas prices ought to be higher. then about 6. 7 months into the beginning of this 110th congress. this pelosi congress. you finally convinced me. you convinced me that you want to see a higher gas pricebecause it doesnt seem logical that people in my districtand they are going to wonder about the rationale of it. but i have listened to the debate too long not to say it out loud. and its thisthat there are those in this congress in significant numbers that believe that this planet is warming. and its our fault. if we can raise the cost of energy. people will use less of it. including gasoline. if they use less of it and ride their bicycle more. there will be fewer greenhouse emissions. and there will be less greenhouse gas go off into the atmosphere. if there is less going into the atmosphere. somehow they are going to save the planet. well. there are a whole lot of things wrong with that equation. the worst of them is that the countries of and china and india. the emerging industrial nations are not going to back off on coal. they are going to burn more coal. and they are building more generating plants. whatever we do to slow down the coal or cut down on the emissions of our greenhouse gases is going to be more than offset. you talk about carbon offsets. its being offset in india and china a lot faster than we could possibly shut down our consumption of energy in the united states. which shuts down our economy. the equation for people that are holding the gavels that control this policy in this congress today is drive up the cost of energy. drive up the cost so that people will use less energy. i said when gas got to be $3. whats the solution for $3 gas? the answer. $3 gas. because the american people are going to demand that their gas be cheaper. now we are at $4.07 or $4.08 gas. and whats the solution for that? well. maybe. its $4.07 or $4.08 gas. maybe we are going to see a $5 gas or more. maybe we are going to see crude oil go from $139 a barrel to maybe $200 a barrel or more. the predictions are saying that. the futures dont quite say that yet. but the speculators are heading in that direction. why are they doing that? because they understand there is a policy in this congress today. as we listened to mrs. bachmann talk to us about this. to drive up the price of energy. the idea that we would ride our bicycles instead of drive our cars. they can get by with it. they can get by with it because we put the hose in our tank. the nozzle in our tank. when we squeeze that nozzle we are paying 18.4 cents a gallon in gas tax. thats federal. a lot of the states. 20 or more cents in gas tax as well so we can support our transportation in our roads. thats a users fee. i fully support that. the people that squeeze the nozzle to pump the gas into their tanks in my district and across this country believe that money is going to build new roads and rebuild existing roads. thats a sad thing to say. but about onethird of that money goes to that. and the balance of that goes to other causes. some of them are extreme causes. extreme causes. like. for example. 28 percent used for environmental and archaeological compliance. 28 percent of the 18.4 cents that you put in there for gas tax per gallon is going to comply with environmentalist ideas and to look for arrowheads out there. thats 28 percent. and 17 percent goes to subsidized mass transit. the people that are voting for those folks that hold the gavels that have this green idea that we should drive up the cost of energy. arent paying for the cost of that energy because they are getting on the metro down here at south capitol and riding over to falls church for $1.25. subsidized by the gas tax thats paid in mrs. bachmanns district. my district. mr. gingreys district in georgia and across this coun-. try. my constituents dont know that because we havent told them enough. but if i went to them and say. hey. i want to take 17 percent of your gas tax and spend it on something else and subsidize somebody elses transportation. they would object. thats why their constituents. though. the intercity urban members of this congress are not held accountable for higher energy prices because its being subsidized by the gas fees that are paid by people in my district and across the country. by the way it doesnt work for us. it is an awful long drive to get to the metro or the \"l\" or to get to the subway or to get to the trolley car like they have in san francisco. but thats all subsidized by the gas that we are paying thats tax on part of this $4.07 thats out there. now. what is the thinking thats going on in the leadership of this congress? well. i pulled out one little thing. green. think green. we had *a green initiative. called a green the capitol initiative that was initiated by speaker pelosi when shortly after she was sworn into this congress. her idea was that we should show them how to do cap and trade. we should tradeoff some carbon credits. so i got some information that came out of the house administration committee. it goes back to the chief administrative officer of the house. mr. dan beard. who at the direction of speaker pelosi spent $89.000 to purchase carbon credits. well. why purchase the carbon credits at the direction of the speaker? because the speaker wanted to be sure that we were a carbonneutral capital complex. to be carbon neutral they shelled out $89.000 of your tax dollars. americans. $89.000 to purchase carbon credits. i didnt know you could actually go on the market and do that. but you can. it has been done. the market was the chicago climate exchange. not the chicago board of trade. not the chicago mercantile. it was the chicago climate exchange. a place where you can go and buy futures. i presume. and buy puts on carbon credits. so $89.000 went out to carbon credits. and here is where they went. brokered through the chicago climate exchange. this report. through the house administration committeejust some of the money i have been able to track. not all of it-$14.500 went to the north dakota farmers union. now. i dont think they actually farm anything. but it went to the north dakota farmers union. i know they do support some folks on the other side of the aisle very aggressively. and thats fine. this is america. the money went. $14.500. to the farmers union then it was redistributed through there to some of the farmers in places in north dakota. some of the farmers. reportedly. were already doing notill. but to try to convince them. give them incentive to switch over from till to notill. now. i dont know what the acres actually are25. 35 percent of the acres around my neighborhood. i believe. are notill. its a good practice. i support it. i have got good. responsible. neighbors that do use it. i encourage it. but to pay somebody that is already doing notill extra money from the taxpayers through the capital complex and the chicago climate exchange. so they will go and do notill. doesnt seem to me to accomplish a single thing except get rid of some money and allow some leadership in this congress to posture themselves as being carbon neutral. what a glorious thing to accomplish. carbon neutral. you have got to dig back down through the paperwork and get the house administration staff to find this. i didnt find out about it until we dug into it. so $14.500 to north dakota farmers union. another $14.500 went to my state. it went to a reengineered generating plant in iowa. chillicothe. iowa. $14.500. so that they could be having an incentive to clean up their act a little bit and emit less carbon. those carbon credits were available to them. and we sent them the $14.500. the problem was they had shut down before the money got there. there wasnt anything accomplished out of that we can determine. i am open to more information. thats what i know today. but those are two pieces at $14.500 each. i havent chased the rest of the money down. but it occurs to me we didnt accomplish a single thing with carbon emissions and the chillicothe plant. we didnt get there with any money in time. that plant is shut down. not functioning. i understand. some of the north dakota farmers were already doing notill. well. what we did was we set up an exchange now so that we can brokering money and taking taxpayer dollars and send them around the country and the industry. and private sector will be doing the same thing. the value of these credits were estimated by the heritage foundation that they would start out at about $13 and then you figure out how you calculate what a unit is. but $13 a unit. in about 10 years they will be up to about $130 a unit. as near as i can determine. there is no audit system. nobody is going to go check those farmers in north dakota and find out if they actually switch to notill. stayed off notill or went off to do something else. i guess it wont pay to check that power plant in iowa because its not actually producing any power either. thats just one of the things that happens when you get this myopic idea that you are going to worship at the altar of green instead of produce the energy that this country needs. i would just point out another thing here. here is another little piece to look at. here is the overall energy pie. this is the energy that we consume in america. look at the number. its 101.4 quatrillion btus. all together. and thats all the kinds of energy that we use. thats gas. thats diesel fuel. and it goes on. there is coal. there is natural gas. this is the big picture of all of the energy that we are consuming. 101.4 quatrillion btus of energy. now. thats a lot of energy. these are the proportions. i call it the energy pie. and the sizes of the slices of the pie. or the pieces of the productionyou can see that nuclear is over here. and it has got a nice piece of that. it needs to be a lot more. but i have got also the ring here that shows us the production pie. this is the exact diameter of the size of our production. you can see that the circle for the size of the volume of our production in america is 72 percent of the size of our consumption in america. so what republicans propose to do is grow these sources of energy so that this middle circle gets as big as the outer circle and maybe bigger. if it does. that will mean that we are exporting energy. i will submit that every phase. every kind of energy has a future in this country. it needs to compete economically. we need to get into it. as mrs. bachmann said. there is no sensible reason not to tap into the energy that sits underneath us. the outer continental shelf. the north slope of alaska. i have gone up there. by the way. if there is any environmental damage to take place in the north slope of alaska and in anwr. we had already heard about it from the other side of the aisle. they would stand up and say here is where that bucket of crude oil spilled out on the tundra. but we have not done that. even with 1970s technology we have did so efficiently. cleanly and safely. and. yes some little things did happen. i wont deny that. we cleaned them up. we did so effectively and safely. our technology is a lot better. we do directional drilling now. if we drill anwr. that will be the equivalent. theres 19.6 million acres. drilling in anwr on 2.000 acres is the equivalent of a postage stamp in the corner of a football field. its out on a coastal plain. the pictures that you see of the pristine alpine forest are false. there is not a single tree up there. anybody that went to eighth grade knows. the arctic circle is a line north of which trees cant grow. there is not a single tree up there. tundra reconstitutes itself. i have seen acres of it where the eskimos showed me. we kind of tore this up by accident. we smoothed it over and 5. 6 years later it grows back green. looks good. i have seen it. that environment was not damaged in the north slope. it will not be damaged in anwr. its built out on ice roads. we punched the holes out. even the most extreme environmentalist on the left side of this aisle in this congress couldnt fly over the north slope and point to the oil field. they wouldnt see it. i can find it because i know what it looks like. i would like to take them up there and show them. all i saw for wildlife. there are no native caribou. by the way. i saw four muskoxen. thats it. standing there with their head down. they wouldnt know if theres an oil well next to them or not. but its environmentally friendly. we did it in a responsible fashion. and we have got 1 million barrels a day to bring down here. we need to open up every kind of energy. do it now. do it all the time. do it everywhere. get it into the marketplace. get the rules out of the way. and lets not be punishing companies for producing energy. yes. one of the slices on this pie needs to be conservation as well. i thank the gentlelady from minnesota for

speaker. this agricultural. rural development. and food and drug administration appropriations bill provides more than $18.8 billion in discretionary spending for the next fiscal year. this bill represents an increase in spending by nearly 6 percent over last years bill and continues the trend of the democrat majority choosing to provide spending increases well above the rate of inflation and putting each taxpayer in the country on a path towards an average $3.000 increase in their federaltax bill. madam speaker. this is too great a burden for the american taxpayer to pay. as many. of my colleagues know. i represent one of the premier agriculture districts in the country. central washington is rightfully famous for its apples. cherries. wine and many other farm and ranch products. the programs funded under this bill are of great importance to the communities i represent. and there are some provisions in the bill that i do indeed support. for example. i am pleased that funding is maintained for rural development. which provides critical financial help to rural communities across the country. this bill also fully funds the natural resources conservation service. which provides ontheground tech: nical assistance to farmers and ranchers dealing with soil and water management issues. i also note that this bill maintains a provision that i have long supported which allows americans to be able to purchase drugs in other countries at lower prices and bring them back -to the united states lawfully. however. madam speaker. i am very disappointed that this bill cuts agriculture research service funding by over $50 million compared to last year. i represent three agricultute research\" service labs. two of which are collocated with washington state university research facilities. federally sponsored agriculture research not only improves crop productivity. it also helps farmers and ranchers find solutions to environmental and marketing challenges. many agriculture research initiatives. were already facing the prospect of cutting essential research programs and researchers. surely. madam speaker. with such a big increase over last years spending level. we could have found room to at least protect the level of research being conducted today. i am concerned about the potential impacts of these cuts and what it would mean for facilities in my district. in particular the agriculture research service lab in prosser. i intend to continue to work with my colleagues from washington to ensure that we provide the funding necessary to maintain the important agriculture .research activities already underway at these facilities. i am also disappointed that this bill provides only $10 million for the spe* cialty crops block grant program. this program provides grants distributed by the state departments of agriculture to assist the development. production and marketing of fruits and vegetables. earlier this year. i joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues in asking that this program be fully funded at the $44.5 million level. this bill falls far short on this account. madam speaker. if we pass this rule today. the house will begin- consideration of the agriculture. rural development. and food and drug adminis.tration appropriations bill. while this must be accomplished in a timely manner. the senate in fact will not begin consideration of this bill until september and there is. frankly. a more pressing issue facing our nation today. watching the news and reading the newsjiapers. americans are reminded each day that the united states remains vulnerable to another terrorist attack. it.is vital that our laws keep us one step ahead of the terrorists. but currently. madam speaker. we lag behind. right now. federal law ties the hands of our intelligence community. causing them to miss significant portions of intelligence. all because technological advances have outpaced federal law. we cannot wait to respond only after another attack. we must act today. therefore. madam speaker. i will be calling on my colleagues to vote \"no\" on the previous question. bs7 defeating the previous question.. we will give members the ability to vote today on the merits of changing current law to ensure our intelligence community has the tools they need to protect our nation from a potentially imminent terrorist attack.

complete planning and financing for a complex of three highmountain laketap hydroelectric projects that promise to provide at an electric power for southeast alaska and for the pacific northwest. today. i introduce legislation to extend by a total of six years the time for developers to secure data necessary to determine the feasibility and prepare a development application for three individual hydroelectric projects all located up thomas bay in southeast alaska. near petersburg. ak. this legislation will give time for construction of the estimated $75 million. 45megawatt cascade creek project. the $56 million. 30megawatt scenery creek. and the $40 million. 20megawatt delta creek hydroelectric projects to be built. the extensions are needed and justified since the three renewable energy projects can only proceed after a $30 million. 27mile highvoltage transmission line is -constructed in alaska to the u.s.-canada border. after another $130 million is spent for 150 miles of new line are built in canada. after $120 million is spent for 140 miles of transmission line upgrades are finished on the canadian side of the border to move the excess power to skeena near terrace in canada. and after portions of the proposed southeast alaska. electric. intertie are finished to also permit excess power from the existing swan lake and tyee lake hydroelectric projects. and the proposed mahoney lake project near ketchikan. ak. to be shared among panhandle communities and to connect to export transmission lines. the developers of the thomas bay project. cascade. llc.. deserve a time extension since the company. so far. has focused all of its planning efforts on winning approval and financing for the vital electrical interconnection between southeast alaska and canada. not on finishing the three individual power projects. the state of alaska only in early summer 2006 approved a grant of $3.2 million to pay for planning to develop a comprehensive plan and review the economic feasibility of using several of southeast alaskas nearly 100 potential hydroelectric sites to provide power for both local needs and for export of the surplus power to the pacific northwest power grid to help with financing of the 95 megawatts of installed capacity. 410 gigawatt. power project. these hydroelectric projects all involve tapping high mountain lakes for power. they do not require the damming of fish streams. so they have no negative environmental impacts. they will produce electricity at substantial savings over the 40- to 50cents per kilowatt hour cost of generating power from expensive diesel fuel in the region and they will also reduce the effects of local air pollution and reduce carbon dioxide generation through the avoidance of fossil fuel combustion. congress routinely extends the threeyear deadline for worthy potential ferclicensed power projects to provide additional time for completion of preliminary planning. financing and design. it is certainly appropriate to grant these three projects that are so interconnected this additional time to work out the contractual and financial planning and -to finish the environmental studies needed for construction permits to be obtained. developing renewable energy that can be produced without any environmental impacts on streams and the fish and wildlife they support is an increasingly important task of government. this bill will help such environmentallysensitive development occur and will help reduce the nations dependence on foreign fossil fuels. i hope for speedy passage of this

facts and not on laws. this rule was published just 2 days after president bush was sworn into office. much like the roadless rule. this decision was predetermined and more about getting president clinton in the extreme environmental hall of fame than establishing good public policy. it was one of many sad lastditch efforts to polish the tarnished clinton legacy. predetermining the outcome was an obvious violation of the national environmental policy act. or nepa. and was welldocumented in the lawsuit filed by the state of wyoming. the babbitt administration and the clinton administration rushed to force the snowmobile ban. leaving public tours only to be taken by snowcoaches rather than snowmobiles. what is a snowcoach? it sounds warm and fuzzy and friendly. a snowcoach is a modified sports utility vehicle. a bus or a van. in which the wheels and the drive line are modified to use a track system similar to those used on old army tanks. we have one here. notice the bison and how apparently the bison are not bothered by interaction with man. and. by the way. the road we are looking at is the same road that snowmobiles would go on. so it is not going to answer the problem that the gentleman from pennsylvania mentioned about buffalo going down the road. the roads will still be there. these vehicles. here is another one. get 2 to 4 miles per gallon. and believe me. i hav been on them and they are noisy. they travel the exact same roads snowmobiles and cars do. and their air emissions are worse than the new generations of snowmobiles by far. i have been in congress a long time. but this is the first time i have had environmentalists advocate for more suvs in yellowstone national park or any national parks. it is also the first time i have ever heard of environmentalists saying that the use of tanklike vehicles is good for wildlife or the environment. let us be honest in this debate. let us not pretend that preventing the use of snowmobiles will remove all humanwildlife interaction. bison jams will still happen. just as they do in the summer months. when 1.7 million cars drive through yellowstone national park. these bison do not seem overly concerned whether a snowcoach or a snowmobile is in the road. in babbitts rush to illegally force a snowmobile ban through the regulatory process. the air emissions statistics of snowcoaches were actually trumped up to show that they were more environmentally friendly than new generation snowmobiles. in fact. the national park service study understated carbon monoxide emissions for snowmobiles by a factor of 50 percent. becausb they used emission factors for light trucks with wheels on paved roads to calculate potential airquality impacts. rather than testing the vehicles after converted to track systems and run on a snowcovered road. yellowstone national park was created in 1872. as has been stated before. with the dual puirpose of conserving its unique resources and providing a recreation area \"for the benefit and enjoyment of the american people.\" no damage has ever been done to the parks by the 65.000 snowmobiles which enter the parks each winter nor the 1.7 million cars that enter in the summer months on the same roads. snowmobiles have never caused a violation of our current environmental laws. and air quality will only improve under the guideline advanced by the national park service. the new generation 4stroke engines are much quieter and cleaner than the older models. they are wildlife friendly. and theyallow for an enjoyable trip through the park for all the visitors. the new plan put forth by the national park service provides a good balance for continued snowmobile and snowcoach use. while still preserving the health of our national parks and the wildlife. oppose the holt antisnowmobiling amendment. and remember. we do not want more suvs retrofitted to look like tanks driving through our national

connected with these regulations and the possible breaches of customers personal financial privacy. on the other hand. since there is a law enforcement issue involved here with respect to money laundering. we need to be very careful what we do. i am concerned because the amendment not only addresses the proposed regulations but also precludes any other regulations being put forward by the agencies that would be similar to these. conceivably. the agencies could develop more narrow regulations that focus on the money laundering issue. in an effort to curb criminal activity. that would not carry with it the heavy burdens of regulation on the banks and the potential intrusion into the financial privacy of ordinary. lawabiding citizens. which none of us wants to do. in fact. i have introduced a bill on the financial privacy issue. broader legislation than we are talking about here. i have been joined in that by senators dodd. bryan. edwards. leahy. and hollings. that is s. 187. i invite other colleagues to join on that legislation. s. 187. because i think financial privacy is an extremely important issue and one that we need to address. we need to assure safeguards to our consumers that their financial privacy is not to be intruded upon without their knowledge and an opportunity to object. but to reach out. as happened this morning. and try to drag in a subject matter unrelated to education and not directly connected with this bill. as part of a constant process that has been going on over the last few days to block out important educational amendments that would raise significant issues which need to be addressed. it seems to me. is going too far. let me. on these regulations. quickly point out that the regulators have received over 130.000 public comments about the regulations. demonstrating a great deal of concern about the privacy of personal financial information. the regulators have already indicated they recognize the problems with the proposed regulations. some have testified or written to -the congress indicating they expect withdrawal or substantial if not total revision. we are addressing the problem in the normal course under which proposed regulations are. addressed. the problem which this amendment addresses. in fact. of course. this amendment moves in and. in effect. seeks to shortcut or terminate the regular process which would be to let the comment period run and then the regulators take the comments into account. we have already had an indication from the regulators that they have seen enough now so that when they take the public comments into account. the concerns that members have expressed. myself included. will be addressed. the potential problem with the amendment is that it may foreclose any possibility of addressing the legitimate concerns of the law enforcement community directed towards money laundering. my very able colleague from michigan. senator levin. has been working on that issue. i simply rise to point out some of the complexity of this issue with which we are dealing. and to focus on the current situation in which we find ourselves--i gather there is not the ingenuity or wit to devise educationrelated amendments to try to block this process. as has been going on. so now we are going to reach out. wherever we can. and find noneducationrelated amendments. to bring them in to try to close out the amendment tree. i am prompted to speak on that because this question of privacy is an issue to which we have addressed some attention. as i said. there is a comprehensive bill which has been introduced by a number of us which i am very hopeful we will be able to have hearings on and act on. i think the \"know your customer\" proposed regulations is a very important issue to be addressed. but i find it interesting that here we are on a friday morning and. instead of dealing with education. we have brought in this issue out of the jurisdiction of the banking committee. i think the regulators were about to address this issue to everyones satisfaction. but the issue has been addressed in the amendment. possibly in such a broad fashion that it will prevent the formulation of regulations specifically designed to get at money laundering. which the law enforcement community has indicated is a significant concern of theirs. that is an issue to which senator levin has addressed considerable attention. i say to the distinguished chairman. to the extent he views these comments as not relevant or germane to his legislation. they were prompted by the fact that an amendment was proposed which itself is not relevant or germane to the bill before us and has nothing to do with education. my own preference. obviously. is to get on with the education amendments. i hope these discussions that are going to take place will make it possible for significant and important education amendments to be offered to this legislation. we are out here with an important piece of education legislation whose basic concept i support. but i do not think we should be precluded from offering other important initiatives with respect to education which. i think. if brought before the body. would command broad support in this institution. i think it would be very important in helping to deal with the nations educational challenges."},{"1":"1998","2":"HOLLINGS","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. president. in over 30 years as a u.s. senator. i have had the opportunity to work with hundreds of federal employees. among all of those hardworking public servants. there are a few individuals who stand out for their commitment to doing the best possible job for the american people and who have the skills to get that job done. today. i would like to recognize one of those individuals on the occasion of his retirementdr. elbert w. \"joe\" friday. jr.. former director of the department of commerces national weather service. dr. friday has given 38 years of outstanding service to this country. twenty of those years were as a u.s. air force weather detachment commander in saigon. vietnam. and nakhon phanom. thailand. and as the director of environmental and life sciences in the office of the under secretary of defefise for research and engineering-. the remaining eighteen years were served in the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa). during his tenure at noaa. joe served as associate administrator for both the national weather service and the office of oceanic and atmospheric research. as the head of the national weather service. joe has guided the agency through the most significant changes in its 200year history. weather service modernization has required the implementation of powerful new observational technologies. updated information and forecast systems. and a streamlined organizational structure. when complete. it will yield revolutionary advancements in our national public weather warning and forecast system. in fact. in recent years we have already begun to document dramatic improvements in the accuracy and timeliness of the services forecasts. of weather events. for example. the weather service has lengthened the warning time for tornadoes from 6 minutes back in 1994 to 10 minutes today. that may not seem like a huge accomplishment. but it can mean the difference between life and death for individuals who are caught in a tornados deadly path. under dr. fridays leadership. we have also seen substantial improvements in the accuracy of predicting hurricane landfall. allowing local managers to make better and less costly evacuation plans and emergency preparations. in 1989. an anxious nation watched as hurricane hugo moved relentlessly towards the southeastern coast. as we waited. there was one person. joe friday. that i could count on to answer my questions and provide accurate information for tracking the storm. during weather service modernization when local communities in every region raised concerns about the closing of weather stations and the placement of radars. one person. joe friday. sorted through the rumors. listened. and gave us straight information. in recent years. budgetary difficulties have provided joe with some of his greatest challenges. however. he succeeded in protecting the national hurricane center and other essential programs from sweeping cutbacks that would have hampered the ability .of the weather service to do its job. last year. joe moved over to noaas office of oceanic and atmospheric research. where he is responsible for environmental research and technology programs like sea grant and climate and global change. these programs are critical for addressing such diverse issues as global warming. climate prediction. el nifio events. red tides. and pfiesteria. i am sure that many at noaa would echo my view when i say that i regret not being able to entice dr. friday to stay longer in his new position. throughout his career. joe friday has shared credit for successes. but never blamed others for problems or difficulties. he is a rare mix of gifted scientist. decorated soldier. and eloquent speakera charismatic man who leads by example and has inspired a generation of men and women at the national weather service. his strong leadership. clear vision. loyalty. and concern for his colleagues were instrumental in creating an effective team of professionals. his simple but powerful philosophy has always been that. as a public servant. his responsibility is to provide the highest level of products and services to the people of the united states and the world. in all his endeavors. he has supplied endless energy. sound judgment. keen intelligence. and a sense of humor to the government he is so proud to serve. it was no surprise to anyone when he was awarded the 1993 federal executive of the year. an. outstanding and well deserved recognition for his contributions. i am confident that i speak for many of my colleagues when i express admiration and thanks to joe for his invaluable contributions to the united states of america and to the global scientific community. he has our best wishes and deepest gratitude for his accomplishments in his 38 years of federal serv-.

president. interstate 55 runs straight through mississippi to memphis and st. louis before veering northeast into springfield and chicago. and. in addition to carrying cars with their passengers and trucks with their cargo. 155 is a firearm freeway into my home state. gunrunners ship trunkloads of guns up 155 for use by criminals. two years ago. one of those gunsthat probably came into illinois via i55--was used to shoot chicago police officer daniel doffyn in the head. officer doffyn was fresh out of the police academy. he was out on a burglary call. and a tec9 from mississippi killed him. the legislation senator torricelli and i introduce today lets everyone know that we are committed to closing down the illegal gunrunning operations that put that tec9 into the hands of the man who killed daniel doffyn. and let no one underestimate the deadly impact of gunrunning across state lines. my home state of illinois has tough gun laws. the local firearms dealers. police. and licensing authorities work hard to make sure that felons cannot go into a store and buy guns. they also work hard to keep the illegal gun market under control. but we have learned that one state alone cannot overpower the illegal gun market. earlier this year we obtained data from the bureau of alcohol. tobacco and firearms detailing the results of their efforts to trace guns used in crimes. we analyzed that data and produced a report. that report concluded that: first. guns used in crimes are most likely to come from just a few states with relatively weak gun control laws. of the traceable guns used nationwide in crimes. 16.635 of the 47.068. or 35 percent. were outofstate guns. second. in states with strong gun laws. criminals obtain many of their guns from other states with weaker gun laws. third. in states with lax gun laws. criminals obtain the majority of their guns from their home state. fourth. the trafficking of guns moves primarily in one direction. from states with weak gun laws to states with tough gun laws. fifth. when neighboring states have different levels of gun control laws. the state with lax laws floods its stricter neighbor with guns. in illinois we can see how these conclusions play out. illinois is a net tracedguns importer. in 1996. illinois accounted for a total of 399 crime guns traced in all the other states combined. however. 1.596 guns from out of state were traced to crimes in illinois. thirtyfive percent of the guns traced from crimes in illinois were from out of state. and 10 percent of the guns traced from crimes in illinois were from alabama. mississippi. and texas. mississippi is the top supplier of outofstate guns to illinois. 306. and wisconsin. 75. in contrast. illinois exported only two guns traced to crime in mississippi. in mississppi. 268 guns involved in a crime were traced right back to mississippi. in contrast. 306 mississippi guns were traced to crimes in illinois. overall. illinois pays a heavier price for mississippis lax gun control laws than mississippi does. in contrast to the weak gun law states. illinois has tough gun laws. thats why per capita. illinois barely plays a role in the gunrunning business. states with laxer gun control laws are acting as exporters to illinois. illinois accounted for 2 percent of the gun exports traced in crimes in other states. in contrast. texas and florida accounted for almost 14 percent of those gun exports. mr. president. i believe that it is time to shut down the firearms freeway to illinois. that is why i am happy to sponsor this bill. this measure will let everyone know that we are quite serious about this. that the gunrunning black market is not just a harmless little business venture. people who run trunkloads of guns into another state are doing so for the sole purpose of making money off selling guns to people they know intend to use the gun in crime. this bill provides for a 3year mandatory minimum for gunrunners. and the penalties will go up with the number of guns. if you run 50 guns. the penalty is 15 years. this legislation also makes gunrunning a rico or racketeering predicate. with this tool in place. we can shut down entire gunrunning syndicates. i believe that we should all easily support this measure. it is aimed at taking guns out of the hands of criminals. mr. president. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and additional material be printed in the record."},{"1":"1996","2":"DASCHLE","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. president. passage of the small business regulatory fairness act will mark an important milestone in our efforts to provide american business with reasonable. common sense regulatory relief. it is a bill that should be passed by congress and sent to the president with dispatch. this legislation. which was approved unanimously by the senate small business committee. and which i expect will pass the senate with overwhelming bipartisan support. will provide much needed change in the way federal agencies deal with american 1 small business. it acknowledges that the federal bureaucracy often chokes small business in red tape. and institutes a number of reforms that will unleash their productive energy without diminishing the federal responsibility to protect the public health and safety. passage of this bill will send an important message to small business owners across the country that their voice is being heard in washington. dc. small businesses already face a daunting array of challenges. from the uncertain economic climate to the myriad daily paperwork burdens of accounting. bookkeeping. and bill paying. the further burden of keeping up with. and complying with. federal regulations can discourage even the most stalwart business men and women from striving to achieve their dream of en-. trepreneurship. the federal government has a responsibility to protect worker health andsafety. public health. and the environment. in that effort. agencies issue regulations. but experience shows that many of those regulations look good on paper. but dont work in the real world. this bill acknowledges that fact and demonstrates our determination to both confront and correct mistakes. federal agencies should be as sensitive as possible to the challenges faced by small businesses in america. and i expect this bill will help achieve that goal. many of this bills provisions were developed by small business owners from south dakota and across the country during the white house conference on small business last summer. no one knows more about the risks and pitfalls associated with owning a small business than businesspeople themselves. the white house conference gave them a forum in which to discuss how the regulatory process could be improved. and i am glad that congress has taken to heart what they had to say on this subject. one of the most frequent criticisms i hear from small business owners is that federal agencies bring harsh enforcement actions against businesses for relatively insignificant and unintentional violations of federal rules. this legislation responds to that concern by requiring agencies to develop policies to waive fines for firsttime. nonserious violations. the legislation also requires federal agencies to publish easytoread guidance for small business to comply with federal rules and creates a small business and agricultural ombudsman at the small business administration to provide a means to comment on agency enforcement personnel and to develop a customer satisfaction rating of federal agencies. it assists small businesses in recovering attorneys fees if they have been subject to excessive and unsustainable enforcement actions. and subjects final agency actions under the regulatory flexibility act to judicial review. small businesses will now be able to hold the feet of federal agencies to the fire and ensure that they comply with the letter and spirit of the regulatory flexibility act finally. i am very pleased that the cbngressional veto* legislation developed by senators reid and nickles and passed by the senate last year has been added to the small business regulatory fairness act. the reid/nickles provision establishes a process through which congress can review major regulations before they are issued. thereby ensuring that the agencies developing these rules adhere to the intent of congress and develop reasonable requirements for american business. mr. president. the small business regulatory fairness act was written with advice from the small business community and will pass the senate with strong bipartisan support. it reaffirms congress belief in the essential role that small business plays in the american economy and sends a clear signal that the public and private sectors are ready to work together in promoting the economic growth .and expansion we will need to compete in the 21st century. i urge all my colleagues to support this important bill."},{"1":"1995","2":"MCCAIN","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. president. i do not intend to take the full 30 minutes as i have under the unanimous consent agreement. and also i would like to yield some of the time to the senator from pennsylvania. also. if necessary. i would be glad to yield some of the time to my colleague from iowa or the senator from mississippi in response to some of the concerns that i have. first let me applaud the appropriations committee for doing an admirable job and resisting earmarks and other unnecessary spending. and i especially want to thank chairman hatfield. senator byrd. chairman livingston. and other members of the committee. i also disagree with the president for stating that he intends to veto this bill. certainly. the bill is not perfect. but it does. i think. contribute to our efforts to reduce unnecessary spending. there are several aspects of this bill that i have concerns about and. very frankly. mr. president. when the president says there is pork barrel spending in the bill. i am sorry to say that i also have reached that conclusion. i just want to mention several aspects of the bill. and i would be glad to hear a response either from the distinguished senator from mississippi. from west virginia. or the senator from iowa. if he sochooses. to begin with. there are several portions of the bill where money was addedaddedin. and projects created without being in either rescission bill before it went to conference. again. mr. president. i find this practice unacceptable. i find it a deprivation of my rights as a senator to vote and debate on authorization and appropriation. and that is why i would continue to raise especially these items that are put in conference without consultation with the rest of the senate or even. very frankly. having been debated or discussed in the formulation of the bill on both sides. one. the bills text says: of the funds made available under this heading in public law 103330 and other acts. $1.400.000 are rescinded. provided that of balances available within this account. $12.678.000 shall be available for a grant to iowa state university for the construction of the national swine research center. and the managers statement says: the house bill proposed rescinding $12.678.000 from amounts appropriated for the national swine research facility in ames. iowa. the conference agreement provides that the $12.678.000 for the national swine research facility be provided as a grant to iowa state university to construct that facility at ames. iowa. the conferees direct the agricultural research service to convey ownership to iowa state university. the conferees are aware of the interest and need for important swine research. however. financial constraints require difficult choices. the conferees expect that any future cost of operation associated with that. facility be provided by sources other than the federal government. by the way. i noted that just last month the president of the united states went to iowa and expressed his strong support for spending $13 million for a 13th federal swine research center. what i do not understand here is. first. why does this action have to be taken in a conference that is on a rescission bill? that is no. 1. no. 2. why should it be given to iowa state university? are there other universities in the country that are qualified? was there any competition? was there any estimate made of the cost? or did we just decide that $12.678.000 should be given to bulild a facility at iowa state university? there may be very legitimate answers to these questions. but none of them have been discussed or debated by the entire u.s. senate. there are several more. but two especially. one concerns clear lake development facility. the conferees agree to include an administrative provision which will enable the national aeronautics and space administration to exercise an option to purchase the clear lake development facility. as modified for use as a neutral buoyancy laboratory. the facility is currently being leased by nasa. it is the intention of the conferees that the cost of the facility as modified by the current owner (or contractor) and delivered completely modified to nasa. will be no more than $35.000.000. the bill text says: sec. 1008. the administrator shall acquire. for no more than $35.000.000 a certain parcel of land. together with existing facilities. located on the site of the property referred to as the clear lake development facility. clear lake. texas. the land and facilities in question comprise approximately 13 acres and include a light manufacturing facility. an avionics development facility and an assembly and test building which shall be modified for use as a neutral buoyancy laboratory in support of human space flight activities. \" this provision. which is in the bill text. and the report language was not in either the house or the senate bills as passed by each body. have there been hearings on this matter? the presidents budget request does not contain request for this purchase. it is my understanding that nasa must now. should this act become law. purchase this one certain parcel of land. what if there were other facilities that could be bought more inexpensively? does nasa need the facilities described in the bill text? why is nasa purchasing building facilities that it is then directed to convert into a buoyancy lab? does nasa have any need for these additional buildings? it is my understanding that mcdonneldouglas currently owns this facility. what is the fair market value of this facility? have nasa and mcdonneldouglas been negotiating this sale? could not this purchase wait for the normal authorization and appropriation process to occur? it seems to me if we are going to make a purchase of $35 million from a private corporation of a piece of land it should not appear suddenly in the conference report of a rescission bill. as i say there may be perfectly legitimate reason to do so. but this is no way to legislate. the next one. of course. that i find very unusual is: notwithstanding any other provision of law or regulation. the national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) shall convey. without reimbursement. to the state of mississippi. all rights. title and interest of the united states in the property known as the yellow creek facility and consisting of approximately 1.200 acres near the city of iuka. mississippi. including all improvements thereon and also including any personal property owned at nasa that is currently located onsite and which the state of mississippi to facilitate the transfer: provided. that appropriated funds shall be used to effect this conveyance. provided further. that $10.000.000 in appropriated funds otherwise available to nasa shall be transferred to the state of mississippi to be used in the transition of the facility. provided further. that each federal agency with prior contact to the site shall remain responsible for any and all environmental remediation made necessary as a result of its activities on the site * * * the managers statement says: yellow creek facility. mississippithe federal government has a long history of involvement in yellow creek. located near iuka. mississippi. the site. originally purchased by the tennessee valley authority for use as a nuclear energy plant. was subsequently transferred to nasa after the nuclear energy plants cancellation. nasa intended to use yellow creek to build the advanced solid rocket motor (asrm) and. after its cancellation. instead committed to use the site to build nozzles for the redesigned solid rocket motor (rsrm). on may 2. 1995. due to its current budgetary constraints. nasa terminated the rsrm nozzle production effort at yellow creek. the bill language included by the conferees on the transfer of the nasa yellow creek facility reflects the most recent commitment made by the nasa administrator to the governor of the state of mississippi. the major investment by the state of mississippi in facilities and infrastructure to support yellow creek. in excess of $100.000.000 is a key to factor in nasas agreement to turn the site over to the state of mississippi. the main elements of the agreement reached between nasa and the state of mississippi. which the conferees expect to be adhered to by the two parties. are as follows. the yellow creek facility will be turned over to the appropriate agency of the state of mississippi within 30 days of enactment of this act. all of the nasa property on yellow creek which the state of mississippi requires to facilitate the transfer of the site transfers within the site to the state. subject to the following exceptions and those exceptions are interesting. to say the least. but. also. and the final paragraph is also interesting: within thirty days of enactment of this act. $10.000.000 will be transferred from nasa to the appropriate agency of the state of mississippi. the sites environmental permits will become the property of the state of mississippi. nasa will provide all necessary assistance in transferring these permits to the state of mississippi. again. mr. president. this is a rescission bill. this provision was contained in neither the house nor the senate bills nor accompanying reports. again. this language is not in the presidents budget. why are we forcing nasa to buy one parcel of land while we are forcing it to give another away at no cost? if nasa has been working with the state of mississippi on this matter. why was -this provision not included in the rescission bill when that measure was before the senate? is there some emergency. some reason why we are transferring this land to the state of mississippi in this bill without waiting for nasa reauthorization and appropriations bills? mr. president. there are numerous other provisions in this bill which i will make part of the record as part of my statement. but here is the problem again. the problem is that we have authorization bills on which many issues are .silent. like these two i just went over. then we have an appropriations process here on the floor of the senate where we are silent on these two major projects totaling well over $70 million here. and then out of the conference into the report. where no member of this body can make any changes to it. appear these appropriations for as much as $50 or $60 million in this case. it deprives the members of the senate of the ability to debate and discuss issues and the expenditure of their taxpayers dollars. especially egregious is when it is on a rescission bill. this is not a spending bill. this is a rescission bill. so instead of cutting funding we are adding money. mr. president. as i say. there are probably good and valid and legitimate reasons for these areas and others i will highlight in the formal part of my statement. but i can assure you. there is no argument that can be made that this process is correct because it does not allow the members of this body. who were duly elected but were not members of the conference on appropriations with the other body to have any input whatsoever into these decisions. we deserve that. and it is our obligation. since it is our taxpayers dollars being expended. to be a part of that. i hope this process will stop. i hope this process will stop. we are about to begin the appropriations cycle of some 12 or 13 bills. i intend. i say to my colleagues. to continue to do everything in my power to stop this practice and return to the practices that we should follow in the u.s. senate. which are hearings. authorization. appropriation. conference. and final signing of the bill by the president of the united states. mr. president. i ask how much time i have remaining?"},{"1":"1994","2":"WISE","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. speaker. i rise in strong support of house resolution 420 which provides for conideration of a substitute amendment to h.r. 2442. the economic development reauthorization act of 1994. house resolution 420 provides for consideration of this substitute amendment under an open rule. under the provisions of the resolution. no limitations are placed on amendments which may be offered. when the leadership of .the public works committee testified before the rules committee. we requested an open rule and house resolution 420 honors that request. i want to take this opportunity to thank chairman moakley. the members of the rules committee. and the manager of the resolution. congressman beilenson. for bringing forth a rule which deserves unanimous support from both sides of the aisle. house resolution 420 provides for a compromise substitute amendment to be in order as the original text for purposes of amendment. the compromise substitute amendment reflects a bipartisan agreement of the public works committee and the committee on banking. finance and urban affairs to revise arnd extend the public works and economic development act of 1965 and the appalachian regional development act of 1965 and .reauthorize the programs of the economic development administration [eda] and the appalachian regional commission [arc]. mr. speaker. many of us have waited 12 long years to have the chance to be here today. this is the first time since 1982 that we actually have a realistic chance to reauthorize the economic development administration and the appalachian regional commission. i join with my good friend and chairman norm mineta in supporting adoption of house resolution 420. the committee on public works and transportation ordered the eda and arc reauthorization bin reported last november by a unanimous vote. we worked very closely with our colleagues congressman bud shuster and congresswoman susan mol:nar. who are ranking members of the fuil committee and economic development subcommittee respectively. to craft a bill which has bipartisan support in our committee. we achieved this goal. and we have been working together ever since to make sure that this spirit of cooperation remains. i want to say that we would not be here today if it were not for the cooperative working relationship enjoyed between the majority and minority on the public works comnmttee. h.r. 2442 was sequentially referred to the committee on banking. finance and urban affairs and to its subcommittee on economic growth and credit formation. i would like to compliment my friend and colleague. congressman paul kanjorski. chairman of the economic growth subcommittee. for his cooperation in the past weeks to reach a compromise. since the banking committee reported h.r. 2442 on april 26. 1994. the public works and banking committees have been working together to achieve a product which we all can agree upon. and i believe that both sides have gained fromthe effort. the final product is the compromise substitute amendment. it is a good amendment and i believe that it will be broadly supported. again. i want to compliment chairman gonzalez and congressman kanjorski on the way they approached these ultimately successful negotiations. and wish to also note the support provided by congressman leach and congressman ridge on the minority side of the banking committee. the substitute amendment to h.r. 2442 authorizes the economic development administration and the appalachian regional commission for a period of 3 years through fiscal year 1996. title i of the substitute amends existing provisions of the public works and economic development act of 1965 (pweda]. this approach differs from previous eda reauthorzation bills which struck existing titles of pweda and rewrote the legislation. title ii authorizes funds for arc programs and amends the appalachian regional development act of 1965. it includes provisions which are similar to previous arc reauthorization bills. several of the provisions contained in the substitute amendment address criticisms of the administration of these programs and include recommendations made by witnesses at hearings conducted by our committee on the legislation. during these hearings. representatives of numerous organizations. development districts. and local. regional. and state governments from both urban and rural areas have pointed out that many areas of the nation continue to need the economic assistance provided by the eda and arc programs. among the most often mentioned recommendations for the programs were multiyear funding at higher levels and expediting a simplified applications process. particularly for eda programs. the authorization for fiscal year 1994 mirrors the already enacted appropriation of $322 million for eda programs. for each of fiscal years 1995 and 1996. the substitute authorizes an estimated amount of $386 million for eda programs. the substitute amendment authorizes $249 million for fiscal year 1994 andan estimated $214 million per year for fiscal years 1995 and 1996 for arc programs. as we have moved the economic development reauthorization act through the legislative process. secretary of commerce ron .brown and appalachian reglonw commission federal cochairman jesse white have been very helpful to the committee. for instance. secretary brown has indicated that eda will be a cornerstone for areas hit by military base closures and the loss of military contracts. eda officials have testified that they are. already heavily involved in assisting communities affected by defense spending cuts as well as areas severely impacted by natural disasters such as hurricanes andrew and inild. typhoon omar. the severe storms of kansas. the midwest floods. and the recent earthquake in southern califomia. mr. speaker. we have an opportunity to take both the eda and the arc into modem times. much has changed in our country since both were last authorized in the early 1980s. and the programmatic changes contained in the substitute amendment will go a long way toward modernizing the way both do business. mr. speaker. i urge support of house resolution 420 to allow us to consider this important legislation in a fair and open process."},{"1":"1993","2":"WALSH","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. chairman. i rise today in strong

mandatory programs will provide additional money for food stamps. for child nutrition programs and for popular feeding programs such as mealsonwheels which benefit lowincome senior citizens. we have also increased spending on the high priority wic program by $350 million to $3.21 billion. this increase is the largest in our bill and it will enable wic to enroll over 5.9 million lowincome women and children into this costeffective program. this bill takes a significant step toward reforming the federal crop insurance program by phasing in an area yield concept. since its inception in 1980. the federal crop insurance corporation [fcic] has lost hundreds of millions of dollars while private insurance companies. who have borne little of the programs risks. have profited handsomely. furthermore. the availability of crop insurance has not succeeded in eliminating other forms of disaster assistance. congress has always been and will continue to be sympathetic to pleas from our constituents for relief from natural disasters. this is just human nature. i am also glad to report that this bill provides $2.9 billion for conservation * programs. conserving. improving and sustaining our natural resources and environment has to be one of our countrys top priorities. agriculture today is facing greater challenges than ever in meeting public demands for environmental protection. agriculture has been identified as a major contributor to nonpoint source water pollution. in fact. water quality is the most rapidly emerging issue impacting agriculture today. in this bill we are also able to expand the wetlands reserve program by providing funding for an additional 50.000 acres of wetlands. last year. the committee was not able to provide any funding for this program. while i would have liked to have seen more land setaside for wetlands protection. this committee has added eight new states to the wetlands reserve program and enrolled. protect and restore our wetlands habitat while staying within the tight budgetary constraints under which the committee was forced to operate. our committee has agreed to restructure the rural electrification administration loan programs. this fundamental change to rea programs will eliminate the current 2percent loan program for rural telephone and electrical cooperatives. thereby cutting back the federal subsidies that phone companies and rural cooperatives have been receiving. while many members. including myself. have argued in the past that the rea has outlived its usefulness. i believe that rea has seen the light and has belatedly responded by increasing its interest rates and revamping the agencys mission. our committees appropriation supports this reduction in rea subsidy rates and our action has resulted in a savings of $97 million. this bill also significantly increases spending for both direct and guaranteed singlyfamily rural housing loans. these programs will help provide lowincome residents with affordable housing. the bill also provides much needed research for farm safety programs and it provides for a $27 million increase for the food safety inspection service. given the recent outbreak of e coll bacteria in washington state it is imperative that we accelerate our efforts to develop an improved sciencebased approach in inspection service to enhance the continued public safety or our meat and poultry supply. finally. the committee provides $813 million for food and drug administration programs. the fda sets food and product standards. evaluates the safety and efficacy of new drugs and medical devices and protects and promotes the health of virtually every american by regulating the activities and uses of food and drug products. while i have continuing concerns about the notoriously slow drug and products approval process. i am hopeful that this $200 million increase over president clintons request will aseist the fda in expediting the drug approval process. there are numerous other beneficial programs which i could cite in support of this bill. i commend again the work of the distinguished subcommittee chairman. mr. durbin and i urge members to support this important legislation."},{"1":"1992","2":"HOLLINGS","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. president. i rise today to honor four south carolina companies for their leadership

in commonincluding an intense responsibility for the health of spaceship earth as bucluninster fuller once called it. mankind and our biosphere is now confronted by an environmental danger of enormous scope and with farreaching implications. i am speaking about the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer which screens the earth from the most dangerous solar ultraviolet rays. scientists have discovered that chlorine from manmade industrial compounds known as chlorofluorocarbons and halons is responsible for the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer. the earths increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation portends a variety of harmful consequencesincluding a higher incidence of skin cancer and cataracts. suppresion of the human bodys immune system. and reduced crop growth and yield. epa estimates that if zone depletion trends were to continue. we could expect 40 million excess skin cancers and an additional 800.000 deaths within the next 80 yzars. a number of other harmful effects on the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems could also result from cllmatic changes which further depletion of the ozone layer could contribute to. furthermore. ozonedepleting cfcs are included among the greenhouse gases which have been implicated in global warming. the urgency of this situation has not been lost on the world community. mr. president. last year the united states. along with 24 nations and the european economic community signed the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer. the parties to that treaty pledged to reduce the 1086 world production levels of cfcs 50 percent by the year 1998. and to freeze halon production at 1986 levels. a short time ago. this body voted unanimously to ratify the treaty. while the ink was drying on the protocol. mr. president. the latest scientific data indicated that the situation may be more serious than previously supposed. the information came from the second of two expeditions to antarctica and a study conducted by the international ozone trends panel. the panel was made up of representatives from nasa. the national oceanic and atmospheric agency. the federal aviation administration. the world meteorological organization and the united nations environment program. one hundred scientists spent 1 year peer reviewing ozone measurement data. including information gathered by nasas nimbus 7 satellite. the panel confirmed the seasonal hole which occurs in the ozone layer over antarctica and estimated that between the period 1969 and 1986. depletion in the ozone layer averaged between 1 and 3 percent over tle entire northern hemisphere. in response to the latest scientific data. a short time ago the dupont corp.-which accounts for nearly half of our domestic cfc industryannounced that it will be phasing out cfc production over an unspecified period of time. i find this commitment to be an impressive testimony to the convincing nature of the scientific evidence which has established the link between cfcs and halons to ozone depletion. cfc manufacturers including dupont. allied signal and dow. and the user industries. have demonstrated a sensitivity and concern regarding ozone depletion and should be commended and encouraged for their willingness to cooperate in the effort to address it. clearly. mr. president. protecting the ozone layer by reducing cfcs and halons is a pressing national and international imperative and meeting this responsibility will be no simple task. we are dealing with industrial substances which are widely used and phasing them downor out. should science find that step necessarywill have an enormous impact upon many industries and consumers. cfcs are used as refrigerants in air conditioners and refrigerators. they are employed as foam blowing agents in such items as insulation and packaging materials. and they are used extensively as solvents. this nation has 130 billion dollars worth of installed equipment using cfc and halon compoundomany of which we do not yet have safe substitutes for. clearly. mr. president. to protect the ozone layer as we must. and to avoid potential widespread economic and industrial disruption. we must commit ourselves to the development of and transition to safe and suitable alternatives to ozonedepleting cfcs and halons. i do not believe enough attention has been paid by public policy makers to this critical aspect of thtr ozone layer problem. today i am introducing legislation to help fill this gap by creating a public/private sector task force which will be responsible for developing and recommending initiatives we should undertake to facilitate this effort. the task force will be comprised of representatives from the environmental protection agency. the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. the general services administrat ion. the u.s. trade representative. the national science foundation and representatives from the cfc and halon manufacturing and user industries. they will examine ways we can promote the rapid development of suitable replacement compounds and new technologies through appropriate intergovernmental. international and commercial technology transfer. and will seek other initiatives to strengthen public/private cooperation in achieving our goals. the bill calls upon the task force to conduct a comprehensive review to identify any federal laws and regulations which might impede the reduction of ozonedepleting cfcs and halons. or which might inadvertantly hinder the transition to safe substitutes. mr. president. this legislation also addresses several other areas we must emphasize in order to reduce the need for production. i am referring to recycling and conservation. the task force will seek ways we can promote recycling and remove barriers which may exist to the recycling industry. furthermore. the bill would require the task force to examine ways we can develop. encourage. and share proper handling. processing procedures and field practices to limit ozonedepleting emissions as much as possible. this will ensure that we are doing everything we can to suppress emissions which would otherwise migrate to the stratosphere. it should come as no surprise. mr. president. that the federal government is one of the largest buyers of products containing cfcs and halons. this legislation will require us to look at federal procurement. policies. practices and governmental uses of ozonedepleting substances and develop measures to promote the earliest possible transition to safe substitutes where they are available. i believe the federal government has this responsibility. because some of these governmental uses involve defense. the task force. will also be required to assess the assorted defense related applications and report upon the national security impact. if any. of reduced production. as well as the effect of a complete phase out. finally. the task force will seek to identify the potential for unfair trade practices which could impact the united states during the early implementation of the protocol when an immediate decrease in production will be required. mr. president. i believe this legislation will play a vital role in helping us to find safe industrial substitutes and to take the affirmative actions necessary to protect the ozone layer in an efficient. effective and cooperative fashion. clearly. the depletion of the ozone layer is a global problem requiring a global solution. we have august environmental responsibilities as the privileged stewards of this earth. with our leadership and through continued international cooperation the world community can meet its obligationsand it must. i ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed

senator domenici and particularly senator bentsenwho is the ranking member of the committee on which i serve and on which senator domenici serves and which has always been a place of good cooperation

senator domenici and i considered a number of possible avenues of reform. after working with the administration. and consulting with all sides in this situation. we decided to offer a package of reforms that address the following issues: first. orphan shares: our amendments provide congressional approval of the administrators existing discretion to have the fund pay for the cleanup of the shares contributed by unknown. insolvement or similarly unavailable parties. such as various government entities which may be immune from liability. second. de minimis settlement provisions: to encourage the government to settle with small contributors without resorting to fullblown litigation. third. releases from liability: where parties. working with the epa. perform environmentally preferable cleanups on their own. they will become eligible for releases from future liability that will provide greater certainty and insurability. fourth. expedited remedial action agreement procedures: the -government will henceforth provide. with specified exceptions. a nonbinding preliminary allocation of responsibility. this allocation would provide a basis on which parties.could work with the government to share information and move more rapidly toward reasonable settlement offers. fifth. state matching grants: we have also proposed a state matching grant for innovative. staterun cleanup efforts that are important. but generally too small to trigger a superfund response. the program would allow the fund to provide $1 million per state. in matching grants. but none of this money could be used in litigation expenses. it is hoped that. in addition to spurring state cleanup efforts. that this program will provide innovative ideas for the national superfund. in addition. this money will be available for cleaning up leaking underground storage tanks. i believe that the domenicisimpson package of amendments is just the beginning. it seems likely. if not certain. that

taking on this day. but the falmouth dam structure is to be constructed in the congressional district that i represent and i vigorously oppose this killer amendment. the author of the amendment advances the argument that the purpose of his proposal is simply to apply the same cost sharing to this project that lie would have the members believe that is applied to all other projects. what lie did not say is that uniform cost sharing is not a rigid and inflexible process with no exceptions. and iore importantly. that the application of his criteria kills the project since these conditions cannot now be met or be expected to be met. as the sponsor of section 301(b). i can tell the members that without this change to the existing project authorization it cannot be implemented. the falmouth dam was first authorized in 1936. that authorization was modified in the flood control act of 1938. to date. $948.000 in federal funds have been expended on the project. this project is not a standalone project. it is a part of a comprehensive program that encompasses 74 floodcontrol reservoirs intended to reduce flood flows on the ohio river. second. the falmouth dam will reduce flood damages on the licking river. yes. including the city of palmouth. some sections of the city have been flooded almost annually. notwithstanding what my colleague from kentucky has to say. the major floods were in 1937. 1948. and 1964 and the pictures here are of the 1964 flood. that event put about threefourths of the city under water. the residents of the area have also suffered through terrible droughts in 1983 and in 1984. wherein those in the licking river basinwhich includes both the district that i represent and the district of the sponsor of the aniendmentare about to run out of drinking water falmouth has three drinking water inlets and the licking river is now 6 inches above the lower one. the city of cynthiana in the gentlemans district has now applied for a grant to go over and take water out of the licking before it gets to falmouth. and the people of falmouth are concerned about this in these drought periods. i think it should be noted that they had to have water hauled from falmouth to cynthiana in 1983. mr. chairman. the main reason that the project has not been built has been the reluctance of the state of kentucky to cost share the recreational aspects of this project. as the members know. the state would have to pay 50 percent of the costs associated with the recreational development. because of the lack of agreement over recreation. the flood damage prevention benefits have been denied to the residents of the licking river watershed and the ohio river basin. in 1904. the dam would have reduced the flood level at cinclinati by 3 feet. at that time the city of cincinnati passed a resolution in favor of it. . as a matter of fact. we have received 620 individual letters. the project opponents say the people down there in the area do not support it. i have 18 mayors. representing a population of 93.212 who have indicated their support in recent weeks. over the years. falmouth has been endorsed by virtually every northern kentucky unit of local government as well as the city council of cincinnati. . the members should be aware that the opposition comes from a few people in the congressional district represented by the author of the amendment. in support of those opposed to the dam. the gentleman alleges that construction of the dam will flood 25.000 acres. 9.000 of which are considered prime farmland. but what he did not tell my colleagues is that in 1983. 11.615 of those acres in the project area were in acreagereduction programs and that costs a little bit of money. including for pik. while the dam is in the district that i represent. a point misconstrued by a number of groups who have circulated material in opposition to the project. there is also significant support in the gentlemans area for the project. as a matter of fact. harrison county. which is the next county down. this is the local newspaper. dick coe. promotingthe falmouth dam. is a former harrison county magistrate. he says in this article: \"it is time for harrison county to support the falmouth reservoir.\" i learned last night of a major groundswell of support that has been launched over in bracken county in the author of the amendments district. 75 letters arrived yesterday alone in support of the project from bracken county. mr. chairman. the corps of engineers project evaluation and selection process has generally worked well. however. in a few minutes. some areas. through the accident of geography. are suffering from discrimination. this is because the value of the property protected is not as high as it might be if that communities werc located in a wealthier highcost area. such as the suburbs of northern virginia that we are all familiar with. thus. the corps if forced to conclude that the benefits are not sufficient to justify the project.. the falmouth project area is not an economically wealthy area. as a result. the project is unfairly penalized by blind adherence to current corps project selection and funding procedures. regardless of the way in which corps regulations are drafted. however. let me say the fact remains that this area has suffered recurring national disasters. and yes. my co~league from kentucky is right. i said from floods. tornadoes. and drought. i do not know who the gentleman talked to in falmouth that does not remember the tornado. i guess it did not happen the year he was running for governor and he passed through there. but here is a recent photograph from the april 20. 1984. falmouth outlook. and a fullpage article on the tornado of april 23. 1968. i welcome my

the sun as an energy source. the solar power satellite concept provides us with another future alternative energy source which has great promise for being clean. renewable. and costefficient. this bill is similar to the \"solar power satellite research. development and demonstration act of 1979\" which passed the house of representatives during the 2d session of the 95th congress. however. there is less emphasis on the satellite demonstration in the bill i am introducing today. the concern of congress must be not only to resolve the energy crisis. but to insure our route to this solution is as efficient as possible. the solar power satellite program shows the promise to warrant our attention and to bring about the enactment of this legislation.

studying and reviewing the social. economic. and environmental impact of the act and the changes they propose in h.r. 3199. the federal water pollution control act amendments of 1977. will do much to strengthen the national program for the restoration and preservation of our waters. one section of the committee amendments in particular demonstrates the committees responsiveness to the recommendations of state and local authorities who are on the firing line in this great national effort--that is the provision which gives the states authority to certify municipal applications for federal grants for the construction of waste water treatment plants. this state certification authority in no way diminishes federal responsibility for the administration of the program. it allows the environmental protection agency to accept such certifications where the state pollution control agencies have the authority. responsibility. and capability to do the job effectively. the certification authority is safeguarded by strict federal requirements and can be withdrawn in the case of a single application or in all applications at any time that epa determines the job is not being done properly. this new provision will go a long way toward speeding up the program by eliminating much of the redtape and papershuffling between the states and washington that have slowed our efforts in

i am pleased to have this opportunity today to discuss s. 521. proposed revisions to the outer continental shelf lands act. comprehensive legislation which will provide for the more orderly development of oil and gas resources in federal waters adjacent to coastal states. the bill amends the 1953 law by providing new leasing. exploration. development and production guidelines. giving impacted coastal states a meaningful input. coupling federal compensation for industrial impacts with the coastal zone management act and improving safety requirements governing resource recovery technology. the bill also vastly improves oil spill liability responsibilities. procedurely separates exploration from development and provides incentives to utilize alternative and innovative bidding systems which could provide more return to the public. over the past 20 years. we have paid scant attention to the industrial development resulting from ocs development as it was gradual and concentrated in the gulf of mexico and louisiana. as a result. there grew up a closed system for development of the offshore resources of the united. states. consisting of major oil companies and department of interior officials. no one questioned the program or sought better ways to manage the leasing and improve the operations. beginning with the disastrous santa barbara spill in 1969. which was followed by other major platform accidents in the gulf of mexico. national attention focused on the inadequacies of ocs leasing and development laws and several indepth studies of offshore safety. technology and management were initiated. it was evident that gaps in information regarding ocs impacts existed. such a review was demanded when in 1973 a proposed schedule for provisional leasing was prepared by the administration which indicated southern california lands would be nominated for leases in 1974. in september of 1974. i initiated hearings in california to fully explore the departments proposal and the implications it would have on the coastal zone adjacent to the federally leased waters. state and local officials were invited to testify on the needs they foresaw for the state to insure reliable protections. their statements were balanced by reports from the government outlining projected national needs. in summary. i feel the essence of the testimony was concentrated into eight areas which included: need and justification of ocs gas and development. response of state and local governments. and the public to the department of interior ocs lease schedule in southern california. energy conservation and the use of substitute energy sources as alternatives to ocs development. the impact of government credibility on ocs leasing. adequate information on the development of oil and gas resources of the ocs. federal. state and local roles in the development of ocs oil and gas. the coastal zone management act and its role in ocs development. and role of the national environmental policy act in the ocs planning process. i am very pleased to note that s. 521 addresses itself to most of these issues and i feel satisfactorily meets many of my states expressed concerns. there is no questioning the need to develop our domestic resources as our past experience with fuel shortages and price hikes has made clear our desperate need for selfsufficiency. studies indicate our dependence on foreign oil has tripled in percentage since 1970 and because of price increases. we are now paying 10 times as much for oil as we did 5 years ago. but. in considering this bill. we must -examine three primary areas which i feel need to be strengthened. first. i would like to discuss the economic aspects involved in accelerating the lease sale. lease sales are scheduled in california in october. 3 months before its coastal plan is completed. according to a study prepared by the national ocean policy study. the undervaluation of tracts by the department of interior. using recent tract valuations. would result in a loss of as much as $7.2 billion to the american public. the study went further to point out that because the department chose to release such a vast reserve of land in a short time. the bids would be considerably lower and the competition for obtaining leases would be lessened. in addition. the general accounting office has questioned the ability of the oil companies to rapidly develop the amount of leases being offered for sale. we all realize the need to expedite the development of this nations domestic energy resources. but we still have not been informed of any factual basis for the interiors judgment why october must be the magic month to initiate lease sales. other than it may exempt california from the provisions of this legislation. onehalf of the acreage proposed for immediate sale lies in waters greater than 1.000 feet and present technology may restrict the development of that oil for another 5 years. shallow water production may not begin for at least 2 years because of the lack of drilling rigs committed by the industry for production. i also feel we should know the full extent of the estimated reserves. reports show that ocs oil and gas represents between 10 and 40 percent of all domestic reserves. with an orderly. welldefined. goaloriented leasing program ocs resources could provide this country with a consistent source of energy. at least to the end of this century. the petroleum industry has based its \"proven reserve\" figures on oil and gas which has been identified in the ground which can be produced economically under present conditions. they have identified approximately a 10year supply. our planning. however. must be for a much longer period and must take into account all oil and gas potentially available in the united states. needless to say. offshore reserves are an even greater unknown resource than onshore reserves. i support limited federal exploration. as proposed in senator jacksons amendment. which would provide more definite answers to the extent of the resources and our expected net gains and loss from those areas to produce the oil. although i oppose government development of oil and gas i feel a limited exploration program is possible. in the administrations haste to sell ocs oil and gas. consideration must be given as to timing and leasing of the tracts. s. 521 contains an amendment i introduced last year which mandates that the timing of the sales and location of the leases and tracts not infringe upon the environmental sensitivities of the area to the upmost practical extent. s. 521 also addresses itself to other problems. what is the effect of offshore development on siting of onshore facilities. on the ecology. and on land use patterns? what happens when pipelines. which as of necessity. come ashore? dredging and laying pipelines can disturb marine and plant life. and building protection for the pipelines at the shoreline can harm fragile areas. moreover. multiple landings of pipelines can magnify the environment damage. and provides very clear evidence of the need for coordinated planning to create pipeline corridors. other facilities associated with offshore development also have major impacts: onshore storage tanks. refineries. port facilities for tankers. petrochemical plantswhat do they do? all these things come along with major oil and gas developmentalthough they admittedly might not occur everywhere ocs operations are taking place. the onshore effects of offshore development are very significant over the long run. and can produce great strains on local resources although. of course. this is not necessarily the case where the onshore effects are located in or near already welldeveloped centers. there is a critical need for longterm planning to meet these problems. this planning must include the state and local jurisdictions which will be affected. and this coordination must occur from the very earliest moment. right now. the degree of local consultation and planning is minimal. s. 521 addresses these problems. as a senator from the state which will be of the first to experience ocs impacts. i feel not enough emphasis can be placed on preventative measures in reference to oil spills and equipment safety regulations and inspections. i joined in support of an amendment which would increase oil spill liability from $7 million to $30 million. the threat of an oil spill on the coastline and even more certain danger from pollution from very small daytoday spills underscores the necessity of employing the strictest technological and environmental safeguards. reports indicate that in 1973 alone there were 13.327 reported spills totaling more than 24 million gallons. onethird of the oil spilled is from unidentified sources. it has also been estimated by the department of interior that as many as 16 major oil spills could occur in the next 40 years in southern california alone. all of which would have the repeated impact of the santa barbara spill. the oil spill liability provisions of s. 521 would mitigate against such spills. however. as we all realize. there can never be enough financial compensation for ths imnnnd environmental impact resulting from a spill and. therefore. i have turned my attention toward strengthening provisions concerning the development and production technology. language which i introduced last year was kept in s. 521 which demands that high standards be kept up by the industry in thearea of drilling technology.- the needs of the individual states i n terms of procedural protection must not be neglected either. i support the amendments which insure that adequate information is made available to federal and state governments regarding the extent of the reserves. in addition. in this bill. as amended by senator stevens. jackson and hollings. there are provisions which will give the coastal states financial aid in order to reduce the adverse impacts. also with this legislation it would be possible to ensure that the maximum amount of oil is in fact produced. reports indicate that there are at least 838.000 acres on federal land which are classified \"producing. shutin\". the leasing oil companies perform a bare minimum required to retain the lease. but are looking more at the future value of the oil. i am pleased that the senate passed my amendment which would revise the now proposed discretionary powers of the secretary to waive production only on the basis of good cause. my amendment removes this loophole and provides that specific production can only be delayed if there is a demonstrated surplus of produceable oil and not enough storage support systems. the bill makes reference to lease contracts which are outstanding at the time this bill is signed. as i understand this. contracts which have not been fulfilled or. in other words. developed and produced. are subject to the same longterm development plans and programs that new leases are subject to. this provision is critical if the lease sale in california proceeds according to schedule. the provisions of this bill should apply to existing leases. without that guarantee. existing leasees will be developed under the current archaic program regardless of the concerns of the adjacent coastal state. hopefully. this will insure a consistency between the leasing agreements made before and made after this becomes law. finally. and it goes without saying. that overall national energy policies with regard to resource development go hand in hand with projections and policies regarding energy consumption. longterm energy consumption is hard to predict. but the information about the availability and cost of producing alternate energy resources must be an ongoing mission. so that future energy consumption rates become clearer with the passage of time. i feel that drilling for oil and gas on the outer continental shelf should proceed without undue adverse impacts on the coastal states and in fact. should serve as an economic stimulus to those statcs. this can only happen. however. with a substantive projection of this nations future energy needs that is coupled with an orderly and timely leasing schedule. the state and federal government must fully cooperate with each other in order to satisfy the others demands and inorderfor usto meet -our -consumptive i would like now to commend my colleagues senator jackson and senator hollings for their work and efforts on this ocs legislation."},{"1":"1974","2":"HANSEN","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. president. much has been and will be said about the deficiencies of this legislation. it behooves me to point out two provisions of the bill which i feel should be included in the legislation considered by the next session of congress. the first is the amendment which my good friend lee metcalf graciously calls the hansenmetcalf amendment. but which should obviously be called the metcalfhansen amendment. the second is t-.tle vi of the pending legislation. this metcalfhansen amendment provides that the states can enact more stringent land use and environmental controls. and regulations of surface mining and reclamation operations that required by the federal minimum standard. ironically. if the members of the conference would have paid more heed to this amendment. i feel that we would have avoided the pitfall which we now face. we must recognize that with the vast climactic and topographic variations of our nation that it is impossible to enact provisions which will meet the needs of every state. after the federal minimum standards have been established. the states must have latitude to enact legislation which is specifically tailored to their own particular problems. such an amendment is important to the coal producing states of our nation. they are being called upon to produce energy for the consuming states. no federal law can sufficiently protect the environment of the west and still be satisfactory for appalachia and vice versa. congress should establish the minimum standards and let the states take it from there. title vi of the legislation authorizes the secretary of interior. if requested by the governor. to review federal lands within the states to assess whether an area may be designated as unsuitable for mining operations for minerals or materials other than coal. this title is significant for residential communities which overlie federal mineral estates or are adjacent to federal lands where mining operations would have an adverse impact on lands used primarily for residential or related purposes. two communities which are acutely challenged with this particular problem are story. wyo.. and tucson. ariz. the people of these communities deserve the protection which this title would afford them. mr. president. there is a need for balanced surface mining legislation. i earnestly hope that this congress and the president will agree on legislation which will preserve our environment. allow for recovery of the resource. and avoid the socioeconomic

colleagues from south dakota . whose aim it is to remove a current inadvertent inequity in federal disaster assistance law. my bill is in the form of an amendment to the disaster act of 1970. section 254. which relates to the eligibility of disaster victims to receive federal relocation assistance payments where federal projects displace these people permanently from their homes. section 254 was included in the disaster act of 1970 so as not to punish those homeowners and renters who. as a result of a major disaster. were displaced from their homes longer than 180 days and 90 days respectively. current law states that a homeowner must have resided in the home 180 days in order to qualify for relocation assistance. and that a renter must have resided in his home or apartment 90 days to qualify for such assistance. in the case of a major disaster. as many of my colleagues already know. and. unfortunately as many of you will know in the future. people are displaced from their places of residence. such displacement excludes these already suffering citizens from the protections of the law which allows equitable replacement payments where federal projects move people from their homes. by failing to meet the required 180- and 90day residence requirement. these people would be denied the equal protection of the laws through no fault of their own and completely unintentionally on the part of the congress. the congress recognized the need to include a section of the disaster act of 1970 which would waive the residency requirement for urban renewal projects in disaster areas. however. with the advent of the uniform relocation assistance act. this body must now act to waive such unequal requirements for all federal projects and not just urban renewal. for any federal programbe it army corps of engineers levee work. housing and urban development open space projects. bureau of outdoor recreation park construction. indeed the entire gamut of federal public worksshould have a provision whereby disaster victims displaced from their longterm places of residence would not have to meet residency requirements not meant to apply to them in the first place. mr. speaker. unless this change in law is quickly acted upon by the congress a situation will exist that neither the congress. nor the executive. nor the agencies. nor the citizens of this country desire to happen. namely. federal projects will be initiated in areas where citizens have been forced to flee from their homes due to raging floodwaters or other natural disasters and these people will be ineligible for the relocation assistance which the u.s. congress intended them to have. such a situation. though undesirable at any time. has been especially pointed up by the numerous projects which will begin soon in the area affected by hurricane agnes. as has been the case with so many changes in disaster assistance legislation. agnesthe greatest natural disaster in the history of this republic has been the catalyst. however. it should be pointed out at this time for all present to note well. that an identical situation can exist in any congressional district by this afternoon. or tomorrow evening. or a week from now. whenever disaster strikes. it would do this body well to act with haste to end this inequity and insure that the equal protection of the laws is provided to those who qualify for relocation assistance. section 254. public law 91606 and text of the bill follows:"},{"1":"1972","2":"MCGOVERN","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. president. as

seashore to include nantucket island. tuckernuck island. muskeget island. marthas vineyard island. no mans land. the elizabeth islands. the monomoy island. we are all of us familiar with the success of the landmark legislation. the cape cod national seashore signed into law by president kennedy on august 7. 1961. but time has passed and the very success of that legislation has pointed out the urgent lack of similar legislation for the islands. it seems most appropriate to conduct a study at this time to see if this very workable and successful solution should be extended to include the several islands lying off the cape. prior to the passage of the cape cod national seashore legislation. federal participation in conservation. preservation. or recreational development was limited to federally owned lands. by the 1950s. it was clear that if some of the most beautiful and historic areas were to be saved from rampant overdevelopment. from misuse or overuse. from lack of planning of uncoordinated planning. then the federal government must involve itself in preserving privately owned lands. the act establishing the cape cod national seashore provided for acquisition of 27.650 acres of land with an appropriation of $16 million. in order to protect landowner rights and at the same time assure preservation of the very best of our scenic resources. a very delicate formula was worked out to everyones benefit. the federal government did not step in to take over homes and villages. families were not shuffled around. no one was forced to sell their property for less than it was worth. cooperation between the federal government. the local municipalities. and the very active participation by citizen groups assured that zoning regulation. scenic easement. limited condemnation rights were implemented with a minimum infringement on residential rights and maximum consideration for their concerns. only last year additional funds were appropriated by the congress to facilitate the acquisition of additional available lands for incorporation into the seashore. an additional 7.500 acres enabled us to move forward with final planning for the cape cod national seashore. plans for improved transportation and recreational facilities and new programs for the off season. the success of the cape code national seashore legislation can be measured by the status of that immeasurably beautiful spot today. almost without exception everyone is pleased with the resultthose who live on cape cod and those who visit the cape during the summer monthsthose most interested in commercial development and those concerned with preservation of the land. we have struck a delicate balance which has worked uncommonly well. over 3 million people visit cape cod national seashore each summer and of these visitors most do not leave cape cod without visiting one or more of the outlying islands. it is to these islands that we direct our concern today. the islands off cape cod which hold the greatest potential for growth and development are of course those large islands which are the most beautiful and prized aesthetically. and many of these are beginning to show the face of disastrous lack of planning. commercial overdevelopment. and sometimes cynical lack of forsight. the legislation i am introducing today would provide for a study of nantucket island. tuckernuck island. muskeget island. marthas vineyard island. no mans land. the elizabeth islands. and monomoy island with the result that we have a plan for the islands future. while the 1970 department of interior study indicates that for the most part development on marthas vineyard and nantucket \"has been tasteful. retaining the islands essential character.\" only a week ago an article in the new york times by anne simon suggests that the .balance \"is suddenly errupting.\" mrs. isimon states that a comprehensive study which has been completed states that -marthas vinyard will have contracted environmental terminal cancer by 1975. the mail that i receive indicates that there has been some sudden and not wholly tasteful commercial development in recent months. marthas vineyard totaling 63.000 acres and nantucket island30.341 acresare.the largest islands in the group and carry the greater -potential for either overdevelopment or programed recreation. the elizabeth islands include seven large and at least 12 small pieces of land totaling 8.268 acres separating buzzards bay from vineyard sound. all but two of these islands are administered under several trusts which protect their natural environmentcars are barred except for service vehicles and riding and hiking are the pleasures as well as the means of transportation. these islands should provide some valuable insight into what can be accomplished with controlled development. in august 1970. the department of the interior indicated that the elizabeth islands. marthas vineyard island. and nantucket island should be put under study to determine if a national seashore trust or \"other protective status\" would be in the best interests of the citizens who live there. an island trust would be administered by a commission with federal. state. and local representatives. this gro!up would be responsible for planning and development in the interest of protecting the islands. my legislation today calls for a study to determine if the best method of protection lies in an extension of the cape cod national seashore. it is my hope that in the 6 months of study a definitive resolution can be madethat we will know if the island trust. or extenton of the seashore. a combination of both. or some other form of controlled development is the best way to accomplish what we all desire. all of the proposals have their vigorous proponents and each proposal has tremendous merit. i would hope that immediate action on this bill would elicit massive citizen comment. the citizens and representatives of this area are most anxious for a judgment from the department of the interior as to which method appears to hold the best hope for the islands future. and i hope that during the 6 months of study. citizen participation will be active and extensive in making known the feeling and desires of the island people. surely no one knows better what needs to be done or has better suggestions on how to do it than the concerned citizens themselves. we have learned in another area of the commonwealth of massachusetts what citizen participation in planning can accomplishthe mount holyoke unit of the connecticut historic riverway. those residents have spent a great deal in time and effort in meeting. discussing. planning. and making certain that their representatives knew their wishes. the result is a landmark piece of legislation which has had citizen participation at every level. at every step along the way. it is most clearly their legislation embodying their hopes. during these 6 months we will try to obtain all the data that has been gathered recently which illustrates either the extent of the problem or possible solutions. this information should be disseminated -to the residents and citizen groups who wish to participate in the study process. a senate interior committee report on cape cod in 1961 reported the following: but more important was the development of a new industry. a servicebased economy generated by the needs of entertaining summer visitors. this industry. which received its impetus from the scenery of the cape. its climate. white sandy beaches. the tranquil isolation from busy industrial centers. and the quaint atmosphere of villages long associated with seafaring and seaside life. grew rapidly. it is continuing to grow today. but in many instances at the expense of the capes natural assets. the open spaces sought by the fatigued city dweller for mental relaxation are being converted into new accommodations. while restaurants are replacing wharves. and barns are becoming gift shops. that same kind of process is underway today. but there is a difference this timewe do not have years to study the problem. we have monthsand we do not have years to reverse the trend. we have months. so let us not waste this precious time. we have long ago accepted the notion that recreation and scenic beauty are not reserved for the wilderness and the country. we appreciate that scenery can be both convenient and beautiful. we know that those who need the solace and peace and pleasure of our natural beauty most are the city dwellers. those crowded into the urban population centers. thirty million people live within a 1day drive of cape code and the islands. unfortunately. it is that which is closest to us that we sometimes fail to see in our endeavor to preserve and protect. but while time and pace have taken their toll on the islands. the residents have been alert to the horrendous possibilities for the future. how often do we think of our land and water. our seashores and islands as fragile thingsbut we are fast learning a disastrous lesson. these things are precious and fragile and within our power to make enduring. mr. president. i ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks the text of this bill be printed in the record."},{"1":"1970","2":"TIERNAN","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. chairman. i thank the gentleman for yielding. the report on h.r. 17255 by the house interstate and foreign commerce committee. of which i am a member. states from the outset thatthe strategies which we have pursued in the war against air pollution have been inadequate in several important respects and the methods employed in implementing those strategies often have been slow and less effective than they might have been. h.r. 17255 is an attempt to speed up. expand. and intensify the war against air pollution and for that reason. i support its general thrust. the problem is that the bill does not go far enough. it has been shown that the automobile is responsible for 60 percent of all air pollution in the united states. yet this bill fails to deal effectively with eliminating pollutants from this engine. members of a bipartisan group. including myself. congressmen leonard farbstein. daniel button. lionel van deerlin. and richard ottinger have prepared amendments designed to strengthen h.r. 17255 so as to make certain that automobile pollutants are eliminated as a major source of environmental decay by the mid- 1970s. my amendment deals with the regulation of fuel composition. the amendment substitutes a far superior version recommended by the administration. in place of the fuel composition section in the committee bill. the amendment would provide the national air pollution control administration with the power to regulate the composition of fuels. thus giving it the ability to ban lead as well as other additives in gasoline. in order to reduce pollution. it is my feeling that the napca needs this power if we truly hope to have clean air in the near future. in a comparison between h.r. 17255 and my amendment. i think it is clear that the latter is more effective in the fight for clean air. first. the administration bill covers all fuels. h.r. 17255 applies only to auto fuels. second. both provide for regulation of fuel composition to eliminate adverse effects on public health and welfare. the committee bill. however. requires that no regulation may be established if the health danger can be remedied through increased auto emission standards. the burden is thus put on the auto industry. and the oil industry is left pretty much free and clear. third. the committee bill requires specific \"finds derived from relevant medical and scientific evidence\" to prove that a fuel or fuel additive endangers public health or welfare. the administration bill requires no such rigorous proof. napca has indicated it could probably not scientifically justify banning lead in gasoline under this procedure. fourth. the administration bill provides authority for napca to secure from industry fuel additive pollution research it reasonably needs to assess pollution characteristics of fuels. the food and drug administration has such power. the committee bill provides only the power to secure research already done. napca would thus be required to do much of its own research at a substantial additional cost. tied to rigorous evidence requirement. it would be almost impossible for napca to operate under this procedure. clean air is vital to our health and happiness. h.r. 17255 can be an effective tool toward cleaning our air. especially if we accept the amendments which are being offered to strengthen the bill. the problems of environmental pollution. unless dealt with quickly and effectively. will plague mankind forever. the steps contained in h.r. 17255 are but the bare minimum. i urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation with the amendments."},{"1":"1969","2":"DADDARIO","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. speaker. on behalf of congressman charles a. mosher and myself. i rise to propose the environmental quality and productivity act of 1969. which i shall include at the end of my remarks as exhibit 1. this congress has had before it over 40 bills dealing with various aspects of the environment. certainly a major issue of our time. a review of all these pieces of legislation shows a remarkable degree of agreement on a national policy of restoring. maintaining. and enhancing the values found in our natural surroundings. at the same time. there is a bewildering variety of organizational proposals to put this policy into practice. our bill is an attempt to simplify matters in a way which will assure that the executive and legislative branches will be served with the information. advice. and coordinated constructive action which they demand. actually. the congress is to be complimented in what it has already contributed to the betterment of environmental management. the intense interest in this problem over the past few years has caused many committees to look into different aspects including. of course. the basic legislation to abate air and water pollution. the result is that innovative alternatives have been generated for organization. policy. and programs. the executive branch has chosen to implement many of these legislative suggestions and thus a number of members may now feel a welljustified satisfaction from leadership in the new emphasis on environmental quality and productivity. in the case of our science. research. and development subcommittee. i would mention specifically four examples apparent from the excerpts appended to this statement. first. in 1966 we recommended a system approach in environmental matters with coordination of all federal r. & d. and operational programs. the fcst committee on environmental quality was formed in 1967 to accomplish this assignment. see exhibit 2. second. in 1968. one of our reports called for a national policy to be expressed in legislation by both houses. a step we are undertaking today. see exhibit 3. third. our 1968 report called for an environmental cabinet to assure conformity of federal operations with the national policy for the environment. this suggestion has been implemented in the cabinetlevel environmental quality council established by president nixon. see exhibit 3a. fourth. we recommended a strengthening of ost and the recent presidential announcement has assigned that office a major role in science related to the environment. see exhibit 3. thus. a considerable history of legislative influence in addition to specific laws can be demonstrated. title i of the bill we are introducing today is a declaration of policy. its exact wording is not critical but nevertheless these words are the result of several years work by legislative and executive branch officials and their staffs. see exhibit 4. title i affirms the great interdependence of man and his environment and the ultimate requirement for harmony between his actions and ecological principles. it recognizes a human right to a healthful environment and a personal responsibility for preservation and enhancement of these values. the bill calls on all agencies to conform their activities to these policy statements. this directive should provide an administrative route for redress of grievances by citizens groups who now must go to court in order to bring the rights for environmental quality into balance with federal or private operations. the origin of national policy for the environment can be traced back over the past several years. there was an apparent and growing concern of citizens everywhere that the earlier guidelines of economic exploitation were yielding byproducts of deterioration. pollution. and esthetic offense. many organizations in government and the private sector began studies and programs to describe the causeandeffect relationships between societys actions and environmental quality. at the same time. increased productivity from the landscape was demanded by a growing world population and desire for higher living standards. these studies found that environmental quality and productivity go hand in hand. in fact. in the long run the most productive environment is one which is kept at a high state of quality. we are pleased to recognize phrases in title i which have stemmed from the hearings and reports of the subcommittee on science. research. and development of the house committee on science and astronautics. it is for this reason that we are prompted to advocate this bill as the best measure before the house. even though no hearings have been held on it per se. in effect. our committee and several others in both houses have been holding appropriate hearings for years. title ii of our bill would satisfy the clearly defined need for an independent advisory group by giving a statutory basis to the present citizens advisory committee on environmental quality established by executive order 11472. may 29. 1969. funds for adequate staffing would make this unit able to perform an informationgathering analysis and program review function which has been shown to be necessary by recent hearings in the house and the senate. since the present terms of the members of the caceq will expire in 1970. the president will have immediate opportunity to broaden and deepen the expertise in this group beyond the present makeup which stems from its former designation as the citizens advisory committee on recreation and natural beauty. by establishing the caceq by legislation. the authority and concern of the congress will be clear. adequate appropriations for its functions will be defensible. at the same time. no new agency would be added. we believe this is extremely important. president nixon has announced the formation. by the same executive order. of a cabinetlevel environmental quality council. it is agreed by all that this is necessary to assure that the action programs of the government are coordinated and conform to national policy. the president ultimately would resolve conflicts among the departments and agencies and so it is very encouraging to see him clearly accepting the responsibility as chairman of the new council. the other presidential moves are to redesignate the former advisory panel on recreation and natural beauty as the citizens advisory committee on environmental quality and to assign to the office of science and technology the staff work for both the cabinet council and the advisory committee. on these two counts. the criticism has mounted. we would not take issue with those who doubt the ability of the caceq and ost to do what is necessary under present conditions of status and funding. but it seems patently foolish for the congress to add another new. unwanted agency to the executive office of the president. rather. we see great value in using the structure that the president is in favor of and providing for it the statutory base and funding support to assure the performance that the entire nation desires. the citizens advisory committee. when established by congressional action. would satisfy all the demands for independent. expert. balanced. widely representative assistance. the membership of 15 would allow the inclusion of the diversity of talent which environmental matters require. an executive secretary and staff of great competence should be attracted by the central role which the caceq will play. the participation of private sector leaders. including industrywhich must bear the brunt of environmental enhancement while continuing efficient productivitywill give all citizens a direct access to governmental planning and priorities for the environment. we believe we must take the presidents announcement at face value and help him make it work. and strengthen the role of the congress at the same time. the number of different bills before us illustrates the difficulty of agreement on these administrative formats. surely we do not need an array of advisory groups. one selected by the president and one chartered by the congress. the possibilities for conflict should be obvious to anyone. it is for this reason that our bill specifically directs the caceq to overview the functions of the many environmental advisory groups now proliferating in the agencies. special task forces may be attached to the caceq to develop advice for any department or agency upon request. but a plurality of uncoordinated advisory groups is to be avoided. finally the caceq established by our bill will issue an annual report to the president. the congress. and the nation on the state of the environment. we will receive authoritative information on status and trends. we will have confidence in a balanced and independent review of federal programs. we will obtain the depth of study and analysis which longrange planning demands. we will strengthen rather than confuse the presidents arrangements. and we will bring the intent of the congress directly to bear on the activities of the executive branch. the exhibits referred to follow: exhibit 1 a bill to establish a national policy for the environment and to establish a citizens advisory committee on environmental quality be it enacted by the senate and house of representatives of the united states of america in congress assembled. that this act may be cited as the \"environmental quality -and productivity act of 1969\". the purposes of this act are: to declare a national policy which will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment. to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of man. to enrich the understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the nation. and to establish a citizens advisory committee on environmental quality. title i"},{"1":"1968","2":"AIKEN","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. president. the patron saint of january was a twofaced old fellow. and some people think that is why some politicians choose this month to unburden themselves of their own particular views of the state of the nation. this is a privilege i have foregone in the past. because usually i have felt that the unions state was not so bad as its detractors would have it. nor so good as those in office wanted to make it out tobe. but this year. the state of the union is so clearly bad that for the first time in my 27 years as a senator. i feel compelled to stand on my privilege. i shall try not to be janusfaced. but only to look backward briefly and forward a bit as the true janus was supposed to have done. according to the mythmakers. we are entering an intensely political year. and i believe the deteriorated state of politics is very much at the root of the malaise of our times. in politics. as in television. media has triumphed over matter. a mans image has become so much more important than the substance of his thoughts and ideas that we have elevated a cult of personality far above any real debate of the issues. and. in this respect. we are not so far apart from our ideological enemies as we would like to think we are or as we should be. the medium of politica has grown to cover a wide range of activities. these used to be innocent enough activities. like kissing babies and donning indian headdresses. now the politician has to be seen intervening on the battlefront. circling the globe with a series of carefully planned \"commercials\" for his policies and mounting a series of aggressive adversary proceedings against any and all critics of the current official dogma. the voter is told to be a viewer of politics. not a listener. and not to pay too much attention to what is said or how it is said. only to who is talking. even the rhetoric of politics has become militarized. we \"war\" on poverty and in vietnam alike. as though some millennial \"victory\" were imminent on both fronts. if we could only hit upon the right \"strategy.\" a flood of \"search and destroy\" legislation has been proposed to congress. committing units of the federal bureaucracy to a kind of pacification campaign in our own cities. pragmatism has given way to posturing and the rattling of warlike wordsnot swords. words. this is a very depressing prolog to an election year in which foreign policy is likely to be a serious partisan issue for the first time since world war ii. or perhaps i ought to say it should be a serious issue. since the militarization of our foreign policy in southeast asia raises questions which cry out for articulate debate but which have been lost in the triumph of media over matter in politics. we have in the past several months promoted such a vast misunderstanding here at home of the realities of world politics. and such vast apprehension abroad about the nature of our intentions. that it is hard to exaggerate the political cost. words constitute much of the substance of both politics and diplomacy. and we have so trifled with words to date that we have managed in our clumsiness to endanger the peace of the world and to embitter our society at home in a manner not seen in a century. there have been. of course. far too many words. the president knows that the issue posed by the war in vietnam is not between those who would cut and run and others with a presumed higher order of patriotism. yet he could not resist putting it that way before the aflcio in florida last month. he has talked in this manner to the detriment of his own cause. and so have his critics. to the detriment of theirs. now only more and better words can stem the tide of bad rhetoric that threatens to engulf us all in this election year. the real political issue posed by the war in vietnam is between those who want to demilitarize our policy in southeast asia in order to reduce the present unjustified costs. and those who cling to the elusive hope of some kind of military victory. i have maintained for many months that we made a huge military commitment in that part of the world simply because we did not have the wit. the imagination or the courage to devise a political strategy to suit a political problem. so we decided to use our military strength to camouflage our political ineptitude. i devoutly hope that this year will see an explicit recognition of this fact and a genuine effort made to solve a political issue by political means. nearly 2 years ago i urged the administration to consider the war won as far as any threat of defeat to our military forces was concerned. our favorable position could not have been seriously questioned at that time. i would like to think that the new statistics coming out of the white house and the pentagon. together with the undoubted human and material damage we have wrought with our huge military investment. presage acceptance of this idea. if so. i will be the first to give profound thanks. for there can be no return to a healthy state of politics in our foreign policy until it is recognized that the militarization of that policy in situations like vietnam can lead only to costly futility. it remains as true today as it was 2 years ago that only the united states. by its own deliberate actions. can revive the possibility of a political resolution of the conflict. it is all too evident that neither the south vietnamese regime nor the north vietnamese regime are ready now to regard a political resolution as being in their interests. if. in fact. the emphasis in vietnam shifts from the military to the political in the coming year. we should all be profoundly grateful. but the costs of bad politics will remain to be paid. shifting the confrontation from the military to the political will not mean that red china is any less of a threat to our real interests. she may be more a threat. since we have done much of late to undermine credibility in the efficiency with which we use military power. it will not mean that there will be real peace in southeast asia. that may not come for a decade or even a generation. it will not mean a restoration of confidence throughout the world in the skill and purposefulness of american diplomacy. though we can be sure that there will be a great slgh of relief from those friends abroad who have been agonizing with us through these futile. frustrating months. a shift of emphasis from the military to the political in vietnam will only provide an opportunity to start fashioning effective policies to deal with these problems. nobody can safely ignore the fact that we are and always will be a major pacific power. thus. what is important is that whoever occupies the white house after the next election. regardless of party. be a man capable of articulating persuasively a role for the united states. both in the pacific and in the atlantic. that is acceptable at home and abroad. if this aualification is to be met. the character of the words at least will have to be improved. we have for far too long now duped the american people with the invention of a monolithic enemy called communism in order to justify our often quite inadvertent foreign policy initiatives. i am convinced that the administration has been unable to devise a political strategy for demilitarizing our foreign policy in southeast asia largely because it has persuaded itself of the possibility of something called an \"important victory for world communism\" in vietnam. having designated the war as a war against \"world communism\" we must now produce a victory over an elusive and almost indefinable enemy. the administration has. in short. become the prisoner of its own bad rhetoric. therefore. our recourse now is to beat into submission a symbol of \"world communism\" in this case the little country of north vietnam. thereby putting the fear of american military might in the hearts of 800 million red chinese and 250 million russians. and possibly fidel castro. as well. it requires an act of invention to make out of the north vietnamese and the vietcong a monstrous monolithic enemy capable of winning a worldwide victory for something even more monolithic called \"world communism.\" it is true that the north vietnamese and the vletcong are more monolithic today than they were 2 years ago when i first urged demilitarization of our policy in vietnam. persistent aerial bombing. where it permits continued life at all. inevitably brings people together in a common determination to survive the attacker. in addition. the progressive assumption of responsibility by americans for the affairs of government in south vietnam. particularly for the tragic \"pacification\" campaign. can only weaken the appeal of the south vietnamese authorities among those to whom nationalism is what the fight is all about. for we are fighting nationalists first in vietnam. that some call themselves communists is important. but not vital. it has been amply demonstrated by students of communism here and abroad that even in the communist world nationalism is the prevailing political force today. to make out that the north vietnamese and the vietcong even today are integral parts of a unified and monolithic world communism is simply a selfdestructive fantasy. yet for every casual mention of their intention to keep our intervention in vietnam limited. administration spokesmen have made many more references to just this fantasy. ignoring the fact that communist north vietnam is the traditional enemy of communist china. this is not because powerful groups within the administration are hellbent on a wider war and i am certain that the president does not want a wider war. i think we have taken official recourse to this fantasy because the administration has had to create a monolithic enemy to justify its refusal to admit past mistakes. this is not the first time ordinary. fallible human beings in high public office in washington have resorted to such arguments. but it is certainly the most costly instance since world war ii. probably the only possibility of resurrecting a monolithic communist enemya unified world communist movementwould be to launch world war iii. and even that might not do it. by clinging to its inventions the administration is simply duping americans at home and undermining credibility abroad in the sincerity of our purposes and the efficiency of our diplomacy. let me assure the president and those who see the war from his perspective. that in advocating a demilitarization of our policy in southeast asia i am not advocating a \"cut and run\" policy. nor can i have any respect for those americans who wake up each morning hoping to learn that the united states has suffered a great military defeat. i had hoped after the elections in south vietnam last fall that the president would see fit to announce clearly his intention to encourage direct negotiations between the warring factions of that country. after all. we imposed those elections. i assumed we did so for a purpose and therefore disassociated myself from those who. it seemed to me. were most unwise in discrediting them. the president has. belatedly. urged negotiations between the warring factions. a proposal which has not been gracefully accepted by the government of south vietnam. which owes its tenure to american military support. there is. in fact. very little the president has not urged in the running and confusing commentary on the war which has come out of the white house and the state department. but is negotiation among the vietnamese factions his present real objective? i do not know. but i feel i should have an answer to the question. i feel all americans should have an answer. perhaps an answer will be forthcoming this election year. i cannot believe that in the final act we will so elevate the cult of personalities above the debate of issues as to make a mockery out of this. the most precious of our democratic processes. i still have faith that candidates will come forward from both parties to \"talk sense to the american people\" as the late adlal stevenson tried in vain to do. when politics becomes dangerous nonsense. when the \"medium is the message\" as some would have it. we will have entered a new dark age. the state of

no charge against leave shall be made for any absence due to injury or illness sustained abroad by an officer or employee as a result of hostile activity or clearly caused by the fact that he was located abroad. the provision will permit an absence without charge to leave in those extraordinary situations in which officers and employees sustain serious illnesses or crippling injuries from physical violence and unavoidable involvement in wars. guerrilla and militant insurgent situations. or localized hostile mob actions. similarly. it will protect the employees earning power in those situations where prolonged disability results from illness which can be attributed solely to the fact that he was serving abroad and which would not have occurred had he remained in the united states.

nations waterways. a recent editorial in life magazine which strongly endorsed the senates unanimous approval of $6 billion federallshare for construction of water pollution control facilities. epitomized thi trend in national concern. in nearly every magazine. newspaper. and other publication. there seems to be an article or editorial on the quality of the nations environment and the need to expand the commitment of funds to control environmental contamination. however. conflicts exist as to the cost of meeting this expanded commitment. the recently released survey of pollution august \"16. 1966 control facilities needs by the conference of state sanitary engineers suggests that only $1 billion per year is necessary to meet the demand for treatment works. mr. president. i do not want to see control of water pollution lost in a numbers game. the fact is that really valid information on total costs has not yet been made available and probably will not be until january of 1968 when the report requested by the senate bill is made available. in the interim. the senate public works committee has attempted to meet those needs evidenced by information received in hearings throughout the nation and in washington. that information indicates that the estimated $20 billion cost is conservative. and the $6 billion federal share is a minimum. during our hearings i asked the secretary of health. education. and welfare. john w. gardner. and secretary of the interior stewart l. udall what advice they would give the subcommittee as to how much the federal investment in water pollution ought to be if they did not need to recognize budgetary restrictions. i think secretary udalls response is particularly appropriate. he said: i know that those closest to the water pollution problem in the country. the members of this subcommittee in particular. have recognized for several years and have been saying publicly that the problem is of such magnitude that the federal government would have to make a very big contribution. billions of dollars. in order to lick the problem. i think the administration in its new program in essence agrees with this. in order to create a better perspective of the demands for pollution control construction funds. i would like to cite a few statistics developed during hearings this year and relate them to the survey of the conference of state sanitary engineers. the conference reports that the state of new york has a total backlog of municipal waste treatment needs including ancillary facilities of $820.321.000. this figure does not in any way reflect information received by the subcommittee on air and water pollution during its hearings on s. 2947. on april 28 dr. hollis ingraham. representing governor rockefeller. testified that the people of the state of new york had approved. by a 4to1 margin. a $1 billion bond issue to finance pollution control. dr. ingraham had earlier stated: the barrier is the staggering expense of .overcoming the huge backlog of needed sewage treatment works-$1.7 billion in new york alone. mr. president. dr. ingraham is commissioner of health for the state of new york. he has excellent credentials and should know the cost of pollution control for his state. it is therefore apparent to me that the estimates of the conference of state sanitary engineers. with a figure of less than 50 percent of new yorks estimated cost and. less than the bonding authorization voted by the people of the state of new york. must be questioned. if this were the only conflict within the estimates of the conference i would be inclined to dismiss the point. however. mr. president. the report is rampant with inconsistency. a further example is that of the state of massachusetts. that state is presently considering legislation which would provide for a $100 million bond authorization to finance the states 30percent share of the cost of pollution control. the conference of state sanitary engineers estimates the total backlog for massachusetts to be but $41.557.000. this is less than 15 percent of the estimated $300 million total that massachusetts is expecting pollution control to cost. in fact. mr. president. the conference total is less than the single job of cleaning up the merrimac river which is estimated at between $68 and $80 million. senator edward kennedy informed the subcommittee this year that. beyond the cost of the merrimac. it is estimated that cleaning up the connecticut river in massachusetts will cost $20 million and the blackstone river will cost $35 million. to summarize a few other conflicts. mr. president. i would cite these examples: first. conference estimate of backlog for ohio is $38.626.000 and yet mayor ralph locher. of cleveland. estimates his citys cost to be approximately $900 million. or 25 times as great. this does not consider the other major or minor cities of ohio. second. conference estimate of the backlog for maryland is $11.860.000 and yet senator daniel brewster. of maryland. estimated the cost to the city of baltimore alone as being $48 million. third. it is reported that the state of connecticut will consider legislation next year authorizing $150 million as the states 30 percent of pollution control. the conference estimates connecticuts total backlog to be $39.931.000. this is less than 10 percent of the $500 million estimated by the state. mr. president. the cost of pollution control is great. i am afraid no one is prepared to really recognize the full magnitude of the problem. but. if we are to have clean water we. in the congress. cannot stick our heads in the sand. throughout the nation. communities are under order. via the enforcement process of the federal water pollution control act. to clean up. they cannot be expected to comply without sufficient help from the federal government. the senate recognized this on july 13. 1966. by a vote of 90 to 0. i hope that this unanimity will prevail and we can get on with the job before the costs increase beyond reach or the rape of our water supply is so complete that damage is irreparable. mr. president. i ask unanimous consent that the excellent editorial from life magazine be included at this point in the record."},{"1":"1965","2":"HENDERSON","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. chairman. i rise in support of s. 2300 and particularly in support of the projects on the neuse river basin: the falls dam and reservoir and the project for hurricaneflood protection at new bern and vicinity. last fall following unusually heavy rainfall in the upper neuse basin. i flew by helicopter over the neuse in wayne and lenoir counties in the vicinity of goldsboro and seven springs. n.c.. and the flood damage was almost indescribable. it was obvious that it came from the upper reaches of the river. and the wilmington district office of the u.s. army corps of engineers reported that had the falls dam been constructed at that time. the great majority of the damage would have been prevented. costbenefit ratios as shown in reports of the corps of engineers are cold statistics and are hard to visualize in terms of evacuated homes with water standing in them several feet deep. of isolated families clustered outside their houses completely surrounded by water looking up and waving at a helicopter. or hundreds of acres of unharvested corn under water. flooded pastures with cattle in tight little knots on a high spot. or a gigantic industrial complex like the carolina power & light co. steam generation plant at quaker neck with the waters submerging its coal piles and lapping ominously around the footings of the generator itself. the costbenefit ratio for the falls dam project is a favorable one. but i am confident that. there is not a member of this body who. if he had seen what i saw along the neuse basin in the goldsboroseven springs vicinity last fall. would not only agree that the project is justified. but would be an enthusiastic supporter of it. the project for hurricaneflood protection at new bern and vicinity is a different type of proposal and provides for the construction of a dam with a break in the center. it would retard and spread out the flow of tidal waters forced upriver by heavy hurricane tides and winds. it is a relatively new concept and i am advised that before a request is made for funding of construction of the project. the corps of engineers will first request funds for a model study to prove completely the feasibility of the construction. certainly the authorization of the project to the end that the model study can be funded is justified. as these remarks are being made. interests along the gulf coast are still trying to evaluate the damage caused by hurricane betsy and hurricane carol is meandering about in the caribbean trying to make up her mind where to go. in recent years. it has not been a question of whether new betl and vicinity would

chairman of the board of the passaic herald news this week when. a few weeks before his 91st birthday. he died in lake wales. fla. immediately. thousands of his good friends from new jersey. throughout the nation. and abroad responded with heartfelt messages of bereavement. they paid tribute to dow drukker for many reasons. only a few years after he came to new jersey in 1897 from grand rapids. mich.. mr. drukker built a reputation as a businessman. a banker. and a newspaper owner. his fellow citizens found him so much to their liking that they elected him as their congressman in 1914. he served in the 63d. 64th. and 65th congresses. when he left congress in 1919. he announced that he would not run for elective office. neither would he accept appointive office. as one writer has said: he felt that as a newspaper owner he wished to be free of partisan compulsions. in the years that have followed. mr. drukker made the passaic herald news a newspaper of direct service to his community and to the state. even as he contributed to the financial vitality of his community. mr. drukker also set high standards of journalistic service. many honors were given to him over the years. one of the most treasured was the award of the officers cross of the orangenassau from the government of the netherlands in june 1955. mr. drukker. who was born in the netherlands. had conducted an operation holland campaign in 1954 to help the victims of the floods of that year. mr. and mrs. drukker were later received by queen juliana at a private audience. other heartfelt tributes were given at recent birthday celebrations. there seemed something permanent and continually young about mr. drukker. his energy and optimism never left him. even in his final years. many additional tributes have been paid in recent days to him. i ask unanimous consent to have two of them printed in the record at this time. one is an editorial which appeared in the passaic herald news. and it expresses the high regard felt for him by those who worked on this newspaper. the other is a news article which reports the comments made by governor hughes and the legislature of our state.

comprehensive measure for projects of value to our people in all sections of the country. now. mr. president. in connection with this national program there are four projects in the measure which are of special significance to west virginia. three of them calling for authorization of flood control works within the border of the state and the fourth being a combination flood control and water storage facility important to west virginia. maryland. virginia. and the district of columbia. in the latter instance i refer to the item for the north fork of the potomac rivera dam and reservoir near bloomington. md.. and piedmont. w. va.. with an estimated total cost of $50.965.000. this is a very worthy project which will contribute much to the solution of potomac river basin problem of flood control. water supply. and water purification. likewise. it will provide employment in the anticipated construction stage in sections of the states of maryland and west virginia where new employment opportunities and new payrolls are needed. the three projects proposed for authorization within the actual borders of west virginia are in the vast ohio river basin and are as follows: justice dam and reservoir in the guyandot river basin at an estimated cost of $60.477.000. with the impoundment area to be in wyoming county and with flood protection intended to be afforded for that county. as well as logan. lincoln. and cabell counties. especially damaging floods have been occurring almost annually in recent years in the city of logan and other communities of logan county and downstream into lincoln and cabel counties. there have been some disputes concerning values and benefits involved in this project proposal. but no controversy over the need for flood control and protective measures. an extensive hearing was held and an adequate legislative history was compiled which indicates appropriateness of possible further hearings before any land is acquired and before construction begins. i hope satisfactory solutions will be found as this project moves through the planning and engineering phases to the end that parties in dispute with findings and recommendations of the army corps of engineers will be disposed to be cooperative because. mr. president. the flood protection. recreational benefits. and employment opportunities inherent in this project are most significant and necessary for the guyandot river basin. in the development of the legislative history and the furthering of this project. i am privileged to commend the cooperation by my diligent colleague from west virginia . and three very capable colleagues in the other body. representatives kee. hechler. and slack. senator byrd has been particularly active on behalf of this project since he came to the congress as a member representing the sixth congressional district which included logan county where the flood impacts have been most severe. the flood of record occurred in 1957 at logan and spurred my colleague to sponsor the resolution under which the guyandot river basin studies were undertaken as the forerunner to the favorable action i urge today in authorizing this project. beech fork reservoir on twelvepole creek in wayne county is proposed for authorization as another of the necessary flood control works in the ohio river basin. it is estimated to cost $11 million and would be an important complement to east lynn reservoir in the twelvepole creek watershed where flooding likewise has been severe. during the hearing on this project. i was privileged to associate myself with the cogent and timely statement made by representative hechler as the principal proponent of this worthy flood control proposal which also embraces important recreational benefits. buckhannon river channelization and realinement in the vicinity of the city of buckhannon at an estimated cost of $1.206.000 is necessary in the interest of providing flood control and protection to residential and commercial properties. as well as public roads and facilities. and parts of the campus of west virginia wesleyan college. there is a modest amount of local cost sharing involved in this worthy project and i strongly urge authorization of expenditures for the federal share. representative cleveland m. bailey. whose district has embraced upshur county. and representative harley 0. staggers. whose district now includes that county. have actively and helpfully supported and furthered the progres of this project and i gratefully commend their cooperation. the projects for provision of flood control in the guyandot river basin. in the twelvepole watershed. and in the buckhannon river are estimated to cost a total of $72.683.000 and. when authorized. funded and amortized. would represent federal investments with favorable benefilcost ratios. the $50.965.000 north fork of the potomac reservoir and water supply facility would be an especially important investment and is a project which has had a remarkable minimum of opposition."},{"1":"1961","2":"BUCKLIAN","3":"E","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"president. national rivers and harbors congress. washington. d.c.: i appreciate very much this opportunity to offer a message to the 48th annual convention of the national rivers and harbors congress. this administration shares your view that accelerated investment in water resources is essential. in assuring water supplies. in providing energy and lowcost transportation. in production of needed food and fiber. in making saline water sweet. in controlling floods. in maintaining recreation and fish and wildlife valuesin wisely managing our water resources. we are meeting the needs of the nation today and creating the conditions for economic growth to meet the needs of tomorrow. the end of the \"no new starts\" policy has invigorated the dedication of federal water development agencies to meeting the nations needs in water and water management. use. and control. the very useful report of the senate select committee on water resources provided a basis for reevaluation of national policies in the light of threatened future shortages. the recent national conference on water pollution. inspired by congressional efforts to strengthen the federal role in the struggle against pollution. made it clear that the people want and are determined to have clean water. the maintenance of our national strength and our obligation to future generations. will require staying power as well as strength. we must husband and wisely use our resources. following an investment policy that is neither skinflint nor extravagant. but properly balances our interests in water resource development with our interests in other aspects of national development. and it is to this longterm national interest that i ask you to dedicate your deliberations. i know you will grasp the opportunity with vigor. and that a sense of responsibility to all the people and the future will guide your judgments. with the enlightened support of public and private agencies and individuals. we can build imaginatively and soundly to provide the maximum

citizens for some time. a suit was entered by people from illinois in order to stop the formation of levee unit no. 5. on september 23. 1959. the gibson county circuit court entered a judgment approving and confirming the assessments and declaring levee unit no. 5 established. it appears that this is a final judgment unappealed from and from which under every possible consideration the time for appeal. if any. has long expired. as stated by my good friends from indiana. this project was authorized in 1936. the committee gave it due consideration. i wish to read at this time an excerpt from the committee report: opposition has been expressed by local interests in mount carmel on the basis of the adverse effect the project would have on flood heights in the mount carmel area. the committee is informed that during the course of a previous investigation of the feasibility of levee protection along the wabash. local interests were informed of the effect that the construction of levee unit no. 5 would have on the height of major floods. local interests considered flood protection for mount carmel unnecessary at that time. but stated that they would reconsider the matter if the levees were constructed on the indiana side. the budget estimate includes $10.000 for the continuation of the survey of the wabash river. mount carmel. an additional $15.000 will be required after fiscal year 1961 for the completion of that study. the corps of engineers have stated that they have the capability of completing that study in fiscal year 1960 if an additional $15.000 were provided for fiscal year 1960. the committee does not feel that the needed flood protection for levee unit no. 5. which was authorized in 1936. should be postponed indefinitely. the committee has. therefore. recommended $25.000 planning funds for levee unit no. 5 for fiscal year 1961. and in addition recommends that $15.000 of the increase provided for surveys be applied to the study of the wabash river

planning."},{"1":"1959","2":"CAPEHART","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"undoubtedly that is true. mr. president. let us consider the facts regarding the existing situation. let us forget who was responsible for the program in the first place. i do not know that. and i do not care. but i do know that. as one of the 98 members of the senate. i have a responsibility to the taxpayers of the nation. including the farmers of the nation. to try to reach a proper solution of this problem. which at present is the subject of a very expensive program. it is a fact that this year the department of agriculture will spend $6.500 millionapproximately $5 billion of it to support farmcommodity pricesin order to support a net income of all farmers in the nation which last year amounted to $13 billion. and the department of agriculture tells us that this year their net income will be $1 billion less. yet the stockpile or the surplus has increased to between $9 billion and $10 billion worth. in other words. under the existing program the cost to the taxpayers is rising every year. the surplus is increasing every year. and the expenses of the department of agriculture are increasing. but agricultural commodity prices are remaining where they were. or are going down. and. at least. mr. president. the farmers net income this year will be $1 billion less than it was last year. furthermore. since 1953. and through 1958and for the first time in the history of the nationthe increase in the farmers income has been less than the increase in the income of the rest of the american people. the farmers received $2 billion less income. furthermore. since 1933 the government has spent. in supporting the prices of agricultural commodities. $30 billion. yet $15 billion of that has been spent in the past 6 years. mr. president. those are facts. yet today the senate is considering a bill which calls for the same. old program. it calls for no change except one which would make the program even worse. i heard senators talk about their desire to help the small farmers. and they thought the small farmers would be helped by imposing a limitation of $35.000 on the amount which could be loaned to any one farmer. mr. president. how would that give any farmer an additional bushel of wheat or corn or an additional pound of cotton or peanuts? it would not help the farmers any. although it might reduce the cost to the taxpayers. but i predict that unless there is a drought this year. the prices of agricultural commodities will go down. as we know. the agricultural commodities which are supported by means of this program constitute only a very small percentage of the total of agricultural commodities. in terms of the total income of the farmers. three commoditiescorn. wheat. and cottonare responsible for 85 percent of the total of $10 billion. on the other hand. the prices of livestock and poultrywhich are responsible for approximately 75 percent. more or less. of the income of the farmersare not supported. the prices of livestock and poultry are fairly satisfactory. at least. hog prices and cattle prices are. mr. president. why do senators hesitate to change something which they know is wrong? why is this chamber almost empty at this time? why do not senators have the courage to face the issue? is it a political issue? mr. president. all senators are doing now is sweeping their troubles under the bedin the way a housewife may sometimes sweep a little dirt under the bed. and think she has cleaned the room. this problem will be back to haunt senators next year. in my opinion. in a bigger way than it is haunting them this yearor. if not next year. then certainly in 1961 or 1962. the only thing that. could possibly save us. in this situation. would be a severe drought or a great many floods which would prevent very much production for several years. certainly that would be an exteremely cruel way to correct the situation. it might be corrected on that basis. but certainly it will not be corrected otherwise. under the present program. mr. president. what is the answer? why do not the senate and the house of representatives

certainly never have. and i sincerely hope this attempt to do so will be the last of that kind of business. the legislative history of the present section 26 of the tva act as amended and of the 1948 limitation on the expenditure of tva power revenues makes it clear that tva has the authority to use its power revenues for the construction of replacement power facilities but does not have the authority to use power revenues for the construction of new power producing facilities without the specific legislative approval of the congress. one of tvas own proponents in congress expressed this interpretation in these words: the tva cannot start one single new power facility. it cannot put $1 of its income or any other funds into any new power facilty. except by and with the advice and direction 100. pt. 8. p. 10490.) we often hear tva and its proponents state or infer that if it had not been for tva the atom bomb might not have been developed or the aluminum for the plane that dropped the first bomb might not have been produced. actually. the oak ridge plant of aec could have been placed at many locations in the country where power was available. also aec constructed their own steam plant of 260.000kilowatt capacity. tva furnished a peak supply to aec of 98.200 kilowatts in fiscal year 1944 and 273.800 kilowatts in 1945. the maximum was less than onehalf of 1 percent of the total generating capacity of the utility industry. and just a little over onefourth of the tva capacity now being used for house heating in the tva area. with regard to aluminum production. in 1939 the tva area had 50 percent of the nations aluminum productive capacity. served in major part by the aluminum companys own powerplants. by 1943 the tva area was down to 19 percent of the nations productive capacity for aluminum. with tva power supplying only part of 19 percent of aluminum capacity one wonders how tva can claim preeminence in aluminum production. last year we heard testimony about what a wonderful record tva had with its steam plants. it seems strange that the federal power commission records would not list any tva steam electric generating plant among the first 18 most efficient steam electric plants in the country. of course. this is in keeping with the usual tva propaganda. at the hearing on the tva request for $3.500.000 to start construction of a new unit at the john sevier steam plant i disclosed that tva back in 1937 was trying to persuade the united states circuit court of appeals that it had a constitutional right to go into the power business by contending that such power operations only were incidental to navigation and flood control. the tva statement to the court said that \"the defendant tennessee valley authority has disposed of and will dispose of only such electric energy as is generated from waterpower inevitably created by the operation of the said dams for navigation and flood control. and which is not needed for governmental purposes and which would otherwise be wasted\". and made other statements as to tva authority and intent. of course we all know that tva has not honored all their solemn statements made to the high united states court. the record since then leaves little alternative than to believe there was a deliberate attempt to deceive the court as to tvas intentions. the record shows that 2 years earlier the tva legal staff in preparing for the lawsuits then besetting tva had a conference with the engineers on the question of what should and should not be said in engineering reports with reference to the power situation and the economic aspects of any watercontrol program which the tennessee valley authority develops. tva officials had gone over a copy of the preliminary report on the proposed development of the hiwassee river. indicating in pencil numerous deletions. changes. and qualifications which should be made in this report to avoid any implications of questionable or unconstitutional activities. with the thought in mind that a copy of one of these reports might be subpenaed. or by other means get into the hands of the opponents of the tennessee valley authority. and that this report. even as written. with considerable care to avoid such questions. raises many doubts as to the planning of our approach in the whole matter of planning. among the suggestions reported to have been made by the tva legal division were the following: tone down system power studies and avoid intimating that tennessee valley authority has any power program * * * put all recommendations on a hypothetical basis and draw no conclusion as to whether they should be developed by the tennessee valley authority or by other agencies. make no specific recommendation for the development of a stream or a project. but rather carry the idea all the way through the report that it is just a possible scheme. without recommendation that it is the one to be considered. avoid any allocation of costs specifically to navigation. flood control. and power. no attempt should be made to allocate these costs in order to calculate the cost of generating power. but in event something must be said on this- subject. to make the assumption that the dams. locks. reservoirs. and all appurtenances should arbitrarily be charged against navigation and flood control. and only the cost of power structures and generating equipment should be charged against power. you may ask what this has to do with the present question on the tva request for funds to continue the expansion of its power empire. it is to give congress and the people just a small part of the long record of misrepresentation and subterfuge on the part of tva in its expansion from the small navigation and floodcontrol development with incidental power that congress was told would not cost more than $150 million. into the present $2 billion electric power empire. are we to set idly by while members of the same tva legal staff. who told the tva engineers not to admit that tva had a power program. advise the tva directors to figuratively thumb their noses at the congress by spending the power revenues to construct new generating units without the approval of congress. after congress had specifically refused to approve such use. it is too bad that congress and the people of the nation cannot have the whole record of tva from its inception to the present. reading the tva annual reports and the almost limitless tva publicity releases one would think tva a haven of virtue and accomplishment. however the record gives quite a different story: flood control by permanently flooding out hundreds of thousands of acres of the most production lands of the tennessee river valley. pioneering of rural electrification by lagging behind the national average for more than 16 years. 3 out of 4 farms without running water. and farm use of electric energy below the national average even with the subsidized low power rate. distributors of tva power operating in the red and with per customer average power use below the national average even under the subsidized low power rates. economic development that has not kept pace with economic and industrial development of other section of the south. unparalleled unified operation of a whole river basin which left several tva reservoirs almost dry and which could not have happened under proper operation for navigation and flood control. the press has carried numerous stories and pictures of dry lakes. a coal purchase policy that resulted in coal reserves for over 3 million kilowatts of tva steam generating plant capacity being down to 12 to 16 days supply. this has been characterized as criminal negligence. normal utility practice is to carry 90 to 120 -days supply of coal on hand. these and other records of tva operations and results do not justify nor substantiate the many tva claims of accomplishment. it seems that the time long has passed to require the tva to meet some of the many claims it has made in the past. tva said its power rates were to be a yardstick. and would provide for interest at 31/2 percent on the power investment. local. state. and federal taxes equivalent to the rate paid by taxpaying utilities. depreciation. all operating expenses. and would amortize all the tva investment. is there any valid reason why the tva area should not pay their fair share of federal taxes. why they should not pay the interest cost to the taxpayers on the funds advanced to tva. why they should not provide for all. tot just a part of the legitimate costs of doing business just like other utilities? is there any valid reason why the area in which this federal electric power empire can operate should not be prescribed? i think not and i am sure a majority of our people also think not. tva has relegated congress to a back seat when it comes to control over the spending of taxpayers money for power expansion. on july 1. 1955. the senate appropriations committee. by a decisive vote of 13 to 10. told tva that it could not use its power proceeds for expansion purposes without congressional approval before the fact. in spite of this clear directive. tva has gone ahead and obligated federal funds by issuing letters of intent covering the acquisition of major equipment for a fourth generating unit at its john sevier plant. in clear defiance of congress. it has stated openly that it believes it has the authority to expend its power revenues for this purpose without prior approval by congress. the history of the john sevier steam plant is a case in point. on september 13. 1955. without coming to congress for approval. tva issued letters of intent covering the acquisition of major equipment for this plant. some 5 months later. on february 8. 1956. congress was notified of tvas independent action when the budget bureau submitted its request for supplemental appropriations for fiscal 1956. included among these requests was one from tva for an initial appropriation of $3.5 million to start construction work on a $28 million addition to the john sevier plant. . tva has thus put congress in a box. if congress now denies tvas request. the government. under the letters of intent tva has issued. is liable for a major share of whatever costs have accrued in the 6month period since these letters were issued. on the other hand. if congress goes along with tvas use of power revenues in this instance. it gives its tacit approval to the \"actfirstgetpermissionlater\" theory under which tva has operated. in short. tva has already made up congress mind that money shall be spent at john sevier. this current action by tva reveals a shocking disregard for congressional authority. it indicates that congress must tighten its control over tva. clearly. the time has come to make certain that tvas future actions are dependent upon the will of the congress. rather than making congressional action dependent upon a condition of tva liking and then submit it to the congress. requesting the congress to approve questionable actions on the part of the tva."},{"1":"1955","2":"VELDE","3":"E","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. speaker. i was very happy while reading my july 1955 issue of sports afield magazine that tribute was paid to our distinguished

activities of the department of commerce. the corps of engineers. the department of agriculture. the department of the interior. the bureau of reclamation. and so on. these efforts go on interminably. i do not know how successful they are. but. so far as i know. they are approved as steps in the right direction. yet. while these cumbersome efforts continue in other regions. the committee proposes to eliminate the most effective coordinating agent that has ever been developed anywhere in this nation. in the tennesese valley. as in no other area of the united states. federal. state. and local agencies. and public and private organizations. are working together to promote a better system of resource use. tva is the link that binds them all together. everyone knows the record of federal activities in the resource development field prior to tva. in the tennessee valley as elsewhere. one agency would be given the task of controlling the water in the river: another faced the problems of water on the land. one bureau was concerned with the fish in the waters. another with the commerce using the river as a highway. the fragmentation of federal responsibilities in the resource development field has been the despair of citizen and legislator alike. in the tva act we tried to do something about the problems for one river valley. here i speak out of personal experience. for i was a member of the committee which considered the legislation in the house. and a member of the conference which adjusted the differences between the senate and the house. it was no accident that we created one agency to develop the river as a whole. to make all of its benefits available to the people. it was not caprice that led us to avoid the creation of interagency committees or advisory bodies to reconcile conflicting plans and points of view. it was a deliberate effort to make the agency see its job as a whole. and to fix responsibility on its management for the development of methods to achieve results. when the tva act was written. we did not stop with the idea of a unified development of the river. although that in itself was an innovation. the tennessee is still the only waterway developed by one agency of government. where dams are designed. built. and operated under a single management. where the same management is responsible for flood control. navigation. and power production. for the use of the reservoirs for recreation. and for the conservation of fish and wildlife. tva was to be a regional resource development agency empowered to see the resources of this valley as a whole. to concern itself with the forests. the soil. and the minerals. as well as with the river. however. there was a difference. in the approach to the development of resources away from the river. responsibility for the primary control of the river could not be divided. tva had to undertake that job itself. but in all the other aspects of the total program. the statute encouraged. and the tva board adopted. a program of working through existing state and local agencies to achieve the objective of a better utilization of the resources with which nature had endowed the area."},{"1":"1952","2":"DEWART","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. chairman. i rise in opposition to this amendment. i think the cut should not be made. in my view. the committee has cut the funds for this branch of the government to an extent that perhaps will be harmful. i believe we should not go further than the committee has gone in making these cuts. i live in an area which is surrounded by national forests. which are used for grazing. timber resources. for watershed management. timber supply. recreation. mining. and all the uses that go on in a wellmanaged national forest. they adjoin the great yellowstone park. they adjoin and surround our ranches and farms in that area. it is necessary in order to preserve that great heritage of which the federal government has the trusteeship. that some funds be expended on the management of those areas. for range management. roads and trails. for insect controlwe passed a special appropriation last year of $3.500.000 for thatand for flood control. i had occasion one time to visit the area above salt lake city. where disastrous floods had occurred that had washed down through that city and done great damage. the forest service has been able to stop that kind of damage within the limits of funds. the timber resources are large and growing. they contribute to our welfare as a whole as well as to national defense. the research program on these forests is of great importance. not only to the united states forests but also to privately held timber. and timber held by other branches of the federal government. mining goes on in these national forests. our subcommittee on mines and mining has been holding hearings in regard to the development of these mines. there is a conflict between those who are particularly concerned with timber and those who are particularly concerned with mining development. this can be resolved under present law. provided mining engineers have an opportunity to examine these mine properties and determine whether the claims that are located are filed for the purpose of really developing the mineral resources or are for the purpose of using the timber. all of these things cost money. i believe. therefore. that the committee has made a just appropriation and should be sustained in that action."},{"1":"1951","2":"SCHOEPPEL","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. president.

correct?"},{"1":"1949","2":"THOMAS","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. president. i was speaking of my hydroelectric plant..which generated electricity which cost me 25 cents a kilowatthour. that rather high cost is why i tried to get the power line extended to my place. for it would have reduced the cost of electricity to me by almost onehalf. so. of course. i accepted the proposal. later on a cooperative bought out the line. and that cooperative now services my place in oklahoma. i have stated the rates which are being charged now. there are today no hydroelectric power plants in my section of the country. however. hydro power is being produced at denison. on the texasarkansas border. and at the norfork. ark.. dam. which is more than 500 miles away from my place. congress has heretofore provided funds for the construction of two dams and hydro plants. one in arkansas and one in oklahoma. funds are being provided for the construction of three additional damsone at fort gibson. which probably is about 80 percent completed. one at tenkiller ferry. which probably is from 30 to 40 percent completed. and one at bull shoals. which probably is from 60 to 70 percent completed. this bill carries funds to connect the dams now constructed with a main transmission line. the committee recommends that all the dams be connected with the main line. even before the dams are ready for the production of power. so they will be ready when they do come into production. the question is. are we to have more dams in my section of the country? these dams do not produce much power. they produce power from flash floods. the dams are built. not for power production. but for flood control. in order to be of benefit. the dams must provide a vast reservoir to catch the water from floods. when the floods come. the dams fill up. then the water is allowed to flow down to the power pool just as quickly as possible. so as to make room for more flood waters when they come. so the only power source we have in our section of the country is flashflood water. of a rather low powerpool status. mr. president. if we cannot get more dams. we shall never have very much hydropower in the southwestern area of the united states. what is the situation today with respect to the building of new power dams? i shall state the facts. last year our president. mr. truman. gave a directive to the bureau of the budget that it should not authorize estimates for any new construction unless such construction was absolutely mandatory in the public interest. i shall place. that instruction in the record. here is what the president said to the bureau of the budget: no authorized projects should be started only where the public need for them is so urgent that it is not in the national interest to postpone them. notwithstanding that order. the corps of engineers submitted 65 new projects for the consideration of the bureau of the budget. the bureau of the budget had instructions and accordingly rejected all but 2 of the 65 projects. the bureau of the budget authorized appropriations covering two of the projectsone was a ditch project in southern florida. the other was a levee project at rosiclare. ill. neither one involved a floodcontrol power dam. so the bureau of the budget has absolutely refused to request an appropriation or to send an estimate to the congress for money with which to start a single new floodcontrol power project. so long as that order stands there will be no new floodcontrol projects built in my section of the country or anywhere else in the united states. that being true. we shall have no more power developed. and if we have no more power developed. then what is the use spending vast sums of money to build a network of transmission lines and distribution systems when there is so little power to distribute? that is the position in which we find ourselves today. that is not all. mr. president."},{"1":"1948","2":"MAGNUSON","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"the proviso. if it can be called that. was a direction that the money should be spent only in a disaster area. we set out where

senator from new hampshire has -said regarding this matter. i appreciate that the republican policy is not to open up the bill. but that should not mean i am denied the right to submit the amendment.

and reclamation was considering the suggestions which afterward be~ame the socalled omahoneymillikin amendment to the river and harbor and floodcontrol bill to provide for the water rights in aridland states and the cooperation of the federal government and the state governments in the development and utilization of water resources. testimony given before our committee showed that even then. while we were in the middle of the war. thousands of letters were being received by the bureau of reclamation from servicemen all over the world seeking opportunities to settle upon the public domain. the servicemen wanted homes. they wanted an opportunity to establish farms. they wanted to engage -in agrictilture. members of congress from the publicland states likewise were receiving similar communications. so one of our main purposes was to adapt the law in such manner that water could be placed upon the land. so as to afford opportunities for settlement. the unfortunate fact is that agricultural land in the public domain which is capable of being used for homesteading and is capable of being used for the raising of ordinary crops without irrigation has long since been exhausted. and there is now no opportunity anywhere upon the public domain to provide homes for vet.erans. except upon the reclamation projects. so the law was passed. with the cooperation of the able senior senator from louisiana . who was acting as chairman of the commerce committee at the time. then the vast program of the missouri basin was authorized. with opportunities for settlement in the publicland states. a year or more ago i personally requested the department of the interior to submit to the committee a full statement regarding all possible projects which could be utilized for settlement by soldiers. and at that time a report was submitted. but because we were in the middle of the war. the bureau of the budget was unwilling to authorize the expenditures at that time. last year. when the deficiency bill for 1946 was under consideration. appropriations were made to begin some of these projects. this year. as the senator from arizona has so well stated. the committee. following the pattern of its action in previous years. requested the bureau of reclamation to give us a statement with respect to those projects which could be easily completed and made ready for settlement at the earliest possible date. that evidence was submitted. the committee has acted upon it. and the program is a highly desirable one. in my opinion. as well as in the opinion of the

be a much more appropriate time to judge its results when the war is over and the final chapter of lendlease has been closed rather than now. but. for the sake of national unity. i feel it is better

should have representation on the combined boards. at the present time these boards consist of members for the united states and members representing the united kingdom. our two other major allies. china and russia. who are fighting so valiantly. have no representation on these boards. the record speaks for itself. cumulative through december 31. 1942. the united kingdom received $3.959.950.000 of lendlease aid. australia. new zealand. india. egypt. and other british territories received $2.393.193.000. this makes a grand total for the british empire of $6.353.143.000. while russia received only $1.532.230.000. or approximately onefourth as much as the united kingdom. and china received only $156.738.000. or less than 2/2 percent as much as the british empire. i am perfectly aware of the tremendous transportation difficulties in getting supplies to russia and china and make no pretense that every effort is not being made to increase the supplies to these two countries. nevertheless. i can see no reason why representatives from these two countries should not be members of the combined boards. they should be recognized as full and equal partners. and not merely consulted by the combined boards for recommendations on matters of interest to them. if all aid possible is being given to china and russia. if representatives of these two countries were on the combined boards. they would be more satisfied. if that is not the situation. then they would have an equal voice in determining the allocation and assignment of lendlease

in a spirit of mourning and sorrow but rather to scatter a few flowers on the pathway of memory and to renew our faith in a blessed immortality. joy and sorrow are closely intermingled in this busy world of ours. the happiness incident to the birth of a precious baby is ofttimes curbed by the death of its mother. and repeatedly on the highway of life the bridal procession must tarry while the funeral train passes by. even after great victories in battle the shouts and huzzahs of the populace are hushed as vanquished foes are borne to their last resting place. but the king and his jester must answer the call. the great and the humble and the spear of the prince and the staff of the pauper shall lie side by side. life is a privilege. the noontide fades and shadows fall among the winding glades. the joy blooms wither in the autumn air. yet the sweet scent of sympathy is there. pale sorrow leads us closer to our kind and in the serious hours of life we find depths in the soul of men which lend new worth and majesty to this brief span of earth. life is a privilege. if some sad fate sends us alone to seek the exit gate. if men forsake us as the shadows fall. still does the supreme privilege of all come in that reaching upward of the soul to find the welcoming presence at the goal. andi in the knowledge that our feet have trod paths that lead from and must lead us back to god. this service is one that carries us away from the busy whirl of today and transports us to the land of yesterday. filled with fond memories of those who have left us for a little while. scarcely one of us but what sit and muse and grow fanciful as the floodgate of memory is opened and we live again the joys and sorrows of a lifetime. the fond mother in fancy sees her firstborn who was taken away in his baby days. and there comes to her an intuitive knowledge that had he been spared he would have been her pride and joy.. son and daughter in fancy see again their dear old father and mother who finally went to their reward after weary months of illness. even communities pause in the midst of their activities to pay tribute to the memory of those whose life work and achievements have made them characters of historic interest. and so we are assembled to turn back the pages of the record of yesterday. and as we listened to this roll call of the departed we in fancy could see our colleagues as we knew them in the days of their health and strength. of which they gave their full measure in the performance of their duties. no measure of sacrifice on our part would have been too great if we could have saved their lives to their families and friends. but the power to stay the hand of the grim messenger is not vested in us. and we bow in humble submission before the awful majesty of death. life. after all. is but a vapor. which appeareth for a little while and vanisheth away. and there shall be no remembrance of the wise no more than the fool forever. life is ever promising and seldom fulfilleth. ever lived in the present. and the present is no more by the time you have said it. one day calls another a day and makes joy to follow joy and tears to follow tears. life is a constant struggle and conflict between the victor and the vanquished. while the bitterness of the strife withers the laurels of the conqueror and rankles in the hearts of the defeated. success is not often measured by the degree of happiness. peace. or contentment attained but rather by the battles won and trophies captured from the vanquished foe. fortunate is the man who can so live that his success in material things has not dwarfed his spiritual stature. death to him is but the zero hour of the great adventure. and he sings with the psalmist: yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death. i will fear no evil. thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. but man is as frail and as prone to err as he has been for centuries. and in spite of the great moral uplift and banishment of bigotry during the last century we are still possessed of the tendency to exaggerate the faults of our neighbor and belittle his efforts for good. so few of us during our life journey walk the center of the path of rectitude with never a step to the right or to the left that in order to be true to ourselves we should be less hasty and caustic in our criticism and heed well the admonition: let he that be without sin cast the first stone. the ancient arabs had a saying that \"death is a camel that kneels before every mans tent.\" and so in the midst of the battle of life comes death. the implacable foe of person. time. or place. ever walking by our side. it cannot be avoided and none may escape it. its sway is universal and the hour of its coming is uncertain. in joy or sorrow it finds us out and we must follow at the summons. even as our departed friends were called. to us shall come perhaps without warning the grim messenger who shall dash the cup of life all fragrant with love and success from our lips and we shall stand as strangers at the gates of eternity. what will our earthly life. our lofty hopes. our success or failure matter to us at that time? how paltry and insignificant our own individuality. and how small will seem the part we played in the drama of the universe. there we shall stand in the presence of the everlasting judge. and human imagination dare not take a step farther. dare not enter that presence for between us and the soul of departed friends ther is a veil which we cannot penetrate. and its secret will not be revealed to us until we too pass behind it from the light which is darkness to the full light of perfect knowledge. what a flood of happy recollections come tumbling down the stream of memory as we look back upon the friendships developed by years of association with these departed friends. to us they have told their story of humble beginnings and early hardships which. in men of sterling worth and integrity. serve but to urge them on to their goal of achievement. many of them had attained positions of high honor in their states. and yet their ambition had been to serve- their country in a representative capacity. they came from all walks of lifesuccessful bankers and businessmen. lawyers of outstanding ability. and occasionally from the ranks of professional men and the clergy. they all contributed to the sum total of knowledge and ability that is so necessary in a national legislative body. to the younger members of the house they were a source of inspiration. and to us all they were unitedin the bonds of real friendship. these departed colleagues to whom.we this day pay tribute all experienced the joy and. satisfaction resulting.from the real friendships that they formed during their years of service. we read in prose and poetry of deathless friendships and we all know just what that means. in this greatest of deliberative bodies. neither invective. sarcasm. nor partisanship can sever the bonds of real friendship. there is no friend like an old friend who has shared our morning days. . no greeting like his welcome. no homage like his praise. fame is the scentless sunflower with gaudy crown of gold. but friendship is the breathing rose with sweets in every fold. the passing of these distinguished members was a loss not only to their immediate families but a loss to the nation. they had served for periods varying from a few months to a quarter of a century and their achievements will be a source of inspiration to us and to future generations. what better record can a man leave than that of the full performance of duty? such a record is the result of the possession not only of marked ability but of undaunted courage and a high sense of honor. to men of this caliber the nation is indebted for their tireless energy and devoted service. to them the master said. \"in my fathers house are many mansions. i go to prepare a place for you.\" and our faith in a blessed immortality tells us that we shall see them again in that \"house not made with hands. eternal in the heavens.\" without this abiding faith in the hereafter. death would be indeed an appalling mystery. life would be a tragedy. and love and devotion a mere mockery. we all dread to think of the hour of parting when those nearest and dearest to our hearts shall be taken out of our lives. but the great wealth of our love and devotion will not be lost to us. for it shall be gathered into the treasury of the kingdom and shall be returned to us a hundredfold when we. in our turn. shall follow the unnumbered generations into gladness eternal. oh. may i join the choir invisible of those immortal dead who live again in minds made better by their presence. live in pulses stirred to generosity. in deeds of daring rectitude. in scorn for miserable alms that end with self. in thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars and with their mild persistence urge mens search to vaster issues. hope not the cure of sin till self is dead. forget it in loves service and the debt thou cannot pay the angels shall forget.. heavens gate is shut to him who comes alone save thou one soul and it perchance may save thine own. god in his infinite wisdom does not permit us to darken our lives with the thought of death. he bids us raise our eyes to the heavens and ever have an abiding faith in our fellow men. to cultivate selfrespect in place of selfregard. to walk humbly with him in the quietness of the dim valley and the dark stream ever believing that an allmerciful providence has a place and a joy for even the most humble of his creations. whether this life journey be long or .short. let the record established by our departed colleagues continue to be an inspirationto us as time marches on.. at this hour when this world of ours is torn and bleeding by cruel war. let us not cry out as did king richard. \"now is the winter of our discontent.\" but rather may we declare that this is the springtime of our opportunity. to serve god and home and country. amidst our trials and tribulations. our ambitions. and our temptations. let

suffering in emergency areas."},{"1":"1939","2":"MURDOCK","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"i do not believe that it is possible or just to return to the former gold standard. i am not willing to surrender further the control of our money system to the banking interests. now. mr. chairman. just a little sketch of our american money history. we started out with both gold and silver as a basis for our money. congress was given power to coin money and the states were forbidden to make anything but gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debt. so says the constitution. we permitted the banks 100 years ago to furnish us a new kind of money. paper currency. \"wildcat\" bank notes. you recall that the panic of 1837 was caused by this country being flooded by \"wildcat\" bank notes. in those days the banks controlled our money with a vengeance. and look what calamity came upon the country as a result of it. we had practically no governmental paper money until the days of the civil war. a soundmoney man. s. p. chase. secretary of the treasury at that time. was very reluctant to have us issue greenbacks. but as a wartime emergency they were issued. i know they did depreciate. but being wisely limited. they served a useful purpose through all these years. i wish to say to my friends i am as much of a soundmoney man as any man on the lefthand side of the aisle. for many years following the civil war there was a conflict between two kinds of paper money. greenbacks on the one hand and nationalbank notes on the other. remember. those nationalbank notes were issued based on a bonded. interestbearing debt. after the war between the states many men. i think the poor class of the country. said. \"why should we pay interest on bonds? why should we perpetuate a national debt in order that we may have a peculiar kind of money?\" there was an insistent demand. especially on the part of the greenback party and the farmers. that we pay off our national debt. our bonds. with greenbacks. that was never done. the nation went right on paying taxes to pay interest on bonds to have bank notes. we still have the $346.000.000 of greenbacks issued in the civil war days. and have them to this very hour. the marvel is that we do not have more. i am not contending for flooding this country with greenbacks. and i must say that. in my judgment. franklin d. roosevelt is not an inflationist. i have heard today a fear expressed of reposing too much power in the president and in the secretary of the treasury. or in continuing that power. look at what franklin d. roosevelt might have done under the act passed early in his administration. he was given the power to devalue the gold dollar to the extent of 50 percent. he has not done that. he has devalued the gold dollar to the extent of only about 40 percent. . he was given the power to remonetize silver at any ratio he might see fit. he has not done that. he was given the power to cause to be issued by executive order $3.000.000.000 in greenbacks. he has not done that. he was given power to bring about the issue of $3.000.000.000 in federal reserve notes. he has not done that. how can any man. in view of the

features have been agreed upon and there is no dispute about them. the war department in reporting on this bill states that they have the utmost sympathy for these farmers and landowners whose lands have been taken and states that these people should be compensated. this is exactly what your committee on flood control reached as a conclusion after hearings and investigations. the engineers had some doubt about the provisions of the law and suggested that the local interests should pay. but i think anyone who will read this act will reach the same conclusion that your committee reached. that the legal obligation to pay for the flowage damage to this land rests with the national government. i have here an example to show you that the federal government has saved in the execution of the project more money than it would take to compensate these farmers in the various states of the union who have come in hereand built their homes and now will be exposed to flood waters by reason of the execution of this national project. now. another point i want to stress is that we are not asking compensation for a foot of land except what was protected when the flood control act was passed in 1928. now here is an instance. look on this chart. this is wilsons point. around this bend it is 15 v2 miles. the government is under its own obligation to build up the levees and maintain revetments for a distance of 151/2 miles around the point. if you cut across the point it is only 3.7 miles across. the engineers adopted that course. and the local interests furnished the rightofway and the levees have been built. there are 960 acres of land protected since 1840. on which the people have paid taxes for levee construction. the government will save $640.000. these people have furnished the rightofway. and the government goes across instead of around. and by going 3.7 miles they save 15 miles of construction and the sum of $640.000. so i say that this is not asking anything unreasonable and is not making any raid on the treasury."},{"1":"1934","2":"FOULKES","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. speaker. the announcement that the existing system of riverandharbor development is likely

senate in support of the conference report on the interior department appropriation bill. i am strongly in favor of the adoption of the report which is now before us. i say that not only as a senator from louisiana. one of the states which has a great many people in a distressed condition. although we have not talked very much about it so far. but as a planter who has been trying to make cotton and other crops during his entire life and has been furnishing a good many people who have been making crops. and are trying to make them this year. i believe. therefore. that i am a fairly practical man when it comes to deciding upon what is meant by the proposed compromise. i wish to invite the attention of the senate to its wording. the only part that i think we should consider now.: is no. 2: to make advances or loans to farmers for crop production for the crop of 1931. senators. in my candid opinion. not only as a planter or. farmer. but as one who used to be a lawyer. we could not have more comprehensive terms than those used: to make advances or loans to farmers for crop production. what does that mean? i have been lending money for many years to the tenants and farmers on my property for crop production. i usually take a crop lien and chattel mortgage from those tenant farmers. for what purposes. do i give them the money? to buy food for themselves andi their families. to buy feed for their work stock. to buy an occasional work animal. to buy farm implements. to buy more or less hardware. to supplement the wornout tools. toj pay drug bills and doctor bills. to buy clothing and shoes. to give them everything. my senator friends. that is necessary to enable men without means to make and harvest a crop. that is exactly what this language meansto make advances or loans to farmers for crop production. suppose instead of \" crop production\" we had written in! there the words \"to make advances or loans for food\"? that would be fine. that is one of the things for which the money is to be used. but there are a great many things. needed besides food. the language could not be more com-. prehensive unless we had used many more words. if instead. of \"money for crop productions\" we had said \"for food. for clothing. and for all things necessary to produce and harvest a crop.\" those words would have been about as comprehensive as are those in the pending measure. but i contend that as written they mean everything necessary. let me inquire. mr. president. if they do not mean that. then what do they mean? they are not vain and foolish words. \"money for crop production.\" what does that expression mean if not food. clothing. shoes. and the innumerable things necessary in addition to the feed. the seed. the fertilizer. the bollweevil poison. the oil for tractors. and everything of that kind which has already been provided by the $45.000.000 bill? there can be no doubt about it. i can not for the life of me see how it can be construed in any other way. mr. president. the man who has to construe that language is mr. hyde. the secretary of agriculture. how did he construe a similar law in 1929. when many of the people of florida. georgia. and south carolina were terribly stricken by flood? that law was worded almost exactly the same as this one. but it was tighter in its provisions. it was limited to seed and fertilizer. and yet we have heard no complaint of its construction and application. the senator from georgia said two days ago on this floor that that law had been fairly and sympathetically administered in those states and in a manner satisfactory to their people. the same secretary of agriculture is now in office. and i am convinced that he will administer the pending measure just as fairly and sympathetically. but suppose he attempts to act harshly. suppose he refuses to carry out the clear mandate and wishes of congress in this particular. what will happen? the secretary of agriculture is not the man to whom the constitution looks to enforce the laws. our constitution provides that it is the duty of the president to see \"that the laws be faithfully executed.\" and if mr. hyde should attempt to administer this law in a harsh manner. in what i consider the cruel manner which some senators seem to fear. he would be called down at once by president hoover. can it be conceived by any fairminded senator. whether he be democrat or republican. partisan or statesman. that a man who handled in such a wonderful manner the food supplies for europe during and after the world war would be harsh and unkind to the people of his own country? can a man from the state of louisiana or arkansas or mississippi or any of the states in the valley of the mississippi. which suffered so terribly from floods in 1927. and who saw the wonderful work done at that time by mr. hoover. when secretary of commerce. conceive that he would be otherwise than humane. kindly. and efficient in the execution of this law? senators. i happen to live in the very heart of the overflow section of the mississippi valley. and i know personally that the work which mr. hoover did during and after the flood of 1927 to relieve the distress among our people. caused by overflows which cost $250.000.000 in loss of property value and the lives of considerably more than 100 human beings. mr. hoover was not there in a formal way. he went there again and again. and he stayed weeks at a time. he traveled about the distressed regions in boats. in airplanes. on the trains. everywhere and in every manner. and personally did what i consider the most humane and remarkable work of relief of human suffering that ever was done during an overflow of the mississippi. i speak from personal experience. i have lived on the banks of the father of waters since september. 1882. a little more than 48 years. i have passed through flood after flood there. and i know what was done by every president who sat in the white house during that time and by cabinet officers. to tell me that the man who worked so hard for humanity during the world war and afterwards and so splendidly for the people of the overflowed valley of the mississippi would be harsh to those who are suffering from distress brought upon them by the god of hosts through no fault of their own is so unreasonable that i -consider it unworthy of consideration in this body. let us put all of that kind of talk behind us. mr. president. i wish to read two or three telegrams from my state to show something of the work of the red cross. that organization has ever acted nobly and effectively in time of distress. owing to the recurrence of floods from time to time in the mississippi valley. on more than one occasion we have had to rely upon the red cross. and i may say. sir. that never has it been found wanting. it has always answered the calls made upon it. and answered them splendidly. i shall read the telegrams in order that they may appear in the record. the first is from e. s. richardson. of minden. la.. who says: minden. la.. february 10. 1931. hon. j. e. ransdell. senate office building: red cross

were losing 9 cents a barrel in the city of new york they would have been losing 7 cents in the city of chicago. it is well known that the united states steel corporation has mills located in the vicinity of chicago. that the freight rates upon cement in those mills to the city of chicago are almost identically the sfame as the freight rates from the lehigh valley district to the city of new york. everyone knows that there is not a barrel of foreign cement which can reach chicago. that the united states steel corporation in the city of chicago is absolutely free and untrammeled so far as foreign couipetition is concerned. we know that the united states steel corporation is one of the most superbly managed business institutions in the country. we know that it dominates and controls the prices of every commodity which it maniiufactures. we know that no competitor dare cross its pathway because if it (itd it w ould be immediately destroyed. we know that the united states steel corporation is not in bu.-iless for its health. but it is in business for profit. and therefore when it sold cement in chicago at $2.25 a barrel it was making a profit and that profit went to swell the millions of dollars of dividends which are annually paid to its stockholders. again. the tariff commission informs us that on this same day. in the city of philadelphia. the lehigh valley co. was selling cement at $2.35 a barrel. the lehigh valley co. was complaining that it was being crushed by foreign competition. by cement which was being shipped in from belgium. and yet in that same day cement was selling in the city of chicago for $2.25 a barrel. 10 cents less per barrel than it was being sold for in the city of philadelphia. and yet in chicago. as i said before. there is no foreign competition. not a barrel of foreign cement can penetrate to the city of chicago. in the city of new york in 1928 there were imported 212.000 barrels of cement. the city of new york consumes approximately 12.000.000 barrels of cement anually. and all those 12.000.000 barrels of cement were supplied by american producers. with the exception of 212.000 barrels. which were imported. according to the tariff commissions figures. the belgian manufacturers would have 55 cents per barrel advantage in price laid down in the city of new york over american producers. that is. those were the figures. of course. which were sul)mitted by the manufacturers themselves. but not verified by the tariff commission. the cost of belgian cement laid down in the city of new york was $1.77 per barrel. according to this statement. and the selling price is $2.23. thus. according to these figures. the belgian producers are given an advantage of 46 cents per barrel. as against a loss of 7 cents per barrel for the american producer. common sense dictates that if the belgian producers had an advantage of 46 cents a barrel on cement laid down in the city of new york. they would have flooded the city of new york with their cement. but what is their record of achievement? they were able to sell but 212.000 barrels of cement. so far as the records are concerned. belgian producers were overwhelningly crushed in their competition with domestic cement. struggle as they might. out of 12.000.000 barrels they could sell only 212.000 barrels. the belgian manufacturers in the city of new york did not even make backdoor competition with tie american producers. all the belgian manufacturers obtained in the city of new york were simply the crumbs that fell from the tables of the american producers. when the tariff commission. through its report. tells us that the domestic producers were losing 9 cents a barrel in the city of new york when cement was selling at $2.213 a barrel. the department of labor informs us that for that year the 1929 average selling price. or the wholesale price of cement in the united states. was $1.65 a barrel. of course. that figure included the profits on this commodity. then we have the lehigh valley district shipping its cement to new york. adding to $1.65 about a 40cent freight rate would bring a price at new york of $2.05. which included a profit. and yet they sold it at $2.23. showing that. in addition to the regular wlolesale profit. they had an advantage there of 18 cents a barrel. however. there is stronger evidence of a still more convincing nature which arises to refute and confound the cement industry in its greedy but bold effort to befuddle the minds of members of congress in reference to this question. the first fundamental question is: is the price of cement today above normal? the answer to that question is of primary and determinative importance in deciding whether special aid should be given to this industry by further increasing the price to the consumer. the wholesale price of cement before the war in 1913 was $1.005 per barrel of 376 pounds. in april and may. 1929. the price was $1.65 a barrel. showing an increase of 67 per cent over prewar prices. the average increase of prices in general during that period as officially ascertained and reported by the department of labor in wholesale prices. april. 1929. was 38.7 per cent as represented by the commodity index of wholesale prices. hence. to have kept pace with the general rise in the level of prices cement would now be entitled to a price of $1.394 or 26 cents less per barrel. at $1.65 per barrel its price is 18.4 per cent excessive as determined by the general rise in the level of prices."},{"1":"1929","2":"SMOOT","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"most of the card and burr waste is carbonized. of course."},{"1":"1928","2":"WILSON","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"what the

briefly to explain it. the helium project is operated on a 5050 basis by the army- and the .navy. there are two problems in the helium project. one is the problem of the conservation of helium. and the other is the problem of current supply. by this amendment it is sought to make the provisions in this bill applicable also to the navy department. in view of the fact that the two departments are jointly interested in the development of this great project. it is thought. by newly discovered economies in the extraction of helium and the consequent reduction of cost that is foreseen. that likely it will be possible to save a part of the money here appropriated. that is the hope of those in control if this can be done the * adoption of this amendment will enable the two branches of the service. through this saving. to take some steps toward insuring an adequate current supply. the field from which we are now getting our supply. that at petrolia. tex.. 104 miles north of the city of fort worth. where we have our plant. is being considerably reduced. the indications are that it may be relatively a very short time until gas from that source will not be adequate for our current helium needs. the government owns a pipe line from the city of fort worth to this petrolla field. a new field has been discovered at nocona. situated about 22 miles from this pipe line. bearing a gas with a slightiy higher percentage of helium and less carbon dioxide. which has to be removed before the helium is extracted. for these reasons this gas seems quite available for production purposes. and it may be acquired. it is estimated. at a cost considerably less than we are now paying for the gas from. which we get our helium. a constant current supply is menaced unless we take advantage of some such opportunity as is thus afforded. and here fortunately is a field close by to which a slight extension of our line will give us access. the period of probable use of the available supply of this new field is estimated variously at from 10 to 25 years. in other words. this amendment. in view of the fact that the army and the navy operate the project on a 5050 basis. is simply to lend facility in the operation. the amendment provides that the provisions herein contained: shall apply also to the navy department in order that the two departments may have the same authority and work hand in hand for the better development of the project. and the economies contemplated in extraction may make it possible. if this amendment prevails. to use these provisions forincreasing our source of current supply with the appropriations available."},{"1":"1924","2":"EDGE","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. president. the time has arrived when the senate must either definitely take over the functions of the courts and the federal grand juries. which is unthinkable. or confine the present mania for investigations to such inquiries as have always been recognized as necessary to secure information upon which to formulate remedial or constructive legislation. likewise. tile senates factious and puerile resentment of protests from the executive because of illy concealed efforts to break down the morale of important departments of the government is indefensible. his demand for \"a return to a government under and in accordance with the usual forms of the law of the land\" is beyond successful challenge. mr. president. the standing of the senate in the country today is at the lowest ebb in the history of the nation. perhaps senators are unwilling to admit this indictment. but it is nevertheless true. there must be a reason. you may contend that the country is wrong and the senate is right. 1. nevertheless. have no fear of successful contradiction of the statement i have unqualifiedly made. i propose to consume 20 minutes. which possibly should be devoted to discussing pending bills. but with a conviction that the attacks in this chamber following the warning from the executive a few days ago should not go unchallenged. i would feel absolutely false to my responsibility if i did not at least file a positive protest. when a senator on this side objects or questions unwarranted attacks. lie is termed a lecturer or a scold. it might not be out of order or an infringement of the rules of the senate to ask the proper term to use to describe the tirades we have for four months. 90 per cent of the time. patiently listened to from our friends across the aisle. i presume they were not scolds or lecturersjust plain. sacrificing patriots. the trouble with our democratic friends is they seem to insist upon a monopoly of being critical. perhaps that is the special privilege of a minority. perhaps. too old fashioned for the present day. i have presumed our responsibilities to the nation were parallel. in any event. it is clearly evident they deeply resent any exception being taken to the free rein they have been given during the last few months. they object to any criticism of their program. their partisanship has remained in most part unchallenged. in my judgment. for too long. however. they have realized the country was not responding in the way they had anticipated. perhaps that accounts for their sensitiveness. some of the wiser ones on the other side seem to be convinced they have overplayed their part. this was very evident when the mellon resolution invoking the blue law of 1789 came to such an untimely end. this was equally evident when the suggestions of other investigations seemed to go up in smoke. conversely. the irritation on the other side following any suggestion that mr. mcadoo. who it was alleged had to retire from the cabinet to make a living. was doing pretty well with millliondollar retainers. was demonstrated by the wails that it was an absolutely unjustified and inconsiderate attack even to suggest that doheny was a democrat and had contributed largely to the democratic campaign funds was entirely aside and apart from the issue. investigate republican campaign funds. even by libeling the memory of dead men. was quite all right. but to call witnesses to consider democratic campaign funds was irrelevant and in no way material. even if they felt so disappointed with the failure of their efforts to find an issue for the fall campaign. it would have been better sportsmanship not to have shown it so plainly. senators on the other side seem to assume every protest an insinuation questioning their sincerity. even a suggestion from others. an indication of bad faith. when the senator from ohio caustically commented on some piroceedings recently the official censors on the other side advised him no such liberty had ever been taken before. perhaps he was sufficiently disciplined. however. the senator from ohio was very. very mild as compared to recent explosions from dour friends across the aisle. the words \" arrogant\" and \"insult\" are hurled at the president because lie dares protect his administration and insists that an important department of the government shall not be subjected to personal attacks. last week the president very properly called attention to a purely personal or partisan effort to disintegrate the treasury -department. the press if the country generally approved of the timely warning. then the floodgates of vituperation were openpd as they never have been before. in my judgment the presidents message was not only justified but if he had failed to so assert his responsibility he would have been convicted of supineness and hesitation absolutely inexcusable. he unhesitatingly. and properly. met the issue and i trust it will be heeded. if the senate refuses to take due notice. the country will not. the resolution to investigate tile internal revenue department of the treasury was supposed to be predicated on a proper desire to ascertain if refunds to taxpayers were contrary to law or if an improvement in procedure could be devised. not a single senator objected to that. neither did the secretary of the treasury. on the contrary. he asked for it. the personal phase that his own interests furnished the incentive for the inquiry met with absolutely no objection. there was continued harping on the floor of the senate that large sums had been returned to large taxpayers. of course. you could not return large sums to small taxpayers. if the refunds are according to law. it makes no difference whether large or small. certainly. no one can contend they should not be returned. so far as i have heard not one unjustified refund has been discovered. apparently that is the disappointment. some malfeasance must be discovered to justify either the personal or political animus. a counsel who through previous records could develop a proper sensation was suggested. heney had successfully prosecuted crime in california. and to meet the objective crime must be discovered in the treasury department. so. why not heney? the little matter of reimbursing him. unauthorized by the senate. was easily disposed of. because mr. mellon. and incidentally the president who defended him. must be reached. the president protests and a resolution is actually proposed to expunge his message from the record. if onehundredth part of the congressionat record contained matter as pertinent or timely or patriotic as the presidents message. i would vote for an appropriation to mail this overworked publication to every citizen of the country. it seems now to be admitted that the real purpose back of mr. heneys employment was to reach mr. mellon through an investigation of the prohibition department. i am inclined to the opinion that a real investigation there. not simply a man hunt. would be enlightening. however. when my colleague on the other side of the chamber recently proposed a resolution to bring it about it was not very cordially received. perhaps the absence of the personal feature made it unattractive. there are investigations and investigations. if every department is to be overhauled by the senate committee or aspiring sensational lawyers. most naturally different opinions as to policy will be developed. that is destructive in the main. because it disorganizes and destroys morale. when a president is chosen. unless crime is indicated. he is supposed to be given a chance to carry out his policy. if congress wishes to change an accepted or general policy. it can be done by legislation. and. of course. a certain leeway of investigation is always in order. there is a distinct difference. however. between trying to reach some one for political effect and constructive inquiries. no one questions the latter prerogative of the congress. certainly this side of the chamber has not. in recent months our committees have in effect been juries. in their influence on the future of men in high public position they have in reality had more influence than juries. because we have indicted. tried. and sentenced. no court jury is permitted to have prejudiced members. the senate has departed widely from those traditions and ideals. whenever a protest is made against the orgy of investigations the query comes from the other side. \"are you opposed to the unmasking of official corruption? are you against getting to the bottom of questionable proceedings?\" the answer is that both the resolution providing for committees to investigate tie attorney general and the oil leases involving the former secretary of the interior and the secretary of the navy were passed practically unanimously by the senate. every republican present voted for the oillease investigation. and all but one for the resolution providing for the investigation of the department of the attorney general. we do not differentiate from our democratic friends in a deire to have the facts. but we do in the clearly evidenced determination on their part to make these investigations political rather than with a sincere desire to confine the inquiries to relevant and material testimony. lxv397 what information could the admitted train bandit. al jennings. give to help the committee decide as to the wisdom of the oil leases by coming from oklahoma to washington to tell stories of a dead mans contributions to a campaign fund four years ago. which statements have been just as positively denied? then again the introduction of witnesses of the type of roxie stinson and gaston means. one testifying against a man who is dead and can not answer for himself. and the other under indictments for violations of the law. fairminded men protest that the reputations of men who have held high and honorable positions should not be in the custody of such characters. that is where some of us differ with the democratic prosecutors. practically every republican senator. as well as the president. has time after time called for a complete inquiry into all the conditions surrounding the leasing of the naval oil reserves and that proper punishment be meted out to any public official guilty of violation of the law. by unanimous vote two attorneys were selected by the president and later confirmed by the senate. who are supposed to exhaust every fund of judicial procedure. both criminal and civil. in completely disposing of these cases. with the knowledge that all possible useful information has been turned over to the attorneys. the committee now employs its activities in the investigation of campaign receipts of both parties. which information was secured by an investigating committee four years ago. judge kenyon. then a senator. was chairman of that committee. i happened to have been a memher of the committee. and the reports were all printed. and if the oillease investigating committee is interested they cal have a full transcript of the sworn testimony of every witness we could find who could give us accurate information. but no. the committee apparently prefers al jennings and to struggle along hoping.for new and varied sensations. and in the meantime the cases are properly in the courts. the oil leases and everything surrounding them should anyway be tried out in the courts rather than in the committee room. the time has arrived when actual facts as to just how bad or otherwise. from an economic standpoint. these leases may have been. should be disclosed through a judicial review of the subject rather than a partisan inquiry. to date this phase has hardly received discussion. while we have always adhered to the leasing policy in order to develop our resources. our forests. our streams. our minerals. yet. because one man did undoubtedly go wrong. these particular leases have been looked upon as beyond any defense. perhaps they are. i do not know. but i do unhesitatingly contend that we should have the facts and not the type of sensations which have mostly controlled the activities of the investigating committees. all must agree that the oil was useless to the navy in the ground. efforts on the floor of the senate have recently been made by democratic leaders to make it appear that these investigations have not interfered with the preparation and disposal of important legislation. the fact remains. however. that the entire atmosphere of the senate chamber for the past four months has been investigations. it would not interfere so much if everyone of the committees activities were not rehashed on the floor of the senate day after day. committees have had great difficulty in securing quorums because of the interest in the criminal investigations. and no one can deny that the preparation of necessary legislation has been retarded simply because of the determination of many of the senators to resolve the body into a super grand jury. try cases. and give verdicts without the accused permitted a proper defense. however. as stated at th.e opening. it would seem as if our friends had heard somewhat of the reaction in the country. judging from recent speeches on the floor. these reactions have. to use a semivulgar expression. gotten under their hides and they are now vigorously protesting against the emphatic protests and criticisms of the policy coming in from all parts of the nation. if you really believe this program of slander and assumption of the power of the courts will be approved by the country. in my humble judgment you will soon be rudely disillusioned. punish crime. of course. but to attempt it through prejudiced partisanship will never be accepted by the american people. the only possible excuse. and that a mighty poor one. is that we are now approaching a presidential election. the efforts to make it appear that republican resentment of the methods employed has been a desire to shield crime have utterly and miserably failed. such an effort has been too transparent and the votes of republican senators in every inquiry have completely defeated any such design."},{"1":"1923","2":"OVERMAN","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. president. i think it my duty to make a st iteiment here in regard to this deficiency bill. we hope that hereafter a different

there. and owned stock. and when the crash came under the dfastic. deadly. deflation policy. his farm was swept from under him. his stock were taken. and the old man brooded over it. broke down. went to bed. and died. ie told of another in tile same community who lost his farm in like fashion. and he said. \" now. instead of living on that beautiful little farm he is insane. and is down in west virginia in ai asylum for the insane.\" there is no reason for that. as god is god in his heaven. there is no reason why that should happen in the united states. the time will come in this country when the people will not submit. and should not submit. to a few men in wall street. or anywhere else. controlling the money supply and credit. and dishing out their favoritism. supplying the stock gamblers. as they do today. the stock gamblers of chicago. i will say to my friend from georgia. can get every dollar they want with which to speculate and: beat down the price of wheat or corn or cattle. the gamblers of new york can get every dollar they want with which to speculate and beat down the price of cotton. so the only sources the federal reserve board is supplying now by its policy. and has been supplying since the spring of 1920. are the people who are employing the money to further afflict the farmers. is not that an evil indictment? yet it is true as i speak to you today. now. senators. let us try not to deceive ourselves. here is the root of tile evil. it is the money power. it is the way it is being manipulated today. what do they do out there in the rice country? they raise the floodgates and let the water come out and flood all tilesoil. and they do it at different periods. it has to be done in order to make a rice crop. suppose the rice farmer goes up to tile man who has control of the mighty system that holds the water supply and says. \" i have come around for my periodical supply of water. i must have it right away. my rice is suffering. and it is just right fbr it now. if i can not get the water i will not make a crop.\" he is told. \"we have decided not to supply you with any water.\" \" if you do that. do you know what you are doing?\" \"no.\" \"you will cause me to turn off 500 men. who are working for me. and each one of them has a family. you will cause people that i supply with rice to be hungry and suffer. you will cause the rice mills to shut down. because they have to have rice to% work with. and all the products that come from rice. every industry all along the line. will be injuriously affected. and you will destroy my business.\" that is exactly what is done with the money supply and credits. the farmer stands in the market place. god bless him. having toiled the year through. ofttimes with his own children and his wife. he comes up with his plroduce to the market place and says. \"here i am. this is the fruit of my toil.\" they say. \" well. we are very sorry to tell you. but we have just heard from the market today and the 1)ice of your produce has gone off. oh. a great deal.\" he says. \"well. i can not afford to sell at that price. i just can not afford to do it. if i sell at that price i sell below the cost of production. if i sell below the cost of production i have lost ol the entire years crop instead of making anything. i am going backward instead of forward. and yet i am a producer.\" the produce with which to feed and clothe mankind is produced by that nan. and you confront him with a market where the price does not warrant him in continuing in that business. so he says. \" i will not sell it at that figure.\" they say. \"well. what are you going to do?\" lie says. \"i am going down to the bank. as i used to do under democratic rule. and i am going to borrow money on my produce and i am going to use my pricefixing power. which i have a right to do. to sustain myself and provide for my family. i am going to hold this stuff off the market until the price will go up to where it will cover the cost of production and give me a little profit. i am entitled to that.\" \" oh. yes. you are entitled to it. but we are afraid you can not get it at the bank.\" \"why?\"\" \"because you have agricultural products.\" \" i see where they are borrowing money in wall street to speculate with. why dont you think they will let me have it?\" \"because they laye liquid assets in wall street. they call turn them over vera quickly. but you have products of the soil and they are not going to let you have any money. we are afraid you cal not get it.\" he goes down to the bank iinder this

the banker says. \"i would he delighted to let you have it. i have let you have it all along. but i have heard from the federal reserve board not to loan money to told cotton for speculative purposes.\" he says. \" i have to told it until i get a price that will cover the cost of production.\" the banker tells him. \" i would let you have the money. but we can not get it when it is to be

you have money. it will go oil down and down.\" he says. \" yes. i guess that is so. but if i have to sell now. then what i have will not even pay what i owe.\" they say. \"yes. that is the situation.\" he says. \"but i promised my wife and my children that i would bring some things home today. christmas is approaching. and i have promised them shoes and clothes and hats. i have been doing that every year when i got a fair price for my produce. when i was doing fairly well and was prosperous. and now what i have will not even pay what i owe. how alni i going to take those things

\"daddy\" bringing the gifts home to them. and as they approach him a lump comes ill his throat. and tears linger on the brink of his eyelids as lie looks down upon his children. knowing that he will have to disappoint them. they look over in the wagon and say. \" daddy. where are our shoes? where are the things you brought us?\" daddy chokes up and says. \" well. i will get them the next time i go to town.\" he knows they call not understand the situation. he goes in the house and acquaints his good wife with the awful condition. and she tells the children. \" that is all right. daddy will get them for you the next time he goes.\" the little children go to bed that night with heavy hearts. disappointed because their father had failed to bring the things lie had promised. instead of enabling hiim to do what lie was able to do before. you have reduced him to that awful conditiol. this feature is true of the south. it is true of the west. the great graingrowing west. and tile

the value of this property to those who lost it. should we. descendants of those who have gone before. presume to question the wisdom of what we know their verdict would be? let us get together. the south accepts the result of the war as being a dispensation. not of the great god chance. but of the god of battles and the god of peace. the south wants its brethren of the north to think well of it. we prefer to say nothing that would disparage or discredit either section from this good day. you will periit me. as the son of a confederate soldier. who carried to his grave a withered arm caused by a bullet wound in the shoulder received while he was fighting under the flag of the south. to say kind words about the soldiers on both sides. i admire the record of those sturdy veterans of the lost cause who won deathless honor upon every battle field they fought upon. and i am not wanting in pride or respect for the splendid men who marched and fought under the great soldier statesman. gen. grant. i admire the courage of the northern soldier. private and officer. but. notwithstanding the glory that shines on the victorious hosts of grant and sherman. it is in deed and in truth no brighter than the white light of the dazzling glory that sheds its golden splendor on the ragged columns of those who fought under the battlesmoked banners of the confederacy. i love the south and i love her people. as brave and as generous a people as gods sun ever shone upon. ever since i have had a home of my own i have had hanging upon the wall two plcturs which i greatly value. it is an inspiration to look at them. one is the portrait of a man with iron gray hair and beard. the kind and manly face of a virginia gentleman. \"when you look upon his face he looks a chief. who fears not human hate nor human guile. on his cheek the twilight of agrief. but in that grief the starlight of a smile.\" \"he was a foe without hate and a friend without treachery. a public officer without vices and a private citizen without wrong.\" the other is the picture of a rugged and homely man. with black hair and beard. and with the firm lips of a fighter. he was a puritan in morals. but a cavalier in the saddle. he followed the injunction of shakespeare. who said. \"in peace theres nothing so becomes a man as modest stillness and humility. but when the blast of war blows in our ears. then imitate the action of the tiger.\" he prayed and fought and fought and prayed. under his slouch cap was the brain of a remarkable military genius. behind his gray coat beat the heart of a sincere patriotthe pictures of lee and .stonewall jackson. and as long as i have a roof to cover my head those pictures will continue to have a place in my home. sentiment is not unworthy and not a rare virtue of the people of the south. the south after the civil watr was a land of ruins. but men are brought solemnly together in ties of eternal friendship in a country that has been devastated and whose peoples sufferings have been great. a land without ruins is a land without memories and a land without memories is a land without history. no one will quarrel with our people because they love the meimory of their illustrious dead. because they refuse to forget price or forrest or gordon or beauregard or albert sidney johnston. is it wrong to listen to the waves that still will glisten where the wreck we loved went down? is it wrong to watch the willows that are drooping oer the grave? is it wrong to love our brave? during the last 50 years. in the shadow of a blessed peace. the stouthearted old confederate soldiers have acted the part of men. they have rebuilt their burned homes. they have reared their families in comfort and in honor. they have respected the stranger and the strangers rights. they have done their duty to their country. to their neighbors. and to their god. and they have wrought works that do them credit. in speech and in conversation we are prone to extol the virtues of those who are dead. and it is a worthy sentiment. but we should not forget the living. murphy. the great temperance lecturer. was very fond of a red rose and usually wore one in the buttonhole of his coat. he used to say. with rich irish accent. \"my friends. i would rather you would bring me one red rose while i live. that.i may admire its beauty and inhale its fragrance. than to wait until i am dead and bring a whole wagon full of roses and shove them down on my grave and say. murphy. shmell of them.\" we should not spend our time in idly and lavishly praising the dead to the hurt or neglect of the living. we are sometimes inclined to picture the dead greater than they really are. a king once said of a prince struck down: \"taller he seems in death.\" and his speech holds true. for now. as then. tis after death that we measure men. and as mists of the past are rolled away. qur heroes who died in their tattered gray grow taller and greater in all their parts. till they fill our minds as they fill our hearts. and for those who weep in this belief. that glory sits by the side of grief. now. let us not forget the rapidly diminishing band of living heroes. who fought through four bloody years of war. who have lived to be old. and who are now in want. the country has progressed. fifteen or twenty years ago a bill of this character would have had scant hearing in this body and in the country. senator worms last year wrote to gen. j. r. gibbons. of my state. commenting on his bill. and.-naong other things. said: i do not see why the south should have any feeling of injured pride on account of the government furnishing aid and comfort and giving cheer to these old men. the time has certainly come when this can be done without offending the sense of patriotism on the part of any citizen. in the united states senate at this time there are five union veterans and five confederate soldiers. one of the confederate soldiers is a member who has occupied the chair next to mine for a long time. i am glad. indeed. to do what i can to bring about this beneficial and patriotic act on the part of th_ government of the united states. i hope that the people of the south will appreciate the fact that this is done only in the effort to do what seems to me to be a worthy and a patriotic act on the part of our government. he was speaking about his bill proposing to turn over the federal soldiers home. near johnson city. tenn.. to the confederate. veterans. as above stated. the bill i am discussing is growing rapidly in popularity. many of the great papers of the south are calling attention to it. in a recent issue of the montgomery journal. an influential paper of alabama. is a lengthy editorial indorsing the measure. a few sentences of which i beg to quote: there could be no more fitting time than the present. while there are wars and rumors of wars. for a practical recognition of the south as an integral part of the united states. speaking of my bill the editor. mr. horace hood. says: this bill is most timely. it is timely in that it is a time for closing up the ranks. letting the dead past be forgotten. as it has long been forgiven. and let the north demonstrate in a practical way that there is no recognition of any section to the exclusion of any other or any sectional differences. that we are one and the same. not only in spirit and purpose. in loyalty and devotion to our country. but in sentiment that shows itself in a practical way that is being practically demonstrated. and is just recognition of as brave a foe as ever was met upon the bloodiest of battle fields. if we mistake not. on one occasion. when the late president mckinley visited new orleans. he was so royally treated by the confederate veterans of louisiana that he said in his address on that occasion that he had not dreamed that there was such a kindly and patriotic feeling among the confederate veterans. and he was so gratified by his reception and the enthusiasm displayed that he promised when he returned to washington he would have one of the members of congress from his state of ohio to introduce a bill to put the confederate veterans on the pension roll. and he tried to keep his word. but a few hotheaded southern members of congress. hotheaded at that time and pardonable. but not pardonable. now. advised against the proposition. declaring it was an insult to the confederate soldiers. that they did not have to be paid to be loyal to the government. and. of course. the idea \" died a bornin in the house of its friends. i quote below extracts from the macon telegraph: this bill appeals with great force to the veterans of the south. rhe grand army of the republic favors pensions by the government for surviving confederate veterans. the government can afford to restore the money improperly taken under the law governing seizures of cotton and other property. for its fame. for its social peace. for its pride of national honor. the government should no longer refuse to return this money. and. as the legal owners can not now get it. let it be paid to the old soldiers and their widows. let us iot forget thefew remaining confederate soldiers. they have received as medals only scars. and for their loss of time. blood. and money. their loss of the opportunity to obtain an education. no money compensation. they will soon pass away and shall dream no more of the glories they won in battle. out of the gloom of vanished years a column is marching today. fling out your banners and -greet them with cheers. the heroes in jackets of gray. onward they march to the land of the blest. onward oer lifes dusty way. soon with their comrades in peace they shall rest. shall rest in their jackets of gray. brethren of the virile north. the south deserves your good opinion and is entitled to your hearty and fraternal \" god speed and good luck.\" there is no fairer land. when god made dixie he was in a particularly happy frame of mind. he swept the wide universe with his mighty eye. and reaching out his generous hand he gathered together. in the twinkling of an eye. a thousand square miles of blue sky and unrolled it like a scroll from the ohio to the gulf and from ocean to ocean. he lighted it by day with the same smiling sun that shed its brilliant rays over cultured athens in the golden age of pericles. and shone over happy italy when horace sang of the field and the vine. he sowed this blue sky with stars that look like angels eyes. he planted in the south seas the southern cross and flooded the blessed land with flowers and sunshine. he peopled this section with a selfrespecting manhood. and a womanhood as pure as the pond lilys spotless leaf. he caused to develop here an \"upright race who love the land because it is their own. and scorn to give another reason why. who would shake hands with a king upon his throne and think it a kindness to his majesty.\" the south has grown apace. it now has a population of over 27.000.000. 4.000.000 more than the united states had in 1860. in 1860 the capital invested in all american enterprises was one billion. while now the south alone has two and onefourth billion invested. the total value of all agricultural products in 1860 in the united states was one billion seven hundred and fifty million. now southern farlms are turning out two and onehalf billions of agricultural products annually. in 1860 the united states had a total wealth of sixteen billions. today the wealth of the south alone is estimated at twentyone billions. it is a land of orchard and grain. a land of rice and cotton. a land of golden indian summers. a land of gorgeous sunsets. and the moon sails through the blue seas of her cloudless nights like a ship of pearl. it is a land of enchantment and variety. here a stately country home. there a big plantation. with its broad. fat acres laughing under a harvest of good things. the mockingbird sings until midnight among the fragant magnolias. the pink peach blooms. and the purple apple blossoms. here is the fragrant pine. there the cedar. dusk and dim. here the virile white oak. there the branching elm. there the stately mountain range. there a lake of silver. there by the roadside a bubbling spring ever holding up its pouting lips to be kissed by. the thirsty traveler. god made the south. and when he had finished this. masterpiece he saw it was good. and said. \"moreover this is my country. my south. and behold it was so.\" let no harry hotspur of the south say in this chamber that he would scorn to accept from this government any help for the southern soldier. why not leave this matter of acceptance to the soldier himself? and let no member from the great north say that disloyalty should not be rewarded. such declarations will tend to destroy the blessed peace that now hovers over the two sections. and \"pour the milk of concord into hell.\" in a war museum in chicago .there is a certain miracle in lead. it was made by the impact of two bullets fired in one of the battles of the civil war. two leaden messengers of death sped through the air from the opposing lines. hissing the hate felt by those who fired the shots. one from a northern rifle. the other from a southern musket. meeting midway between the battle lines they melted into a solid leaden star. this leaden star now exemplifies the unity of the once hostile sections. now happily welded together. emblematic of the feeling prevailing among peoples now claiming one flag. one country. and one god. at the beginning of the year there were some sharp passages between the gentleman from missouri and the gentleman from wisconsin and the gentleman from massachusetts . i quite agree with the first two gentlemen. that we should not be hostile to these american citizens who were born under foreign flags. who now love america. but who have not forgotten the land of their birth. we have many loyal frenchamericans. russianamericans. british -americans. germanamericans. scandinavianamericans. who love our country and are a credit to it. nor should we unduly criticize massachusetts or boston. i remember that a. certain memorable and highly creditable tea party occurred at boston. attended largely by boston people. i remember the midnight ride of paul revere. i remember that the shot that was fired at lexington was heard rbund the world. nor should we forget a certain monument. piercing the sky like a giants spearhead. attesting a very worthy enterprise occurring at bunker hill. the cost of these pensions will be a mere bagatelle. this great nation is now the richest in the world and well able to pay them. the republic is too great to deny this relief. this nation will live forever. southern valor could not destroy it. and what southern valor could not destroy the world need not attempt. we are partial to the south. and you would not respect us if we were not. somehow \"dixie \" raises more enthusiasm in the south than does \"yankee doodle.\" \"dixie\" is the best war tune ever written. it is such a stirring air and one so full of southloving sentiment. and written by dan emmett. of ohio. god bless him. there is that in the music that tells of the magnolia and the palmetto. that is eloquent of the cotton fields and the broad acres of the old plantation. that tells of the mocking bird. the violet skies. the land of beautiful women and gallant men. the land of flowers and sunshine and chivalry. god pity the man of the south who refuses to yell when the hand plays \"dixie.\" somehow \"down where the cotton blossoms grow\" sounds better to us than does \"john browns body.\" somehow \"down on the cumberland\" is a little more musical than \"up on the wabash.\" somehow \"midst the old virginia pines\" suits our fancy better than \"way down in maine.\" eomehow \"my old kentucky home. good night.\" is more suited to our taste than \" marching with sherman through georgia.\" somehow \" surrey of eagles nest\" reads better. we think. than \"uncle toms cabin.\" and the virile. brave. redblooded men of the north commend us for this sentimental loyalty. men of the north and the west and the east and the south. the soldiers of the confederacy are old and are rapidly growing older. their ranks are thinning faster than when the men in blue poured deadly hail into their faces. one by one god is touching them with is finger and calling them home. the world is better for their having lived in it. and will miss them when they are gone. the cause they fought for was lost. but they will leave behind them a record of stainless honor more to be desired than victory. the red badge of courage has ever been a passport to respect. and courage they had to the point of recklessness. in a few years the sturdiest of them will strike his tent for the march which will end in the great hereafter. there he will meet the kingly lee. who said at appomattox. \"boys. i have done the best i could for you. go home and make good citizens.\" thdre he will meet the englesouled stonewall. the peerless albert sidney johnston. price. cleburne. ewell. pickett. the hills. and longstreet. as gallant a company of heroes as gods sun ever shone upon. there he will meet many a gallant spirit who fell in the ranks with his face to the foe. that will be a grand reunion. remembering the dead. let us not forget the living. let us cleanse our souls by the act of justice contemplated by this bill. let us pay an honest debt. let us give over this conscience money to those who are entitled to it. to those who will appreciate it. to those who need it. and by this act of equity and generosity we will bind together with hooks of steel the north and south and thus form a \"more perfect union.\" [applause.1"},{"1":"1915","2":"HUMPHREYS","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"mr. chairman. the $4.000.000 on hand has been contracted for and is on hand no longer. there is none on hand now. there was $3.750.(00 allotted out of the $20.000.000 bill passed last year. complaint has been made by citizens in the mississippi valley ever since the beginning of the government against whatever system was in vogue. there are those there now who are bitterly opposed to levees. as the gentleman from wisconsin has stated. of course. there are very few of them. the government in 1822 appointed a board of engineers to investigate the question. and that board declared that the only way to control the floods. and that is what this money is largely used forwas to build levees. in 1850 another commission was appointed. and they reported the same way. in 1851 another commission examined it for 10 years and made the most extensive examination ever made of any river on the face of the earth. and their report. the report of humphreys and abbott. two of the most distinguished engineers that we ever had. was the same way. gen.. humphreys was a very distinguished general in the union army. and after that chief of engineers. gen. abbott was one of the greatest engineers we ever had. and by the way. i am happy to say. is still living. nearly 100 years old. that commission reported that the only way to protect the deltas from flood was by levees. congress has appointed numerous commissions itself to make investigations. and every commission that ever investigated it has. after investigation. reported that the only way to control tme floods was by levees. it 1879 we created the mississippi river commission. it was composed of oflicers from the army. the coast and geodetic survey. and from civil life. the personnel. of course. is changed every few years. gen. benjamin harrison. afterwards president of the united states. was at one time a member of that commission. capt. james b. eads. one of the most famous of all the civil engineers the country has produced. was at one time a member of it. that commission has been at work ever since 1.879 and has been studying the question all the while. and after the most exhaustive examination has reported that the only way to control the floods is by levees. always there have been some men who have said that that was not the right way. but there has never been a time since the creation of the mississippi river commission in all the volumes of their reports and after innumerable investigations when the commission was not of the opinion that the only way to control the floods was by the construction of levees. others have taken the opposite view. but of course they are very few and far between. the people along the lower mississippi in various levee districts have contributed since the civil war. including what has been put in this year. about $75.000.000 for the construction of levees. the congressional district that i have represented since 1884the total assessed value of all taxable property was then $29.000.000has contributed $25.000.000 to build these levees. it would be charging these people with lunacy to presume that after all these years of experience they would still continue to subject themselves voluntarily to the tremendous. tax which they have to pay in order to build levees if they did not know that that was their salvation. all political parties and nearly all the prominent men in all political parties have insisted that the federal government ought at least to contribute. the federal government has since 1879 contributed $33.000.000. while we have put up $75.000.000."},{"1":"1914","2":"BORAH","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"no.

slackens this great sedinmentbearing stream. filled as it is with heavy material gathered in the missouri and from the caving banks all along the river.drops a portion of its load. and you will always find a big sand bar below a crevasse. which causes very poor navigation in the river. let me give you one little piece of history. i went to lake providence to live in 1882. that year we had one of the greatest floods on record. two hundred and eightyfour crevasses occurred in the levees of the mississippi river in the spring of that year. and for two or three years. thereafter we did not have more than 4 to 5 feet of water over a number of the shallow bars. several years later. when the breaks had been closed. the navigation began to improve. and for more than a decade we have had an average of 9.feet over these same bars. we have fine navigation in the river now. and we will always have good navigation if we keep the levees up. but if we allow them to go down the bars will show up again as in the past."},{"1":"1911","2":"CULLOM","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"at the request of former senator mason. of illinois. i introduce a bill. which i ask may be read twice by its title

recommended the pastage of this legislation. the gentleman speaks of the sale of certain lands in new hampshire. and seems to assume that these lands were all heavily timbered. the first tract that he mentions is the summit of mount washington. there is not a tree on it. there were no trees on it when it was sold. none have grown upon it since. none ever will grow upon it. for it is bare granite rock. the second tract that he speaks of includes scattered lots in three different counties. tens of thousands of acres of this tract were located on mountain summits upon which no trees grew. the state got 4 cents an acre for it. and much of it today could not be sold for 4 cents an acre. no one dreams of purchasing bare mountain summits. the other tract that the gentleman speaks of in the town of pittsburg is timber land. not in the white mountain region. not in the region where anybody seeks to acquire land under the provisions of this bill. that is heavily timbered land upon the canadian line. far north of the white mountain region. it was a bad trade when the state of new hampshire sold this land. as experience has shown. but when these lands were sold they were remote from railroads. remote from navigable streams. and there was no possible way in which these tixiiber lands could be operated and pay the state one single cent. experience has shown that this was a bad trade. but has not the government of the united states. by authority of congress. sold millions of acres of timber lands and of mining lands at a price as inadequate as the state of new hampshire received for the pittsburg lands? i think for a far more inadequate price. we can not acquire an acre of land under this bill until the geological survey has made a report that it will serve to maintain the navigability of a navigable river and until we show that affirmatively not a dollar can be used. why. every man who was a member of the sixtieth congress knows that we voted to purchase a forest reservationthe calaveras grove. in californiawhich was in private ownership. if it is proper to do this in the west. is it improper to do it in the south and east? why. the gentleman from kansas gave you certain alleged facts about the merrimac river and certain conclusions by army engineers based upon these facts. those conclusions will fail when you know that the statement of facts is entirely unfounded. he would have you believe that there was general deforestation many years ago at the headwaters of the merrimac. but that in recent years that region has been reforested. why. the greatest clean cutting in timber lands in all new england has been going on for the last ten or fifteen years at the headwaters of the merrimac in lincoln and woodstock. another thing which the gentleman did not mention. on the merrimac river there is one of the largest lakes in all new england. and this great reservoir can be drawn upon during the summer months to aid in maintaining. the flow of the river. the gentleman speaks about the connecticut river and the report of the army engineers. let me read to you what mr. goodrich. general manager of the new york and hartford transportation company. says about the effect of deforestation upon the flow of the connecticut river. for forty years he has been engaged in marine commerce on that riyer. handling at the present time more than 40 vessels of from 500 to 5.000 tons register. he has had every occasion to watch the flow of that river closely. and he says in his testimony before the agricultural committee: i remember the time when our river. forty years ago. reached its highwater season and continued it away along until the middle of june. when the common inquiry was. how much snow is there left in the forests in the white mountains in new hampshire? we could depend in those years on operating without difficulty from low water until about the. 15th of june. in the last twenty years. and right down to the present time. in an aggravated way. the length of highwater flow in spring has been exceedingly shortened. starting in march. freshet after freshet comes with an immense waste of water. and by the 20th of may. instead of the 15th of june. navigation is impeded. the people of new england. generally. are not taking an intense interest in the postal savingsbank bill or in the railroad bill. their chief interest at this time is in conservation measures. and to them far and away the most important of these measures is the weeks bill. in my opinion. that bill excites more interest in new england than all other measures pending in congress. the legislatures of several new england states have memorialized congress in behalf of a white mountain forest reserve. and the people of new england are united and enthusiastic in its support every new england state except rhode island has a direct interest in the proposition. for into or along the borders of every one of these states flow the rivers rising in the white mountain region. while rhode island has not the peculiar interest in the matter which other new england states have. its people are strongly for the bill. realizing as they do the many indirect advantages they wil derive from such a measure. year after year governors of the new england states and many prominent citizens have appeared before the committee on agriculture to urge the passage of such legislation. i believe that new england congressmen get 10 letters favoring this proposition to every 1 they get regarding any other bill before congress. the question of the constitutional power of congress to purchase lands in the states for the establishment of a forest reserve has been passed upon by the house committee on the judiciary. and the power of the federal government to purchase such lands as will directly aid in maintaining the navigability of navigable .streams has been fully sustained. practically all the principal rivers of new england have their source or the source of their most important tributaries in the white mountains. and their value for all purposes depends to a great extent upon the preservation of the forests in which they rise. these rivers are all navigable streams at the present time. and in 1905 more than a million tons of freight were transported on these rivers. in the days before the railroads they were used to a much greater extent than now. and in the coming years it is hoped and believed that they will be so improved that under modern conditions they will be most valuable and important avenues of commerce. the extent to which they are now used for the purpose of navigation is not the true test of their value for that purpose. they are capable of great development along that line. and that development is certain to come. for the future growth of new england is largely dependent upon cheap methods of transportation. if as an aid to navigation on these rivers we may constitutionally and properly appropriate money to preserve the forests about their headwaters. may we not also give a thought to the enormous incidentil advantages which will necessarily follow the establishment of such reserves? surely it will not be contended that the fact that there will be great indirect benefit from such a policy is an argument against it. no lands can be acquired under the provisions of this bill unless it is shown to a government commission that they will directly aid in maintaining the navigability of navigable rivers. but if. as a necessary incident of such constitutional and proper expenditure of money. great advantages accrue to toe people or many 6tates on account of the preservation of water power upon which millions of our people depend for their livelihood. and the forests are conserved. saved from speedy destruction. and so managed that the supply of timber may be made permanent and adequate for the wants of the eastern section of the country. surely no one will suggest that these great incidental advantages constitute an argument against the proposition. a very distinguished member of the committee on the judiciary. in a draft of a report sustaining the constitutionality of the bill. says: it can not be seriously argued that because congress in aiding navigation will at the same time produce other beneficent results that congress has no power to aid navigation. the control and regulation of the flow of water in a stream would undoubtedly improve the value of the water power on such stream. but it would to a greater extent improve the navigability of the streams. * * * must congress be denied its undoubted power to improve and preserve the navigability of navigable streams because in so doing there will be other benelicial results- congress has never made an appropriation for any public improvement in any community. whether for harbor improvements or buildings. that has not resulted in benefiting the community in many i ways. end yet the appropriation has always been justified because intended for a distinct constitutional purpose. the incidental benefits in other directions that have followed have never stood in the way of an appropriation for a legitimate end. every federal forest reserve in this country. except the one at the headwaters of the mississippi. is located.west of that river. every argument in favor of reserves in the west applies with at least equal forcei think with greater forceto thereserves in new hampshire and the southern appalachians. whatever criticisms. caused by the peculiar conditions. there may be in the west of.the policy of creating forest reserves. conditions in the east. where we desire such reserves. are such that none of those criticisms will apply. nothing but good as the result of such a policy will come to any single person in the east. in the east their establishment will meet with universal approval. the policy of creating forest reserves is a new policy in this country. initiated less than a score of years ago. but in the .west is time goes on and asthe true conditions surrounding .each reserve come to be fully understood such errors of management which now exist and which now seem to some so serious will be corrected. and the wisdom and incalculable benefit of this great policy will be demonstrated to all men. i am confirmed in this belief by what congressman martin. of south dakota. one of the best and most levelheaded members of the fiftyninth congress. and who lives very near the black hills forest reserve. one of the oldest reserves in the system. said in a speech a few years ago. he said that when the black hills forest reserve was established you could find scarcely one nman in a thousand who was not opposed to the idea. but so successful had been the working out of the idea that he challenged anyone to find. now one man in a thousand in that vicinity who (lid not recognize its great benefits. and he said that it was a noticeable fact that the senators and representatives who were objecting to the forestreserves movement came from states where the reserves had been very recently established. president roosevelt in his annual message to congress in december. 1906. after stating that no government policy for the betterment of our internal conditions had been more fruitful of good than the national policy of irrigation and forest preservation. strongly recommended to congress an appropriation for the establishment of the white mountain and southern appalachian forest reserves. president taft in his conservation message urged the passage of the weeks bill. if we are to * have forest reserves anywhere in this country. i submit that one including the white mountains is as pressing. is as important. and will be as beneficial in its results as any that have been or can be established. of course it is true that the existing forest reserves were not purchased by a direct appropriation from the treasury. but were set apart from lands owned by the government. what difference does it make. however. to the taxpayers of this country whether money is taken from the treasury or government property easily convertible into money. and which. if sold. would inure to the benefit of all the people of the country. is taken? whether for any purpose you take money out of the treasury or keep money from going into the treasury by appropriating property the avails of which would go into it. the result. so far as it applies to the financial condition of the country. is just the same. it is not certain that it would not have been better economy for the government to purchase such lands by direct appropriation from the treasury than to secure lands of private owners for forest reserves by allowing such owners to exchange their lands for other lands of like character owned by the government. i have an impression that in some cases it would have been far better. far more economical. for the government to have purchased such lands outright than to have made such an exchange. the country. i take it. is definitely committed to the policy of establishing forest reserves. it can not be that this policy is to be a sectional one. that only in the west is this wise policy to be carried out. and that the south and east are to have no share in its manifold blessings. the people of the east and south. in a spirit truly national. are glad to aid the movement for reclamation of arid lands in the far west at the direct or indirect expense of the general government and for the establisiment of forest reserves. but we believe that the forestreserve policy should be national in its scope. nowhere in this broad land of ours is there more pressing need of forest reserves than in the southern appalachian mountains and the white mountains of new hampshire. you in the far west have a reclamation fund of many millions. which would have all been in the federal treasury for the benefit of all the states but for the policy which turns over all this for the direct and peculiar benefit of the people of a few western states. it is a good policy. we all approve it. when you aid one section of the country. you. to some extent. aid all sections. but it is not gracious. to say the least. for members from such states to oppose every )roposition looking to the conservation of the natural resources of the east. in the united states it is estimated that there are 700.000000 acres of wooded area. of this amount 170.000.000. or more than oiiefifth. are in national forest reserves. these reserves are worth at least $1.500.000.000. and. with the single exception of a small reserve in minnesota. are west of the mississippi river. we are asking for an appropriation which. during the ten years to which it is limited. calls in all for less than 1 per cent of this amount for reserves east of the mississippi river. where we feel the imperative need of forest reserves far more than you in the west. nearly or quite onehalf of all the standing tinl)er of tfis country is on the pacific slope. it was stated in an editorial.in the new york evening post a few years ago that the rivers flowing into the pacific have their headwaters protected by vast tracts of forests preserved from indiscriminate lumbering. but those flowing into the atlantic. though their present commercial use is tenfold greater. rise in regions where the commercial lumberman generally has full sway. millions of dollars could be dispensed with in every river and harbor bill but for the fact that rivers and harbors. year by year. are filled up by silt brought down by freshets from the deforested slopes of mountain ranges. the most economical way in the world to preserve the navigability of your rivers is to preserve your mountain forests. how can any reasonable man insist tlat it is a constitutional. proper. and wise expenditure of money from the federal treasury to continually dredge the rivers and harbors located in the various states to remove the silt carried down by the floods caused largely by the destruction of the forests. and unconstitutional. improper. and unwise to appropriate money from the federal treasury to keep the silt from going into the rivers by establishing forest reserves which will. to a great extent. prevent these floods? proper to dredge out a chanul. but improper to prevent its filling up again! the mere statement of such a proposition refutes it. will the eastern forest reserves pay? will it be a wise investment. regarded purely as a business proposition? unquestionably. the german state forests return a net revenue of $2.40 per acre a year and the swiss forests $8 per acre. no expenditure from the federal treasury at the present time will produce so certain and ample a revenue in the end as investmients for the establishment of forest reserves. the time is not far distant when the forest reserves should be in condition to return a very large net income. a royal commission in great j13ritain has recently made a report on the question of creating national forest reserves. it is proposed to create. by complete reforestation. reserves embracing 15.000.000 acres. the work is to go on at the rate of 250.000 acres each year for sixty years. and it is estimated that at the end of eighty years the forests would return a net annual revenue of $9.73 per acresomewhat. but not much. more than the actual return today of the forests of saxony. great britain must create these forest reserves from seedlings. and hence the time is long before there will be much revenue. in this country we have our forests. and good management of them and a comparatively small amount of tree planting will give us a large net revenue in a comlaratively short time. because of the time element involved in the growth of trees. private ownership of forest lands has proved wasteful and destructive. private owners must cut. in view of the revenue. in their day. and there is little or no inducement for them to attempt to reforest. the investment is for too long a period to be profitable for private capital. only the government can undertake this work. the lumbermen can not afford to practice the rules of forestry possible. and. in the long run profitable. to the government. in 1894 an examination of the growth of spruce in the white mountain region xas made under the direction of doctor fernow. the celebrated forestry expert. his report established the fact tlt at that time the finest spruce forests in the world were in that section. in those forests the spruce is the dominant tree. and nowhere is the stand heavier. while for size and quality the report states that nowhere else are seen such spruce trees as those which grow in the valley of the ammonoosuc. it is doubtful if anywhere else is the growth so rapid. it was found that the annual average accretion in the virgin growth in those spruce forests was 20 cubic feet per acre. this was the result of natures unaided efforts. the governmeat management of the spruce forests of europe. with a judicious system of cutting the mature trees. has shown that this accretion can be very greatly increased. in a wellmanaged european forest it was found that there were nearly three times as many spruce trees per acre as in a virgin and natural growth. and that they grew twice as fast. doctor fernow states.that a wellmanaged forest would produce an annual average growth per acre of 100 cubic feet for wood over 3 inches and over 50 cubic feet for saw timber. an amount from three to five times the amount which our virgin woods would produce. doctor fernow also states: government ownership and control of forests in europe has shown that the production per acre can be very greatly increased without destroying the immature trees or reducing the permanent value of the forests. one hundred years ago germany found herself with her forest resources nearly exhausted and facing a wood famine. and then she accepted the policy of government forest reserves. and under her scientific management of the national reserves and her regulation of the cutting on private lands germany in the last seventyfive years has increased the average acre production more than threefold. in saxony in the last eighty years the average cut per acre has been increased 50 per cent. and in 1904 amounted to 93 cubic feet per acre. why does new hampshire ask for federal aid? why does not she establish the white mountain forest reserve and pay the bills? new hampshire is a small and comparatively poor state. and the undertaking is too large. do you ask other states where rivers are being improved. or forest reserves are being created. or arid lands are being reclaimed. to pay the bills? there is no earthly reason why new hampshire should undertake a work at her own expense which wiu benefit the people of other states far more than it will benefit her own people.. this is an interstate. a national. proposition if ever there was one. senator brandecee in his report on the forestry bill. in speaking of this matter. says: new hampshire owns no public lands. the rivers which have their origin within her borders contribute more largely to the prosperity of other states than to hers. she ought not to be expected to burden herself with debt for the benefit of her neighbors. nor can they be expected to purchase lands outside their own borders for the creation of a forest reserve. the connecticut. for example. is vastly more important. economically. to the states of vermont. massachusetts. and connecticut. but none of these states can rightfully be asked to contribute money to be invested entirely within a sister state. no state in the union is doing more in proportion to its population and its wealth in making public improvements than the state of new hampshire. thelast legislature authorized the issue of bonds to the amount of several million dollars for state roads. bonds have been sold. and the. work is under way. the state has taken over many mountain roads.and will maintain them by expenditures from the state treasury. we have a system of forestfire patrol. and the state will aid to the extent of its ability in establishing and maintaining a forest reserve. it is unjust and unfair to suggest that the effort being made to secure the passage of this bill is an effort to sell worthless lands to the united states. to aid the owners of such lands to dispose of them. i do not believe that a single member of congress has ever heard from a landowner in new hampshire who wished to dispose of his lands under the provisions of this bill. the demand for this legislation does not come from the landowners. it comes from governors of states. from the unanimous action of state legislatures. from chambers of commerce and boirds of trade. from navigation companies. and from all the people. is it a valid objection to the bill that the lands to be acquired for a useful and constitutional purpose are beautiful? if. as a necessary incident. beautiful natural scenery is preserved. will anyone oppose the bill on that ground? i am .not ashamed to say that any movement for the preservation of beautiful scenery appeals to me. while material. business. national considerations make the establishment of the white mountain reserve an imperative duty. the natural beauties of that wonderful scenic region. within less than a days ride of 10.000.000 people. have a value not to be overlooked and despised. all lovers of the beautiful in nature have an interest in the preservation of the white mountain country just as much as they have in the preservation of the yellowstone or the yosemite. .while nature may be grander there. nowhere. i venture to say. is she lovelier than in this section we seek to save. all are priceless assets of all the people which will yield a revenue for all time. not to be measured in dollars and cents. but in souls uplifted and in countless lives made happier."},{"1":"1909","2":"TILLMAN","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"while we are endeavoring to shut off this flood of claims i

of him i speak in no disparagement. because his candidacy was not one in which his personal strength was the test. his weakness was the weakness of the reactionary. it was the weakness of a general who was leading toward the rear and not toward the front. when mr. parker ran in idaho he polled only twothirds as many votes as mr. bryan had polled four years before. coming now to the state of

feel that i would be lax in my duty to the people of the state that i in part represent. and who i know are intensely interested in this legislation. did i not call the attention of the house to this measure. now on the calendar. and known as the \"appalachian and white mountain forest reserve bill.\" this measure. proposed by the american forestry association and the national board of trade was recommended in the presidents message and has been repeatedly indorsed by the department of agriculture and advocated by the press of the country. in the first session of this congress this bill passed the. senate. and on may 22. 1906. was unanimously reported to this house by its committee on agriculture. this legislation. mr. chairman. in my judgment. is of more pressing and vital interest and importance to the thirteen .states whose rivers rise in the appalachian and white wountains than any that has been considered during this session pf congress. and in consequence is of interest to the entire country. it only carries out wellestablished principles and does not commit the government to any new policy. one is so overwhelmed with the multitude of general and special bills pending that it falls upon those. as it rightfully should. who have for special reasons. responsive to the needs of their constituencies. to be particularly interested in certain legislation to single that out and call it to the attention of the entire body and urge its favorable consideration. president roosevelt. in his message at the convening of this session of congress. in referring to the government forest reserves. said: the forests of the white mountains and southern appalachian regions should also be preserved. and they can not be unless the people of the states in which they lie. through their representatives in congress. secure vigorous action by the national government. mr. chairman. the particular branch of the national government which at present needs to move is this house. all others have done their full duty. this billcarries an appropriation of $3.000.000 and gives the secretary of agriculture the discretion to purchase such lands as may be readily acquired. and such as will be the best adapted to the purpose. the fact that the bill carries an appropriation ought not of itself to prevent recognition for its consideration by this house or militate against its passage if the proposition is in the interest of a wise economy and is right and just. mr. chairman. when the other legislative branch has passed a measure i assume that no conclusive presumption exists per se that it has not had fair consideration by that body and its committees. especially so when the same proposition is considered and recommended by a great and painstaking committee of this house abundant precedent can be found for this legislation. millions of dollars have already been appropriated. and doubtless wisely spent. in the reclamation service. we have just appropriated over $80.000.000 for the improvement of our rivers and harbors. and there are now established and maintained by the federal government 138 forest reserves in seventeen different states. and territories of the union. covering an area of 127.154.371 acres. one is too apt to think of the forests either as a matter of sentiment or as something that has no end. and hence no need of protection. yet. governors of states. legislatures. numerous commercial bodies. many granges. and large numbers of other organizations and individuals have prayed. petitioned. and resolved for the passage of this bill. i believe that the country would have but little sympathy with the argument that the machinery of this house would \"have to be overworked. as has been said. to secure a vote upon this measure. what the country would be especially concerned about. i take it. is whether the bill is right in principle and would in its result promote the general welfare. a prima facie case at least. for its consideration has been made out when two presidents have urged the favorable consideration. the senate has passed the bill in three different sessions. and the committee on agriculture have unanimously recommended its passage. is it not at least worthy of some consideration by this body. directly responsible to the people? all that is asked is that this measure be fairly brought before this house for a vote. mr. chairman. speaking for a constituency that is vitally iliterested in this measure. responsible directly to that constituency for my course. i ask for its consideration. in the belief that the necessity and the wisdom of the enactment of the bill will appeal to the judgment and patriotism of the members of this body.. it ought not to be necessary to plead for the consideration of a measure of this importance. whose effect is so farreaching. it almost seems needless and perhaps futile to give any extended reasons for the passage of this bill. for the wisdom of establishing these reserves has been so clearly demonstrated by actual test. not only by this country. but for years by other nations who were long ago compelled to recognize the necessity of supervision and control of their forests. as to challenge contradiction. our supply of gold may diminish and our real wealth not decrease. but not so with our forests and all they do to conserve other natural forces necessary to our commercial life. the connecticut river. which is 375 miles long and drains a basin of 677.178acres in area. is absolutely dependent for its regulation upon the preservation of the forests of new hampshire. as provided in this bill the committee. in making its report upon this bill. says: the connecticut. speaking only of the main river. has a total of 2.038 feet and is capable of being rendered one of the most valuable rivers in the world. and quoting another authority: \"the power developed at holyoke. mass.. is the largest in the country. except that at niagara.\" it is no wonder that this bill now on the calendar has challenged the attention and won the approval of many not directly affected by its result. it offers the only means of protecting the territory covered by its provisions from the dire consequences of a deforested land. already 24 per cent of the southern appalachian region has lost the power to produce future forests. and in this section the rainfall is heavier than anywhere else on the continent. except on the northern pacific coast* thenew york evening post. in an editorial in its issue of december 28. 1906. says: the rivers flowing into the pacific have their headwaters protected by vast tracts of forest preserved from indiscriminate lumbering. those flowing into the atlantic. though their present commercial use is tenfold greater. rise in regions where the commercial lumberman generally has full sway. as the senate committee reported last year. the new hampshire rivers \" contribute more largely to the prosperity of other states than to hers. she ought not to be expected to burden herself with debt for the benefit of her neighbors. nor can they be expected to purchase land outside their own borders for the creation of a forest reserve.\" and. further. the same article in the new york evening post adopts the language of the committee report in speaking for the appalachian reserve. and says: the. various states in which it is proposed to locate this reserve have already by legislative acts conferred upon the united states government the right to acquire title to these lands and exempted them from taxation. they can not. because of the proposed location of the reserve in more than one state and their own lack of fundsi be expected to go muchfurther. and the post closes its editorial by saying: state- cooperation is thus assured. and the project simply waits upon congress. all that has ever been urged in favor of a forest reserve. either on the floor of this house or elsewhere. can be said in support of this bill. for it affects a locality which is the most thickly settled in the union and one where the natural resources are most dependent upon the preservation of the forests. in new hampshire. where the proposed white mountain reserve is located. are the sources of all the principal rivers of new england. in 1900. in the state of new hampshire. there was cut 177 board feet per acre of wooded area. which was the largest cut per acre recorded in any state in the union. in the section covered in this bill there are no public lands. in 1878 a law was passed by which tile president was authorized to set aside \" any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth. whether of commercial value or not. is public reservations. and the president shall by public iproclamation declare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof.\" under this provision of law the forest reserves have been heretofore set aside. the department does not intend to reforest this section. the preservation of the present forest lands is. particularly ili the case of the white mountain reserve. in tie interests of states which own no land where the forests are located. thlis apl)ropriation creates nothing. it preserves. and can not be regarded as all expenditure. but rather an investment which will yield a.revenue to the federal governinent. thie secretary of agriculture estimates that in five years the department of forestry will cost the taxpayer hothing. it is estimated that the standing timber now on the governinent reserves is worth $700.000.000 and that the entire property is worth $1.400.000.000. last year the receipts from these reserves amounted to $1.125.000. the province of ointario derives a revenue of over $3.000.000 annually from its forest lands. tile net annual revenue from this source in france amounts to about $59.000.000. and swiss forests yield a revenue of $8 an acre a year. at present there is but one forest reserve cast of the dakotas and none east of the mississippi. the danger of a dearth of forests is increasing in a greater proportion than our population. though steel has displaced wood for many uses. for fencing and shipbuilding. and though cement is displacing wood for building. and coal and gas for heating. still the uses of wood increase. it is estimated that during the last forty years the consumplion of wood has increased at the rate of from 3 to 5 per cent a year. today we have no knowledge of the amount of timber consumed annually. it is easy to point to uses made of wood that were unknown only a few years ago. the demands of the country for steamrailroad extension. with the increase of lecirie lines giving a cheaper form of power. telegraph and telephone eomnnication. with tile woodpulp mills. furnish a fitling illustration of the present day draft upon this article of commerce. j. t. richards. chief engineer of the pennsylvania railroad system. says. in speaking on this subject: many of the former sources of supply have been already exhausted. our pennsylvania roads now look chiefly to inland virginia. west virginia. and kentucky for our whiteoak ties. and the longleaf yellow pine of the southern states will soon disappear. the governlnent forester says. with reference to the necessity of taking hold of this matter in time. thatforest lands are passing out of the governments ownership every day. lands whose preservation is absolutely essential to the wellbeing of the country where they lie. it will eventually cost the government of the united states hundreds of millions of dollars to become possessed again of the areas which it once held. which are now in private ownership. and which are absolutely essential to the welfare of all of us. statistics can not be secured of the damage by flood and freshet caused by the indiscriminate cutting and depletion of our forests and the denuding of our forest lands. in the southern appalachian region alone. from april. 1901. to april. 1902. floods did a damage estimated at $18.000.000. the flow of all our rivers are dependent upon the conserving of the waters at their sources. a river is a nuisance rather than an advantage if its flow is to be spasmodic. we ought at least to be assured that it will furnish something more than freshets. to reach tile full measure of usefulness intended by nature and essential to the commercial and material well being of the country. these rivers must be regulated in their flow and not intermittent. the falling of the leaves from the trees form a sponge which insures a wellregulated flow such as nothing else can furnish. the cupidity of man is such that the present generation would strip our forests without regard to those who might come after. it has been said that \" it is the traditional policy of consumers of lumber and timber to ignore the possibility of the exhaustion of the timber supply. and invariably they fail to realize the fact until it has already taken place.\" forests are peculiar in that they are all agency in place of which nothing can be substituted. with the great growth of our country the former wasteful methods of our lumbermen must stop. our responsibility does not cease with providing for the present needs. . am not unmindful of the force of the argument that what this bill seeks to accomplish could in some measure be accomplished by the several states. and i am not one that wants to see all the power of the state surrendered to the federal goveminentwith a consequentdiminution of -the -states -responsibility in tile government.- but we have passed many measures and provided for many conditions that the states might have legislated upon. there is. however. a forestry department il my own state and a forest reserve. trees are being planted. intelligent supervision exercised. a system of fire protection initiated. advice and cooperation given by the state forester to private individuals interested in preserving their own forest lands. and my state. alive to the necessity of such action. is doing its full duty to the extent of its power and ability. a plan is now being inaugurated in connecticut to extend its present reserves. so that there .will be established a forest reserve in each county in the state. it is to the credit of the foresight of many states that state reserves have been established. and the enactment of this bill does in no measure take away from the states responsibility. the work of the federal government in this particular needs to be augmented by the states. it is not within the power of the thirteen states directly affected by this bill to control the sources of the principal rivers running through them. and the accomplishment of the purposes of this measure can not be secured except by its enactment into law. it is not an experiment. it is not a scheme. it preserves for future generations a necessity. and favorable action should be taken now to insure the full measure of benefit."},{"1":"1906","2":"CLAPP","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"it might be said. i think. without any qualification. that the use

it strikes me. to be used there. if the word \"documentary\" is too technical. perhaps the word \"written\" might answer the purpose. they claim that. they made application by letter. which they

impossible for them to restore said banks by a local taxation. in some of the counties they have issued levy scrip to improve the river. but there are localities where the benefit district is so small that they can not bear the burden. all i ask is that you appropriate $500.000. so as to restore the banks to the condition they were in prior to that great flood. as they are now. any ordinary spring rise of water will come over the banks and destroy the property. i venture to say. gentlemen of the house. that if the house had been in session when that flood of 1903 occurred this house would have

whom we are associated. there are always those to whom we are peculiarly attracted. with whom it is an especial pleasure to be. who seem in some way to belong to us and we to them. these we hold as friends. in the morning of that day which we call life. the angel of. death. with noiseless footstep. steals among a group of merry children and bears away the one whom we most love. while we stand by wondering. afraid. and lonely. without our little friend school is a dreary. cheerless place. we fail in lessons that we knew. because our thoughts are far away. nor have we heart for play. a shadow falls on every game and robs it of its sport. and every tree and field and brook reminds us of our loneliness. but sorrow does not long weigh down the buoyant. elastic spirit of a child. and so. after a while. some one else slips into the vacant place. and life is glad again. years pass. it is the noontime of lifes day. again the unwelcome angel comes and bears beyond our touch and ken our best belnywd friend. the pain is keen. the wound deep. we are restless. and listlessly we take up our round of duties. the charm and zest have fled. to us the sky seems ever gray. and the glad sunshine to have gone forever. yet this also is a period of elasticity. of ceaseless. virile activity. a period of many interests. so here too. after a time. there is a rebound. do we forget? ah. no! this friendship becomes a sweet. a treasured memory. whose impress we bear through all the years to come. time hurries on. we reach the afternoon of life and feel ourselves. though all reluctantly. nearing the twilight. we are more slow than once we were to take on new friendships. but time and the experience of life have given depth and strength to those already formed. nor do we here escape the visit of the angel. indeed. he comes more frequently than in the years gone by and bears away those whom we cherish. but into the place of the friend whom death takes from us no new one enters. we are more lonely than we were in childhood or in earlier manhood. more full of yearning. yet is there no vacant place in our heart. for the inspiration of the personality of him whose form has vanished. whose voice is hushed. lives with us still to bless us. within a few brief years. thrice has the angel come and borne away. beyond the dark. mysterious borderland. into that fair country where \"there shall be no more death. neither sorrow. nor crying. neither shall there be any more pain.\" those whom i have had the honor to claim as friendsmen of noble heart. of breadth of view. of poise of character. whose minds were masterful. whose loyalty knew \"no variableness. neither shadow of turning.\"men great in achievement. who charmed alike the imagination and the hearthobart. mckinley. hanna. and it is to honor the memory of the last of this noble trio. marcus a. hanna. that we are thus met today. when. on the evening of the 15th of february. representatives of the press called upon me and asked for some expression of opinion regarding senator hanna. i said: gentlemen you must excuse me tonight. as well might you ask me to speak concerning the loss of some dear member of my own household. as to speak at such a time of him whom i have so loved. all that day i had remained near the room in which he lay ill. hope struggling within me against despair. despair against hope. hope finally yielding to despair. when the word came that to the last grim enemy the great. strong will of the otherwise -unconquerable hanna had bended. and i stood face to face with the ct that the spirit of this brave. true man had gone to return no more forever. grief and desolation filled my heart. he was a man made to be loved. and he was loved. today the world seems lonesome without him. i miss his kindly face. his cordial hand clasp. his genial companionship. his helpful counsel. sometimes. indeed. it seems as if the very sunshine itself were not so bright and warm as once it was. i speak because \"he was my friend. faithful and just to me.\" because i loved him. because his friendship was one of the priceless blessings of my life. and. finally. because to keep silent on this day set apart to do him reverence would seem to savor of disloyalty. not that i can add aught to the rich meed of welldeserved praise that has been accorded him during these weeks that have gone. i have no gift of eloquence with which to grace a splendid eulogy. mine is but the simple tribute of a frienda friend who knows no words commensurate with the mighty flood of feeling that surges through his breast. those happier in tt~e use of words than 1. fellowsenatorsthe orators of this honorable bodyothers brilliant and- distinguished in public life. ministers of the gospel. the press. political and various civic organizations. have paid him noble tribute. and yet has he indeed need of these? are not his own life and character his most eloquent eulogy? \"nature herself will have no great things hastily formed. in the direct path to all bautiful and conspicuous achievement she heaps up difficulty.\" said rufus choate. and we have learned. each for himself. only too well the cost of even moderate achievement. we have learned also the cost of loyaltyespecially the cost of loyalty in political life. when we remember. therefore. how preeminently senator hanna succeeded in every field that engaged his interest and to which lie gave his endeavor. when we remember his unswerving loyalty to every cause that he espoused. to every promise that he made. to every friend that he had. we begin to appreciate how phenomenal he was. the president of perhaps the most powerful railroad system in the united states remarked some months ago that. in the several conversations which it had been his privilege to have with senator hanna. he was struck with his comprehensive grasp of subjects to which. it might very naturally have been supposed. he had had but little opportunity to give much consideration. and that touching the question of transportation. for. example. to which day after day and year after year he himself gave his serious thoughtwhich. indeed. was his life studyhe had never talked with senator hanna without receiving some new idea a r some original and valuable suggestion. his political life was inseparably connected with that of our late beloved president. william mckinley. for many years le apri 7. had been a warm admirer of mckinley and had supported him with all the ardor of a true friend in his political advancement. when. the memorable campaign of 1896 drew near. the demand for mckinley as the candidate of the republican party became widespread and insistent. his long and honorable career in the national congress and as governor of ohio made him the logical candidate of the party. the country had just passed through a period of disastrous business depression.and financial interests were in a chaotic and demoralized condition. mckinley was the personification of the american policy of protection. and was heralded as the advance agent of prosperity.\" at this juncture there appeared on the horizon a star previously unknown to the political world. it flashed forth through the mists of obscurity with the brilliancy of a meteor. fixed itself in the firmament of political activity. and became the guiding star of the republican hosts. as a political manager mr. hanna was an unknown quantity. and wise men shook their heads with doubt and fear at the sudden ascendency of this new moses of the party. many gave utterance to expressions of deprecation. but his friends knew him and trusted him. mr. hanna. as i have said. was comparatively unknown in politics. he had never been a national character in the councils of his party. but he was a man whose name had been linked with success in every field to which his energies had hitherto been directed. he addressed himself to this new responsibility with characteristic determination and zeal. and more than fulfilled the expectations of his friends. his name became a household word the country over. his great natural ability. coupled with his long and successful experience in the world of affairs. fitted him for his new task and enabled him to master its every detail with a thoroughness and an understanding that gave confidence to those associated with him and excited the wonder and admiration of even his closest friends. his methods were original. and his directness fascinated his political opponents and compelled their respect. he was the right man in the right place. the splendor of the victory of 1896. following. as it did. one of the fiercest political campaigns the nation had ever experienced. demonstrated that there had been no error in the choice of a leader. and proved that those who placed their faith in mr. hanna knew in whom they trusted. it won for him the unbounded confidence of the country at large and made the second decisive victory. gained by the republican partyin 1900 through his wise and conservative leadership. but the realization of general expectation. great as these victories were. however. to mr. hanna. they brought something of bitterness. his position as chairman of the republican national committee made him the target for the most merciless criticism. the most venomous abuse. as the strife grew more heated. the rival campaign orators and newspapers became more and more inflamed. and. in some instances. all sense of political fairness and of respect for the personal feelings of men seemed to be lost."},{"1":"1903","2":"NEWELL","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"NA","6":"the usual summer supply is entirely employed. and there is nowi call attention to thisand there is now a considerable acreage under cultivation for which there is not a sufficient supply of water in all seasons. tho spring flowthe floodsin large part go to waste. and water storage is absolutely essential to the future development of the territory. irrigation. as it appears from this testimony and as it appears from the agricultural development and history of the country and from the census report. is now at a standstill and has attained its limit. the irrigation is confined to these few streams that professor newell referred to. there is some irrigation in the verde river valley near prescott. there is some irrigation in the salt river valley near phoenix. and some in the san pedro valley near florence. and some near yuma. and some on the gila river. i read from a report here which enumerates the different basins that it is possible to irrigate: notable among these are the basins of the gila. the salt. the san pedro. the santa cruz. the verde. bill williams fork. and the hassayampa rivers. the gila being supplied from the larfgest and most extensive watershed is in consequence the most important of a streams lying wholly or almost wholly in the territory. nearly all other streams mentioned are tributary directly or indirectly to the gila. and have each irrigated areas of their own. on all can be found available reservoir sites eventually to be used. under the law. for the reclamation of the arid lands tributary thereto. if you look at the map of arizona. you will find how far apart these different localities are. you will find how far the salt river irrigated area and valley is from the verde river. and the xxxvi32 latter from the pecos river. and that again from the gila river. it is these few little valleys which have been irrigated. with their population. and with the population of some mining camps and mining towns. which constitute practically the population of arizona. in reference to the matter of water supply and irrigation. i ask leave to refer to certain testimony that was taken by the committee which is germane and has an important bearing on this question. the testimony of henry hartin: q. what was the nature of the occupation of the people out in the country districts which you enumerated? a. why. mining and stock raising. and a little agriculture. q. where was the agriculture carried on? a. down on the verde. about the head of the verde valley. along the river. q. they worked the valley along the river? a. yes. sir. q. have you been pretty well over the territory? a. no. sir. i have heen pretty well over yavapai county. but not over the territory. q. how far was the irrigation taken from the river in the verde valley. of which you spoke? a. not at all. it was just along the bed of the river. by senator hzitfemnd: q how wide is the valley? ait was not quite a quarter of a mile. it was not. at the widest place. a quarter of a mhile wide. i read from the testimony of mr. sloan. he states. on page 124: we have had for a series of years a remarkable shortage of water. and for that reason the farmers have notprospered as they did in former years. the amount of land that can be utilized is practically unlimited. the water necessarily is limited. the rainfall is not such as to afford sufficient water for all the land in the salt river valley. however there are possibilities for the storage of water which will be completed. i those works which are now contemplated are completed. that willadd many thousands of acres to cultivation. this is the testimony of mr. heard. one of the waterstorage commissioners: q. in what portions of the territory which you have nhmed are there irrigation works actually in operation? a. the principal irrigation in the territory is in this valley and in the upper gila valley. an there is also quite a small irrigated section just south of tucson. and there is a splendid irrigated section in the gila valley. about 0.000 acres. q. how much would you say at the present time is actually under

investment advisers modernization act. this bill makes longawaited and sensible changes to the 76yearold investment advisers act. h.r. 5424 also streamlines requirements for private equity funds and sophisticated investors in private equity funds. as i said on the floor yesterday. there should be no room for regulation that serves only to appease bureaucratic demands. capital should be used to create jobs and further growth. not fulfill meaningless and unproductive regulatory requirements. private equity plays a vital role in our economy. i have seen it firsthand in my district and across missouri. and hope my colleagues recognize that private equity is responsible for saving and creating jobs in each of their congressional districts. capital is the lifeblood of businesses. at a time when investment returns are down and options are limited. when investment advice is more expensive and may soon be out of reach for many americans. and when our economy continues to stagnate. we need to take measured steps to streamline regulations and free equity. that is the way you fuel an economic recovery. this bill came to us from constituents who we have been listening to during all of the different times that we go home and talk to them. they said these are the rules and regulations that are strangling their ability to do business. the ranking member just talked about a shadow banking

5424 will make modest but meaningful changes to existing law. this is a bipartisan bill that received support from the majority of the minority during the financial services committee markup. it is legislation that merits support from all my colleagues. and that is because h.r. 5424 is about modernization. capital formation and. ultimately. american jobs. i ask my colleagues to join me in

americans workingand i emphasize \"working\"-their way out of poverty. too many americans work hard. play by the rules. take responsibility for their lives. but simply cant get ahead. they are in lowwage jobssometimes two lowwage jobsand dont really have much opportunity where they live or due to their circumstances to get a job that pays closer to a living wage. there are millions of americans living in this situation. the eitc helps provide for their children. to build economic security to allow them to pursue the american dream. signed into law in 1975. expanded by every single president since then. the eitc was created to make sure we have a tax system that provides an incentive to work. that is what it has done. eitcs expansion in the 1990s led more than half a million single mothers to move from cash welfare assistance to work. making it twice as effectivewithout the side effects. i might addas welfare reform. since its creation. eitc has lifted more children above the poverty line than any other government program. i will emphasize that it rewards work. most importantly. in 2012. 28 million american householdsalmost 1 million from my state of ohiobenefited from the eitc with an average credit of more than $2.300. i met juanalicia duran in cleveland last year. she told me she lives paycheck to paycheck not because she overspends. not because she is irresponsible. but simply because she does not make a lot of money. she said receiving the eitc is the one time of year she pays off her bills. she is barely making it. getting a little bit behind week after week. month after month. then she gets that check ofi dont know how much juanalicia duran gets. but on average she gets a check for a little over $2.000. it helps her to pay her bills and maybe get a little bit ahead. rosa olea of toledo works as a manager of a fast food restaurant and makes $9.35 an hour. imagine thata manager of a restaurant making $9.35 an hour. she said her family struggles to pay bills. the eitc has been a lifesaver since she found out about it through her local vita center. there are thousands of stories like this. and we hear hundreds and sometimes thousands of them from ohioans. in last weeks state of the union address. president obama laid out plans to reform the tax code by making the current earnedincome tax credit and child tax credit permanent by expanding credit for middleclass families to raise children and save for retirement. some in this town respondednot surprisinglyby saying that reforming the tax code starts with cutting taxes for big business. think about that. most of the time. i hear people in this townpeople with good titles. paid well. dressed well. getting a good government pension and health care benefitssay that the first thing we need to do with tax reform is lower the corporate tax rate. it is all about trickledown economics. you cut taxes on big companies. you cut taxes on the wealthy. and maybe it will trickle down and help workers and families. well. the experience of the last 25 years doesnt really say that. the one time we tried trickledown for a decadefrom 2000 to 2010we had no net private sector job gain in this country. zero. but when we tried focusing on the middle class and growing the economy from the middle out during the clinton years. we had a 22millionit may have been almost 23 millionprivate sector net increase in jobs. and since the auto rescue. when we have focused on the middle class for the last 5 or 6 years by building the economy out. we have had job growth for 56 or 57 months in a row. if we are going to reform the tax code. we need to draw a line in the sand: no tax breaks for corporations without tax breaks first for working families. there is one glaring hole with the earnedincome tax credit. under current law. workers without children who are making minimum wage barely receive any eitc. childless workers under 25 dont qualify at all. that makes young people and workers without children the only group who can be taxed deeper into poverty. my state of the union guest was jason jacobs. a cincinnati resident and paraprofessional. he is a college graduate. he went to ohio university. he has a degree to teach. he has not found a fulltime teaching job. he is a paraprofessional in the west clermont school district who works with special needs students and does the kinds of things people should be rewarded for. last year he made less than $16.000. i believe he is paid hourly. he is obviously not paid in the summer. he is not paid on nonschool days. because he doesnt have children. he will miss out on this critical tax credit. that is why my legislation. the working families tax relief act. will nearly triple the size of the earnedincome tax credit for workers without children. expand access to young workers. and will make permanent enhancements to the eitc to 2017. we know what this will do. we know that children from lowincome families where the families are eligible and qualify and earn the eitcand i say earned the earnedincome tax credit. that is why it is called earnedbecause these are always working families who are playing by the rules. doing the right thing. and taking responsibility. we know that children from families who have earned the eitc have higher test scores. higher high school graduation rates. and higher college attendance rates. expanding eitc means more people attending college and more people getting geds. it means working more hours and higher salaries. why wouldnt we invest in the earnedincome tax credit? it means stronger communities. if we fail to act to renew the provisions that expire in 2017. 50 million americans would lose all or part of the eitc and ctc50 million americans who are doing the right thing. they are working hard and taking responsibility for their lives. we would just give up on them? we would be glad to do corporate tax breaks. but we would give up on the 50 million working americans? sixteen million of themincluding 8 million children. if we dont renewwill be pushed into poverty or deeper into the poverty they are already in. it is the worst kind of

floor."},{"1":"2014","2":"HASTINGS","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"madam speaker. this budget is not about reducing deficit or establishing a regime of fiscal responsibility. this is a budget to dismantle the national safety net system and to transfer those savings to the wealthiest individuals and corporations. even the appropriations chairman. chairman hal rogers. thinks that this budget is \"draconian.\" if you want a perfect example of republican ideology and book cooking. look no further than h.r. 1874. the progrowth budgeting act of 2013. republicans want to force the congressional budget office (cbo) to use their discredited models to help them mask the true effect of their slash and burn agenda. while at the same time. denying the use of their pseudomath to the one committee where it would hurt them. the appropriations committee. they want to pretend all day long that the discredited \"taxcuts = revenue growth\" model will do wonders for america. while denying the fact that the economically proven model of \"investment = growth\" will bring the much needed prosperity and equality that our citizens desperately want and need. defense spending is certainly important. but this budget is a complete failure of imagination when it comes to defending this country. defense is not simply about bullets. bombs and brigades. we also defend this country militarily and economically through making sure we have an educated citizenry. at the very least. please tell me that you understand that our war materiel is the most sophisticated in the world. please tell me that you understand that we. at the very least. need educated men and women to operate this equipment. well. this education does not miraculously appear overnight. indeed. their journey to where they are today started many years ago. and sure. some of them did not come from wealthy families and yes. some of our men and women in uniform had to rely on federal programs like head start. but that is never anything to be ashamed of and is certainly not something we should now turn our backs on. to defend a country as large and complex as ours is a multifaceted endeavor. an endeavor this budget utterly fails to meet. can \"general welfare.\" a constitutional obligation of congress. be defined as a budget that places the heaviest burden on the vast majority of americans. while bestowing the greatest benefits on the wealthiest? what is the appropriate level of shared sacrifice that ought to be required? one percent of americans take home over one quarter of all income every year. and have seen those incomes rise 18 percent in the last decade. but those in the middle have seen their incomes fall. why do you think that those who have suffered most severely under this recession should bear the greatest burden of hardship? what does this budget do to help those people. as opposed to the wealthy who will be fine no matter what we do with this budget? in your budget you say. \"the first job of the federal government is securing the safety and liberty of its citizens from threats at home and abroad.\" why is the only threat to the american dream that the republicans deem worthy of funding the one that comes from abroad? while this budget increases defense spending above presequester levels over the next decade. it ignores the very real threat to the american dream at home. by increasing inequality. and removing any hope for struggling families to move up to or stay in the middle class. how will deep spending cuts in serviceoriented federal programs help citizens weather the economic crisis? how will huge tax breaks for the wealthiest enable the poor and middle class to obtain jobs? with individual income and payroll taxes comprising 82 percent of revenue resources. and corporate taxes making up only 9 percent. how does this budget anticipate growing the economy when the burden falls disproportionately on those who need the most help right now? which specific tax provisions will you target in order to make the \"broadening\" savings claimed in this budget? the biggest four are (1) the home mortgage interest deduction. (2) the exclusion of employerprovided health benefits. (3) charitable deductions. and (4) state and local tax deductions. what specific tax loopholes do you propose to close? where. specifically. does all the projected revenue come from? this budget cuts the top marginal income tax rate to 25 percent. the lowest the rate has been since herbert hoover. yet the budget also predicts that federal tax revenues will increase by nearly $600 billion by 2021. president reagan used a similar model which has since been discredited as unworkable. and which. on his watch. drastically increased the deficit and national debt. how will americans receive the health care they need if their medicare premium and outofpocket costs become unaffordable under this proposed privatized system? is the value of the vouchers linked to health care cost growth? americans already pay more than twice as much per persons for health care as other wealthy countries with the same or longer life expectancies. since the government pays for about half of this countrys health care. almost all of which is actually provided by the private sector. future health care costs are increasing because of private sector costs. not the government. is it your contention that eliminating government support will suddenly render health care affordable? or does this budget foresee the government washing its hands of the need to ensure quality health care for its citizens? how does converting medicaid into a block grant bear relation to the actual need for medicaid services? when twothirds of participants are seniors and persons with disabilities. when half of longterm care is covered by medicaid. and when 70 percent of people over the age of 65 will require longterm care services at some point. how will cutting $732 billion benefit these americans? is the goal to control costs or to shift costs? the cbo says that privatizing medicare will shift costs onto seniors. in 2030. traditional medicare costs would be less than the private costs envisioned by the gop budget. under this plan seniors will be out of pocket for about twothirds the cost of privatized care. as opposed to about onequarter under traditional medicare. isnt it true that rising costs and financial risk simply would migrate from the federal budget to seniors household budgets? wouldnt that mean seniors would face higher premiums. eroding coverage. or both? how do you propose to provide relief to millions of homeowners in this housing crisis? this budget dramatically cuts funding for public housing assistance. foreclosure mitigation programs. and neighborhood development activities. how do you anticipate that communities will be able to meet the housing needs of their most disadvantaged residents? the republican budget resolution will cut housing aid to 10.000 veterans each year. approximately onethird of the total number of homeless vets. how does the republican budget plan on taking care of newly homeless veterans? is cutting these services a fair reward for those who risked their lives in service to our country? if students can no longer rely on pell grants and other federal assistance for their college education. how do you propose to increase the number of students going to college and improve americas system of education? this budget reduces pell grants to the 2008 level and eliminates the grant increases that democrats achieved previously. bringing the maximum grant award back down to $5.000. but the budget does not seem to provide even enough funding for that amount. in this budget. republicans slash transportation investment in 2015 by $52 billion. do republicans think that our infrastructure will magically fix itself. like they apparently do the rising inequality that this budget perpetuates? how many bridges have to collapse. and how many schools have to remain unbuilt so that we can provide another increase to our already bloated defense budget? madam speaker. i am asking a lot of questions. because this budget does nothing but raise them. and provides no answers. it provides no answer for how we will help middle class families as they continue to struggle on chairman ryans road to ruin. it provides no answer for how we will help low income families send their children to college. it provides no answer for how we will provide quality healthcare to our seniors and those who are one medical emergency away from bankruptcy. it provides no answer for how we will provide housing assistance to those who have served their country and need a helping hand getting back on their feet. the fact that we have to even debate these measures is outrageous. madam speaker. we can do better. not only can we do better. we have an obligation to the american people to do better. this budget utterly fails to meet that obligation. the material previously referred to by mr. mcgovern is as follows:"},{"1":"2013","2":"TAKANO","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"the compounding effects on that amount of debt is going to seriously add to those students who will take. say. public service jobs or jobs in teaching. or jobs in the public sector. nonprofits. it will severely limit the kind of employment that young people might seek out."},{"1":"2012","2":"CICILLINE","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"i thank the gentleman from connecticut for his extraordinary leadership on this issue. which is important to rhode island. but really important to students all across our country. i think one of the things that has struck me during this debate about this issue in the last several weeks as weve tried to bring attention to this issue is that this is really a moment in the history of our country where we need to recognizemaybe more than anytime at least in my lifetimethe urgency of investing in education and of ensuring that young people have access to a quality education. the idea that were in a position to prevent interest rates from doubling for those who are benefiting from stafford loans and that this congress seems poised not to do anything about it. to me. is. as you said. unconscionable. there was a report that was done recently. the georgetown university center on education and the workforce. they found that over the period from 2008 to 2018. about 47 million job openings will be created. and of that. more than 30 million of these jobs will require at least some level of postsecondary education. so this is the reality for our country. that we have got to realize if were going to create jobs and be sure that we have young people who have the skills necessary to fill those jobs in this new knowledge economy of the 21st century. we have to make it easier for people to access higher education. not more difficult. and congress wisely cut the rate in half from 6.8 percent to 3.4. we have to make sure it stays there. now. i come from a state that brought us the great senator claiborne pell. who was the creator of the pell grant. which created and continues to create hope and opportunity and access to education for millions and millions of americans. really unlocking opportunity and keys to success. we all understand that not only the student benefits from that education. but we all benefit. the community benefits when we have a welleducated group of young people that are making new discoveries. that are finding cures for diseases. that are inventing new products. that are building productive lives to support themselves and their families. and this is a moment when we have to be sure that were protecting families from the consequences of this kind of interest rate increase. doubling. as you just said. representative. the united states public interest research group says that without congressional action. borrowers who have taken out the maximum $23.000 in subsidized student loans will see their interest balloon to an additional $5.200 over a 10year repayment and $11.300 over a 20year repayment. so this is a huge increase for families. many of whom in my state. where we continue to have very high unemployment. the second highest in the country. where families are struggling with the consequences of the housing crisis and difficulty finding work. this cannot. we cannot allow this to happen. it will cause incredible hardship for families in rhode island and my district. i was recently at roger williams university and at several other universities in my district meeting with young people. all were concerned about will pell grants continue. will we be able to protect pell grants. and whats going to happen when they graduate and have student loans. are these kinds of interest rates going to be in existence. which are just not affordable to young people. and the idea that we have 73 days. you know. this is a moment where we can demonstrate we can get something done. my friends on the other side of the aisle dont seem interested in addressing this issue which. for rhode islanders. and i know you recently had an event in connecticut. and i know many of our colleagues around the country doing this. weve got to rally young people to demand that the legislation which you sponsored. h.r. 3826. and which im proud to be a cosponsor of. and my senator. senator reid on the senate side is the lead sponsor. weve got to demand that speaker boehner bring this to the floor for a vote. our colleagues need to hear from their families in their districts. from young people all across this country. this is about our own investment in our future as a country. that we benefit from young people who have access to higher education. at a time where our economy is still recovering. we cant allow interest rates to student loans to double. im going to continue to fight very hard. i thank the gentleman for his leadership on this. i hope that we will continue to beat the drums on this for the next 73 days till we force some action here on the floor of the house for the sake of the young people in this country and for the sake of our future as a thriving and prosperous democracy. i again thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak to this issue tonight."},{"1":"2011","2":"CASEY","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"i thank the chair. let me talk for a moment about the legislation. the legislation before us. as i said before. would both extend and expand the payroll tax cut that is in place right now. first of all. for employees. we cut it in half. so instead of paying a 6.2percent payroll tax. the employee. the worker. would pay just 3.1 percent. that has a sizable impact on the economy when we do that1.500 bucks in the pockets of the average worker in america. approximately 160 million american workers are impacted and as many as 6.7 million in pennsylvania. so we would not only keep in place the payroll tax cut for workers. but we want to expand it so it is fully cut in half. secondly. i wish to speak for a moment about the employer side of this because that wasnt part of last years effort. i introduced the payroll tax credit in early 2010 to encourage employers to hire and accelerate the pace of the recovery. a number of folks on both sides of the aisle have worked on this. the ideas of those kinds of tax credits in those kinds of bills we introduced form the foundation of what we are trying to do today. this legislation incorporates elements of my and others earlier legislation to provide businesses with quarterly incentives to increase their payrolls. i wish to highlight a couple of elements of the legislation before us. first. this bill cuts payroll taxes in half for 98 percent of u.s. businesses. these businesses have taxable payrolls of $5 million or less. they will see their payroll taxes cut in half. as i said before. for the worker as well as the business. some people say: ok. that is 98 percent of businesses. that is good news. what about the other 2 percent who have higher incomes? those businesses that have taxable income above $5 million will still get a payroll tax cut from 6.2 percent to 3.1 percent on the first $5 million of their taxable payroll. so they get it up to that level. so this is a huge benefit to small businesses across the country and even some businesses larger than that. the joint economic committee. of which i am the chair. recently released a report that indicated that small business lending remains well below prerecession levels both in the number of loans and the dollar value of those loans. so a lot of small businesses still cannot get access to credit. this payroll tax cut legislation will help those companies substantially to be able to get access to credit. finally. i wish to make a point about the legislation as it relates to eliminating the employers share of the social security payroll tax on the first $50 million of increased payroll in 2012. this isnt just a cut. this is an elimination if they do one of three things: if they are hiring more workers. if they increase the hours. which is another way to get the benefit. thirdly. if they are boosting pay. this legislation is one of the best ways to create jobs. one of the best ways to kickstart our economy. i will conclude with this. if we look at the real world of communities across pennsylvania or across the country. means that if we pass this legislation. for median family income in pennsylvania. the benefit is $1.535. a little more than $1.500. so whether people go to small rural counties or big cities or suburban communities. wherever it is across a state such as ours. workers will be able to put roughly $1.500 in their pockets for this season coming up when people need some help. and small businesses will be substantially positively impacted by this legislation. we need to pass this legislation. we need to do it now to help our workers. to help our businesses. and to grow the economy and create jobs. thank you. mr. president. i yield the floor."},{"1":"2010","2":"MALONEY","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"i thank the gentleman for yielding. madam speaker. the joint economic committee. which i chair. released a report today that finds that if congress fails to extend the federal unemployment insurance benefits program. the unintended consequences could be extremely serious. serious not just for the 2 million americans who would see their benefits expire in december. but extremely serious for the larger economy as well. prematurely ending the program would drain our economy of some $80 billion in purchasing power. just as our fragile economy is beginning to recover. this would result in the loss of over 1 million jobs over the next year. even now. there are five americans looking for work for every job opening in the land. and more than 40 percent of those unemployed have been out of work for 27 weeks or more. including over 159.000 in new york state. with some 95.000 in my home of new york city. choosing to vote against an extension. and thus add a million americans to the ranks of the unemployed. cannot possibly be considered as a wise economic policy choice. the nonpartisan congressional budget office ranks the stimulative effects of unemployment benefits as one of the most effective policies to increase growth and employment that they have studied. and the presidents council of economic advisers estimates that every dollar spent on unemployment insurance benefits increases the gross domestic product by $1.60. economists predict that without extended benefits. the economy will suffer. consumer

board members in the center pointurbana community school district. and to report on their participation in a unique federal partnership to repair and modernize school facilities. this fall marks the 10th year of the iowa demonstration construction grant program. that is its formal name. but it is better known among educators in iowa as the program of harkin grants for iowa public schools. since 1998. i have been fortunate to secure a total of $121 million for the state government in iowa. which selects worthy school districts to receive these grants for a range of renovation and repair effortseverything from updating fire safety systems to building new schools or renovating existing facilities. in many cases. this federal funding is used to leverage public and/ or private local funding. so it often has a tremendous multiplier effect in a local school district. the center pointurbana community school district received a 2002 harkin grant totaling $125.500 which it used to help build a new health and fitness center addition which .is used not only by the school. but by the community as a whole. the district also received two fire safety grants totaling $42.152 which it used to replace emergency systems throughout the district. excellent schools do not just pop up like. mushrooms after a rain. they are the product of vision. leadership. persistence. and a tremendous amount of collaboration among local officials and concerned citizens. i salute the entire staff. administration. and governance in the center pointurbana community school district. in particular. i would like to recognize the leadership of the board of educationpresident carol engelken. mark boies. tammy carolan. scott millikin and dan jones as well as former president connie elgin and former members kelly bonar and todd ramsey. i would also like to recognize superintendent alan marshall. former superintendent richard whitehead. athletic director dan rosendahl and board secretary kathy thomas. as we mark the 10th anniversary .of the harkin school grant program in iowa. i am obliged to point out that many thousands of school buildings and facilities across the united states are in dire need of renovation or replacement. in my state of iowa alone. according to a recent study. some 79 percent of public schools need to be upgraded or repaired. the harsh reality is .s9405 that the average age of school buildings in the united states is nearly 50 years. too often. our children visit ultramodern shopping malls and gleaming sports arenas on weekends. but during the week go to school in rundown or antiquated facilities. this sends exactly the wrong message to our young people about our priorities. we have to do better. that is why i am deeply grateful to the professionals and parents in the center pointurbana community school district. there is no question that a quality public education for every child is a top. priority in that community. i salute them. and wish them

will enable us to put behind us the mess left by last congress and get on to the important business of addressing the real and pressing needs of the american people. mr. speaker. last november millions of americans went to the polls to register the strong disgust with the republican dominated control of the legislative and executive branches of our federal government. americans were fed up with a republican congress and its legacy of a culture of corruption. its failure to address the pressing needs of the american people. its unwillingness to provide effectivb oversight of the executive branch. its fiscal irresponsibility that resulted in record budget deficits and added trillions to the national debt. and its ability to complete one of the most basic tasks of the legislative branch: to pass the appropriations bills needed to fund the government. is it any wonder that americans were voting for a new way of doing the peoples business when they elected the democratic majorities in the house and senate? i think not. we democrats promised a new and better direction for america. and we have been delivering. mr. speaker. behold what we accomplished in less than the first 100 legislative hours of our majority. we passed h.r. 1. which implements the recommendations of the 911 commission. we passed h.r. 2. raising the minimum wage by $2.10 an hour over three years and providing a much needed raise to nearly 5 million workers. we passed h.r. 3. which will provide funding for embryonic stem cell research and provide hope for millions of americans suffering from some of the most debilitating illnesses. but we did not stop there. we passed h.r. 4. which requires medicaid to negotiate lower prescription drug prices for our seniors and disabled citizens. we passed h.r. 5. which will make college more affordable to middle and working class americans by cutting the interest rate on federally insured student loans in half. and we passed h.r. 6. which is a substantial start in making this country more energy independent. and we accomplished all this. mr. speaker. after draining the swamp and ending the culture of corruption by adopting the strongest. toughest ethics and lobbying rules in history. today. we clean up the fiscal mess left by the republicanled 109th congress. the last congress abdicated its duty to be a faithful and responsible steward of the public fisc. they shirked their responsibility to establish the right priorities and make the right choices to serve the american people. they failed to pass nine of the eleven appropriations bills needed to sustain the operations of govemment for fiscal year 2007. mr. speaker. thanks to your superb leadership. and especially the extraordinary legislative craftsmanship of our remarkable chairman of the appropriations committee. we rectity these republican failures today. the continuing resolution we take up today. h.j. res. 20. is not the ideal manner to fund the government and contains some provisions that each of us might not like. unlike the presidents decision to escalate the war in iraq. the choices reflected in h.j. res. 20 represent the best

president. i approach this part of the debate on a critical piece of legislation with due caution. i say that because of my respect for my colleagues from arizona and from the state of texas and the work they have done as members of the judiciary committee and the due diligence they have always put into this critical issue. i believe there is a component missing from this debate that speaks to the need for this country to be in a continual and progressive mode of training and shaping a permanent stable workforce. unlike all of the demographic studies of the last decade or two. there is something upon us as a nation that we have never experienced before. i am a 1945 baby. i am 60 years old. i am just 1 year ahead of a great class of people77 million americanscalled baby boomers. they. similar to myself. because of their age. will soon be leaving the american workforce. there are demographic studies out there today which suggest that if we are to sustaih a 3.5- to 4- percent growth economy. we have to have about 500.000 new. nonu.s. citizen workers in our workforce on an annual basis. yes. we will have ups and downs in the economy. we always have. but in the last downtrend we had. in the final days of the clinton administration and the early days of the bush administration. it was about 3.5 million in the downturn before it came back. in the 5.2 million jobs created since that time. onethird of them have been claimed by foreign nationals. it speaks to an economic growth pattern that now requires for the first time in our history a sustained. incoming. trainable. and permanent workforce of the kind that the american citizen. by birthrate. is\" not providing. if we deny that as a country. if we create instability as a country. we deny ourselves the ability to continue to grow. and if we do not grow. this senate is going to be faced with public policy decisions we are not yet brave enough to make: social security reform. medicare reform. medicaid reformall of those things which. without a sustained economic growth cycle. -become phenomenally expensive and maybe unaffordable. that does not sound like part of the debate that would tie itself to the kylcornyn amendment. but i suggest it does. i suggest it behooves this country to create a legal transparent immigration system with a secured border that allows americas employers to train and sustain a permanent workforce. a constantly growing permanent workforce. because the american. by birth. is no longer going to do that. it is the nature of our country. it is the maturity of our country. it is. in fact. the -wealth of our country. that is. in part. what all of this debate is about. americans said: get your borders secured and get the illegal flow under control. identify them. control them. that is what we are trying to do. i do not believe that a constant temporary environment is a stable environment. for those who work for long periods of time and get a green card. does it mean they will become a citizen? no. it does not. does it mean they are eligible? in this bill. it says: yes. if you go to the end of the line and apply. and that is 6 years. another 5 years. that is 11 years. and .it goes on and on. i dont believe this is an appropriate amendment to this bill. there is enough temporariness to the bill itself by the nature of h2as. h2bs and h2cs. and that is written in. there has to be some stability of permanency. that is critical to the american economic scene and to the stability of americas workforce. and even in that. we will have the down cycles

today. along with senator daschle. senator baucus and senator durbin. i am submitting a resolution that calls on the congress to reject social security privatization plans. including those that require deep cuts in guaranteed benefits. such as the proposals by president bushs social security commission. for nearly 70 years. social security has reflected the best of americas values. social security promises americans that if you work hard. pay your taxes. and play by the rules. you will be able to retire and live in dignity. social security benefits are far from lavish. the. average retiree receives only about $900 a month. that doesnt go far in many parts of the countrycertainly not in new jersey. unfortunately. even the benefits. promised under current law are now at risk. president bush says he wants to move toward privatization. but what he does not say is that shifting funds from the social security trust fund into privatized accounts almost inevitably leads to deep cuts in guaranteed benefits. to appreciate the depth of the cuts that flow from privatization. one need only consider the privatization plans developed by president bushs own social security commission. that commission included only proponents of privatization selected by president bush. and it developed privatization plans that call for deep benefits cuts. according to the nonpartisan actuaries at the social security administration. those cuts would exceed 25 percent for some current workers. in the future. seniors could face a 45 percent cut in benefits. the president likes to argue that privatization is about choice. but there would be no choice about these cutsthey would harm every senior. in fact. those who chose to participate in privatized accounts would see their benefits cut even deeper. that is why. in response to the bush commissions report. 50 members of the senate wrote to president bush. urging him to reject the commissions proposed cuts in benefits. unfortunately. we have yet to receive a response. privatization advocates try to justify cuts in social security by pointing to future projected shortfalls in the trust fund. but diverting payroll taxes from the trust fund only makes matters worse. and would substantially accelerate the date by which the fund would become insolvent. that is why privatization almost inevitably leads to deep cuts

hope we can kill this radical idea before it has a chance to get off the ground. we must never accept any plan that takes the security out of social security."},{"1":"2003","2":"MCGOVERN","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. i rise in strong opposition to this rule. once again. the republican leadership that runs this house is attempting to stifle debate. once again. they are trying to rush important legislation through without adequate deliberation. and. once again. they are wrong. and i urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject their tactics. it saddens me to say this. but the united states house of representatives has become a place where trivial issues are debated passionately and important ones barely at all. and this is an important issue. we are talking about the war in iraq. we are talking about an enormous. complicated $87 billion supplemental appropriations bill. we are talking about providing the resources our soldiers need to do their jobs in iraq and afghanistan. and we are talking about the financial health of our nation and about the priorities of this congress. now. at least we were talking about those things until the republican leadership decided just after midnight last night that they did not want to listen anymore. the committee on rules is intended to be a place where debate is structured. it can. and it should be. a tool to manage the house. but under this leadership. the committee on rules has become a weapon. a weapon that does not manage debate but smothers it. now. here is the situation: yesterday. we passed what the chairman of the committee on rules. the gentleman from california . and other republican leaders described as an open rule. in reality. the rule was not all that open since it did not allow us to offer very thoughtful and important amendments. amendments to pay for the $87 billion without passing the debt on to our kids. amendments to require the administration to actually come up with a plan for winning the peace in iraq. those amendments and so many others. republican and democrat. were not made in order. but they said even though we could not vote on our amendments. we could at least talk about them. they called it an open rule. so let us go with that. now. we are told by the republican leadership that the republican leadership is tired. they do not want to debate. they do not want to vote past 2 or 3 today. they are tired or they have trips to take or planes to catch or somewhere else to be. with all due respect. mr. speaker. too bad. this is one of the most important pieces of legislation we will consider this year. and we need to get it right. is this the new standard for appropriations bills? you use an open rule that really is not open until you get sleepy. and then you shut off debate and go home? you muzzle members of congress and the people they represent? there has been a lot of rhetoric in this chamber this week about establishing democracy in iraq. i want to say to the republican leadership that you are setting a lousy example for the iraqi people to follow. we spent one day authorizing this war. one day as legislatures of parliaments from london to berlin. to ankara to santiago spent significant and meaningful time discussing the issue of war and peace. the united states house of representatives rushed to a war resolution in a single day. we did not ask the tough questions. we did not get the straight answers. i do not think there is a member in this house who really believes that we met our responsibilities. and here we go again. now. the leadership tells us you have had 3 days. well. i do not care if it takes 3 weeks. let us stay here all weekend for the soldiers in iraq. for their families. for the people we represent. we cannot afford to get this wrong. let me say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. many of you had important amendments and thoughtful things to say. if this rule passes. you will be silenced. you know this is wrong. please take a stand. do not be a cheap date. vote no. because if you do not. this is going to happen again and again and again. reject this rule and let us get back to work."},{"1":"2002","2":"TANCREDO","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"i thank the speaker for that reminder. the issue is. of course. this particular agency and the security of the nation is dependent upon having an organization like the ins do its job. do it effectively and efficiently. i hope that i have indicated to you and to the members and our colleagues the difficulty we would have if we were to just give this agency the responsibility to actually increase border security. it has to be abolished. we have to start with something new. it has to be something we create. the president today. as i understand. has called for something far more dramatic. far more significant than the original proposal to just split the agency into two parts. he has called for the complete elimination of this part of the agency. the enforcement side. creating a brandnew one that would combine various other offices. various other functions of other agencies. including customs and agriculture. perhaps dea. putting them into one agency. with the clear purpose. the clear line of authority. with people who are not philosophically inclined to open borders. but actually have a belief that they have a responsibility to help defend our borders. he has called for that today. and i applaud his call for a new agency. brand new. new people. and i would suggest we take it out of justice and perhaps put it into governor ridges homeland security agency. that would be appropriate. now. we have to do something like that. and it will be dramatic. it is a big test of our will in this body and in the other body as to whether or not we can actually accomplish this. because. of course. there is a lot of turf we are going to be treading on. and in this town turf is very important and people do not give up their turf. even a tiny little bit of it. without a big fight. what we are saying here is we have to take some things away from you. and some things away from you. and we have to put it into another agency. it is going to be tough. it has to be done. and i will tell you why. people will often say. hey. who are we really afraid of? are we afraid of the people coming across the borders? they are just coming for jobs. they are not really coming here to do us any harm and that sort of thing. madam speaker. i am going to be quoting from something here. an article that was put out on worldnetdaily. written by j. zane walley. a lot of the references i will be making will be to this particular article. it is called \"arab terrorists crossing the border.\" this was a very elucidative analysis. i think. of the problem. and something that every american should be aware of. especially when we talk about the need to make sure that we are fighting the war on terrorism both here and abroad. because if we do not have a twofront war. we will certainly lose. the article says that to date. the u.s. border patrol has apprehended. and this is up to this time of the year. 158.722 illegals. just in the year 2001. by the border patrols own admission. it catches one alien in five. and admits that about 800.000 have slipped across this year. others contend that this is inaccurate. these are the ranchers down there. and they contendthe agency only nets one in ten. an estimate is that over 1.5 million unlawful aliens have crossed into america in what the border patrol calls the tucson sector. by the way. that is just one part of our border. of course. many border ranch owners are validly apprehensive of speaking about their desperate situation because of likely retribution by narcomilitarists. the drug runners. and coyotes. the smuggling of human beings. unsolved murders and arsons are alarmingly ordinary in cochise county. so pure fear keeps locals from speaking on the record. the foot traffic is so heavy that the back country has an ambience of a garbage dump and smells like an outdoor privy. in places. the land is littered a foot deep with bottles. cans. soiled disposable diapers. sanitary napkins. panties. clothes. backpacks. human feces. used toilet paper. pharmacy bottles. syringes. et cetera. u.s. border patrol agents are doing the best they can. considering their sparse numbers and the impossible terrain they patrol in fourwheel drive vehicles. quadrunners and on foot. agents of the border patrol have their other fears besides being ambushed by rockchucking illegals and confrontations with assault riflearmed narcos. they are not allowed to speak adbout what they cope with each day. this is what i mentioned. madam speaker. as being endemic in this agent. they have intimidated their employees so that they are afraid to speak out in what they see to be as clear violations of the regulations they are asked to uphold. one agent who spoke anonymously said. look. i can tell you a lot of stories. but i have to be unnamed or i will be blackballed and might lose my job. he worriedly added. i have a family depending on me. another agent of supervisory rank stated that smuggling traffic of mexicans has really slowed. we are experiencing a tremendous increase in what he calls otms. that is border lingo for \"other than mexicans: when queried about the ethnic makeup of the otms. he answered central and south americans. orientals and middle easterners. when he was questioned about that further. middle easterners. he said yeah. it varies. but about one in every ten that we catch is from a country like yemen or egypt. border patrol spokesperson rene noriega stated that the number of other than mexican detentions has grown by 42 percent. most of the nonmexican immigrants are from el salvador or other parts of central america. she said. but added that the agents have picked up people from all over the world. including the former soviet union. asia. and the middle east. arabs have been reported crossing the arizona border for an unknown period. border rancher george morgan encounters thousands of illegals crossing his ranch on a wellused trail. he relates a holiday event: \"it was thanksgiving. 1998. and i stepped outside my house and there were over 100 crossers in my yard. damnedest bunch of illegals i ever saw.. all of them were wearing black pants. white shirts and string ties. maybe they were hoping to blend in.\" he chuckled. \"they took off. i called the border patrol. and a while later agent dan green let me know that they had been caught. he said all were iranians.\" according to border patrol spokesman rob daniels. 10 egyptians were arrested recently near douglas. arizona. each had paid $7.000 to be brought from guatemala into mexico and then across the border. according to the san diego union tribune. hours after the 911 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon. an anonymous caller led mexican immigration officials to 41 undocumented iraqis waiting to cross into the united states. the associated press reported that mexican immigration police detained 13 citizens of yemen on september 24. 2001. who reportedly were waiting to cross the border into arizona. the yemenis were arrested sunday in agua prieta. across the border from douglas. luis teran balaguer. in the northern state of sonora. said the evidence indicates that they have nothing to do with terrorist activities. the agua prieta newspaper clearly did not agree with his assessment. the editor. jose noriega durazo. claimed in a front page el ciarin headline. \"arab terrorists were here.\" he quoted agua prieta police officials as identifying the 13 yemenis as terrorists. reportedly the mexican immigration police returned the yemenis to a federal detention center near mexico city. but the new information would indicate they were released and returned to agua prieta. carlos carrillo. assistant chief. u.s. border patrol. tucson sector. told worldnetdaily in a telephone interview monday that- nine yemenis were reportedly holed up in a hotel in the border town of agua prieta. sonora. \"we have passed the tip on to the fbi.\" he said. when pressed for information. he said he could not confirm the number. because they were under op/sec. which is a counterintelligence acronym for \"operations security.\" the border patrol field patrol agent. who spoke anonymously. confirmed the presence of nine yemenis. the agent said they could not get a coyote to transport them. and they are offering $30.000 per person. with no takers. the article goes on. some people are being offered $50.000. specifically of arab descent. this is happening at the same time that we are debating whether or not we actually can control our own borders or whether we should. today i had an interesting discussion with a member of the press. specifically a lady i think from usa today. and it became apparent after a short time she was annoyed with the fact that i was pressing for border control. she put the pad away for a second and talked to me. you know. sort of \"off the record\". and she said you cannot really expect to do this. we are going to turn into a police state. are you really going to try to keep these people out? so i said to her. tell me the alternative to trying to defend the border. just tell me what you think the alternative is? it is to abandon it. there is no other way. you have two options. you either defend the border as well as you possibly can. and it does not mean we will absolutely be sure that no one- will ever be able to get into the country without our permission: of course not. but we do everything that we can do. just like the president has said that we are going to do outside the country. he said we are going to do everything we have to do. i ask the president to do everything that he can do. and i certainly will do everything i can do. and i will ask my colleagues in this body to do everything that we as a body can do to stop people from coming into the united states illegally. because it is dangerous. it is not just the person coming across to get a job in a factory or a field somewhere. we cannot discriminate. we do not know. it is not easy to determine which one is coming across illegally. for some purpose that is benign and which one is coming across illegally for some purpose that is quite deadly. it is impossible for us to know that. we have only one ability. only one charge. only one responsibility. that is to defend the border against all people coming across illegally. it is our responsibility as a congress. and although there are many people who shy away from it. who are frightened by that because they know that politically we will be attacked by the immigration support groups and various other organizations. and by people who in fact have as their purpose. even here in this body. there are many reasons that many people vote against tightening immigration laws. some are directly political. some people know that massive numbers of immigrants coming into the united states. legally and illegally. will end up supporting the democratic party. and therefore they say. we do not want to reduce immigration. whether we are talking legal or illegal. many people on our side are split in that libertarian camp that say. \"i want open borders.\" or say. \"i want cheap labor.\" that is the problem we deal with here. but i ask all of my colleagues to overcome those very parochial. partisan interests in the hope of and in the desire to try and defend america as successfully as we are doink in afghanistan. it is imperative that we do it here. also. our very nations survival is at risk. we recognize that. and we respond to the call that the president makes when we appropriate money and in every other way indicate our support for the effort to fight terrorism overseas. but why. why. madam speaker. is it so hard for us to get the same job done here in the united states? it should be the first place we look. it

house today is the senate amendment to h.r. 1151. the credit union membership access act. if the house concurs in the senate amendment. a step i strongly encourage. this important legislation will be cleared for the president for his expected signature. thereby ensuring that millions of americans will not be forced out of the financial institution of their choice. this body originally approved the credit union bill on april 1 by a vote of 4118 and the senate last week acted by vote of 926. this legislation is in response to a 54 supreme court decision earlier this year which overturned the national credit union administrations interpretation of the 1934 federal credit union act on what the appropriate common bond should be for federal credit unions. if the supreme court decision were to stand. not only could millions of credit union members be kicked out of their financial institution. but the safety and soundness of the entire credit union system would have been jeopardized. the senate amendment generally incorporates the house approach to the credit union issue. especially as it relates to the common bond issue. but there are four major differences between the house and the senate versions. first. the senate amendment does not impose community reinvestmentlike requirements on state and federally chartered credit unions. the house version would have. second. the senate amendment limits the total amount of member business loans to approximately 12 percent of a credit unions aspets. the house bill would have frozen current ncua restrictions on commercial lending for one year. third. the senate amendment expands upon the prompt corrective action provisions contained in the house bill. which generally would have called on the regulator to issue regulations comparable to those imposed on banks and thrifts under the fdic act. the senate version provides somewhat greater detail. finally. the senate amendment struck the house provisions limiting the economic benefit directors or officers could receive from a conversion of the credit union to a stock form of company. these senate changes. while not in all instances improvements to the house position. are generally acceptable given that the broad approach of the house has been maintained. the supreme court case was brought by the banking industry because of a perceived difference in the regulatory and tax treatment of credit unions. there is particular angst among bankers that this legislation does not repeal the tax exempt status of credit unions. however. this issue was not broached in the supreme court and the banking committee from which this bill originated has no jurisdiction over federal tax laws. beyond this. this congress has little appetite for imposing new taxes. but taxes aside. the competitive regulatory playing field between banks and credit unions is pretty well evened out under this legislation. for instance. the new capital standards and prompt corrective regulatory requirements imposed on credit unions under this bill are similar to those imposed on banks and will ensure the continued safety and soundness of operation of credit unions. in a financial services world where the big are getting bigger from the top down. consumers are increasingly showing their desire to maintain the option of being served by communitycontrolled institutions. whether they be community banks. savings and loans or credit unions. it is therefore critical that this congress do everything in its power to ensure that smaller. communitycontrolled institutions are provided the means to compete and prosper in the marketplace. credit unions. just one part on the cooperative movement side which have so advantaged american society. represent democracy at work in the marketplace. in protecting them. in legitimizing them. this legislation deserves support. i would strongly suggest a \"yes\" vote on accepting the senate amendment. i would also strongly urge that the president sign this important legislation. mr. speaker. i reserve the balance of my time."},{"1":"1997","2":"MALONEY","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. i yield myself such time as i may consume. my thanks to the chairman for working with the minority in drafting the managers amendment to this bill. the government spends over $7.5 billion annually on travel and relocation costs. i rise in support of this bill and in support of streamlining government paperwork and saving the taxpayers millions in government travel expenses. it is so simple. h.r. 930 just calls for the use of one travel card. one bill to pay. one bill to check. if every government employee simply used this card for all travel related expenses. taxpayers would gain $105 million. the card comes with a 30day moneyback guarantee. employees must be reimbursed within a month of their payment. h.r. 930 does allow the agency to deduct certain unpaid travel charges from paychecks. unless the employee is disputing the charges. even those deductions will not exceed 15 percent of the travelers wages. h.r. 930 also calls for a review of shipping and other transportation expenses before they are paid. that seems extremely reasonable. do not we all look at our bills before we pay them? this measure alone will save $50 million a year. simplicity saves. complications cost. i urge my colleagues to support this bill."},{"1":"1996","2":"HEALTH-CARE","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"task bob dole says he wants to pass healthcare reform before he steps down as majority leader and leaves the senate next month. the task will not be easy. bills passed by the house and senate would perform a valuable service by requiring insurers to offer coverage to workers who lost or quittheir jobs. a requirement known as portability. though nothing in these modest bills guarantees that coverage would be affordable for individual workers. but congress is hung up over three ideologyladen provisions added to one bill or the other. mr. dole has yet to resolve the wrangling. the house bill would enshrine a favorite conservative remedy. the socalled medical savings accounts. the bill would provide a tax break for money deposited into these special accounts and the money would be used to pay routine medical bills. the owners of these accounts would cover their large medical bills by buying a highdeductible. or catastrophic. policy. proponents say the accounts will discourage wasteful care because individuals will be aware of each dollar they spend. but the accounts will probably do little to discourage waste because an overwhelming percentage of medical expenditures are accounted for by the 15 percent or so of the population that rack up huge bills and therefore are well beyond the deductible of their catastrophic policies. even worse. medical savings accounts will siphon healthy patients out of the market for traditional coverage. leaving a concentrated pool of sick applicants who will be forced to pay skyhigh rates for ordinary coverage. mr. dole knows he cannot push the savings accounts. which conservatives love as a governmentfree solution to health reform. past a presidential veto. some in his party arc willing to settle on a demonstration project. demonstration projects of an untested idea make sense. but president clinton ought to be wary. for a demonstration project to provide a valid test. it would need to last at least six yearsenough time to watch how healthy people who own the accounts react when they become sick. will they junk catastrophic coverage? will they save money after sick years balance out healthy years? will they forgo preventive care. driving them to highcost specialists? shorter periods would not suffice because more than 85 percent of the population are healthy at any one time and would not need to dip far into their taxsubsidized deposits. another obstacle to compromise concerns purchasing pools. a sensible way for small employers to join to negotiate discounts with hospitals and physicians. the senate would encourage such smallemployer pools. but keep them under strict state regulation. the house bill would unwisely create loopholes through which small employers could escape government oversight. even state monitoring of solvency and grievance procedures. the third obstacle is the senates wellmeaning provision to require insurers to cover mental illness on a par with other conditions. americans do need adequate coverage of mental illness. but the hastily adopted provision would create major economic problems that will probably doom the measure to defeat. the provision is likely to boost insurance costs by as much as 10 percent and drive employers to drop coverage of 400.000 workers. the senate is right that healthcare policies should include adequate coverage of mental illness. but the proper way to achieve that goal is for congress to appoint a commission to come up with a costeffective package of federally defined basic health benefits. piecemeal mandates. conceived in haste. are likely to produce unintended adverse consequences. the only bill that has a realistic chance of passing congress and getting past the white house is one that sticks close to the senate bill but forgoes mentalhealth parity until another day. this is an obvious compromise for mr. dole to seize.

to have been cochairman of a working group with senator grassley to try to pull together various parts of this legislation and help get it to the floor. i am fully cognizant of the fact that those of us who are newcomers to this legislative process. indeed. stand on the shoulders of giants. there have been so many who have done so much in this area: senator grassley. senator lieberman. senator glenn and others. i am delighted to be a part of that. and to be part of this strong bipartisan effort here in my first opportunity.to address this body. mr. president. senators grassley and glenn have very aptly gone over the details of this legislation. it is indeed complex. it involves several pieces of complex litigation and applicability to those already existing laws. they have gone over this in detail. i will not. i would like to make some basic observations. however. starting with the proposition that the people spoke in a very loud voice in this last election. we can disagree as to what the people were saying in many respects. and we do. we have spent a lot of time trying to interpret .the voice of the people in these last few weeks. however. i think there is one thing we cannot or should notdisagree on. that is. in large part. they were saying that they want a change of the way we have done business in washington. dc. mr. president. specifically in the congress of the united states. i cannot think of a better example of the way that we have beexi doing business in times past than this whole business of exempting congress from the laws that other people have to live under. so today. i think that what this bill does is take a step in the right direction. it takes a step away from that and toward accountability. it stands for the basic proposition that those who make the laws in this country have to live under the laws that they make. as other citizens do. those of us who have just come off the campaign trail. perhaps. have an additional insight into this matter. those here with us today have spoken many times and laboredin the vineyard for many years on this bill. those of us on the other end of the spectrum have just come from being a part of campaigns where the peoples voice was most recently heard. mr. president. not only are the people in america for this legislation. the people in america demand this legislation. i would suggest that the people in my state of tennessee. and i would guess the people across this nation. wonder why it took so long to pass a proposition that seems to be so imbued in basic common sense. so perhaps that day has changed. i hope we are winning it now. as i speak. mr. president. in the first place. it is the fair thing to do. that has been so aptly discussed and described by earlier speakers today. second. mr. president. i would like to bring up an additional point. and that is. in mry observation. the people of this country. in many respects. are unfortunately losing confidence in our countrys institutions. people more and more. i believe. mr president. are feeling alienated from their government in this country. i think that that certainly has to do with the congress of the united states. i believe that people more and more feel that the congress has lost touch with people who work hard. pay their taxes. obey the laws and regulations. and are seldom heard from except when additional revenues are needed. so. i believe that this legislation is the first of many reforms that we will be discussing here in the next several days that will help restore the confidence that the people must have in the peoples branch of government. the congress of the united states. we cannot stop this cynicism and this feeling of alienation. mr. president. by ourselves. but the congress of the united states can stop contributing to it. mr. president. i believe in the years to come that this body will be a messenger of bad news to the american people if we do our job. if we are responsible. when we look at the economic picture down the road. when we look at the budgetary problems we will be facing in this country. we will not always have good news to bring to the american people. i believe the american people are up to it. however. i believe when we deliver that message.-the american people must be able to trust the messenger. and i think. again. that is what we are about here today. the .first step in that process. in addition to those reasons. i think that another pretty commonsense proposition applies. and that is that. if the congress of the united states had to live under the laws they passed for everybody else. maybe we would not have so many laws and. thereby. maybe we would not have so many regulations. i think it has become entirely too easy in this country. in this congress. to spend other peoples money and regulate other peoples lives. that is what i believe congress has spent too much time on for too many years. i think for the first time under this legislation. members of congress. who understandably are concerned with cost. understandably are concerned with inconvenience and all of these other things. for the first time will start to realize the problems that people out in the country who have to live under these laws have experienced. and maybe. just maybe. we might want to. in the future. reconsider some of the laws that have already been passed and some of the rdgulations that have been promulgated pursuant to those laws. i think. in looking at this legislation. legislation of much detail. much work. that there are a couple basic criteria that i look for: no. 1. that it be comprehensive. and when i study this legislation. i see that every comparable law here is. indeed. applied to congress. second. there must be access to the court system. i examined this legislation and. indeed. we do have access to the court system. those bringing actions against the officers and members of congress of the united states. indeed. have court access. it is not just the laws under this legislation that will apply to congress but the regulations will also. also. congress under this legislation does not.exempt itself from the numerical limitations that are afforded to small businesses which would exempt congress from coverage under many of these laws. so i think we are moving in the right direction. is the legislation perfect? i would say not. could it go further? indeed. i would like to see it go a bit further. but i think that.we can revisit this at times in the future. i think the question of ultimate liability is

more funds for federal agencies that finance trade with. and aid to. developing countries. the push comes from executives at such companies as american telephone & telegraph co. caterpillar inc. and general electric corp. their reasoning is that a larger pool of government financing will allow u.s. companies to offer more competitlve terms when bidding on bigticket contracts in cashstrapped third world markets. \"since this is a buyers market. you have to have financing. were prepared to match our technology with anybodys. but in some cases our customers are offered deals they cant refuse.\" said ronald . pump. a lawyer at at&ts federal government affairs office in washington. china. for example. is said to be the recent beneficiary of a 30year. erointerest loan in a telecommunications contract with swedens telefon ab lm ericsson. \"financing is the lifeblood of what were doing. bell labs notwithstanding. its often more important what (the u8. exportimport bank and the us. agency for international development) do.\" mr. pump said. bell labs is the creative genius behind at&ts telecommunications equipment. \"we wont win many orders without the best price.\" said frank p. doyle. a ge senior vice president. \"but without competilive financing. we wont win any orders at awl\" the bush administration and capitol hill may abhor the practice of mixed credits. argued caterpillars wallsi w. beddow. manager of government affairs in the comparys washington office. but this practice. under which governments engineer loans and grants to subsidize the sale of their companies goods overseas. is the rule rather than the exception in the current compettive environment. like the administration. \"caterpillar would prefer to compete based on price and quality. but unfortunately. we dont dictate the competitive enviromnent.\" mr. beddow said. \"the united states should have the same tools available to its companies that are available to its competition. we clearly have to have accem to simiar forms of financing. the united states has been really far behind in offering the kind of expert financing terms the rest of the world is of fering. all sorts of concessionary financing is available.\" he said. competition is most cutthroat in capital equipment markets like construction. transportation. power generation. telecommunications and mining. us. executives say. according to a recent exim bank study. the united states loses some $400 million to $800 million a year in exports because its companies cannot match the mixed credit and other concessionary financing packages offered by their rivals in western europe and japan. private surveys put those losses at $24 billion to $4.8 billion annually. and the losses are longterm. said howard lewls. vice president of international economic affairs at the national association of manufacturers. \"once you lose a capital goods project. youve lost it for a while. its not the simpleminded analogy of win a few. lose a few. he said. \"that may be good in economls 101. capital projects are more analogous to buying a house. youre making a major commitment. and the factors involved are more complicated than the factors involved in buying a box of cereal.\" according to the nam vice president. \"its even more difficult to get back into that market later on because the people will be used to the equipment (of your competitors).\" be added. at stake for the labor unions. meanwhile. are the jobs saved or created every time a u.s. company wins a contract to supply heavy equipment to a foreign country. \"its not only an incometrade issue. its a jobs issue.\" declared bruce b. talley. executive director of the coalition for employment through exports. also based in washington. \"we are trying to acknowledge that resources are limited. but. on the ether hand. these are resources which. if employed correctly. generate income and jobs for the u.s. economy.\" he said. according to the u.s. commerce department. merchandise exports accounted for almost 7 million jobs in the united states in 1989. that same year. about one in six us. manufacturing jobs was probably due directly or indirectly to exports. commerce said. \"jobs tend to follow financing. a us. company may get a contract abroad. if the company has the capability to source for that contract from plants around the world. it will tend to source from the plant (in the country that provides) the best financing. so from a public policy point of view. it would make sense to source n the united states to keep the jobs in the united states.\" said at&ts mr. pump. the coalition for employment through exports was formed in 1981 when the reagan administration \"tried to close down exim bank.\" as one company executive puts it. it is considered the standardbearer for the lobby to increase funding for exim bank. aid. the state departments trade development program and multilateral banks such as the new european bank for reconstruction and development. it represents a unique mix of labor unions. including the international brotherhood of electrical workers. the machinists union and the 8eafarers! union. and major exporting companies. maritime employment could gain from cargo preference arrangements linked to tieaid and mixedcredit programs. also affected by the competitiveness of u.s. capitalgoods exporters. say coalition members are the small and mediumslled companies that serve as subcontractors for major corporations. for example. subcontractors spply 65% of the manufacturing content of a ge jet engine. parts worth 45% of the engines sales dollar. according to mr. doyle. the biggest hurdle. said mr. talley. is canvinctng the office of management and budget. and the treasury department to some degre to appropriate more money for export financrg. unfortunately. they have such a hemorrhage of the budget deficit situation that it effectively (keeps them from reaching) a sound trade policy in this very finite area. they basically are unable to acknowledge the situation because that situation would require resources. and they are coming from the premise that there are no additional

act. the act is needed to correct the 1984 supreme court decision in grove city college versus bell which held that recipients of public funds need comply with the civil rights laws only in the particular program or activity to which public funds are directed. the effect of this ruling has been widespread. it ha reached far beyond the original confines of the casewhich was brought only on the question of whether student aid was a federal benefit to the college which the student attended. the supreme court ruled that it was. but the court then went to a question not raised in the case. and found that only the student aid office. which directly handled the funds. had to comply with the antidiscrimination law. no sooner was this decision handed down than the department of justice announced that it would. henceforth. apply this standard to the enforcement of all the major civil rights laws. not merely to the education act amendments on which the ruling was brought. the justice department has done precisely that. and as a result. lower court rulingswhich are required to follow supreme court precedentsand administrative action have both closed off redress against discrimination for many americans. individuals have been denied hearings when funds could not be traced directly to the salary of a professor accused of sexual harassment. or to the building in which an individual was denied the right to speak. or to the courtroom in which jurors served. in the education department alone. well over 600 cases have been suspended or dismissed because of the grove city ruling. four months ago. the 11th circuit court of appeals reversed the factual findings of a lower court than an entire states higher educational system had systematically channelled black and white students to separate institutions. not on the grounds that the government failed to show this occurred. but that it did not show precisely where each federal dollar of aid was used and how that particular program discriminated. in 1954 the supreme court finally overturned more than half a century of de jure segregation in its brown versus board of education judgment. but it was not until passage of the 1964 civil right act. with its title vi enforcement powers. that actual progress began to be made against discrimination. january 28. 1.988 the threat of losing federal funds was finally the incentive before which much segregation gave way. and in the decade of the seventies. black college enrollment almost doubled. the other statutes affected by the grove city ruling are all based on that experience. title ix of the education act amendments of 1972 extended civil rights protections to women in higher education facilities. in 1972. when the act was passed. our nations medical schools graduated 830 women as physiclans out of a total of 9.253. in 1985. 4.874 women physicians were in the graduating class of 16.041. in 1972. the nations law schools graduated 1.498 women. out of a total of 21.764. todays 37.491 graduating lawyers include 14.421 women. there can be no doubt that the doubling of black college enrollment and the increased admissions of women to graduate studies was not a fortuitous outcome. it was the result of enforcing wha.t the law has always demanded. equality of treatment. we should not have to look back to a century of racial turmoil and discrimination under the 14th amendment to the constitution to know that a written statute. even a constitutional commandment. has no effect unless it is enforced. that understanding guided the congresses which enacted the four civil rights statutes covered by this bill. those congresses moved beyond exhortation and recognized that additional incentives were necessary to promote equal treatment. there are those who like to characterize the civil rights laws as punitive. that implies that institutions have a prior right to receive federal funds and that any threat of their loss is unfair. that is not the case. federal funds are appropriated for programs which the congress judges to be in the national interest. and among the many issues that are in the national interest is the vindication of our constitutional promise of equality before the law. as the supreme court itself noted in bob jones university. any private organization enjoys the full protection of the first amendment in its beliefs or doctrine. but no private organization may expect preferential government treatment when its beliefs conflict with national policy. so when congress chose to enforce antidiscrimination efforts through the funding mechanism. it did not detract one iota from the first amendment rights of any group. individual or organization. it did offer institutions a choicethe choice between accepting federal funds and abiding by the law or not accepting federal funds. there is nothing coercive in such a regime. simply put. if an institution accepts tax funds. that institution may not discriminate. we know we cannot eliminate private prejudices and bigotry by law. but we need not and should not subsidize them. the fundamental issue at stake is that tax dollars raised from all americans should not be used to discriminate against some americans. where the issue involves. race. sex. age or handicapping condition. this is a matter of simple justice. the civil rights restoration act does nothing more than restore through statutory language the reach of the civil rights statutes to the institutions which chose to benefit from federal funds. the act does not affect any of the definitions of what constitutes discrimination. it neither expands nor narrows any of the rights that may be asserted under antidiscrimination law. the act does not alter or modify the meaning of \"recipient\". so those who are not now affected by civil rights lawsfor instance. grocers accepting food stamps. farmers accepting crop subsidies or individuals receiving social security benefitsremain unaffected by the reach of the law. as they were before the grove city decision. the act preserves exactly the same language as in current law with respect to religious organizations. it nelther narrows nor broadens it. the entire purpose and. i believe. the only effect of the bill as written. will be to restore in practice the understanding that i and most americans held before the grove city rulingnamely that when an institution chooses to benefit from public funds. it must abide by public law. including laws which outlaw discrimination. the repeated claims that the bill unacceptably expands civil rights law are untrue. the definitions of unfair treatment which exist in regulations. in case law and in practice are neither broadened nor narrowed by this bill. i very much regret that the presidents state of the union message included this misleading and inaccurate claim about the civil rights restoration act. and i sincerely trust that he will not veto this very simple and straightforward legislation. when it reaches him. we have already waited too long to correct the statutory deficiencies that the supreme court found in these four civil rights laws. over the past 4 years. many cases. some reaching back more than a decade in some instances. have been abandoned. dismissed. and suspended as a result of the congressional failure to act. these cases are not merely statistics. each one involves a fellow american whose life has been directly affected. students have found their study plans delayed and. in some instances. ended. disabled persons have lost jobs and the chance for independence and personal selfrespect. women have seen career choices and opportunities foreclosed. we should end this unfairness now. we should reinstate and reaffirm the 20yearlong struggle to vindicate the civil rights of every american. from 1964 until the earlier years of this decade. there was a bipartisan congressional consensus that civil rights laws must be vigorously enforced. that consensus reflected the overwhelming demand of the american people. who were no longer satisfied with a status quo which treated some of them unfairly. the effort to give life to the great ideals of our constitution has always been a struggle against entrenched habit. accepted convention and comfortably establisled inequities. that is as true today as it was in 1964. over the past three decades. the majority of americans has concluded that we want a society where equality of treatment is not restricted to men. or to white men. or to the physically capable. or to the young. we have concluded that this is not the american ideal. and we know that we cannot wait passively for a just society to evolve over time. we know that to achieve justice. we must pursue justice. the pending legislation is an essential element of that effort. it must be approved."},{"1":"1987","2":"DOMENICI","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. we judged these young people

to visit philadelphia to see what they could see about the hall where the delegates sat and look at that history and see some of the documents. i decided that i might take a few minutes and think about the constitution as it applies. as i see it. and why we ought to revere it and what it means to be an american and free under that document. so permit me. mr. pres ident. for the young people from my state who are here and for the senate and for the senates record to give you a few thoughts as i view this constitution. mr. president. 80 years ago. my parents in italy were making their plans to sail to this country. you know what they called this countryamericanovo mondothe new world. a new world where any one. regardless of his race. religion. or economic background. could make it. a new world where dreams could be made to come true. any yet this new world has the oldest constitution in the world. we are the oldest freely elected government in the world i think even our founding fathers might be surprised by the durability of the charter they forged. remember the lady who approached benjamin franklin as the convention ended two centuries ago this september? \"what kind of government did you give us. dr. franklin?\" she asked. \"a republic.\" franklin replied. \"if you can keep it.\" well. the founding fathers underestimated their achievement. 80 years ago as my parents were planning to immigrate here. william gladstone. the great british prime minister. called \"the us. constitutionthe noblest document ever conceived by a group of men at a given time.\" well. what is it that makes it so great? very simply. it is the balance between liberty and order. you see. if we had total liberty. it would be anarchy. but complete and total order would require a totalitarian state. the difference is that in the soviet union and other totalitarian states like nazi germany. the government owns the people. but in oursthe people own the government. and general washington gave the assembling delegates in philadelphia in april 1787 this summons. \"let us raise a standard\". he said. \"to which the wise and honest can repair.\" what a splendid idealand the founding fathers did just that. yet with the rights of liberty there is a load of responsibility. when abraham lincoln journeyed by train to washington from illinois to be inaugurated in 1861. he asked that the train make a detour to philadelphia. on washingtons birthday he made a stop to visit independence hall where the constitution was drafted. lincoln delivered some brief remarks and ended saying: finally. my fellow citizens. it is not with the presidents or with politicians. but with you. remains the questionshall the freedom forged by our founding fathers be preserved for posterityfor our childrens chil. dren? lincoln knew that a democracy unlike a dictatorship is not reliant on extraordinary leadersbut on rather ordinary peopleordinary people who go about the ordinary tasks of citizenship extraordinarily well. benjamin franklin in the closing day of debate in philadelphia in september 1787 said something similar. he said that if the charter fails. it will not be because of what he and others had just written. but because of what we the people later did. our constitution with its appended bill of rights and its guaranteed freedoms is based on an ideaand ours is the only country in history that is based on an ideal. other countries owe the reason for their existence to race. religion. or language. but ours is based on an idealthat all men are created equal. oh. i know that there are some critics who say that we have not always lived up to that idealthat we have not always lived up to those ideals our founding fathers wrotewell. if thats trueisnt that because no other country ever wrote higher ideals to live up to? this idealthat anyone regardless of racial. religious. or economic backgroundcan find fulfillment. that is the ideal that jefferson wrote in 1776that is what washington meant in his appeal to the delegates in 1787 or that is what lincoln said at gettysburg in 1863that \"government of the people. by the people. and for the people should not perish from the earth.\" oh. i know there are some who say that the ideal that anyone despite color. class or creed can seek his own destiny. shape his own future. they say its a dream. they are right. it is a dream.

institutionalized freedom. responsible government and human equality. but that fact places an inescapable burden on youon all of us. theodore roosevelt is that other president besides washington. jefferson. and lincoln who has his face carved on mount rushmore. president theodore roosevelt was once asked by a citizen after a speech. \"mr. president. you just spoke on the constitution and about our duty as citizens. but im just an ordinary smalltown businessman. what can i do?\" and theodore roosevelt in that high staccato voice of his replied. \"do what you canwhere you arewith all your heart. but do it.\" well. we honor the constitution when we obey the law. when we vote. when we serve on jury duty. when we pay our taxes. and when we lay a wreath on a veterans grave. but reverence for our constitution. love of our country is more than a series of actsits an attitude. its more than a series of observances. its an obligation. patriotism is not just the sentiment of 1 dayits the commitment of a life time. and dont we honor the constitution and dont we justify the confidence our founding fathers placed in us when we continue to build an america on the foundation they so nobly laid. it is our duty to reforge that faith. when we as parents make our house a homewhen we as workers make our job our vocationwhen we as citizens make our communities a neighborhoodand when we as members of a church or synagogue make our creed our lifes workwe reforge that faith. we redeem that dream. i believe in that dreamthe american dreambecause i saw it come true in my life. in my own

one of the other criticisms raised by the distinguished senator from ohio is that s. 1848 raises a dangerous double standard. that obviously is ridiculous. first. mr. president. no drug exported under this bill would be \"dangerous\" in the normal sense of. the word. each drug will have been approved for safety and effectiveness by a sophisticated foreign drug approval agency adequate to undertake the review and equivalent to our own fda. i agree with senator kennedy that it is arrogance to say that the united states is the only nation in the world that has the degree of sophistication necessary to approve drugs. it is arrogance. i just have to be honest about a number of the organizations the distinguished senator from ohio has cited. that they always overstate everything. frankly. some of them are very sincere. but their sincerity files in the face of reality. flies in the face of what we are trying to do. it shows an underlying misunderstanding of what is going on here. - despite the emotionalism which the bills opponent invokes with the use of the term \"double standard.\" this bill does not set up a double standard. rather. it recognizes different standards and judgments. there are no absolute standards of safety and efficacy and there are relatively few if any absolutely safe and effective drugs. very few. each country assesses the relative safety and efficacy of drugs based on its balancing of risks of using. the drug versus the benefits conferred by its use. different countries will properly reach different conclusions from time to time. based on their peculiar disease and demographic profiles. and on the quality of their health care delivery systems. their resources. and other factors. further. because a balancing is involved rather than a measurement against an absolute standard. similar countries will sometimes legitimately reach different conclusions. third. academic and governmental experts around the worldincluding the united nationsrecognize these differences and see them as proper. legitimate. even necessary differences. not as \"double standards.\" fourth. i might add. s. 1848 does not send a message that. \"these drugs are not good enough for us but they are good enough for you.\" as the distinguished senator from ohio states. first. the bill clearly prohibits the export of drugs which have been rejected by the food and drug administration. drugs which we have determined to be not up to our requirements. it speaks only to drugs which have not yet been shown to be safe and effective to the fda. on the other hand. while making no findings on whether \"they are good enough for you.\" the bill says we feel that certain advanced foreign countries should have been given the opportunity to make their own judgments about these drugs. fifth and finally. it is incorrect to say that such organizations as the united nations or the european parliament or the organization of american states are working to tighten up drug exports from developed countries into developing and underdeveloped nations. even were this so. it is difficult to see how s. 1848 would run counter to these efforts since. with the exception of topical disease drugs. it authorizes shipments only to sophisticated or developed countries. but it is accurate to say that proposals to restrict exports from developed countries to developing and underdeveloped nations have been suggested to these organizations and are supported by the activist groups identified by the senator in his minorityoviews. it is enlightening to know that the broader agenda of these groups is to undermine patent protections. to greatly restrict the types of pharmaceuticals available in the developing world. thereby condemning- many third world inhabitants to needless pain. suffering. and death. block the free enterprise system in key industries. curtail the activities of western multinational corporations. and. most importantly. establish a global welfare state by the massive but shortsighted shift of resources from the devleoped to the developing countries. mr. president. that is really what is behind these obscure but vocal organizations that senator metzenbaum has been bringing to our attention. it sounds great to get up and talk about a letter here and a letter there from some of these groups. they may be important in the eyes of many people but let us understand what they are about. their philosophy runs counter to the philosophy of almost everybody in the u.s. senate and u.s. house of representatives. frankly. it is difficult for me to understand how senator metzenbaum or any other senator could stand on this floor and make the arguments he has just made in light of the way this bill is written and in light of the way present law actually operates. another criticism he brought up is that the export of unapproved drugs under s. 1848 will undermine the integrity and the reputation of the \"made in america\" label. mr. president. now. come on. drugs exported to first- and secondtier countries permitted under this bill will have been approved for safety and efficacy by the sophisticated regulatory agency of at least one developed country. it is arrogance to think that our fda is the only one in the world that can do a good job. because of this and other safeguards in the bill. it is quite unlikely that any unapproved pharmaceutical exported under s. 1848 will pose a significant -health risk abroad. so the argument is ridiculous. the \"made in america\" argument is completely speculative. the committee received no evidence that the term \"made in america\" is commonly. if ever. found on pharmaceuticals made in america and shipped abroad. as the senator has pointed out. in manyperhaps mostcases. a pharmaceutical whose active ingredients are manufactured in this country will be finished abroad. maybe tableted. encapsulated. and so on. and will be packagd abroad. thus one would suppose it unlikely for these products to bear a \"made in america\" label. more to the point. however. is the realization that the world does not operate as assumed by those who make this ridiculous argument. the interference is that foreign consumers will assume that the product is either safe or approved because it is made in this country. however. we have no reason to believe that even sophisticated foreign consumers will draw this conclusion. i note here in general that we export many extremely and explicitly hazardous products from industrial chemicals to weapons and it is hard to imagine that consumers immediately conclude that such products are safe because they are produced in america. indeed. even if we narrow tae focus to pharmaceuticals. we.should remember that some categories of unapproved drugs can currently be exported under section 801(d). complete with the \"made in america\" label. if allowed by local law while others :may not. the conclusion that this lableoforigin argument is speculative and manufactured is strengthened when we remember that \"made in west germany.\" \"made in japan.\" cr \"made in switzerland\" can be affixed to drugs not approved in those countries. aad there is no evidence that foreign consumers believe those drugs to have been approved by their nations of origin. nor is there any reason to believe that those countries drug export policies have damaged the value of their labels of origin. it is much more rational to conclude that a product which causes injury abroad will bting suspicion upon its manufacturer and that manufacturers other branded products. and this is proper and deserved. this is related to the fact that \"made in america\" is unlikely to appear on many drugs. whether approved or unapproved. which are marketed abroad by u.s. companies. our own fda does not permit countryoforigin designations on consumer containers of prescription drugs. thus. i strongly suspect that comparative judgments by consumers are much more based on brandname recognition. it seems much more likely to me that a consumer would perfer a drug because it is made by merck or upjohn or smithkline. regardless of where the drug is made. and domestic companies are of course free under current law to manufacture unapproved drugs overseas and ship them abroad. thus. i believe s. 1848 would make no difference at all in the minds of foreign consumers. again. this whole issue is contrived and without substance. it seeks to play upon our emotions. and i might say. upon some peoples sense of chauvinism. another criticism by my colleague from ohio. he claims that transshipment of unapproved drugs will not be prevented by s. 1848. again. if you look at the bill. if you look at the arguments. it is a spurious argument. s. 1848 contains finely crafted provisions addressing transshipment. it does not purport to block any possible presence in unauthorized countries. it is simply not practical to try to control those drugs once they have left the control of the importer. however. this in no way detracts from the merits of this particular bill. that is because even if this bill does not pass. a particular unapproved drug may be manufactured overseas and exported to any country where it is legal. if the bill passes. the same unapproved drug may or may not find its way to the same countries depending upon the acts of subsequent actors in the purchase chain. however. the situation is not different under this scenario from that under current law. current law is unable. simply unable. to prevent the presence in any country of any drug since it simply leads to the production of unapproved drugs overseas. it is a consequence of current law that in moving abroad they also are not subject to any kind of regulation. any type of regulatory control or protection. therefore. it makes no sense to criticize this bill because under some scenarios. extreme ones at that. the same thing could happen as happens now on a daily basis under current law. this bill actually corrects current law and has carefully crafted provisions in it to decrease transshipment. nor is the problem one of enforcement as the senator has stated. hearing testimony by the food and drug administration and the pharmaceutical manufacturers association reflect the impracticality of our trying to control the trade in pharmaceuticals among downstream independent purchasers in foreign countries. such a task would consume enormous resources but would not succeed even if it were permitted by foreign governments. the labor and human resources committee. the committee which i chair. recognized this and instead imposed duties and corresponding penalties on exporters to take all measures in their control to ensure that neither they nor their importers were engaged in improper transshipment. however. we realized that it would be unfair and that it would gut the bill if we attempted to impose these heavy penalties on manufacturers for conduct which was beyond their control. all in a fruitless attempt to prevent. a situation that occurs right now under current law with no protections whatsoever. this bill gives us protections. i really cannot understand why the senator from ohio prefers current law to the improvements on current law contained in s. 1848. certainly it is not because current liw affords consumers in the world any protection. because it does not. this bill does. and it clearly does. additional restrictions under s. 1848 occur in an imminent hazard situation. while it can be normally expected that drugs exported under these amendments and found in unauthorized countries will cause no harm there. having been already approved as safe and effective by at least one competent foreign agency from one of 15 of the greatest countries in the world from a drug approval standpoint. additional export restrictions may be imposed if the drug does pose an imminent hazard to health in those countries. these duties and restrictions were carefully considered by the committee and are enforceable by the appropriate agencies in contrast with the impracticality and pointlessness of the acrosstheboard prohibition on all transhipment which the senator from ohio seems to feel necessary. the responsibilities this bill would place upon the department of health and human services and the department of agriculture are quite manageable. they are fully consistent with the statement by the food and drug administration quoted in the senators minority views. let me just answer just one other criticism. the distinguished senator has indicated that s. 1848 will not assist the development of drugs that treat tropical diseases. i have to admit this bill has never been touted as a panacea or a cureall for third world health problems. such an ambitious proposal certainly is beyond the u.s. congress. however. as the committee report on s. 1848 points out. \"there is no doubt that the provisions of s. 1848 will help.\" as pointed out in testimony by third world health experts before the labor and human resources committee. \"export authority would make it feasible for u.s. manufacturers to undertake research in response to emergency situations. such as epidemics. arising overseas.\" in such situations. the country in need requires effective drugs as soon as possible. it will not have time to wait for a u.s. manufacturer to obtain fda approval and will turn to foreign nations for remedies developed there. this has happened before. and it is expected that it will happen again. the bill will make it more economical for u.s. manufacturers to focus on third world drugs by making it possible for them to piggyback on existing production facilities in this country and by assuring them that their production facilities can remain in close conjunction with their research centers. in some cases this may make a difference between whether a company decides to pursue development of a third world drug or not. the bill makes tropical drugs explicitly eligible for the developmental assistance and market protection of the orphan drug act. finally. senator merzenbaum has noted in his minority views to the committee report that we should take comfort from the number of tropical disease drugs already in the pipeline. he lists four drugs. one said to be approved. two under review at the agency. and one not yet submitted. in fact. the one listed as approved has been approved only in livestock and the sponsoring manufacturer has no plans to submit it to fda for approval in human use. precisely because of the lack of market in this country. thus. we are talking about three remaining potential drugs that the distinguished senator from ohio has brought up. i am sorry. but i cannot take much comfort in those kinds of statistics. compared with the hundreds. if not thousands. of severe. devastating diseases which plague the undeveloped world. the drugs submitted for fda review simply. will not count for much. indeed. the paucity of tropical disease drugs submitted to fda illustrates how great a damper current policy puts on their development. this bill will help them to develop more for the benefit of these undeveloped countries. also. i would like to address the european parliament letter. this letter. which is illogical and disturbing in its claims. is signed by 52 members. this represents about onetenth of the membership of that body. i might add that is not only a small minority. it is a pitiful minority. and you may be sure that the drafters of this document knocked on all 500plus doors. further. the political composition is informative. we find here a group of byandlarge radical activists opposed to western free market capitalism. we find. of the 52. 9 communists. 25 socialists. and 15 of the socalled rainbow group.i might add a lot of the other socalled worldwide backing against this bill is of the same ilk. just as significantly. the gist of the letter is that we should not ship to europe drugs not yet approved in the united states. because their own european regulatory agencies are not trustworthy or competent. this is the same rhetoric we hear from zerorisk activitists in our country who do not trust our own fda. in fact. i would have to say that many of these people are zerorisk activists themselves. people who are not satisfied with anything. no matter what we do. and who would probably find lots of fault with our own fda. the view of these people concerning the adequacy of european agencies is certainly not adopted by the scientific community in this country or in europe. regardless of support by a small minority of politiciansand i might add. that they are politiciansin the european parliament. they deserve to be treated with respect. and i do not mean to imply in my remarks here today that i do not respect their right to speak out. but let us understand who they are. senator metzenbaum makes it sound as though all the thinking people in the world are against this bill. i call to his attention to 13to2 vote against him in our committee. and our committee is a pretty good composite of this body. there is no question that it is pretty well evenly divided. it goes from the far left to the far right. with everything in between. and the vote was 13 to 2. in conclusion. let me point out that radical opposition to this bill is not hard to find. i do not mean to demean my dear friend from ohio. but much of the offshore criticism is incited by antiamerican. antiwestern. often procommunist factions in many parts of the world. but i hope we would not let ourselves be influenced by the voices of thai students. for example. who have little understanding of the issues involved or of the facts of the situation. or even of the operation of this particular legislation. i hope that we would instead be influenced by more moderate. reasonable. respected voices like those of dr. donald kennedy. former fda commissioner and now president of stanford university. who supports this bill. or of dr. paulo machado. former health minister of brazil. who argues eloquently for the right and necessity of third world authorities governing their own affairs. if we pass this bill. we will be listening to people like that. we will be making good policy. i think those are facts. let us talk about the bottom line here. the real issue is ignored by the critics of this bill. the real issue is the impact of the bill. when compared to the results of current policy. on the foreign consumer. under current policy. every drug which may be exportable under these amendments and all others besides can be manufactured in foreign plants under few. if any. controls and shipped anywhere in the world. thus. all of the potential problems which the critics such as our friend from ohio claim can happen if these amendments are passed are happening right now as we speak. and many of them will not happen if this bill is passed because the bill has plenty of protections in it. there is. in short. no evidenqe that this bill will affect the types of drugs available to foreign consumers at all with the possible exception of the tropical disease drugs. while through its requirements it ensures greater quality and imposes much greater fda control on those drugs produced in the united states and exported. is there any evidence that the current ban on the export of unapproved pharmaceuticals saves any lives? the answer is a resounding no. is there evidence that the defeat of s. 1848 will prevent any injury to foreign consumers? the answer is a resounding no. as a matter of fact. will s. 1848 help consumers? the answer is a resounding yes. this bill effects a net improvement in the situation for consumers. it will save american jobs. and it will lower our balance of payment deficit. i think we ought to cut through the rhetoric and pass this bill. this is a very good bill. it has broad bipartisan support. for the life of me. as intelligent as the distinguished senator from ohio is. i have grave difficulty understanding his arguments and even understanding why he makes some of the arguments he does. or even why he thinks the way he does. but i give him creditfor standing up for his beliefs. and taking the time of the senate to do so. i hope we can proceed to amendments and i am prepared to do so right now. if we can. mr. president. i suggest the absence of a quorum."},{"1":"1985","2":"MONTGOMERY","3":"E","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. last night my good friend. the gentleman from arkansas . the very able ranking minority member of the committee on veterans affairs. was the principal speaker at the banquet session of the national executive committee meeting of the american legion in indianapolis. in. there have been many articles written and much debate has taken place pertaining to benefits and services for veterans. i call to the attention of my colleagues the remarks made by our good friend from arkansas because i think he has stated clearly not only his position. but the position of the overwhelming majority of members of the house. relating to our commitment to our nations veterans. mr. speaker. it is appropriate that these remarks be placed in the congressional record in . view of the action in the house yesterday when we paid tribute to veterans in observance of the 40th anniversary of ve day: commander bacon. distinguished members of the national executive committee of the american legion. past national commanders. distinguished guests. and ladies and gentlemen: may i first of all thank you sincerely for inviting me to come to the banquet meeting of your national executive committee. it is good for me to be able to pause in the midst of a congressional session and to refleet with each of you on a number of matters of mutual concern. i am sure that your excellent legislative staff led by phil riggin and paul egantogether with your rehabilitation and economic staffhave advised you on the current status of these issues. just yesterday. our house committee on veterans affairs acted on many of them. they involved compensation. medical care. jobs for veterans. g.l loans. and national cemeteries. they also involved the administration of veterans programs by the veterans administration. in one meeting of the committee we acted on some 40 separate and distinct proposals. most of which are subjects of american legion official positions. let me mention just a. few of them that i consider very important and upon which your organization has mandates from your last national converition. firstly. our committee doesnt. intend to let the 58 regional offices of the veterans administration be consolidated into 3 locations. just the opposite is true. if we prevail through the entire congressional process. at least. one regional office in every state will exist as a matter of law and once and for all this consolidation proposal that comes to us every few years will have been put to rest. our committee has also expressed its will on two other matters of more than passing interest to the american legiork in sense of the congress resolutions we reported to the full house of representatives our opposition to any increase in fees on the origination of g.i. loans. and we made it very clear that any idea of taxing the compensation of disabled service connected veterans has absolutely no support in the congress of the united states. as to this latter proposal. i must. state to you that it is not even officially before the congress. it is merely someones thought over at the treasury department in terms of making a recommendation to the president. it is my hope that the idea will never even go to the white house from treasury. but if it does. i trust it. will be summarily discarded. in any event. i can tell you that it will never see the light. of a legislative day in the congress. of that you can be certain. in a more positive vein. other legislation reported by our committee is intended to improve the va medical program in several different ways. we want to pass legislation to meet medical needs of the aging veteran. we know that these needs are going to require a dynamic approach as veterans reach their golden years and we want va to be ready to meet the challenge. i know that the legion is very concerned about a crisis situation in va tiedicne with respect to recruitment of certain medical and administrative employees. an otherwise good governmentwide attempt.to reduce the number of highgrade employees and thereby save federal money has failed to take into account that.vas department of medicine and suigery already had a good record in this regard. by applying a total government reduction to such employees equally in both the agencies with good records and those not so good. va has been very adversely affected. particularly as to psychologists. social workers. and pharmacists. the legislation we reported yesterday is designed to correct this situation. the legion can take considerable credit for this action. your national survey about the crisis gave our committee valuable information that gave impetus to our action. in the compensation area. we are delaying action for the moment on a costofliving increase. we have determined in our committee that such increases should be consistent with all other entitlement programs. for instance. if social security goes up by a certain percentage. it is our view that compensation. which holds an even higher priority on the national agenda. should also. go up by at least that same percentage. let me dwell on this subject for just a moment. when the various veterans organizations have had representatives before our committee over these past few months we have asked repeatedly. \"what. would be your view if all entitlements were frozen?\" almost without exception. these representatives said that their organizations understood the tremendous deficit problem of our cotutry and that if alt these other entitlements were frozenincluding social securitythey would be willing to do their part and that their organizations would forgo cola increase requests. the american legion was in the forefront of these kinds of statements and i want to commend you not only for your view but for your leadership in a most difficult area. it is an example of patriotism at its very best and in the finest traditions of the american legion. quite frankly. i dont want to predict how this issue will finally be resolved. but no matter what is finally decided. the record will clearly show that the legion was in the forefront of being willing to sacrifice one of its major goals in order to assist fn achieving national fiscal responsibility. i said earlier that i know that. your tegislative representatives keep you well informed. i know therefore that you are up to date on the g.i. loan issue. the national cemetery issue. the servfcemens group life issue. and all the rest. i know. too. that you are up to date on vas budget. with respect to the budget. in my opinion va has fared rather wellthus far at least. all of us know that our nation is faced with a huge. deficit problem. we do ourselves no justice if we ignore it. but we also do ourselves and the agency of government called the veterans administration no justice either if we ignore its special needs.. for my part. those special needs require special consideration by the congress. when i say special. i do not mean that we ought not to be financially frugal in our recommendations. but i have often stated and i now repeat my philosophy of government as it pertains to -the veterans of this nation. this member of congress believes that: those who served our country in time of war deserve a special status among our citizenry. adequate benefits for those who were disabled by their military service must be. the prime concern of the congress and the people.of this nation.. benefits for americas disabled veterans are not a drain on the american taxpayer. those benefits are acontinuing cost of war. veterans of our nations wars must never become public charges. and finally. i state to you that. any position on any matter that is inconsistent with what i have just said. will have my unrelenting opposition and any position that is in accdrdh with it will have my unrelenting support. mr. commander. our nation lives in difficult and challenging times. representatire government always does. but in terms of benefits forveterans. i believe our country has every reason to be very proud of itself. we have the best veterans program of any nation in the world. we do more for our veterans than anyone else. history clearly shows that we do not shrink from our responsibilities nor from our challenges. we accept those responsibilities and we welcome those challenges. in this land called the united states of america. there are those who often have divergent military. social and economic agendas there are those who have fortunately not actually been personally involved in war and on occasion perhaps they lack full understanding of what the nation owes to those who have fought those wars. but. we ought to note that these are not bad or evil e 2111 people norin my vieware they antiveteran people. they may be uninformed and they may need education. and if that be true. our taskyours and mineis clear. we must inform. and we must educate. you of the american legion have been doing this for generations and you will be doing it for generations to come. and i applaud you for that. and now. let me mention a little bit of philosophy which i am certain you share in great abundance. america has a soul and because of this she finds nothing pleasant about war. after the spanishamerican war. secretary of state hayes is quoted as having said that is was a \"splendid war.\" on still another occasion. he described it as a \"jolly war.\" i do not know what promped those remarks and perhaps i take them out of context. but to me nothing about war is splendid and nothing about it is jolly. on the contrary. you and i are reminded daily of the horror of war for we deal with its most tragic consequences * * * all involved with horrible memories. heartache and suffering. both personally and officially. we know war for what it really is and we have a bitter distaste for it. but with that distaste we also have a quiet confidence that our nation has waged war only when it had no other choice. we also have a quiet confidence that when war is ended our nation has a conscience that is second to none in the world. that conscience has created an unequaled program for our nations veterans. the american legion has been a grand architect of that program and it has a right to an.unequaled pride. you need never be ashamed to proclaim the goodness of that great effort. you have greatly assisted in creating the best medicine. the best benefits. the best ideal. and yes. too. the best dream. and it is not bad to dream. when we have had imperfections in the past you have dreamed of their correction. and corrections have come about. when there have been doubts about vas future. va has survived and become stronger. and had more vitality. and the doubts have subsided. the record is clear that your efforts and the efforts of those of kindred spirits have been primarily responsible. commander bacon. you and your associates meet at a time of historical memories. today. may 8. we commemorate the.40th anniversary of the allied victory in europe. a few months later the war far across the world from europe also came to an end. these worldwide conflicts to overcome unspeakable tyranny saw our nation enter a period of uneasy peace that was to be shattered later in korea and then in vietnam. from these three wars. and the one of a generation before. came the membership of the american legion. that membership is a bulwark of strength for our country. your motto speaks of god and country and expresses a deep respect and reverence for each. that respect and that reverenceand the actions to which they have given birthare the essence of the goodness of a nation that is truly blessed. and now let me conclude. mr. commander. by mentioning a statement you recently made concerning the presidents visit to germany. during that visit he placed a wreath at a cemetery where german soldiers are buried. the advance word .of this ceremony caused consternation in many areas. including the ranks of your organization. the ceremony is now over and in its wake you publicly commented that the presidents statement at the wreath laying was excellent. you said that he mentioned his hopes for friendship with the german people. his hopes for freedom in the world. his hopes for reconciliation. his understanding and grief concerning the great trials and tribulations suffered by the jewish community at the hands of the nazis and finally his gratitude for the constributions of the veterans of this nation. finally. mr. commander. you stated your belief that the president would never purposely show insensitivity to any group. these remarks were to the point. and i associate myself with them. strong feelings have been expressed about this entire event. pent up emotions in such a situation are perfectly understandable. speaking for the american legion. you said forcefully what you had to say before the presidents visit to germany and now you have said what needed to be said in its aftermath. i congratulate you for your forthrightness in both of these instances. these recent events and the commemoration of ve day remind us that the american legion is a creature of americas wars. you have a solemn resblve which is captured by lincolns precious words as to the veterans of those wars.. i share that resolve and i share your belief in the greatness of the american people. i also share your resolute determination to assure that our nations veterans will always have a benefits program that will beand ought to bethe very definition of the american ideal. this is an ideal which says that we are alleach in our own waythe disciples of a spendid hope for those who have defended freedom here at home and around the world. it is a hope that there will be complete fulfillment of your very legitimate aspirations for a good today but a better tomorrow. those who have honorably worn the uniform of our land in its times of national and international peril deserve no less from all of the american citizenry. the blessings of our land are perhaps not always fully appreciated by some. but i know that they are fully appreciated by those who are in this audience. it is an honor indeed to be asked to speak to the leaders of the american legion and i am most grateful that you would ask that ishare these moments with you. thank youeach of youso very

support of h.r. almost every time i return to my district. i hear of factories in the pittsburgh area that are closing or reducing their operations. the loss of skilled workers who operate these factories is critical. when these workers join the ranks of the unemployed or are siphoned off into other occupations. america loses a vital resourcethe experience and knowledge built up over many generations of industrial labor. we need to enact h.r. 5540. the defense industrial base revitalization act. to help make american industry more competitive. if we would find ourselves in a crisis. it will be too ate to remedy the decline in industrial plants and their cadre of skilled workers. this is why it is imperative that we enact h.r. 5540 so we can begin the job of restoring the productive capacity needed to sustain our defense posture. this bill has several related thrusts. it offers financial assistance to modernize aging and industrial plants and equipment. it offers training and retraining programs to provide workers with necessary skills. it offers means to reduce u.s. dependence on other nations for strategic materials. it provides assistance to institutions of higher learning for obtaining or modernizing equipment needed to train professional and technical personnel. and it calls for the development of a national infrastructure strategy so the nations highways. rails. bridges. waterways. and other public facilities can speed production and transport defense materiel promptly to our armed forces. financial assistance to small and medium size businesses may be in the form of loan guarantees. direct loans. purchase agreements. or price guarantees. aid would go to firms defined as critical to the defense effortcurrent or futureby the secretary of defense. this is conceived as a 5year program and would be funded at $1.35 billion a year. states would share the costs of the skills training programs. starting at 10 percent the first year and up to 50 percent in the fifth year. h.r. 5540 emerged from hearings of the economic stabilization subcommittee of the house committee on banking. finance and urban affairs. these hearings. held in washington and many areas of the country. including pittsburgh. revealed the depressed state of the industrial economy and the dangers this posed to our national security. as a representative of a heavily industrialized area. i must tell you that small- and mediumsize firms are in particularly serious trouble. they are struggling to keep from going under. without properly targeted help. their situation will remain bleak. some are saying we should do nothing about this now because the recession is about to bottom out. we have heard these same rosy forecasts for well over a year and should view them with suspicion. eager as we all are for an economic turnaround. we should face up to facts that dramatize the need for the remedies in this bill. the findings of a recent survey of over 300 small manufacturers in the pittsburgh area were made available to me by leo r. mcdonough. executive vice president of the smaller manufacturers council of western pennsylvania. the implications about interest rates. profits. backlog orders. and employment struck me as pertinent to this legislation. about interest rates. i think many people forget that the prime rate is only part of the story. at the time of this survey. the prime was 16 percent. of 224 firms responding about their current debts. 38 of them are borrowing at interest rates between 16 and 17 percent. 66 are borrowing at 17 to 18 percent. 73 are borrowing at 18 to 19 percent. 21 are borrowing at 19 to 20 percent 8 are borrowing at 20 to 21 percent. and 5 are borrowing at over 21 percent interest. i do not have to tell you that these are crippling interest rates. to complete the picture. 17 firms reported interest rates of 15 percent or lower. these morefavorable rates are not really available in the financial market. i am told they represent cases where families and friends came to the rescue of small companies that could not afford to raise capital at those typical rates i just cited. here is what. the survey shows about profits. of firms queried. 31 percent showed profits up this year. 13 percent showed no change. and 36 percent showed a drop from last year. those who reported gains showed modest increases while those who registered losses showed steep declines. moreover. if. the majority of the 20 percent who did not respond were in the loss column. the situation is even worse than these data indicate. statistics on backlog orders are particularly significant because they foreshadow the future with a fair degree of certainty. the future. based on this reading. does not look favorable. of the firms responding. 67 percent report backlog orders down from a year ago. only 32 percent.report their orders are up. i noted earlier that small manufacturers are fighting hard to stay alive. the survey bears this out when you look at layoffs and hirings. these companies had to lay off 1.444 workers during the past year. yet they managed to hire back a good proportion. or 1.024 workers. a point to emphasize here is that small business is responsible for the employment of over 80 percent of the workers in this country. this is not to downgrade the importance of the large industries. in fact. many of the small firms are subcontractors of large firms. however. if this measure beefs up the small- and mediumsize industries. as i believe it will. the impact on employment should be substantial. throughout the northeastern industrial belt of this country. these twin problems of joblessness and declining small businesses is especially severe. surveys cannot show everything. from talking to the owners and managers of the plants in my area. i can report that they are trying valiantly to modernize. to keep in the forefront of their technology. to remain competitive in home and world markets. but they feel the cards are stacked against them. these small business leaders constantly remind me.that the recently enacted tax incentives do not help them overcome the horrendous costs of borrowing so that they can make a profit and thus enjoy the tax benefits. that is why the loans. loan guarantees. and purchase agreements. or price guarantees provided in the bill are needed. as the author of a section of this bill that deals with infrastructure. i should conclude with a word about that. my district. like many other urban areas of the nation. has not been able to keep pace with the maintenance of its bridges. highways. streets. locks and dams. and other public facilities. many of these are joint city. county. state. and federal responsibilities. i am not trying to point a finger of blame at anybody. the evident fact is that deteriorating public facilities are impeding our economy. heavy trucks have to circumvent many bridges that are now unsafe. in times of national emergency. this loss of time could be critical for defense purposes. transportation. no less than manufacturing. is essential for getting material to the right places in the fastest possible tine. for these reasons. we have called for an inventory of the nations infrastructure needs as a first step in developing a comprehensive and orderly strategy for bringing them up to par. an immediate result of launching infrastructure upgrading will be to stimulate employment and the construction sectors of the economy. in conclusion. this bill is needed for our defense posture. and it should have the important side effects of reviving our economy and putting americans back to work."},{"1":"1981","2":"HOLLINGS","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"i thank the distinguished chairman. the senator. from mississippi. mr. president. these are only some of the areas in which i believe the senate may be damaging its credibility by accepting the reagan economic assumptions. let us not fool ourselves into believing that by following the presidents program we will be led out of the land of deficits and into the promised land of milk. honey. and budget surpluses. it will not be that easy. although the reconciliation instruction includes only total levels of savings to be achieved by each committee and does not require changes in specific programs. i am disturbed by some of the working assumptions used by the committee in arriving at the level of* savings. some of these assumptions are clearly shortsighted. in such areas as child nutrition. the cuts are pennywise and pound foolish. they may achieve shortrange budget savingsthey do so but only at the expense of greatly increased costs in other areas. such as education. health. and welfare in later years. rather than spending cuts. these reductions actually cause a spending increase in later years. this is not sound policy. either for the budget or the american people. the committee also rejected a proposal to change costofliving adjustments to major retirement programs. my proposal would have changed the computation of the colas in three respects. first. it would annualize all federal colas so that civil service and military retirees. who now receive colas twice a year would be treated the same as social security and veteran pensioners. second. it would index all colas to the lesser of the increase in the consumer price index or the national wage index to provide a measure of equity between workers and retirees third. it would pay all colas on october 1 to provide uniformity and make payments consistent with the octoberseptember fiscal year. together. these changes would save $8 billion in fiscal year 1982 outlays and save a total of $39 billion in outlays between fiscal years 1981 and 1986. by rejecting this proposal. the committee has merely delayed the day of reckoning and made the task of reducing federal spending all the more difficult. there is no doubt that we will have to face this question. i only hope we will have the courage to do so sooner rather than later. mr. president. while i have taken exception to some of the assumptions made by the committee and its economic base. i fully support the resolution itself and the level of savings it will achieve. i commend president reagan for sub.mitting his budget reductions and giving emphasis to the economic affairs of the party politic. i particularly commend his director of the office of management and budget. mr. david stockman. for producing the presentations. we have had our differences in those presentitions. but he has done a brilliant job in presenting the program to us clearly and cogently so that we could act on the reconciliation process on the floor of the senate at an early date. major spending reductions are essential to restoring a sound fiscal program. therefore. i reiterate i fully support the resolution itself and the level of savings it will achieve. further. the reconciliation process assures congress that budget decisions are made with regard to both their overall macroeconomic effect and their consequences for specific programs and individuals. given the magnitude of savings the budget committee is recommending. we need the fiscal coordination inherent in this process. reconciliation also sends a signal to the american people that the congress is serious about its pledge to reduce federal spending. it is the first of but a series of steps we must take to get spending under control. reduce inflation. increase productivity. and get our economy moving in the right direction to the benefit of all americans. mr. president. i particularly want to thank and commend the staff of the congressional budget office for their hard work around the clock. they have been working since last fall. and into the late evenings in the past several weeks. in order to get the economic and statistical information and data necessary for us to act as a budget committee. i especially commend and thank the minority staff. our former majority staff. they are experts. they are still. in my opinion. the better informed of the groups who really worked on this budget. they have also been working on weekends and late evenings. they have done a magnificent job. the resolution before us is in large part the result of the tireless efforts of our distinguished chairman. senator domenici. during the committee deliberations. which often ran late into the evening. he presided over us with fairness. yet always kept us moving toward our goal. under his guidance. the committee recommended the largest savings bill ever reported in the senate. senator domen4icis skill. his perser. verance. his determination. and his willinguess to coordinate. confer. and com. municate has played no small part in achieving this result. it has been a privilege and pleasure. really. to work with him. i would notify the manager of the bill. i am ready to proceed. the distinguished senator from arkansas has an amendment and then our next amendment will be presented by senator chiles. i think if we work together. and not only notify each other but notify other senators. we can keep this debate moving."},{"1":"1980","2":"DURENBERGER","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. the history of american foreign policy has. in recent years. been a history of reaction. too often. we have rushed into a given area after a crisis has developed in an attempt to patch together our interests with gestures that confer too little. too late. to too few. the result has been a foreign policy which is directed at the problems of the moment rather than the opportunities of the future. a policy which is fragmented rather than comprehensive. a policy which generates confusion rather than support among our own citizens. president carter has recently described three fundamental challenges to u.s. foreign policy: growing soviet military strength. continued dependence on imported mineral resources. and increasing social. political and economic turmoil in the third world. mr. president. these are not new challenges. they have been gaining in significance for many years. and they have been dominant for roughly the past decade. yet because of our frequent failure to anticipate the events which derive from these challenges. we have lost the initiative and surrendered a policy of coherence for isolated programs of desperation. this is as evident in central america and the caribbean as anywhere. despite the fundamental importance of these regions to our own security. our policy has for too long been characterized by inattention. ignorance. a lack of concern. and a blind acceptance of the status quo. we have frequently overlooked the problems of economic development in these nations. mistaking the support of governments for the friendship of populations. while there are many economic and political success stories in central america and the caribbean. it is clear that there are many nations facing instability because their populations labor under the twin burdens of repression and poverty. by failing to anticipate consequences and act upon opportunities. we have often been confronted with political shocks rather than smooth relations. domestic instability. as we have learned too often. frequently results in international instability. economic stagnation. disease. and suffering. if borne too long. foster the intervention of radical demagogues. thereby setting back both the policy interests of the united states and the longterm selfinterest of the nations involved. in nicaragua. we have witnessed a u.s. foreign policy which has consistently lagged some 6 months behind events. as a recent article in foreign affairs demonstrates. we failed to account for mass dissatisfaction at a time when we might have bolstered a moderate government. thereafter. we attempted to promote moderation at a time when the population had rallied behind a radical leadership. thus. by overlooking reality and pursuing a policy of reaction. we missed an opportunity to promote stability in a region of the world which concerns us all directly nicaragua is thus a case history of the failure of american foreign policy. and it bears close study if we are not to let the mistakes of the past become the path of the future. i would therefore commend to the attention of my colleagues the analysis of prof. william m. leogrande. and i ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the record."},{"1":"1979","2":"BAUCUS","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president.

add the names of senators young. packwood. and levin as additional cosponors. i would like to summarize again the reason for this resolution. to begin with. it seeks to \"hold harmless\" all the parties for 45 days in order that a longterm solution to the milwaukee railroad bankruptcy can be worked out. this is the situation as it exists today. as i see it. if congress does not act immediately on this resolution. the bankruptcy judge will almost certainly grant in the next few days the trustees petition to embargothat is a legal fiction for a defacto abandonmentover 7.000 miles of milwaukees trackage. the result of this action will be not only to cause several thousand employees to lose their jobs and hundreds of shippers to lose good rail service. but more importantly. it will set the stage for the ultimate dissolution of most of the milwaukee railroad. the past few days convinced me that. if the railroad could be kept together for a short period. there is a strong likelihood that the shippers and employees of the milwaukee railroad can buy it and operate it profitably."},{"1":"1978","2":"PERCY","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. i take note of the fact that it is now 10:57. at this very moment. at the sheraton park hotel. the president of the united states is addressing a conference that i just left because of the pending business. the white house conference on balanced national growth and economic development. the chairman of that conference is the distinguished governor of west virginia. jay rockefeller. the concept of the conference came from jennings randolph. the distinguished senior senator from west virginia. once again. west virginia has provided leadership to the nationa state relatively small in size. but very powerful. indeed. in the voice of the republic and in providing guidance for the future development of this country. i commend both governor rockefeller and senator randolph for this remarkable conference. under way since sunday. which has brought leaders appointed by governors from our 50 states and has provided a pattern of development for future economic growth in this country that will be very much in the best interests of our nation and its citizens present and future. may i also parenthetically comment that it is the hope of the senator from illinois that. through the combined leadership of government. labor. and management. the present prolonged coal strike will quickly come to an end. it is now reaching a point where it is defeating the economic interest of the very workers it is supposed to berefit. it is reaching the point where it is causing deep concern among coal purchasers about the stable source of supply of coal as a reliable fuel. i do happen to know of the extraordinary efforts being made by governor rockefeller to help bring about a settlcment on a fair and equitable basis at the earliest possible time. this would be one way to help assure balanced growth and economic development in the country. looking to the future. our future national energy policy must be based upon dramatically increasing the production and use of coal today and in the years ahead. i regretted that i had to leave the white house conference in order to be on the senate floor this morning. but senator glenn and i have worked for years together on the nuclear

person at the bottom of the employment ladder. unskilled and undereducated is actually worth in terms of productivity 60 percent. 55 perent. 53 percent. or even 52 percentas has been suggestedof the average hourly wage paid to american factory workers. which includes in its scale tool and die makers. automatic screw machine operators. punch press operators. quality control. and inspection personnel and assemblers. in our marketoriented economy. there has to be a logical relationship between pay received and value of output. indexing one persons pay as a percentage of someone else with entirely different skills and abilities is arbitrary. even irrational. the one to be most hurt by suh a system is the most highly skilled worker. in addition i felt that the inflationary effect of such indexing would impose a penalty on all of usbut especially the lowincome workerin the form of higher living costs. recent department of labor statistics indicate that the level of increases in the hourly wages in this country have begun to outdistance the increases in productivity so much that the rate of increase in unit labor costs is beginning to be a cause for concern. if these fears are well foundedand i believe they arethen unit labor costs could once again accelerate to a rate that could lead to rapid inflation. reduced purchasing power. and recession. certainly. this situation is something all of us know we do not want to live through again. viewed from a broader perspective. i have reservations about writing an indexing provision into law that is diametrically opposed to and inconsistent with the u.s. position in international negotiations against indexing. we have opposed the demands of developing countries to index the prices of the commodities and minerals they produce and export in relation to the prices of the goods they import from us. we particularly opposedand i spoke to the shah of iran personally about this and to the heads of other oilproducing nationsthe proposal by the opec countries to index the price of their oil exports to the price of the industrial goods they import. we cannot in good faith tell the rest of the world this is no good and then turn around and index wages for the american worker. the federal government has adopted very few indexing proposals. and even then with great deliberation. increases in the social security retirement benefits are indexed to the cost of living. this was done especially for the elderly who frequently have nowhere else to turn and for whom it is often too late in life to be looking for new sources of income. such increases have no effect on the salaries of the average worker. federal employee salaries also are indexed. to a certain degree. but they are adjusted to be comparable to salaries in the private sectoragain they react to private sector salaries but have no effect on them nationwide. the type of indexing proposed in this minimum wage bill is entirely different. rather than preserving purchasing power in \"real\" e:onomic terms. this indexing contributes to the continued inflationary spiral by practically guaranteeing wage and price increases. experience in observing developing countries which have tried a variety of indexing proposals shows us that it is always difficult. if not impossible to discontinue these relationships when deflationary policy becomes necessary. for all of these reasons. mr. president. i am pleased to join the senator from new york and the senator from new jersey in their attempt to strike the indexing provisions of the bill and substitute a gradual increase in the minimum wage level. retaining for the congress the responsibility of periodically reviewing the level within the context of prevailing economic conditions. mr. president. what i had hope to do in peoria. by appealing to organized labor itself. directly at its convention. was to convince them that this idea really was contrary to the interests of the average worker. we ought to pay a person what he is worth and not artificially set wages. we hve enough trouble here in congress figuring out what a person is worth at the bottom of the scale. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record at this point an article that appeared in the business and economic research division publication of the first national bank of chicago. i think it will be helpful to everyone considering the minimum wage issue."},{"1":"1976","2":"FANNIN","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. as can be seen from this example under a disc we tax 75

depends on the use of foreign affiliates which would normally be established in a lowtax country where an income tax of 10 percent can be expected. furthermore. the direct comparison does not take into account further tax measures that they have in france. such as the vat. value added tax. and many other taxes that are added against the import of goods so as to place our u.s. companies doing business abroad at an extreme disadvantage. it is extremely essential that we realize just exactly what is involved. it is well to reflect on the important fact that the european countries strongly oppose our use of disc as it gives our u.s. companies abroad at least some means to be competitive. when we are talking about the overall measure as far as disc is concerned. we must take into consideration why disc was formed. now. tonight it has been said it was formed because of the dollar devaluation and because of what was happening with the dollar. lest we not be mistaken we should remember that discs were created by the revenue act of 1971 to offset a growing tendency of u.s. firms to locate production facilities abroad. we were concerned about increasing our exports abroad and about trying to keep the jobs at home which would support the sales that were being made abroad. what do you have to do to qualify as a disc corporation? it must be organized under our state laws. and

of its kind in the united states and has increased production from 6 bales per hour to 30 or over. the new \"push button\" gin. as it is called. has gained much attention since its opening last fall. people have come from all over the world to see the gin in operation. a major part of the story of the new gin is that the buildings and grounds have been designed and landscaped to make them the

economic controls. and i urged that those controls be restored. i did so because i seriously questioned whether or not the administrations phase iii controls could halt inflation. i specifically raised the question with respect to food prices. i believe the answer is now selfevident. the phase iii controls have not halted inflation. the price of food has increased beyond the ability of the poor to pay for it. and hardships are being worked upon american wage earners. and especially upon our citizens who have to depend upon fixed incomes for their livelihood. at the time when i spoke previously. the u.s. department of agriculture was projecting a retail food price level for 1973 at 6 to 61/2 percent above the level of retail prices in 1972. i was informed on this past tuesday by the department that that projection has now been revised upward to approximately 10 percentand 1973 is not yet 6 months old. when i spoke on march 8 on this subject. the department of labor was reporting that wholesale food prices during january of this yearthe month in which the phase ii controls were imprudently and prematurely removed by the administrationincreased at an annual rate of 39.6 percent. that exceeded the 26.4 percent increase in december. which in itself was an intolerable rise. but now. mr. president. i am informed that the january through may increasethe period of the socalled controls employed in phase iiiis estimated to be at an annual rate of 43.2 percent. i believe that figure was scheduled to be released by the u.s. department of labor today. there is only one word to describe such an increase. it is outrageous. and action must be taken to halt this runaway spiral. american wage earnersand most certainly citizens who are not wageearnerscannot stand the strain which is being put upon their meager resources. i think we have had enough of cheery predictions and reassurances from the executive branch that all is well. or is going to be all right. i thinlk we have had enough of the kind of nonsense that has been coming this week from mr. herbert stein. chairman of the administrations council of economic advisers. i noted a statement in the washington post in which mr. stein was quoted as having said that the largely voluntary phase iii wageprice controls have been generally effective despite soaring prices. i further have noted that he is quoted in this weeks u.s. news & world report as having said that there is no evidence that the american consumer \"is suffering.\" and that \"nothing could be further from the truth.\" he ought to visit a grocery store and hear what housewives are saying about food prices. it is not necessary. mr. president. to draw ones conclusions from the statistics compiled by federal agencies about the trend of inflation in the price of groceries. all one needs to do is to make a trip to his own foodstore. the continuing increase in the price of the food on its shelves is appalling. the worst aspect of the situation is that among the foodstuffs which have advanced the most in price are those basic to the diets of poor and averageincome americans. i am not talking about lobster and fillet mignon. i am talking about the price of beans. cabbage. potatoes. and hamburgerand the other common everyday staples. compared with. say. 1967. the price of these basic foods is today astronomicalan estimated onethird more than it was then. think of what that means in terms of modest incomes. out of which must also come the cost of the other necessities of life. such as rent. clothing. transportation. and doctors billsall at the highest levels they have ever been. phase iii is a shambles. it has failed utterly to meet the glowing predictions made by the administration at the time the mandatory controls were lifted in january. and what is the administration doing now about the situation other than issuing rosy reassurances? it is reminiscent of the depression years when the nation was told that prosperity was \"just around the comer.\" now we are told that the control of inflation is just around the comer. but we have never seemed to reach that corner in the 6 years in which inflation has steadily grown worse. it would appear that the administration has become incapable of timely. firm. and decisive economic action? the president reversed himself and acted with courage and forthrightness when he instituted his first freeze of prices and and wages in august 1971. i commended him then. and i continue to think that he acted in the best interests of all of the american people. i would urge him now to act as effectively and decisively again. today. prices are racing upward at the fastest pace since the korean war 22 years ago. that fact alone ought to be enough to prompt quick and effective action. this is not a partisan matter. members on both sides of the aisle. i am sure. are equally and deeply concerned about a situation which has obviously gotten out of hand. we simply cannot as a nation afford to allow the continuation of a situation in which workers pay checks will buy less and less and less of the necessities of life. the cost of living must be brought under control. yet the only action which has been taken toward that end was thefor all practical purposessuperficial gesture of the meat price ceilings. as everyone knows. the ceilings were put on. and with considerable fanfare. at a time when meat prices had reached an alltime high. the administration must not wait any longer with regard to food prices. and with regard to the increasing cost of the other necessities of life. what we have had in effect. mr. president. in the 5 months that have elapsed since the ending of phase iis mandatory controls is 5 long months of economic foot

president. many thousands of words have been spoken in this chamber on the subject of rural development and economic growth. many of our efforts have been devoted to the countryside. we have sought to give help that is needed. and we have other measures under active consideration at this moment. i think it is well if we pause and ask what all this is for. and i would like to provide an answer as i have seen it develop in my own state. finding water in south carolina has seldom been a problem. and with the dams along the santee and savannah rivers. and the rapidly growing reputation of my state as an area for waterbased recreation. some may wonder that i even raise the question. but good waterpure waterconvenient water. flowing from pipes into our homes. schools. churches. and businessesis needed before a community can grow and flourish. mr. president. lancaster county in the piedmont section of south carolina is an example. our first water system was built there nearly 10 years ago. since then. seven more systems have followed. and now some 200 miles of pipeline convey water throughout the countyand provide a supply to five other water districts and one town. all of south carolina is the better because of these water systems. farmers home administration. which assisted with loans for these seven water systems. has also financed over 350 homes along these water lines in rural areas. and private lending institutions have more than doubled that numberover 500 homes for a total investment that exceeds $13 million. mr. president. with this increased financing have come expanded telephone and electrical service. new mail routesand growth. as a result the county has lower fire insurance rates and more plentiful job opportunities. population has grown 10 percent since the first system was established. the strengthened tax base has improved services and amenities and values have increased from 50 to 100 percent along the water lines. one of our real good farmers points out that farming people are not interested in selling out at any price. mr. president. this is a quick. thumbnail sketch of results that already have come from the good work of the congress in establishing and maintaining the farmers home administration. i searched deeply into the program that the farmers home administration has provided in south carolina. as a result i found good work and strong programs that provide an essential foundation to this administrations goal of balanced growth. we were proud to discover that south carolina can now claim the no. 1 position in rate of progress in rural areas. living conditions. quality of homes in the towns and countryside are rising to a general level of first class in south carolina. faster than in any other state. and i compliment state fha director e. whitson brooks for his outstanding work. mr. president. in county after county in south carolina water systems have opened the way. in this rural water program. 84 municipal and intercommunity organizations have developed some 75 water systems. large and small. plus nearly a score of sewage disposal systems for towns that had sanitation and pollution problems. all this has been achieved because of some $20 million of financing through the fha in south carolina. several hundred towns have benefited from the uplift that comes with the graduation to modern systems of water supply and sanitary waste disposal. the pipelines of a larger rural water system normally embrace several towns. as well as the farms. homes. businesses. and industries that lie in the open country between towns. mr. president. lancaster county offers outstanding examples. but others will be found in every section of south carolina. two of lancasters neighboring countieschesterfield and kershawaccount for 10 more thriving rural water systems. union county in the northwest section of the state has a network of eight rural systems. in counties of the coastal areas of south carolina. both water supply and drainage improvements are being achieved through farmers home administration programs. aiken county typifies the surging development of industry and new. modernized communities along our southern boundary. among eight new rural water systems in that county. the breezy hill system is now in the process of more than doubling its service load. more than 1.000 homes will be supplied by this system that started 2 years ago with less than 500. in greenville county. the blue ridge rural water system was recently approved for $2 million of farmers home administration loan financing. this system will begin with coverage of three towns and the intervening countryside. which accounts for a large rural portion of the county. mr. president. these examples are exemplary of progress in every sector of our state. modern services and a prevalent pattern of desirable housing no longer stop at the city line. every county of south carolina is being reached by the rural water program. fortyone more projects totaling $17 million are planned for development within the next 2 or 3 years. with the solution of water supply and sanitation problems in a rural community comes rebuilding. renewal and growth. this is happening today in south carolina. the real symbol of advancement for our people is found not so much in plants and storefronts as in homesnew homes of modern quality for the general population of middle and lower income families. mr. president. south carolina is now the leading state in rural housing. in the fiscal year ended last june 30 we topped all states. including many much more populous states. with more than $97 million worth of homebuilding through the farmers home administration rural housing program. south carolina produced 7.132 new or newly modernized homesall for families who. until the inception of todays rural housing program. seldom found home financing within their reach. mr. president. in south carolina the housing effort of 3 years ago produced only 1.500 homes. $13 million worth of building in fiscal year 1968. however. in fiscal 1971. more than 4.700 families of the lowincome group alonefamilies who until now saw no way of escape from crude. oldfashioned. substandard housingwere able to step up to ownership of good. modern homes. rural homebuilding of itself has become one of the biggest industries in south carolina. and one of the most important sources of new rural employment. some 900 contractors are now producing homes in town and country areas. homebuilding jobs provide a livelihood for some 20.000 rural south carolina families. the economic effect provided by increased homebuilding spreads through many lines of business and employment. to the nearly $100 million invested in 7.100 new rural homes last year. can be added some $15 million spent by homeowner families just for furnishings and modern appliances in their new homes. the combination of these investments has been a tremendous boost to the overall economy of south carolina. mr. president. this transformation of housing is a profound improvement. long overdue in rural areas. the key to its accomplishment has been a conscientious and capable organization of state and countybased workers in the farmers home administration. they have made the people of rural south carolina aware of the new \"second chance\" now afforded them in housing. there now is ample fha credit through the farmers home administration. supplementing all private and conventional credit that may be available in a rural locality. there also is fine and continuing cooperation between fha and the homebuilders of our state. working to develop and produce in volume good modern homes that are fully adequate for the families who will live in them. but priced within reach of the family of modest means. mr. president. i . offer the examples of lancaster county and the record of accomplishments throughout our state as evidence that rural development is working in south carolina. we commend administrator james v. smith on the immense improvement of services the farmers home administration has achieved under his leadership. volume of credit for homes. farms and community improvements has increased from 4.400 loans of all types totaling $29 million in fiscal 1968. to more than 12.000 loans totaling $121 million the past year. credit needs of the small farm family also are being better served. fha farm ownership and operating credit is up from $6.8 million 3 years ago to $7.5 million in the year just ended. moreover. through new policies introduced by the present administration. private lenders who join with farmers home in serving the same borrowers are adding about onethird more to the rural credit picture. mr. president. i am proud to present this progress report from the rural areas of south carolina. it is my belief that as these efforts continue. rural areas will fulfill their promise as the great realm of future community development in this country. the goals of rural development will be realized. and those who want to stay in the country. or turn to country life. will find decent work and living conditions in a better environment."},{"1":"1970","2":"MAGNUSON","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. the bill now before the senate. s. 3706. is. i am sure. the most comprehensive effort to deal with the perplexing rail passenger problem ever brought to the floor of the senate. if enacted into law it would revolutionize passenger travel by railroad. the terms of the legislation were not agreed upon easily nor was support within the committee unanimous. the report resembled a recent supreme court decision with majority views. minority views. individual views by a member who voted with the majority. and individual views by a member who concurred with the minority. the report culminated nearly 5 months of frustrating time consuming onagain. offagain consideration by the committee. and much of the time of the members of the committee and particularly members of the subcommittee headed by the distinguished senator from indiana . we had hoped to obtain administration views before reporting a bill. but despite our efforts and particularly those of the committees ranking minority member. the senator from new hampshire . no such views were made known. the committee decided to act without those opinions. helpful as they might have been. and s. 3706 was ordered reported and subsequently the report was filed. a majority of us simply felt that we could wait no longer and. indeed. that perhaps we had already waited too long. in all fairness. i want to point out that the proposals were before the department of transportation and other departments of the administration involved in this effort. they met and considered the complicated problems involved. and i imagine that they felt a little like the committee did in the first few months of its frustrated efforts. despite all the lengthy discussions and exhaustive consideration that resulted in the provisions that went into s. 3706. the committee chairman and the subcommittee chairman who supported the reporting of s. 3706 have joined with their counterparts from across the aisle to sponsor a substitute for the reported bill. this is not a course taken lightly. the subcommittee chairman in this instance. the senator from indiana . has expended substantial time and energy in developing a bill which the majority approved. as was stated in the report on s. 3706. the majority felt that that bill with all its imperfections would have materially improved rail passenger service. we pointed out. however. that the committee was not convinced that that legislation represented the only possible answer to the problem. we realized there would be floor amendments and we were ready to consider them. a few days after the report was filed. the secretary of transportation. in meetings with senators cotton. hartke. prouty. and me. notified us that at long last he had been authorized to express administration support for a national corporation approach. the bill before us includes substantially the pure subsidy approach. we had been waiting to hear officially from the administration for several monthsso we were happy to get those views. while the committee had discussed such a proposal previously it had been decided that any such action should be deferred pending administration views--so the idea was not completely alien to us. because we felt that administration support was vital if we were to gain congressional passage in time to help and because we thought the basic concept had merit. we agreed to enter into discussions with the administration to see if agreement on the terms of a bill could be achieved. surprisingly we learned after some early conferences that we probably could reach an accommodation. the result of such agreement is amendment 608. it is a compromise measure in the nature of a substitute that has as its most significant purpose the replacement of railroad management of rail passenger service with new quasipublic management. the bill as now writtenand it surprised some of us that we could reach agreement in this very complex matterenjoys the support of the national association of railroad passengers. the association of american railroads. railway labor. the department of transportation. and the sponsors. the committee report on the reported bill. s. 3706. outlined the four primary objectives of such legislation. i am satisfied that the substitute bill meets those primary objectives in every respect as well as s. 3706 and in some respects in a preferable way. unless positive government action is taken soon. railroad passenger service in many parts of the country will be a thing of the past. provision of modern passenger trains will be facilitated if existing service is retained on those routes over which improved service should be operated in the future. once passenger service on any give route is discontinued. stations. terminals. signals. and necessary trackage are abolished shortly thereafter. sales and marketing organizations are disbanded. travel is wholly diverted to other modes and must be lured back to the trains from scratch. moreover. not all existing service is obsolete. some of it can be significantly upgraded with very modest expenditures for capital improvements. therefore. it is necessary for the congress to enact a program to insure continued operation of essential passenger services. and to provide for their nearterm upgrading and modernization. in summary. let me assure the senate. in my capacity as chairman of the commerce committee and as one who has long been desperately concerned about the future of the passenger train. that i have no hesitance in urging the senate to accept this very unusual procedure. we are convincedon a bipartisan basisthat the substitute proposal is in the best interests of this nation. i know there will be amendments to the substitute offered and some will be adopted. but i would urge that amendment 608 be adopted without major structural alteration. the very distinguished senior senator from the state of indiana . has been actively engaged in writing this amendment. as well as s. 3706 itself. and will floor manage the legislation. the senator from indiana has spent many days and weeks listening to testimony from scores of witnesses on all sides of the question. as i said he was very actively engaged in writing the substitute amendment. as was the distinguished senator from vermont and others. i yield to my colleague from indiana who will discuss this matter in greater detail."},{"1":"1969","2":"KLUCZYNSKI","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. the untimely death of representative daniel j. ronan has left his friends and colleagues with hearts bowed in

is among them. they were interrogated at length. and they testified along the lines suggested. mr. president. in later hearings on the professional team sports bill. other witnesses. including the group of professional baseball. football. and basketball league officials and players. have testified that the reserve clause and the drafting systems that they use in the respective professional sports are absolutely necessary and that any action taken by the congress to upset either the reserve clause or the drafting of players would be ruinous to the professional team sports and. thus. the most seriously affected would be the players themselves. in conclusion. professional team sports. as testified to by the above witnesses. must have the draft system and the reserve clause because they are \"the life blood of the professional team sport.\" we would all like to ensure the freedom of contract which would give the person the right to set the price for his services or for his wares but we know from experience in certain business and professions there is not always that freedom. farmers are told by the government just how many acres they can toil. oil people are told by the state just how much they can produce each month and also on an international level. how much oil they can import into this nation. union members have delegated the right to negotiate for their wages to a committee. the above represents only one from each category of industry. agriculture. and labor. it surely would not be freedom because it would mean that without the draft systemand it is functioning pretty much as it has functioned heretoforewe would find that the more fortunate and more prosperous teams would get the preference and get the better players. but it would not be in the interest either of confidence in the sport nor in the interest of real competition. it was the intent of the members of congress in introducing the professional team sports bills to exempt from the antitrust laws the reserve clause and the right to draft players. a system which has been in effect in professional team sports for many. many years. in asking the senate legislative counsels office to prepare amendments to prohibit raiding of the college athletes by professional teams. they prepared two versions. one. applying only to football. to which i have referred earlier. and two. applying to all professional team sports which senator eavm introduced as the ervin amendment and adopted by the senate judiciary committee. however. the ervin amendment. as i have noted earlier. is not for the purpose of prohibiting raiding of college players but in his own words: my amendment in no way prohibits teams signing college players: rather it prohibits the professionals from agreeing that not but one team participating in a sport has the right to negotiate with a player. thus. senator ervins amendment could. in effect. kill the free agent and draft system. if it is applied only to professional baseball. it would discriminate against that professional sport alone but it goes further because it gives freedom of contract to boys who are signed before they complete their 4 years of college eligibility but the amendment does not give freedom of contract to college players after said 4year period of eligibility nor to high school students who are qualified to play professional baseball. i

not. then later. by a vote in the senatenot unanimous. but 77 to 16this body approved senate joint resolution 29 proposing a constitutional amendment. which is the constitutional way to handle the question. there was no prolonged debate. no resort to cloture. and no need for it. the states now have that constitutional amendment before them. i thank the distinguished senator for his comment. mr. president. i should like to refer to mr. lippmanns most recent observation on this subject that i have seen. which was on december 27. 1962a month agoin an article in the new york times discussing the problems of government in france. england. and the united states. in the article mr. lippmann calls for various reforms in our governmental structure. but it is interesting to see what he says about the proposed reform in senate rules. i should like to read mr. lippmanns comment into the record: the american version of the problem arises. as i see it. out of the fact that the american form of government cannot be operated at all in wartime and cannot be operated successfully in peacetime except under presidential leadership. in domestic affairs. which include such external affairs as tariffs. foreign aid. and the character of the defense structure. presidential leadership is checked and balanced and is often vetoed and frustrated by the rules of congress. including particularly the rule of seniority and the entrenched power of the standing committees. it will be a labor of hercules to reform the system. but if the american government is to be adequate to the times we live in we have to begin the reform. for myself. i would begin in the house with a concentrated assault on the entirely arbitrary and highhanded usurpation by the rules committee when it arrogates to itself the right to decide what bills congress shall vote upon. this usurpation is quite outside the meaning of the constitution. i ask senators to listen carefully to the following: at the same time. i would not reopen now the question of the limitation of debate in the senate. there is a strong case to be made for continuing the tradition which makes it necessary that legislation which is highly controversial must command a consensus in the senate which is much bigger than one more than onehalf. i believe that in the long run the preservation of this principle in one of the houses of congress is a protection of our liberties. mr. president. this is a columnist who perhaps is supporting the administration more actively in its requests for farreaching legislation than any other. who recognizes there are obstacles to the enactment of some of that legislation arising from the senate rules and from the house rules and from the traditions of congress. who takes this occasion to say again what he has said so well before. that he thinks no attempt should be made to amend the senate rule becauseand i read the last sentence of his statement againi believe that in the long run the preservation of this principle in one of the houses of congress is a protection of our liberties. mr. krock. the distinguished political commentator of the new york times. directing his thoughts to the same problem on march 3. 1960. in an article dealing with debate in the senate at that time. had this to say: the allout southern filibuster in the senate. which really is centered only on those sections of equalrights bills that would impose total racial integration by federal force. is under the usual attack of being undemocratic. yet the senate rules which lend strong protection to such delaying actions are historically in alinement with the basic concept on which the constitution was drafted and ratified. this was that the enforcement of the will of the majority on a strongly opposed minority must be subject to many checks and balances. since the constitution established a republic. and not a massaction democracy. a number of these checks and balances were written into the text. it allotted two senators to each state. regardless of size or population. so that the senators from rhode island have the same voting power in their body as the senators from new york. it provided for the presidential veto by which onethird plus one member of either branch of congress can kill legislation supported by one less than twothirds. the constitution also requires a twothirds senate vote to approve international treaties submitted by the president. threefourths of the states must ratify a constitutional amendment to make it the supreme law of the land. and the supreme court has successfully read into the national charter the unspecified power to nullify acts of congress as unconstitutional. the senate rules. which make it possible for a determined minority to forestall a vote on pending legislation until and unless twothirds of the members present support a motion to close the debate at a specified time. reflect this same fundamental concept of the constitution. and seldom mentioned is the additional fact that. in the most recent of a series of tests of senate opinion. many more than onehalf of the membership again refused to change the rules to allow either a simple majority of those present and voting. or a constitutional majority (now 51). to terminate a filibuster or any other form of deliberately protracted debate. also. in the criticism of the current filibuster as undemocratic. it is rarely if ever recalled that the threat of a filibuster by nonsoutherners. in august 1958. when senators were anxious to go home. killed the house preemption bill. i shall not be unkind enough. mr. president. to give the names of those liberal associates of ours all friends of ours. who threatened to filibuster at that time to kill a bill which had passed the house by an immense majority. and which would have passed the senate by an almost equal majority. in my opinion. if it had been allowed to come to a vote. i again quote mr. krock: moreover. the undemocratic charge against senate rules. which at all times have been drafted and modified by a majority (otherwise they would not be in the manual). suggests that some who make it are fundamentally opposed to the concept of checks and balances deliberately embedded in the constitution. it suggests that what these critics really want is a massaction democracyexcept of course. when a filibuster attains one of their ends. butthis cannot be unless the national charter is rewritten and adopted by threefourths of the states. mr. david lawrence on march 2. 1949 in discussing the right of a majority to limit debate in the senate. made these pertinent comments in an article published in the washington evening star: the debate over the right of a majority to cut off discussion in the senate has implications that can affect the future of american history. as they have in the past. the issue goes deeper. however. than civil rights and racial problems. it goes to the heart of minority rights on all questions. the right of unlimited debate has kept the senate from becoming a rubber stamp for the executive on matters of domestic as well as foreign policy. in times of economic stress an intolerant majority can ride roughshod over the rights of the minority. in the senate it has been possible for unlimited debate to be checked only by the processes of public opinion when the debate privilege was abused. mr. president. if i may. i wish to dwell for a moment on this statement by mr. lawrence. i think he went to the very heart of the question when he referred to the fact that when public opinion frowns upon a socalled filibuster or a resort to unlimited debate that filibuster is sure to collapse and is sure to fail. as i stated the other day in my remarks. every senator who resorts to unlimited debate knows that he does so against the background that he. as the representative of his people. trying to obtain for them from the senate the consideration which they deserve. is jeopardizing his standing with his associates if he stands upon a ground which he knows to be unsound or in which he does not believe with all his heart. likewise. he jeopardizes his own standing at home if he dares to take a position which the majority of his people do not. in his sincere opinion. support. in addition. mr. president. i think that the power of public opinion runs much wider than the confines of state bounds. because i have seen its effects in the senate in respect to the tidelands bill. when a group of liberals were seeking to filibuster against it. when papers like the washington post. which supported them. and the new york times. which supported them. and other papers i could mention which supported them. came out. nevertheless. with editorial comment which frowned upon what they were doing in wearing out the senate and refusing to allow the senate time to take up and to pass some very important measures for the nation. that opposition caved in. the measure got to a vote. and the bill was passed. in spite of the dedicated opinions of those who opposed it that it was unconstitutional. the distinguished presiding officer knows that the supreme court very quickly. when the matter came to it--with. i think. one dissenting votesustained the constitutional aspect of the law. the fact of the matter is. mr. president. that the power of public opinion in the final analysis governs on a matter of this kind. it is only when senators feel sustained by the force of public opinion which sympathizes with the stand they are taking. when they believe their stand is right. or when something is so questionable that it is believed to be right to indulge in unlimited debate. that anyone can hope to stand on this floor literally until he drops and fight for those things which are involved in that particular contest. so. mr. president. in my opinion. the fallacy that one more than any majority should prevail on questions no matter how fundamental to our government and no matter how important to our people is convincingly disproved by the studious comments of these three distinguished authorities. who are not southerners. but who are great scholars and great patriots and are so recognized by everyone. regardless of whether one agrees with their statements. the columns of these great americans are read with respect. even though all may not agree with the philosophy they espouse. mr. president. the tragic events which have occurred in recent months prove clearly that coercion. whether by the courts. the executive branch. even extending to the use of military force. or by any proposed legislative mandate does not produce the desired results in the difficult field of civil rights. it should be obvious to all by now that attempted enforcement by coercion of the decisions made by what may be a transient majority. which decisions are offensive to the traditions. the customs. and the conscience of a great number of our people. who are determinedly opposed to them. cannot succeed. without grievous injury to the peace. tranquillity. and wellbeing of the country. or at least a great section of it. nor. i regret to say. without bloodshed and violence. i want the record to show. as i stated the other day. that when we talk about the south. we are talking about a region that. without including the border states. has a population of some 50 million. and which comprises an area greater than most of the great states of the world. to attempt to do something by coercion which conflicts with the traditions. beliefs. and longstanding customs and practices of the people of a great area like that. and with our illustrious history. is bound to fail to succeed. two recent events i hardly need to mention amply illustrate this: the tragic disorders last fall at oxford. miss.. and the race riot at the district of columbia stadium on thanksgiving day. it is lamentable even to have to recite what happened at oxford. but there may be those who in later years will forget what transpired there. my position has been stated pretty well. i stated on the floor that. so far as i was concerned. i would have acceded to the court order. even though i strongly disbelieved in it. but today we are looking at the results of what transpiredresults which show that action as completely unwise and demonstrate the complete failure of what was done. at oxford two persons were killed. scores seriously injured. many college students hurt. an entire semester of learning greatly impaired for thousands of students. and the lives of thousands of citizens disrupted with lasting effects of bitterness of which all of us are only too painfully aware. it is painful to talk about this deplorable eventcoercion. court decree. executive interference. a resort to arms. plus military force to go along with it. which brought about an abysmal failure. i notice in the washington news of today. which just reached me a few minutes ago. an articleand i do not vouch for its accuracyto the effect that meredith. the student who was put in there by that forceful effort. has just left school. having failed some of his semester examinations. events of the near future will make clear whether that statement is true or not. whether it proves to be true or not. the fact is that several hundred students were withdrawn from the university during the semester because of the travail there. the fact is that the whole course of academic learning on that campus for some thousands has been greatly hindered with lasting effect. the fact is that the bitterness which came about on that campus and the whole area affected will remain for years and years. the fact is that huge amounts of public money have been spent in an effort that now proves was clearly abortive from the beginning. i inquired as to the amount of public moneys involved. i was advised by the two distinguished senators who i think are closer to the defense department than is any senator on the floor except the senator from georgia [mr. russelland i refer to the senator from virginia and the senator from mississippi that they have been informed the total cost exceeded $4 million sometime around the first of december. i doubt if it will ever be known exactly what the cost was. i think the matter of the cost in money is one of the least important elements in the matter. the total failure to accomplish any goodand the violence and destruction wroughtis so very clear that i do not think anyone would belabor the question at allbut so the record may be complete i submit figures provided by the department of the army and the department of justice on the cost of supporting the federal marshals and soldiers sent to oxford. the library of congress. which looked into this matter for me. advises these departments reported that the cost to the federal government of supporting thousands of armed troops. 325 of which are still stationed in oxford. for 60 days up to november 30. 1962. exceeded $2 million. this was the department of army estimate. the cost of supporting the 541 u.s. marshals. 15 of which are still on the university of mississippi campus. with their ammunition. communications. and equipment. according to the department of justice. amounted to $406.508 as of october 31. mr. president. that mass effort of 541 u.s. marshals supported by the thousands of armed federal troops to enforce the precipitous enrollment of a negro candidate in the university of mississippiwho intends to withdrawor has already withdrawn if todays newspaper reports are trueas precipitously as he was enteredis without parallel in our history. the cost. beyond that in terms of human misery which never can be paid. of that forced implementation of the supreme courts decision far exceeds any progress in civil rights even the most optimistic extremists could hope for. what i am trying to say is that those who believe that coercion will bring about good results are wrong. because we are dealing with a matter that my 70 years of life in the south and my 40 years of service in public positions. in the state legislature. as governor of florida. and in the congress. has led me to believe cannot be handled by coercion. and i am regarded as a moderate. i am the one who for years introduced the antipolltax amendment. which has now been submitted to the states. i am the one who voted for cloture on two occasions. i am one who has done things that some people in my state cannot follow me in. i have done them sincerely. because i thought they were the right things to do. i am sincere in saying that if persons think they can bring about the results they want by coercion. they are entering a blind alley. they will not get anywhere. just as has been proved in the case of the trouble on the campus of \"ole miss.\" which it appears is now about to come to an end."},{"1":"1962","2":"KOWALSKI","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. i rise in this discussion today as a grateful man. a man. who because fortune permitted me to retire from the regular army. has been blessed by a generous country with a medical and hospital program which will take care of me to my grave. for the remainder of my life. i shall have the best medical attention this nation can provide. and most important. i shall always have the great satisfaction of knowing that no matter what misfortune may befall my health. i shall never be a financial burden to my children. some say this kind of care to the grave makes people lazy. indifferent. and unproductive. i do not think so. i assure you this is not intended as testimony in support of a recruiting drive. it is rather an expression of awareness of my personal obligation to the millions of my fellow americans who are paying the cost of this wonderfully human medical program for our service personnel but who themselves have no such benefits. what i have. i want others to have also. furthermore. i believe that in this great democracy millions of americans can have equivalent benefits. if we will only provide an effective national health insurance program. i have campaigned for forand type of legislation since i entered politics. i have introduced my own supporting legislation. in recent months. during visits to our nato allies. i have studied their medical care programs. i am convinced that a national health insurance program for our senior citizens is financially sound. philosophically correct. and morally a national obligation. i think it would be desirable and appropriate in this discussion to summarize briefly why this program is necessary. what it will do and how it will be accomplished. to begin with. millions of sick elderly americans will be faced this year with the cruel alternatives of. first. putting off their visits to doctors because they cannot afford to pay the bill. second. paying for medical and hospital care which will wipe out their lifes savings. or. third. begging state or welfare authorities to pay the cost of their misfortune. at the same time. millions of young couples with heavy family responsibilities will be faced this year with financial crisis caused by the illness of their aged parents. and this is going to happen in a nation which has the greatest medical facilities. the best doctors. and the most advanced miracle drugs the world has ever known. the plight of 17 million of our people over 65 years of age is a matter of record. first. they need more hospitalizationthree times as much as the rest of the population. second. they stay longer in the hospitalat least twice as long as younger people. third. their hospital and doctor bills are much higherin more than half the cases their hospital bills average $800a years income for millions. fourth. they do not earn the money to pay these bills. in 1960. 3 out of 5 persons 65 and over. not in institutions. had cash incomes of less than $1.000 a year. the average oldage benefit is $74 a month. fifth. unemployment hits older people hardestthey lose jobs. private pension rights. and support from relatives. sixth. hosfjital bills have skyrocketed. average per diem cost of hospital care has risen from $9.39 in 1946 to about $35 today. seventh. millions do not have insurance programs to cover these costsmore than half have no health insurance programs because they cannot afford them on their limited incomes. eighth. those who have insurance programs find these do not afford adequate protection. no person is so callous as to be unconcerned about an ill parent. but a parents doctor bill can truly take bread from the mouths of children. a person paying an $800 hospital bill for a parent may find himself unable to send a son to college. these and similar cruel alternatives have faced millions of good. sincere people. the sick parent. too. is not unaware of the burden he places upon his beloved. surely americans can find a better way to provide the medical wonders of the space age to its senior citizens in their golden years. opponents of the presidents proposal point out that the kerrmills legislation will provide adequate medical care for all those who need it. but cannot afford to pay. i favored the kerrmills bill and support expansion of this program. but this legislation was designed to provide a medical program for a very limited segment of our people. as a supplement program. it has great possibilities. but it has not and cannot meet the needs of the majority of our senior citizens. first. by the end of 1961. with 19 states participating. only 4 out of 1.000 persons over 65 in the united states were receiving any benefits under this program. second. only the poorest receive any benefits at all. third. the sick citizen is subjected to the most humiliating poverty tests. in some states. the children must also face severe means tests. fourth. in only 6 states. benefits are being paid to more than 1 out of 100 persons over 65. fifth. benefits are frequently meager and uncertainoften only acute or emergency care is provided. sixth. only the wealthy states can afford to match the federal funds offered. 92 percent of the funds are being spent in the rich industrial states of new york. massachusetts. and michigan. the kerrmills legislation was not designed to satisfy the needs of 17 million of our citizens who are over 65. nor can it by any stretch of words provide the means of paying the heavy costs of medical and hospital care for these millions. if the great majority of our senior citizens are provided with an effective program of health benefits. then those who need public assistance will be small enough to permit the states to help them adequately. president kennedys proposal as embodied in the andersonking bill would do this. fundamentally. this legislation provides a medical insurance program under the social security system for our senior citizens. it would pay four kinds of health care for all persons 65 and over who are eligible for benefits under oldage and survivors insurance or the railroad retirement system. the care would include: first. full hospital benefitsother than doctor servicesfor up to 90 days. for the first 9 days. the patient would pay $10 a day with a minimum of $20. second. up to 180 days of skilled nursing home care after hospitalization. third. hospital diagnostic services for outpatients. including xray and laboratory tests. the patient would be required to pay the first $20. fourth. home health services up to 240 visits a year. including nursing care. therapy and parttime homemaker service. it is estimated that this national insurance program for our senior citizens would cost about $1 billion a year initially and about threefifths of 1 percent of the covered payroll in the years to come. the employers and employees would be required to contribute onefourth of 1 percent and the selfemployed threeeighths of 1 percent additional to the social security contributions they are now making. the taxable earning base would be increased from $4.800 to $5.000 a year beginning in 1962. wage or salary earners -under the program would pay according to their earnings. the average worker would pay about $1 a month. while working. for health insurance benefits for himself and his wife at age 65. a special account. to be known as the health insurance account. would be set up in the federal social insurance trust fund. president kennedys proposal is carefully integrated to provide a national health insurance program which together with other existing programs will assure health care for practically all of our citizens 65 years of age and over. it has been estimated that at the beginning of 1963. there will be about 16 million people in the united states 65 and over. of this number 141/4 million would be entitled to benefits under the andersonking bill. an additional onefourth million will be entitled to at least equivalent benefits under the federal staff retirement system. there will be about onehalf million persons receiving benefits under veterans programs. of the remaining 1% million persons not eligible for benefits under the social security. railroad retirement. veterans programs. or staff retirements. more than 11/4 million will qualify for oldage assistance when the state programs become fully operative. in summary. all but about onehalf million of the 16% million people 65 and over will be covered by effective. democratically inspired health care insurance programs. there is nothing in the presidents proposal which would in any way conflict with established practices for providing health care for our people. this is not government or socialized medicine. the government would provide no medical facilities or medical care. the government would only establish a system for collecting and paying for the insurance program. the patients would continue to choose their own doctors and hospitals. doctors would continue to be responsible on a personal basis for the patient and would make their own medical judgments for the care of patients. including determination of admittance to and release from hospitals. hospitals and nursing homes would follow the present established patterns of operation and competing costs. no institution or doctor would be required to participate in the program. nor would any agency of the government be permitted to interfere with hospital administration or supervise or control the practice of medicine. the medical profession will continue to be responsible for the quality and care available to all patients. the providers of services would decide what services should be made available. payment for services would be accomplished in much the same way it is now accomplished for blue cross and other large purchases of service. this program would not replace private insurance and public assistance. it would supplement them. although the american medical association and some of the insurance companies oppose this program. the people who would be the beneficiaries want the program. the supporting mail in my office is heavy. gallup poll reveals that two out of three americans favor a national health insurance program for our senior citizens operated under the social security program. i am pleased that we have the support of the people for this program. i am proud to join those who believe in the greatness of americaa greatness always capable of improvement. and when a national health insurance program for our senior citizens has become law. america will become a little greater having banished fear from the hearts of those who become sick."},{"1":"1961","2":"NELSEN","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. during my visit back home last week. i talked with many people in cities and towns. and on the farms in southern minnesota. in addition to getting many reactions to the farm programs. i heard a great deal about the problem of small business. the men and women who show courage and initiative by launching a business of their own deserve not only our praise but whatever legitimate help we can give them. because their success is vital to our entire economy. we hear much these days about the need for speeding up our economic growth. that hope lies to a large extent with the small businesses of the nation. like the 90.000 such establishments in minnesota who employ some 600.000 workers1 out of every 6 men. women. and children in the state. assuring the progress of these small businesses is clearly our great need. with that as my goal i have today introduced a bill designed to contribute to this important purpose by a number of provisions including the encouragement of expansion and modernization by tax reform. the bill would provide an exemption on net taxable earnings of small and independent business in case of expenditures for expansion and modernization of the business. permit individuals and partnerships to revoke an election to be taxed as a corporation. provide a normal tax rate of 20 percent. and increase the surtax exemption. liberalize the income tax treatment of losses incurred through loans. provide an exemption for goodwill in the determination of an estate.

from the committee on government operations of the senate on s. 3140. a bill to provide for the establishment of a commission on the problems of small towns and rural counties. this bill was cosponsored by my able colleagues. senator case. of south dakota. and senator mansfield. of montana. i am very happy to have this bill placed before the senate for consideration through the filing of this favorable committee report. the problems of rural americaits small towns and countiesare among the most neglected. i am sure that the people who live in the heartland of our country. in the rural areas. will be grateful that the senate has decided to do something to help them with their problems. we have made an effort in congress to assist. where needed. in solving the social and economic challenges of nearly every distressed segment of american life. we recently aproved in the senate a bill providing for a study of the problems of metropolitan areas. we have made studies for labor. for farmers. for industry. for large cities. for education. and on many other subjects. it is logical. then. that we turn our eyes toward a portion of our nation that we desire to see survive. and that is the small town and the rural area of our nation. the force for good that comes from the rural towns and communities is almost immeasurable. every group dealing with population problems comes to recognize that from the small towns comes a great ground swell of moral responsibility and strength. the support of many of our traditions and institutions comes. very often. from the training and background which people have acquired in a rural setting. character and leadership are the real treasures of the nation. nowhere can they be acquired better than in a small town or rural environment. i speak of these things to indicate that a program for preservation and advancement of the small town has something more important than an economic argument to support it. i am sure that is the reason why so many church groups. groups which deal with rural problems and rural sociology. give their support to the idea of a commission on small town problems. for instances. most of those who have contacted me in regard to the need for establishing a commission on small town problems. indicate that they see a general breakdown in smaller towns which threatens the existence of churches and other forces for good in these areas. the economic factors which cause deterioration must be combated so that rural churches and schools will survive. at this point i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record letters which i have received from mr. willis j. ray. of the colorado baptist general convention: mr. william h. hilimer. executive secretary. the lutheran church. missouri synod. mr. william h. rhoades. executive secretary. american baptist home mission societies. mr. m. wendell belew. director. division of missions. southern baptist convention."},{"1":"1959","2":"THOMSON","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. i believe the budget proposed by the president will provide adequately for all of our national responsibilities. most of those who would attack it as inadequate cannot have much comprehension of the enormous sums involved. we talk about billions of dollars. but do we have any understanding of what these billions mean? the $77 billion total of the budget is more than the amount of money needed a year ago for a whole calendar year1957to buy all the food and drink consumed by every american man. woman. and child. it would have paid for all our meals at home and in restaurants. for all our drinkincluding alcoholic beveragesand would have kept us all in cigarettes and tobacco to boot. another way of looking at $77 billion is to measure it against the national income. it amounts to about 20 percent of the total of the wages. salaries. business profits. interest. and rent earned by all workers. proprietors. professional men. and businessmen in the nation for a whole year: one dollar out of every five. if we were to compare all government budgets. including state and local as well as federal. the total would equal over onefourth the national incomeone dollar out of every four. certainly that is enough government in a prosperous. peacetime year. our population has been rising rapidly. but federal expenditures have been going up even faster. the presidents budget recommends that next year we spend an amount equal to $431 for every man. woman. and child in america. this is $29 less than the $460 per capita we are spending this year. and the president deserves much credit for bringing it down. but it is still more than we spent in any previous peacetime year. it is almost as much as the $469 per capita we spent in 1953 while we were fighting a war in korea. in contrast. we spent only $394 per capita as recently as 1955. and if we go back to the period before world war ii. how wistfully i look at the $68 per capita uncle sam spent in 1939. let there be no misunderstanding. a $77 billion budget is a big budget. the congress should join forces with the president to hold the

term which has become a euphemism for coloration of news to suit a particular point of view. because of the recent developments in radio news. this department was particularly pleased with the recent announeement by the george foster peabody awards committee. the peabody awards are generally considered the highest in radio and tv. roughly equivalent in electronic journalism to the pulitzer prize

include my statement before the house committee on post office and civil service urging postal pay increases: mr. chairman and members of the committee. believing as i do that our postal employees are entitled to at least a 10percent wage increase across the board. i have introduced such legislation and am again appearing before your committee to urge favorable consideration of such an increase in the hope the committee in its wisdom will concur. i also believe that consideration of a postal salary increase should be completely disassociated from the postagerate increase. in my opinion. there is no basis for controversy on the wage increase whereas there will be serious controversy on the postagerate proposal. during the greater part of the last 2 decades. postal and other federal employees have been unable to compete with increased prices. wages of a worker. including federal employees. must be considered in the light of cost of living. in a period during which our nation as a whole enjoyed unprecedented national prosperity. federal workers have been stepchildren of our american economy. inadequate wages for government workers can lead only to an inferior caliber of personnel. expensive recruiting and training experience. decreased efficiency. and. in the final analysis. poor government operation. the combination of these undesirable conditions inevitably results in more costly government to every taxpayer. the cost of government is properly the concern of each of us. no one advocates useless spending or the waste of our public treasury. however. in the matter of wages for federal employees. there is involved a very human question as well as a moral obligation on the part of those responsible for determining salaries. the human question can be satisfied only if the worker is given a wage that will enable him to provide proper and adequate care for his family. a moral responsibility exists as longasfederal employees do not have collectivebargaining rights and in the absence of economic privileges accorded workers in: private industry in a given wage dispute. these two responsibilities should weigh heavily on those charged with establishing federal salary schedules. they were completely ignored last year in the veto of the wage legislation approved by the 83d congress. the current attitude of some persons in the executive branch of

the appropriations committee. for their excellent work in consideration of the many projects covered in h. r. 8367. i am sure allof us realize the enormous task that they had in endeavoring to provide adequate funds for the numerous civilfunctions projects coming under their jurisdiction. with the available moneys to cover them. i call attention to a statement in the committee report. page 8. with reference to the projects of the pacific northwest in which the people of my district. as well as in that entire area. are deeply interested: funds in the amount of $29 million have been allocated for the dalles lock and dam. oregon and washington. a reduction of $5.100.000 in the budget request. this reduction is based in part on unobligated and unexpended balances estimated to be in excess of $6 million at the end of the present fiscal year. the project. however. is a part of the comprehensive columbia river basin program for which $267.300.000 has been authorized to be appropriated. actual appropriations through fiscal year 1954 total $232.991.600. funds requested in the presidents budget were greatly in excess of the remaining authorization of $34.308.400. rather than abritrarily reduce the various projects to be within the authorized amount the committee has limited the funds available for the dalles project to an amount sufficient to place basinwide appropriations with the present statutory limit. the committee recommends $1 million for the lower columbia river fisheries program. a reduction of $360.000 in the budget estimates. at the end of fiscal year 1954. $558.900 of previous appropriations is estimated to be unobligated. this amount. when coupled with the committee allocation will provide sufficient funds for an orderly continuation of this program. while there is allocated for the mcnary lock and dam $24 million and the lookout point river project $3 million. the dalles lock and dam $29 million and the chief joseph dam in washington $27 million. we are disappointed in that $5.100.000 of the requested budget has been eliminated from the dalles lock and dam projects and some $11 million. i am advised. from the amount requested to keep this project on schedule. i was interested to note that the chairman of the subcommittee in his opening remarks stated that it was the belief of the committee that projects of this sort which were under construction should be completed as soon as practicable in order that the federal government might receive the revenues from the sale of hydroelectric power which they will produce when the generators are put into action. this is particularly true of the dalles dam. it is my understanding that the $5.100.000 eliminated from the budget request as stated in the report. was due to the fact that there was no monetary authorization for it. i have a bill pending in the house. h. r. 8377. which will supply this deficiency and not only covers the $5 million deficiency but also $11 million to keep the dalles project going full speed ahead to finish on schedule. i hope that before the bill reaches the president these items will be restored to the bill in order that the project may be completed on schedule at the earliest possible time so that revenues from power sales will be available to the government and we will not be threatened with a blackout to meet the demands of hydropower in the area. i appeared before the subcommittee urging that appropriations be allowed to complete these projects in the columbia basin area which are now under construction going forward without delaying their completion by failure to appropriate the necessary funds to keep up with the schedule of construction as recommended by the army engineers. my congressional district borders on the columbia river and these projects now under construction on the columbia river which provide hydroelectric power for the pacific northwest are vitally important to the economy of the whole area in which my district shares very heavily. the bonneville and grand coulee projects since their completion have proven to be profitable investments for the government. which are returning revenues to the government rather than losses as is the case in so many other public works constructed by the federal government. the bonneville project is ahead of schedule on repayment to the government for all of the cost allocated to power. unless construction on the dalles. mcnary. and chief joseph projects is continued according to schedule there will be a heavy dearth of hydropower in the pacific northwest needed to keep abreast of the increased demand for power. i urge that the appropriations required for continuing construction of these projects on schedule be allowed in order to forestall the hardships that will result to the area in the event that the power is not made available. as i will point out this will not result in losses to the federal treasury but will on the other hand make a profit.for the treasury from the revenues received from power from the completed projects. a years delay which will result of the slowdown now proposed is adopted would bring about a loss of revenues from power of some $21 million. . the appropriation in this bill for the dalles lock and dam project. oregon and washington. would result in a slowdown of construction whereby the schedule of installation of power generators will be delayed 1 year. so i am advised. up to this point the fastest economical schedule in construction has been maintained. in the northwest the need for additional electric energy femains urgent. also. for the chief joseph dam project in washington. the appropriation requires a delay of 1 year in installation of all generators after the first 4. it is most important that these projects be placed back on schedule to avoid a brownout in the winter of 195657 and following years. if the present schedules should prevail and the pacific northwest experiences a dry year when streamflows reach minimum proportions. the shortage of power would probably be even more severe than we experienced in 1952. a dry year for lack of rain. under such conditions. the utilities and industries in the region would suffer a heavy financial burden inasmuch as they would require greater reliance on operation of highcost thermal plants. any slowdown in this program would also cause a possible loss in production and employment. the industries in the northwest which are dependent on power for their production would curtail operations or shut down. thereby causing a loss in output of products as well as wages for employees. with attendant reduction in tax collections by the government. there is another important point i have considered in determining what course of action would achieve economies. the delay in these projects will cause the federal government to lose over $21 million from power revenues. as i have said. which could never be recovered. since a good portion of the total cost of these projects has already been invested. it would be sound business to install all the generators in accordance with the original schedules of the army engineers in order that these projects may repay the investment of the taxpayers as quickly as possible. the bureau recommendations for the cut in the dalles dam which reduces the expenditure in the appropriation approximately $14 million is not in any sense a saving to the government. but a loss. the loss to the treasury from power revenues which would otherwise be received from this project if construction continues according to schedule would be $11 million. in the chief joseph dam the loss to the federal government would be approximately $9 million. and the combined loss for the projects would be. as i have stated above. over $21 million from revenues alone. in view of the fact that heavy expenditures have already been made by the federal government. good judgment would dictate that the projects should be completed at the earliest possible moment so that these revenues from power can be received into the treasury and obviate the necessity of having a heavy investment held over for a year in idleness. for these reasons i can find no economies achieved in a slowdown of these three important projects. and urge that sufficient funds be allotted to properly maintain the construction schedules on the basis of the urgent needs. and hope that before this bill reaches the president these cuts will be restored to the bill."},{"1":"1953","2":"HICKENLOOPER","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"that.

chairman. the two issues before the house in its consideration of h. r. 1612 are whether the congress should again delegate authority to the president to make new trade agreements. and if the congress does so delegate this authority what should be the terms of the delegated authority. my position on these two issues can be as simply stated as the issues themselves and it is that: first. no further delegation of authority should be made by the congress to the president to make new trade agreements. second. if such authority is granted by the congress. then. as a bare minimum. h. r. 1612 should be amended to provide: 1. that. with certain modifications as discussed below. the perilpoint report provisions established by the trade agreements extension act of 1948 be reenacted. 2. that the president be directed to prevent the application of reduced tariffs and other concessions made in trade agreements with the free nations to imports from soviet russia and communist china. and to imports from any communist satellite country (including north korea) which the president finds is part of a conspiracy against the free world. 3. that. for the purpose of clarification and to facilitate procedures. certain standards be established by the congress for the guidance of the president in determining relief under the esczpe clause. 4. that the authority of the president to make new trade agreements be extended for a 2year period instead of a 3year period. these four qualifications on the terms of the presidents authority were unanimously recommended by the republican members of the ways and means committee. in 1934 the citizens of the united states were told by unsound propaganda of the state department that reciprocity would lay the foundation for perfect peace and brotherhood throughout the world. our people were assured by the proponents of the trade agreement program that there would be no need for further conflict or wars if only we of the united states would agree to enter into reciprocal trade agreements with various foreign countries. this plausible but false idea was exploited to the fullest degree. what was the result as one after another trade agreement was entered into by the united states? the result was that international trade. commerce. investments. and other economic relationships became more confused with every new trade agreement entered into. currency depreciation and other forms of monetary manipulation became the order of the day. exchange control. including clearing and compensatory agreements. were adopted as government policy in the struggle of many nations to get an economic advantage over the people of other countries. trade and commerce became confused with a maze of quota restrictions. licenses. permits. and other forms of control. a multitude of different unfair methods of competition became the practice of the day. all manner of foreign discriminations were introduced or resulted from the numerous socalled reciprocal trade agreements entered into by the -united states with foreign nations and between variods foreign countries. the trade agreement program during the past 17 years has become nothing more nor less than a poorly conceived device for reducing custom duties to let foreignmade competitive goods and other products into our domestic market. to the injury of american labor. the american farmer. american industry. and the american taxpayer. the truth about reciprocal trade agreements has never been revealed to the public by the state department. it has resorted to misrepresentations as to the objective of the trade agreements and to false promises with respect to expected benefits to the united states. the propaganda that peace would be restored and permanently underwritten by the proposed agreement made a powerful emotional appeal to the mothers and fathers throughout the nation. international peace through trade agreements stirred into action the christian churches. the womens organizations. and every mother who had suffered a tragedy in her home as a result of world war i. this sham crusade for peace led by the state department became one of irresistible pressure on congress to support this new deal tariffreduction plan for world peace. this unholy propaganda resulted in the enactment of the trade agreements act of 1934. it did not result. however. as many a bereaved family knows. in the nations of the earth \"beating their swords into plowshares.\" i shall show later how it did promote war and also the price our nation paid in american blood. lives. and treasure. it was urged by the proponents of the tradeagreement program under the leadership of the state department that. aside from the promotion of world peace and brotherly love. the adoption of the tariffreduction scheme would increase ou: exports and thus bring prosperity to our workers. industries. and farmers. this was another fantastic promise on the part of the state department that dii not materialize from lower tariff concessions. to fortify this statements indisputable facts let me point out that the physical quantity of exports during the 5year period193539before the beginning of world war ii was only 80 percent as much as during the earlier prosperous 5year period192529. in other words. the physical volume of exports was actually 2 percent less under the reciprocity than under the american system of prosperity at home. now then. the assurance given the public that the trade agreements act. if adopted. would bring about peace in the world and that the program would increase exports did not materialize. i state to the congress. without fear of successful contradiction. that the trade agreements program as carried out by the state department contributed to the wars in europe and to the one in the pacific. hr. it not been for the perfidy of the state department in deceiving the public with reference to exports the united states would not have been involved in a war with japan. what did the state department officials do when they found that there was a 20 percent reduction in exports under reciprocity than there had been under the american system of protection? not only the state department but also the entire new deal administration forfeited their promise of peace under the trade agreements program and instead encouraged the shipment of war materials to foreign nations in an effort to build up the promised increased exports. i shall now show the tragedy for which the state department has been responsible. exports became more important to the state department than human lives. why not. said these zealous proponents of the trade agreements. furnish the war lords in japan with our scrap iron. copper. steel. aircraft and plane parts. petroleum. street car rails. the latter removed from in front of the white house. the steel from the elevated railway in new york city and metal junk from all parts of the united states. robert t. oliver. in his recent book entitled \"why war came to korea.\" makes this statement: - japans attack upon china in 1937 was strongly criticized in the united states. but during 1938 we provided japan with 90.4 percent of her scrap iron and steel. and 76.9 percent of her aircraft and plane parts. 65.6 percent of her petroleum needs and many of her sinews of war. this trade continued to the very eve of pearl harbor. i ask. has any group of persons or any nation by its acts. furnished russia with more effective propaganda than to point out to the chinese the fact that the united states armed japan with the material to make the weapons with which to slaughter the chinese women and children? the warmongering program of the state department finally succeeded in preparing japan for an allout war against us. there could have been no war in the pacific and the far east had it not been for the shipment of war supplies by the united states to a potential enemy. let me present the facts to establish the responsibility of the stat- department morc in detail. the very year1937that japan opened war in china our exports of scrap iron and steel exports to japan amounted to 2.081.037 tons. or enough to build 20 battleships of 45.000 tons each. 200 submarines of 2.400 tons each. 10 aircraft carriers of 30.000 tons each. and 26 cruisers at 15.000 tons each. thus the state department could claim an increase in exportsnot in the regular course of commerceof which to boast. so long as the character of the diabolical purpose of these exports were not disclosed to the public. the next year1938our scrap and steel exports to japan were 1.463.000 tons. 1939 they were 2.179.000 tons. and in 1940 they were 1.248.003 tons. at this point in this program of claiming an increase in exports as promised by the state department. the united states foreign trade statistics. normally published by the department of commerce. became a military secret. no official figures are available to reveal the amount of metals and war materials exported to japan in the first 11 months of 1941. the fraudulent claim that the trade agreement program was responsible for an increase in exports was becoming debunked. protests against arming japan were being heard in congress. an inquiry as to why the state department was suffering and permitting these shipments would have been most embarrassing to the trade agreement proponents. arming a country to cut the throat of our chinese friends as a means to claiming credit for increased exports under the trade agreement program would have been indefensible. these war exports to japan came back with ghastly results. at 7:55 oclock on the morning of december 7. 1941hawaiian time100 japanese planes. built of and equipped with our exports. attacked our united states pacific fleet anchored at pearl harbor. t. h. to aid in this raid several midget submarines constructed with our exports assisted the japanese planes in their raid on our men and ships. it was our exports to japan that totally destroyed the battleship arizona. this raid severely damaged the battleships oklahoma. nevada. california. west virginia. and three destroyers. one target ship. and one minelayer. damaged but finally repaired were the battleships pennsylvania. maryland. tennessee. cruisers helena. honolulu. raleigh. one seaplane tender. one repair vessel. one drydock. our loss of airplanes in this raid: navy. 80. army. 97. all of this damage and cost was inflicted by japan with our exports to her of essential war material. but here is the ghastly part of this export program. casualties: navy. 2.117 officers and men killed. there were 960 missing and 376 wounded. army. 226 officers and men killed. 396 wounded this is the result of an attempt of the state department to deceive the american people that exports had actually expanded as a result of the reciprocal trade agreements. have the american people suffered enough from the perfidy of the state department? now after the experience of the holocaust at pearl harbor is the same scheme of arming our enemies being suffered and permitted to be continued as a permanent appeasement policy? the shipment of essential war material to russia and red china from our own ports has continued since and even before the korean war. i call attention to the fact that the state department. in its mad rush to increase our exports. stripped our nation of copper. scrap iron. and other essential war materials to the point where the children were asked to save their copper pennies for our war needs. the state department had a secret meeting with the ways and means committee. urging the removal of the tariff on scrap iron to aid our war effort. the country was so reduced in scrap metal that ships and men had to go to central america and the caribbean islands to collect old sugar mills and the rails from abandoned railways to replenish the loss of the material that had gone to japan to enable her to butcher the chinese. it would not be fair to leave this subject without further emphasizing the fact by repeating that during the 5year period 193539 a very large portion of the exports of commodities consisted of materials needed by germany. italy. and japan in their preparations for world war ii. they imported from us. not because of trade agreement concessions. but in order to prepare for war. in other words. if i may repeat. not only was the physical quantity of legitimate exports 20 perc nt less than during the earlier period. but a very large portion of the exports which we did find possible consisted of scrap iron and steel. petroleum products for military purposes. trucks. tractors. and other vehicles. machinery for the making of war instruments of destruction. it should not be forgotten that much of the exports of farm products were made possible by payment of export subsidies. and not as a result of reciprocaltrade agreements. aside from the contribution of the state department to the death of our boys at pearl harbor and the devastating war that followed in the pacific. the loss in revenue from the reduction in custom duties under the reciprocal trade agreements should not be overlooked. the rate of duty imposed upon dutiable imports has now been reduced down to the last month for which the official figureswhich averaged on 12.4 percent of the value of dutiable imports. so that whereas over a 20- or 30year periodin fact at the turn of the centuryour tariff averaged something like 36 percent. now. the tariff has been gradually reduced under the tradeagreements program until the last monthas i saythe tariff was on 12.4 percent of the value of the dutiable commodities. the value of imports has increased and they are now up to well over $6.000.000.000 so that even with the low rate of duty the revenue has not increased. over onethird of all imports are dutiablejust about $2.000.000.000 out of $6.000.000.000 are dutiable. now during the 5 years since the war closedthere is no use discussing the revenue during the war periodthe customs duties have been as follows: during the year 1945. $391.000.000. during the year 1946. $498.000.000. during the year 1947. $445.000.000. during the year 1948. $417.000.000. during the year 1949. $374.000.000. they had been up to a very much higher level than that. during earlier periods the revenue customs duty collected had run up to approximately $600.000.000 a year. in other words. during the 10 years from 1920 to 1930. there had been right around $600.000.000now they are down to less than $400.000.000.. in spite of the fact that our imports have increased from $400.000.000 to $600.000.000. because of the lower rates under the tradeagreements program. the revenue has decreased from an average of $600.000.000 to $400.000.000. the result is that we are now losing $200.000.000 a year in revenue. because of the tradeagreement concessions. well. if you lose $200.000.000 a year. it only takes 10 years to lose $2.000.000.000. so you could say that during the last 10 years we have lost $2.000.000.000 because of the low rates. i want to call attention of my colleagues to the fact. and a tragic and indefensible one. that communist russia and all of her communist satellites. including red china. are getting the benefit of every tariff concession made in every trade agreement entered into by the united states. communist russia and all of the countries behind the iron curtain. including red china. get all of the tariff concession benefits without granting a single concession to the united states. this is simply a repetition of arming another foe with the implements to destroy our american boys. such deadly material exported to russia and paid for by free imports into the united states from russia in time of war cannot be successfully defended. to grant communist russia and the countries dbminated by her the same tariff reductions the united states has made to 45 other free nations is to furnish russia and her satellites the dollars with which to buy arms. ammunition. and other war materials with which to build tanks. planes. and trucks to prosecute a war against us is unthinkable and preposterous."},{"1":"1950","2":"AIKEN","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"i think we cannot discount right now any claim that this bill affords any effective protection against the fraudulent serving of imitatioh butter. now for the most important part of my argument against the bill. as i see it. i want to speak of the effect of the proposed legislation on the national economy. we may assume without question that oleomargarine will make heavy inroads on the butter market if this legislation is passed unamended. that is the purpose of the bill. we may assume without question that the price of oleomargarine to the consumer will increase. that has been proved in areas where competition from butter has been lacking. we may assume without question a reduction in the number of uairy cattle in the united states and a cessation of expansion of the dairy industry in those states where it is badly needed. there are many groups in this country supporting legislation proposed by the oleo interests that would not do so if they had full possession of the facts. these groups are those which generally seek to promote higher living standards and higher incomes among american working people and consumers. yet what they unwittingly propose is to furnish their tables from the labors of the lowest paid agricultural workers in the united states. if not indeed the 16centaday labor of the pacific islands. assuming that oleo will be manufactured principally from cottonseed oil. which is the lowestpriced oil on the market today because of the high import tax on coconut oil. i would like to point out the effect on the income of american agricultural labor which this bill. if unamended. will have. i was informed yesterday by the bureau of agricultural economics. united states department of agriculture. that the average hourly farm wage rate in three important cottonproducing states is as follows: mississippi. 40 cents an hour. arkansas. 47 cents an hour. georgia. 37 cents an hour. in contrast to these very low rates. we find the great dairy state of washington paying its agricultural labor 93 cents an hour. iowa pays its labor 71 cents an hour. and minnesota. 68 cents an hour. but this hourly wage comparison is not the whole story. the worker on the dairy farm has to work every day of the year. including sundays. whether he wants to work or not. he has to work every day. the worker on the cotton farm has a seasonal proposition to deal with. therefore. the yearly earnings of the dairy worker are still further out of proportion to those of the cottonfleld worker than a comparison of the hourly earnings would indicate. if the materials used in manufacturing oleo were produced by as highly paid labor as that employed on dairy farms. there would be little difference between the cost of oleo and the cost of butter. even with these low wage rates. the cotton grower of the south is in trouble. he is trying to produce and continue to produce cotton on land which has been producing cotton for 150 years. he is continuing to grow a soildepleting crop and doing the best he can to make up for that depletion by adding chemical fertilizer."},{"1":"1949","2":"BAILEY","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. chairman. regardless of what may be said in general debate or in the committee of

the opposition is pure propaganda. still other protests are unjustified. take the case of the organized farm groups. not a single farm activity is covered in this bill. yet we find these groups playing the game with the united states chamber of commerce. the nam. and other affiliated~ groups. let me remind the farm groups in this house that the farmer has a minimum guaranty in the form of parity. all the unorganized and underpaid workersseveral million of themare asking is that they. too. be guaranteed a minimum return. not to assure them a profit. as in the case of the farmers. but to enable them to live as decent american citizens. what good. my farmer friend. is a guaranteed price if the workingman has no money with which to buy. you know full well that the answer is increased purchasing power such as this legislation seeks to provide. when economic chaos engulfed us in 1932. president roosevelt said he wanted to do something for the men and women at the foot of the economic ladder. here. my colleagues. is an opportunity for you to emulate the humanitarianism of our late lamented leader. you may call it new deal or fair deal. to me. it is just good. plain. oldfashioned american horse sense. today. more than 28 percent of our american families are earning less than $2.00 annually. this is even $1.000 less than the amount set as a living standard for the average family. under the present wage minimum of 40 cents. weekly earnings are a pitiful $16. not enough for the bare necessities of life. even a 75cent minimum and $30 per week is not enough to meet todays soaring prices. it will to some extent ease the burden of feeding. clothing. and educating the children in millions of american homes. once again we face the issue of whether we shall place material things above human welfare. lincoln said something about this being a country of the people and for the people. i am sure he never said anything about it being a government for entrenched wealth. my colleagues on the left center aisle. who are now divided over whether it is to be a taft approach or a dewey approach. could render some real service if they talked and voted along the line of a lincoln approach. there seems to be a disposition on the part of some members of the other side of this chamber that the committee has done a terrible thing in recommending that the benefits of this act be brought to more workers. they seem to feel that the benefits of the act should be brought to as few workers as possible. some members of the committee were almost frank enough to admit that they wanted the whole act repealed. others were content to offer amendments reducing the coverage of the act. one member actually proposed that a million workers that have been under the act ever since 1938. should be removed from its protection. all of this may explain why hearings were held by the committee of the eightieth congress and not even a committee report was issued. let alone a bill passed. the president of the united states has called on the congress not only to increase the minimumwage provisions of the act to at least 75 cents an hour. but also to extend the coverage as widely as posible. i feel that the committee could have gone much further than it did in extending the coverage of the law. the situation today is different from that wartime situation. again we have the case of men competing for jobs. again the country faces the danger that in their eagerness for work. men will take jobs for anything an employer will offer and that gradually the wage structure that has been built up will collapse. i know of no better way to prevent this collapse than by an absolute floor wage set at 75 cents an hour. it would even be better if this floor could be a dollar an hour. but even 75 cents an hour will help stop a further collapse in the purchasing power of our workers. if there would be such a collapse. the farmers of america will be among the first to suffer. although of course. they already have a minimum wage in the pricesupport program. the truth is. that the 75cent minimum wage will directly benefit 1.500.000 workers who are now subject to the act. the bill will also benefit many additional workers in industries and occupations which are not now subject to the minimumwage provisions of the act. i am supporting this bill nonetheless because it represents the views of the majority of the committee. and while i would prefer that the committee had brought in more workers. i feel the job done by the committee is a good one and that it should be supported by all of us. while time still permits. i must hasten to remind my colleagues that the opposition to this legislation is centered in a substitute proposal that will be offered in the committee of the whole by the gentleman from texas. representative lucas. as a member of the committee on education and labor. i was one of several who appeared before the rules committee and asked that an open rule be granted so as to permit the gentleman from texas to offer his proposal. a study of his proposal. even though he has at the last minute changed it to meet the changes in the committee bill. h. r. 5856. still represents in coverage. all of the views and pet schemes of those who appeared before the committee as witnesses in opposition to drafting a fair and just minimumwageandhour bill. in the matter of a minimum wage. his proposal to tie wages to the cost of living. is one that has already been denounced by senator taft. the republican leader in the senate. as one that is impracticable and economically unsound. i will oppose his substitute on the ground thatfirst. it will bring economic instability. second. it will lack adequate facts on vhich to base a wage scale. third. instead of uniformity. it will create confusion by providing dual administration as between the department of agriculture and the department of labor. fourth. in wage categories of 75 cents and less. it will preclude the right to bargain collectively because the rate will follow the cost of living index. labor is interested in more than just the right to live. fifth. it will defeat a major objective of this legislation by removing from coverage 1.000.000 individuals now covered in the present law. despite the fact that our nation has had a minimum wage and fair labor standards act on the books for the past 11 years. there appears to be a great number of our population who think that h. r. 5856 is new legislation. or a new venture in the field of both economic and managementlabor relations. before we vote on this bill. i want every congressman to know the facts. the facts are available to everyone who is interested in facts. not propaganda. the issue is clear. my friends. you must. by your vote on this floor. let america and your constituents know whether you stand for human welfare or organized wealth. every congressman interested in the welfare of the working people of america and in the welfare of our nation as a whole. should support h. r. 5856. it contains vitally needed changes in the fair labor standards act. which have been long overdue. let us pass this bill at once and in so doing. demonstrate to the american people that we can ignore the pressure of the special interests in legislating for the american people as a whole."},{"1":"1948","2":"VANDENBERG","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. i wish briefly to complete the record in respect to another matter which was submitted to the congress by the president in connection with this special session. i refer to the international wheat agreement. in which many senators have expressed a very earnest and intimate interest. and in which i know there is a very widespread public concern. the subject came to the attention of the special session in a paragraph in the presidents message. from which i read: the international wheat agreement is another vital measure on which the congrezs should act. this agreement is designed to insure stability in the world wheat market in the years ahead when wheat will be more plentiful. it would guarantee american farmers an export market of 185.000.000 bushels of wheat at a fair price during each of the next 5 years. since the agreement is in the form of a treaty it requires only ratification by the senate. although this agreement should have been ratified by july 1 of this year. we have good reason to believe that it can still be made effective if it is now ratified promptly. the day after the chief executive had delivered his message to the congress the senate committee on foreign relations resumed its labors in consideration of the international wheat agreement and the new concepts upon which it is based. as a result of continuous study the committee has come to a unanimous conclusion. i am happy to submit another in the long line of committee reports by the score of 13 to 0. the committee has come to a unanimous conclusion which undertakes to do two things: first. to recognize the great importance of fully exploring this new concept. the principle of surplus agricultural marketing by international agreement. second. to assure time for its careful and prudent study. our problem has been to find a meeting of minds to resolve these two objectives. i am happy to say that we have unanimously done so. and i wish to read the very brief. threeparagraph report which the committee instructs me to submit to the senate in returning executive f of the eightieth congress. executive session. to the senate for the executive calendar. the official statement of the committee is as follows: [ex. rept. no. 121"},{"1":"1947","2":"KEATING","3":"E","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr.

dollars. my interest in this was aroused by my good friend from pennsylvania who served with me in india. but i do not find myself in complete harmony with his viewpoint. however. i think he has a considerable amount of merit in his position. i find that so far as bituminous coal is concerned. there is no such laboratory. that is taken care of at perin state. and i am informed. and if i have been incorrectly informed one of these coal men will gladly set me straight. that both lafayette and lehigh colleges have offered to do the same thing for the anthracitepeople and give them the spade and equipment if they can have $10.000 for personnel to run the place. certainly. this seems a desirable solution. i grant you it might be desirable to have this anthracite laboratory. but i seriously question whether it is essential. if it is not essential. i earnestly ask the committee to vote in favor of this substitute amendment. certainly. the construction is notnecessary at this time. if we defer this. and that is all that is being done by striking out this provision. no harm will be done because we can get along another year without an anthracite laboratory to the tune of half a million dollars."},{"1":"1946","2":"EASTLAND","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"as a part of the question. i wish to read from an editorial of the los angeles times: action of the assembly governmental efficiency committeethat is of the state of californiain tabling the socalled fair employment practice lill of assemblyman hawkins is an occasion for congratulation. since it seems certain such legislation. however well meant. would do more harm than good. it is unfortunate that persons are discriminated against in obtaining employment because of their race. color. or creed. such discrimination is the result of unreasoning prejudice: it is illogical and wrong. but prejudice cannot be removed either by force or by attempt\" to legislate it out of existence. \"a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still\" is a very old and a very true saying. when you say to a man that he ought not to have prejudices. you may get somewhere with him by argument or persuasion. but if you try to say to him that he must not have prejudices. that he will be penalized if he does. you are very apt to rouse his obstinacy. prejudice lies in the realm of emotion. not of reason. i ask the distinguished senator to pay close attention to this part of the question: there is also the practical consideration that no fairemployment practice committee can possibly tell. in most cases. whether a man is refused employment because of unfair discrimination or because he is not considered adapted to the job. rulings would have to be based on guess.. with grave danger of injustice. i invite the attention of the distinguished senator to that part of the question. because the commission which is provided for under the pending bill would do grave injustice to employers in this country. i continue reading: and the door would be opened to racketeering. an employer. threatened with being summoned before a fairemployment practice committee. could be \"shaken down\" easily in many cases. does not the distinguished senator know that if the personnel of the present committee on fair employment practice should be transferredas is provided for under the pending billto the new. agency. employers would certainly. be shaken down. because of their inability to secure a square deal before the radical elements who are now employed by the present committee? i continue reading from the editorial which i am making a part of my question: in some cases. it is not the prejudice of the employer that causes discrimination but that of his employees. it would be unfair to punish a man because all his workers are not broadminded. i invite in particular the attention of the distinguished senator to what i have just read. let us consider a business which employs a personnel man. if that personnel man should be prejudiced. and should violate the law. the employer could be penalized and put into jail. under such a system one man could be punished criminally for wrongs committed by another man. is that the distinguished senators idea of justice? i read further: all in all. this is not a subject for legislation. but for education. not for agitation. but for persuasion. not for impatience. but for forbearance and time. efforts to provide a quick cure may make the disease much worse. does not the distinguished senator agree with the reasoning in the editorial which i have read. which was printed in the los angeles times of january 18. 1946. the los angeles times being one of the great california newspapers?"},{"1":"1945","2":"BURTON","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. it is on that point that i disagree with the senator. i believe that there will be. in addition to a strengthening

members on that side of the house and many on the republican side pleading that we do something for national defense. that we prohibit communistic tendencies in this country. when we know that a lot of these strikes now going on are fomented by the \"fifth columnists.\" by people who are not -real redblooded americans. when good american citizens want to work and are prohibited from working

mean and vicious slanders that were directed against the white people of the south during the debate on it. i do not have time to point out all the dangers in this legislation. it is being shoved through on the pretense that its advocates in the house are trying to help the laboring man. when as a matter of fact it is calculated to have the most baneful effect upon the laboring people of the south. i am talking about the people who work for a living. in the mills. in the lumber yards. in the factories and on the farm. i know something about it. i have been a day laborer. and i have worked on a farm. i rode a carriage at a saw mill for two years to get money to go to school one year. many of the men with whom i worked will be thrown out of employment if this bill becomes a law. it will not raise their wages. it will just close the mill. that is what some of you want. you want to destroy southern industry and force all manufacturing establishments back into the large cities of the north and east. you kidglove members from the cities need not attempt to tell me about the problems of the laboring man. i have had experience. and i know more about the problems of the man who toils for his daily bread than you will ever know. it makes me a little tired to hear you windowsill farmers from new york. boston. pittsburgh. and philadelphia attempt to tell us about the conditions of the farm laborers. you are not even interested in them. you know this bill will pile upon the farmers backs untold burdens of expenses. without giving them the slightest benefit. you propose in this bill to prevent any man working in any kind of industry unless he can get 40 cents an hour. that means that if he cannot get 40 cents an hour. then he cannot work at all. he must either beg or seek the relief rolls. that destroys the very fundamental principle of human liberty. the greatest liberty a man can have on this earth is the liberty of working for his daily bread. if you are honest and sincere in your pleas for the laboring man. why do you attempt to make this wide distinction between people working in industry and people working on the farm? a cotton farmer makes 1 cent an hour for his work for every cent a pound he receives for his cotton. today cotton is about 8 cents a pound. that means that every cotton farmer makes about 8 cents an hour. and wheat. corn. and other farmers about in proportion. if you are going to do justice among the people who toil. why not write into this bill a provision to raise the farmers pay to 40 cents an hour. which would mean 40 cents a pound for cotton and $4 a bushel for wheat? instead of that. you are raising the prices of everything the farmer has to buy and leaving him with the bag to hold. you dodge that issue by saying that this does not apply to farmers. now. if you think the farmers of this country are so stupid that they cannot see that this will pile additional burdens upon them in increased prices for the things they have to buy. without increasing the prices of the products of their farms. then you men from the south and west. who are supporting this monstrosity are in for a rude awakening. if this bill would raise the wages of all the laborers in the country who are underpaid. god knows i would be glad to support it. but it will not do that. and you know it will not do that. it will simply close industrial establishments in the southern states and in the western states. throw thousands of people out of employment. concentrate industry back into the large cities and into large establishments where fewer people will be employed for the amount of goods producedsince machinery will take the place of manpowerand unload upon the unprotected masses. -including farmers of the nation. additional burdens that they will be unable to bear. this will raise the prices of manufactured articles. with the result that goods will flow in from foreign countries. then you will be clamoring to build the hightariff wall higher in order to protect american manufacturers. that will add additional burdens to the farmers of the nation. and destroy the efforts now being made by our distinguished secretary of state. hon. cordell hull. to rebuild our international trade. in my humble judgment. the laboring people of this country will curse the day this bill ever became a law. and will curse you for placing this vicious legislation upon the statute books of this republic. you say that we can manufacture goods more cheaply in the south and in the small towns throughout the agricultural belt than you can in the large cities of the east. that is true. what you manufacturers pay your laborers in wages over and above what they get in smaller towns of the south and west. is taken away from them in exorbitant tents. excessive prices for the necessities of life. exorbitant utility charges. and other similar expenses. you do not want to give us any differentials or make any difference between the wages to be paid in the south and west and the wages to be paid in the large cities of the east. yet. when the relief bill was before the house the other day an attempt was made to wipe out those differences and you voted it downalthough it was shown that in the average southern state a relief laborer only gets about $19 a month. while in new york he gets about $55 a month. but when it comes to placing this measure upon the statute books. to outlaw and destroy southern industry. you refuse any differentials whatsoever. if this bill becomes a law without the biermann amendment it will probably close thousands of cotton gins throughout the south. it will close the small canning plants and other processing establishments upon which the farmers depend for a market for their crops. some of you. are consoling yourselves with the thought that the american people. and particularly the farmers. do not understand this legislation. you let this measure become a law in its present form and you will find out whether or not the people know what is in it before you. or your successors. come back to the seventysixth congress. some of you northern democrats are saying that you can get along without the south. that you can have a northern democratic party. i have heard that argument quite often in recent months. let me remind you that the democratic party originated in the south. and if it had not been for the south holding up the banner of democracy in recent years there would be no democratic party today. if you should succeed in driving the south out of the party. it would not only mean the end of the party itself. but it would sound the death knell of democracy in america. if i might be permitted to borrow from the lips of a great statesman of a century past and gone. an apostrophe to liberty. revise and appropriate it to democracy. which. to use his own language. are \"one and inseparable.\" i would say that in the south. sir. where the democratic party raised its first voice. where its youth was nurtured and sustained. there it still lives in the strength of its manhood and full of its original spirit. if discord and dissension shall wound it. if religious strife and blind ambition shall hawk at it and tear it. if communism. if fascism. if folly. if madness. if uneasiness under salutary or imaginary restraints shall succeed to separate it from those principles by which alone its existence is made sure. it will stand in the end by the side of that cradle in which its infancy was rocked. and it will fall at last. if fall it must. amidst the

socalled \" recovery program \". with its official tomtom beater for the 200 monopoly codes. the leader of brass bands and dealer in wall street stocks. who has been of late. in headlines of our leading newspapers. quoted as lashing the \"senate critics \" who are described as sightless foes of recovery.\" but history records a wiser prophet than even the man who describes himself in his book of the n.r.a. as the \" associate of bernard m. baruch.\" i doubt if mr. baruch himself. with whom the \"associate \". according to the press. spent christmas week. would be unwise enough to publish the statement that repeal of the clause to suspend the antitrust laws would \"kill the recovery program.\" this confession is a tacit admission that the fundamental purpose of this particular section of the n.r.a. act is to put the government behind monopoly. not only are the antitrust laws of the united states in danger. but the common law of the englishspeaking nations against monopolistic restrictions of trade is in danger. our antitrust statute establishes no new principle. it is simply the statutory expression of the commonlaw principle which has been the law of our land for 145 years. ever since the adoption of the constitution and the organization of the first american court. i am expressing no new thought. it is the legal knowledge of every lawyer in this chamber. it is the finding of a hundred decisions by the united states supreme court. one of the greatest dangersindeed. the greatest dangerthat has threatened the republic of washington and jefferson. of lincoln and theodore roosevelt. is this: to place all the industries of the united states. all the commerce and domestic trade activities of 48 states. all the labor and all the homes and means of living. under the dictatorial control of a wall street stock broker or an \" associate\" of a stock broker. the proposal that such a condition. resorted to in an hour of supposed \" emergency \". should be made permanentthe proposal that the temporary industrial dictatorship should abide indefinitelyis a proposal to overthrow the republic of the constitution. abolish \" government of. for. and by the people \". and substitute the fascisti system that now rules the land of the coesars. the only major country suffering an industrial setback from july to november 1933. was the united states. even in 1932 the industrial index of the united states from july to november. as disclosed by the published data of the federal reserve board. recorded a substantial advance. in 1933 the federal reserve index of industrial production dropped from 100 in july to 73 in november. a decline of 27 percent. july is the pivotal month for measuring the economic effect of the two industrial measures of the socalled \"new deal \"-namely. the a.a.a. and the n.r.a. congress adjourned june 16. its last act was the passage of the n.r.a. bill. the bill was signed on the night of june 16. the first n.r.a. code signed by the president. the cotton textile code. was approved july 17. therefore. the industrial trend during the month following july is the economic measure of the benefits and disasters of the n.r.a. the same goes for the a.a.a. government departments and bureaus--federal reserve. commerce. agriculturegive the country their own official record of the disaster to industrial production from july to november. and the disaster to farm prices and to the farmers purchasing power from july to november. by that record. the new deal must stand or fall. this record shows that from july to november 1933. industrial production fell 27 percent. the purchasing power of the farmers dollar dropped steadily month after month. and the price of wheat fell over 30 cents a bushel. the first n.ra. code was that of cotton textiles. cotton was also the first farm crop to which the a.a.a. was appliedby an order to plow under 15.000.000 acres of growing cotton. what was the effect of the n.r.a. on cotton textiles? what the effect on the cotton farm price? what the effect on cotton consumers? what was the total cost of the hullabaloo to the united states as applied to cotton? the cost of cotton goods to the country has been approximately doubled. the cost of denim in the workmans overalls has been increased something like 100 percent. the cost of calico and sheetings in the homes of the country and in the dresses of the mothers and children has been increased 50 percent or more. the cost to the government treasury for these experiments exceeds $100.000.000.. what was the benefit to the cotton industry? the answer is. \"nil. nothing whatever. on the other hand. the net effect has been disaster.\" the convention of the cotton states. held here in washington and presided over by the senator from south carolina . chairman of the senate committee on agriculture. bears adequate testimony to the failure of the n.r.a. and a.a.a. as applied to the cotton industry. today we read that cotton forwardings to the mills and markets are lower than on the same date 1 year ago. we find that cottonmill employment. as measured by cottonspindle activity. is lower than 1 year ago. we read that scores of cotton mills have closed down by lack of mill orders. with resultant reduction of employment. we find that the price of cotton is lower than in july. when the n.r.a. and a.a.a. began. we find that the government cost of these experimentsplowing under 15.000.000 acres of good cotton. the imposition of over $100.000.000 of processing taxes. the cost of n.r.a. and a.a.a. reaches in the aggregate several hundred millions. and the only material results are two: first. to increase the cost of cotton goods to over 30.000.000 homes and 125.000.000 forgotten consumers. second. to reduce our exports of both cotton and cotton goods abroad. and stimulate imports of european cotton goods. cotton mills have lost both in domestic and foreign sales. cotton farmers have lost both in home and foreign markets. cottonmill hands and cottonfield hands have lost .jobs. and the entire population of cottongoods consumers have paid the costs and losses in hundreds of millions. one of the marked disasters of the n.r.a. and a.a.a. to the cotton industry. it appears from the commerce reports. is the marked increase in imports of foreign cotton goods and the practical ruin of the american export trade in cotton cloth. this export trade had risen to a value of $80.000.000. and included north and south america. large sales in the west indies and china. and fully 25 consuming countries. the n.r.a. and a.a.a. had boosted the price of sheetings. as shown by the commerce department survey of current business. from 4.7 cents per yard wholesale in september 1932 to 8 cents in september 1933. and other cotton goods in proportion. note the effect on imports and exports. imports of cotton cloth for september 1933 were more than double the imports for the same month the year before. exports of cotton cloth. on the other hand. declined from 25.000.000 square yards in september 1932 to less than 14.000.000 for the same month in 1933. even production of cotton cloth had fallen from 88.000.000 yards in september 1932 to 57.000.000 in the same month in 1933 under the n.r.a. thus. the principal benefit of the n.r.a. and a.a.a. in the cotton industry has been to foreign cotton mills. foreign cotton growers. and foreign cotton merchants. in capturing from this country its great cotton trade. the united states census bureau gives in a nutshell the disaster inflicted upon this great industry by 6 months of this n.r.a. hullabaloo to promote code no. 1. the cottontextile code. in june. the month before these two birds of disaster pouncedupon our industries. cotton consumption by american mills exceeded 696.000 bales. in december. after 6 months of the n.r.a.. american mill consumption fell to 348.000 balesa decline of 50 percent. six months of the blue eagle had destroyed half the cottonmill consumption. upon which both the cotton grower and the mill hand depended for a living. in june. before the blue eagle appeared. american cottonmill consumption of raw cotton and production of cloth far exceeded the records of former years. in both november and december 1933 american cottonmill production was below the same months in .1932. the cost of code no. 1 in this blueeagle hullabalooincluding reduced mill production and cotton consumption. reduced exports and increased imports. loss of foreign trade. loss of 15.000.000 acres of growing cotton. processing taxes. government appropriation for administration. and increased cost of living for the 127.000.000 \"forgotten \"-will easily exceed $500.000.000. it may reach a billion before the nonsense is ended. this is too much to pay for hullabaloo. vaudeville. brassband parades. airplane junkets. crackingdown speeches. may be all right for entertainment. but they are not a substitute for industry. for business. and the means of living in 30.000.000 homes. also. they axe a poor substitute for government. this is only code no. 1. there are now about 200 codes. if we want to view their aggregate effect. we can read it in the presidents budget messagean increase of the public debt by ten billions and a prospective budget loss of seven billions. the budget message of january 4 is the worlds most eloquent demonstration of the high cost of hullabaloo. not hitler. mussolini. and the soviet combined can exhibit a budget disaster equal to that presented to this congress on the second day of this session. take another codethe iron and steel industry codeapproved by the president august 19. 1933. one might think that the steel industry would have been stimulated by the steel code. steel companies not only received a suspension of the antitrust laws but they are given the notorious \"pittsburghplus\" graft. which had been declared unlawful by the federal trade commission in its rulings of 1925. the commission had found that the effect of the pittsburghplus bonus amounted to a tax of $30.000.000 a year on the farms of 12 middle western states alone. in the unlawful extra charges accrued on farm implements. barbed wire. motors. engines. building. and general construction. applied to the country at large the steel code should have promoted the industry. if special privileges could accomplish that result. what do we find? in the closing weeks of july. before the steel code was approved. steel mills were running at 60 percent of maximum capacity. the average steel activity for july was 58 percent. by november. after 4 months of the n.r.a.. the federal reserve board tells us that steel activity has declined \"to 25 percent.\" the july average of 58percent capacity dropped to a novemberdecember average of 28 percenta reduction loss of one half in the key industry. iron and steel. the administration has made heroic efforts to make a market for steel. it appropriated $238.000.000 for building armed cruisers for the navy. it loaned $84.000.000 to the pennsylvania railroad to hasten construction improvements. it expended $100.000.000 on army camps and further hundreds of millions on delayed construction projects. yet. with all this pumping of government loans and appropriations. public debt. and treasury deficit. to make a market for steel and promote steel activity. the end of the year finds the steel industry operating at only 34 percent capacity. compared with 58 to 60 percent in the weeks immediately prior to the approval of the steel code. the net result of the steel code is comprised in these items: first. the antitrust laws have been suspended. second. the steel corporation and its allies have been authorized by government edict to do the very acts of restricting trade. reducing production. and boosting prices for which they were formerly prosecuted for violation of law. third. they have been granted the pittsburghplus graft hitherto declared unlawful as extortionate charges on other industries. fourth. they have reduced their productive activity and they have increased the cost of every constructive improvement by the government and american citizens. industries. and transportation projects using iron and steel. the amount of this levy upon the country at large may be estimated by the following iron quotation. employed by the commerce department as a key to the iron and steel price basis: no. 2 philadelphia foundry iron has jumped from $13.94 in january a year ago to $19.26an increase of 40 percent. steel billets. pittsburgh. stand at the same unchangeable trust price at which they have stood for 2 yearsand the government is backing the trust against the country at large. if there is any trust in america that is not represented today on the advisory boards of this new deal. i should be glad to have its adv6cates name that trust. if there is any industrial monopoly that is not authorized by the n.r.a. to write its own pricefixing code. i should be glad to have that monopoly named. the recovery act itself contains the borah amendment. adopted by the senate. in the following language. as appears in section 3: provided. that such code or codes shall not permit monopolies or monopolistic practices. but what does the n.r.a. care about law? what are the law and constitution in a time when government is administered by hullabaloo? the weird financial experiments of the past 90 days are. in effect. an admission that the n.r.a. is a failure. the a.a.a. a fizzle. and the blue eagle a flop. downfall of industrial production since the n.r.a. started with code no. 1 on july 17a 27percent downfall from july to november. as officially ascertained by the federal reserve board. together with a like decline in the julynovember price of wheatforced the administration into paying $35 for an ounce of gold worth $20.67 in the vain effort to recoup farm purchasing power. all that the government accomplished by this experiment was to donate from the treasury deficit a bonus of about $15 an ounce to great britain and its possessions. the chief producers of gold. and to france. the principal foreign holder of gold. the millions that these two powers should have paid to the united states treasury on their lawful debts. the gold bonus paid to england and france simply added to the debt to be paid by american taxpayers. the american dollar is now set at 59 cents by the president with no appreciable benefit to the purchase power of the farm. but with a marked loss to the wage earner in the marked up cost of living and with marked loss to the 127 million \"forgotten\" in higher prices for codemonopoly goods. the sound currency pledge of the inaugural message was thrown to the winds. and the american dollar. which from the day of washington down for 144 years had been the watchword of stable value. is the flotsam and jetsam of fluctuation on every foreign exchange. during the past 100 days no man has known what an american dollar is worth from morn till sunset. it is set at 59 cents today. perhaps it may be set at 55 cents tomorrow. it all depends upon speculation in foreign exchange. financial confidence has become a crazy quilt. millions of american capital have taken wings abroad. on the wings of the blue eagle hundreds of millions are leaving this country. the federal reserve statement of january 15. 1934. shows that in the year beginning january 10. 1933. the reporting member banks in 90 leading cities showed a shrinkage of $525.000.000 in loans. a loss of 281 millionsin net demand deposits. and a drop of. 312 millions in time deposits. in the week following the presidents message. january 310. 1934. the bank debits to individual accounts fell off by the huge margin of $1.500.000.000. is this national recovery? is it not. rather. a financial demonstration that the country is fed up with its weekly dosage of patent nostrums that lead to nothing but another batch of new prescriptions? as usual with all political panaceas. the pretense is kept up that labor is the great beneficiary. the leading argument is that the n.r.a. has abolished child labor. yet every member of congress knows that child labor had been abolished by state statute or constitutional amendment in a vast majority of the states long before the n.r.a. was ever heard of. in addition to state enactments. congress had passed the proposed amendment to the federal constitution abolishing child labor. by a vote of 61 to 23 in the senate and by a vote of 297 to 69 in the house. back in 1924. doubtless. the state legislative sessions of the present winter will extend the ratifications to the number required by the constitution. but whether they do or not. over two thirds of the states were already operating under state child labor acts before the election of 1932. this false claim to credit due to the acts of the states is an admission of n.r.a. failure and a confession of a desperate need to find excuse for n.r.a. continuance. if the n.r.a. was a solution of the employment problem. why the c.w.a.with a cash appropriation of $400.000.000. and the last weeks addition of $950.000.000? the latter is simply a confession that the n.r.a. was a flop. powerful statistics have been issued to the effect that in in december 4.000.000 unemployed had been made permanently selfsupporting by this sum of $400.000.000. which netted $100 a head for each of the alleged 4.000.000. let us examine this claim. the only dependable and nonpolitical authority on the subject of unemployment is the american federation of labor. in june 1933. when congress last adjourned. the countrys unemployment was rated at 11.000.000. as compared with 12.000.000 in march. when the business of the country was paralyzed by the new deal administration closure of all banks. when congress met. the american federation of labor filed its annual report to the effect that the present unemployment figure is 10.700.000. the employment relief since june had been only 300.000. even after the alleged 4.000.000 had been made permanently selfsupporting by the c.w.a. if we accept the administration statement of the december relief of 4.000.000. then we are driven to the conclusion by simple arithmetic that from july to november the n.r.a. had thrown out of jobs 3.700.000 hands. the only national authority for unemployment is the american federation of labor. the united states labor department gets returns from only a limited percentage of manufacturing concerns and then makes an estimate. and everyone knows what estimates are worth when made by the \"brain trust.\" the labor bureau of statistics does not get returns from over 5 percent of the total 40.000.000 people gainfully employed in normal times. the rest. under the present administration. is \"brain trust\" estimate. the american federation of labor. on the other hand. covers the entire labor field. its estimates have been accepted as the only national authority on the subject of employment and unemployment. it is not a partisan political organization. president green has done what he could. evidently. to help the administration organize the n.r.a. certainly he has given out no publicity in opposition to the n.r.a. experiment. he has done what he could to aid them. and here the figures stand. after 6 months of the n.r.a.. and $400.000.000 of c.w.a. relief. the unemployment total is still 10.700.000. or only 300.000 less than when the n.r.a. started with blue eagles and brass bands in midsummer. i either that 4.000.000 workers permanently made selfsupporting is a fiction or the n.r.a.. by forced reduction of mill production. cost the country 3.700.000 jobs. for the net employment gain. as shown by the american federation of labor. was only 300.000. the fact seems to be that the statistics published by the \"brain trust\" and its official spokesmenwhether pertaining to employment. the budget. the public debt. or any other branch of political propagandaseem to lack that necessary quality required of all highclass fictionthe quality known as .\" verisimilitude.\" webster defines the term as \"the appearance of truth.\" in reading a novel. or even listening to a talking picture on the screen. the public requires a high degree of verisimilitude in order to be very deeply entertained. lincoln. who was an expert on political literature. said: \"you can fool part of the people all the time \". doubtless meaning the party beneficiaries. \"and you can fool all the people part of the time. but you cannot fool all the people all the time.\" he meant by this. perhaps. that in the end the public would learn by bitter experience the high cost of hullabaloo. mr.

substitute will show that there is no possibility of detour and that the method. the very language spoken of herethat is. \"economical operation and location of the domestic industry under

strong man. but there was a party and political situation which made it better to put somebody in his place. - i am happy to come to the defense in this place of the president of the united states. it is easy to dramatize a president like theodore roosevelt who. though a member of the dutch reformed church. was essentially a fighting methodist. it is not so easy to understand or appreciate a president who has the quieter psychology of a quaker inheritance. it is another kind of power. equally effective and of great constructive importance in a period like this when quietness of spirit and thoughtfulness and practical ideas are worth more to the world than anything else. we have come upon a time when there is far greater power in ideas than in arms. when brute force is failing throughout the world as a means of solving any major problem. in the month of june of this year germany was on the verge of financial collapse. and collapse might soon have meant communism for germany. further economic and political disaster in europe. and greatly prolonged agricultural and industrial disorganization in the united states. germany attained a breathing spell and at least a chance to find her way out. through the power of two ideas and nothing elsethe idea of the debt holiday and the idea that by international agreement it might temporarily be determined what shortterm loans germany could safely pay and what she could not pay. there is at least a lessening menace of hitlerism and communism in that country. and recent dispatches indicate that the german people are ready to develop their own forms of relief. by a sweeping emergency program of reduction in prices and rents and rates of interest as well as wages and by heavy penalties for those who send their capital out of germany. those two ideas. which are giving germany a chance. which are aiding in the settlement of europe after a great tragedy. and which are thereby lessening the economic peril of america. are the product of the leadership of the president of the united states. and in that particular crisis. international dislocation and relations being what they are following the war. the president of the united states has been working for the people of the united states at every moment in the negotiations. in what are esteemed more purely domestic concerns there is also overwhelming evidence of the quiet power of character in the presidency and the leadership of unspectacular but effective ideas. in many other countries there have been revolution. disorder. national bankruptcy. artificial inflation. and panics on a wide scale. in america. none of these major evils. the serious manifestations of economic distress and inequality in the united states have been met by the people. as the president has met them. with quietness. with a sense of responsibility of all for each. with the assurance that government would do everything that a government should do. with a tremendous fulfillment of private initiative and generosity. without strikes or disorders or other ineradicable marks of industrial conflict. the president has sought the way out through practical. effective ideas which grow out of the experience of peoples and governments. including our own. in similar crises. and also through new ideas of constructive genius. the principle of maintaining wages wherever it can be reasonably done. the expediting of federal construction and the inspiring of state and municipal public works. the sponsoring of the magnificent effort of walter gifford and his associates in preparing throughout america for the hard winter of unemployment. the attempt at stabilization of agricultural and commercial and homeloan finance in time of peril. the many practical suggestions of the presidential messageall these indicate leadership of a high and practical order. instead of inflation. the setting free of the idle money in the private hoards and frozen banks and setting it to work for the nation. instead of reaching blindly into the common treasury of the country for the purpose of the unintelligent distribution of a deficit. the setting to work of the vast resources of private initiative and generosity in america to accomplish the task. this is the statesmanship of ideas and not the politics of demagogy. it is a process of facing realities with high intelligence. the alleged sin of being an optimist about america at the onset of the catastrophe is one which may easily be forgiven. there is no reason for us to expect that any man. because we have elected him president of the united states. should become endowed by that election with supernatural powers of prophecy and vision to foresee and forfend a catastrophe beyond the range of human experience. yet. large numbers of the american people have an unhappy tendency to blame the pilot at the helm when the storm rages and dangers threaten. it is not a tendency to be encouraged in the congress or the country. the year before abraham lincoln came up for election the second time. he was the subject of such bitter denunciation and attack that the confidence of large numbers of the american people was shaken. and no man of prominence could be found who predicted his reelection. a turn in the fortunes of war and the deep underlying sense of right in the breasts of the people reelected lincoln. wilson had a similar experience of public illwill. and so had washington. we compare no man in american history with lincoln. at least i do not. but every great and effective president who has sought with high intelligence and with all his soul to lead his people straight is entitled to the meed of gratitude and cheer. this is not the presidents depression nor any partys depression. if men go to war. they suffer the aftermath. if men kill each other and destroy each others wealth. there is no escaping the penalty. if men inflate values and prices beyond all reason. there is a judgment day. it is not in the power of human ingenuity to escape it. the human race was engaged for four years in the most vicious of all wars. a war of populations and deliberate inflations of currency and credit to facilitate the war. we are now reaping the harvest. the sin of war and the sin of inordinate speculation after the war. and the sin of neglect of the economic security of the masses of the people are bringing their retribution upon the just and the unjust alike. as they did in the days of which abraham lincoln wrote in his second inaugural: fondly do we hope. fervently do we pray. that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled up by the bondsmens 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword. as it was written 3.000 years ago. so still it must be said. \"the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether.\" it is this background of worldwide economic and moral failure that we must hold in imagination when we estimate the burdens and the services to america and mankind of the present president of the united states. we have a right to be grateful that we have at the helm of the ship. in the gigantic storm which envelops the world. a pilot of quietness and of ideas. for it is only the leadership of balanced judgment and adventurous wisdom that is of any advantage to us now."},{"1":"1930","2":"MCFADDEN","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. chairman. i am indebted to the members of the committee on military affairs for their courtesy in granliting me this time. mr. thomas w. lamont is quoted by the new york sun of june 2. 1930. as stating before an assembly of the academy of political science at the hotel astor thatchairman mcfadden of the house committee on banking and currency had made \"unfounded and unjust accusations\" against germany in connection with the young plan of reparations. the sun further states [quoting] : he represented mr. mcfaddens statement that germany went beyond the law in accepting tie obligations under the new plan and that the late herr stresemann had declared that germany could not fulfill the obligations. i am astonished that mr. lamont should raise the question of good faith at this late date. mr. lamont is laboring under all illusion. mr. mcfadden in none of his speeches charged the present german government or the german people theimselves with bad faith. nor did he state in any of his addresses that \"germany went beyond the law.\" what mr. mcfadden did say was to quote herr streseimann in a speech delivered by him before the reichstag on june 24. 1929. with which the investing public of the united states are thoroughly familiar. this statement was printed in the london times of june 25. 1929. on page 16. first column. i have it here [displaying file of the london times]. i have here also a copy of the official record of the proceedings in the german reichstag of june 20. 1929. the statement of herr stresemann appears in that copy. .ad these are the exact words that i quoted in the previous speech to which mr. lamont referred. and i now repeat them and say that they are identical with tile statement i referred to in the london times. and they are from the proceedings in the german reichstag on that date. this is what herr stresediana then said: do you think that any member of the government regards the young plan as ideal? do you believe that any individual can give a guaranty for its fulfillment? do you believe that anybody in the world expects such a guaranty from us? the plan would only represent. in the first place. a settlement for the coming decade. the point is whether it loosens the shackles which fetter us and lightens the burdens which we have yet to fulfill. and what mr. mcfadien further said was that the reparations bonds. having grown out of the illegal clauses in the armistice upon which the illegal clauses in the treaty of versailles rest. and from which the german reparations commission. as well as the present bank for international settlements. derived their authority. constituted an illegal barrier to the commercialization of the present bonds which the american public are now requested to purchase. what is generally understood by all international lawyers. and in which i thoroughly concur. is that the only foruma in which a purchaser of these bonds could recover. in the event of the failure or impossibility on the part of the german people keeping up their payments and thus defaulting upon the payment of principal and interest would be in a german court in which the principles of german law would be applied. and even if the german courts were persuaded to adopt the law of nuations as a guide in their ruling upon the question. it would still be impossible for any german court to decide otherwise than that the bonds were a result of duress and bad faith on the part of the allies in the armistice and all its subsequent dictating policies and instrumentalities which brings these bonds now into the markets of the world. therefore it is not a question of the bad faith of germany at all but the question of bad faith on the part of the allies which lies at the base of these bonds and entirely destroys their validity in any court of international law. even if the rules thereof be applied in the local courts of germany. by referring to the dispatch fromn paris in the new york times of june 3 by carlisle macdonald. it will be noted that already efforts are being made for some arrangement by the bankers with the authorities in germany to overcome the manifest illegality of the bonds now offered. and that so far nothing satisfactory has been invented to overcome this difficulty. mr. lamont can not. by misquoting me. nor by his present attempt to appear sympathetic with the german people. reverse his previous attitude and place the burden upon others of proving the allies innocent in forcing germany to submit to terms and thus issue bonds which. under the law of nations and the common promptings of humanity. should never have been done. it is up to mr. lamont to excuse his previous attitude and to show conclusively by legal authority that the bonds he now seeks to market in this country are at least capable of being recommended by lawyers of repute. common honesty demands this at least. now. particularly this paragraph in the new york times report is significant. it says: the matter of the price of the bonds in the various markets is still being worked out. but there are indications that american investors will have the opportunity of purchasing them at a very attractive price. one suggestion is that the price will be around 85 or 86. to yield nearly 61a per cent. that the american price will be approximately at this figure is borne out by the dispatches from washington published here today to the effect that the state department has given its informal consent to the flotation in american of \" one third of the loan.\" or $100.000.000. previous estimates of the american share have fixed the amount at $85.000.000. but when this was pointed out in responsible american banking quarters it was explained that if the american issue price was around 85 it would be necessary to sell $100.000.000 worth of bonds to complete the american allotment of $85.000.000. to quote further. and this is significant: it will be recalled that one of the main problems inherited by the committee of four was the delicate question of the services of two portions of the loan. that is to say. the $200.000.000 destined for the allied treasuries and guaranteed as to thme interest and principal by a portion of the unconditional annuities of the young plan. and the third $100.000.000 which the bankers. with the consent of the allied powers. are lending to germany for the development of her railways and postal services. the latter is secured only by the german budget. it was said today that a strong \" legal formula\" had been reached under the terms of which each portion of the loan will bear an equal guaranty as to interest and principal. thus removing any doubts which prospective investors might have had regarding the security for (what) the $100.000.000 to be paid to germany. the committee on banking and currency of the house of representatives have. through its chairman. requested from our state department information which has not been forthcomingthe chairman is still insisting and waitingyet we find that the state department. if the above statement be true. has been cooperating with and keeping fully informed the foreign interests which are now seeking to market their securities in this country. is it not about time. in view of these recited occurrences. that the state department now inform congress and the american investing public what position it does actually assume in regard to the legality and sale of the bonds now being recommended by mr. lamont which are to be sold by j. p. morgan & co. to the american investors? mr. lamont should also now make clear to the american investing public whether he proposes to sell $100.000.000 worth of the proposed commercialized german reparation bonds. which require a strong formula for their support. or whether j. p. morgan & co. propose to sell to the american public the $100.000.000 worth of bonds representing an advance by the bankers to the german government for the development of her railway and postal services. which are only secured by the german budget. recognizing the fact that the american people have long memories. there are few of our own investors in liberty loan and victory loan bonds who will fail to recall that bonds of this great country for which they paid 100 cents on the dollar fell after the armistice to 82 cents on the dollar. remembering this. it is a matter of

votes from my party. and because it contains a little sop built to stand 10.000 years. it is being built of indiana limestone. a material upon which the climate. weather. or the elements have a very little appreciable deteriorating effect. i am much interested in this building program to know that our country shall obtain value received in the material and construction of these public buildings. also that these structures shall have beauty and qualities of permanence. on north sixteenth street. in this city. stands the elegant scottish rite temple. also erected of indiana limestone. this is an attractive edifice. being outstanding in magnificence. and in the words of wordsworth may be describeddull would be he of soul who could pass by a sight so touching in its majesty. in the business world are many specimens of buildings erected for commercial purposes that have put indiana limestone at the top of the list as a permanent and economical material for construction. the grand central terminal station of new york city is one of the greatest building projects of modern times. it was george w. vanderbilt. a director. who became so interested in indiana limestone as a building material in connection with this station. that he also erected his new york residence. named biltmore. out of the same material. i can not recount all. but a few commercial buildings are the cunard building. standard oil building. new york cotton exchange. and in chicago is the tribune building. the strauss building. and the university club. of the 12 reserve banks 7 are housed in buildings constructed of indiana limestone. and in one other it is used in connection with other material. there are five state capitols constructed of indiana limestone. including the one at indianapolis. in the state where mother nature bestowed the blessing and material resource of this deposit of stone. the capitol of indiana was erected about the year 1880 at an approximate cost of 80 cents a cubic foot. and it is an outstanding circumstance that the same kind and quality of stone would cost no more today. and this in face of the facts that labor costs. freight. machinery. and all overhead charges have increased many times. the increased charges have been offset by the improvements in machinery and facilities to quarry. handle. saw. and dress this stone with an increased output that has taken care of these increases of cost. thus the employees and the public get the benefit of these improvements of discovery. invention. and efficient management. the aggregate output of these indiana quarries is approximately 11.000.000 cubic feet. at an average cost of 65 cents per cubic foot. making a total annual value at the quarries of $ 7.000.000. and to which should be added for milling and shaping a cost of from .$2 to $6 per cubic foot. there is much line carving of stone that can not be calculated by the cubic foot. indiana furnishes about 40 per cent of all exterior building stone in the united states. and this is another good and sufficient reason wly the representatives from indiana believe that we should have a building program for the construction of government buildings. we desire the public buildings to be erected of a material that will stand with good appearances. in the centuries that are to come they will be the mnunents of this age. of course. granite is as permanent and marble is as beautiful. and we admire these materials. but bear in mind they are much more expensive. with indiana oolitic stone a century is more like a year to the softer stones and imitations that are being mistakenly used. think of a building stone that is thirtyfive times as strong. as is necessary to bear the load. indiana limestone has a strength of 7.000 pounds per square inch on 2inch cubes. and more on larger stone. and this is twice the strength of the best quality of concrete. washingtons monument has a pressure. of but 313 pounds per square inch on its foundation. and indiana limestone is possessed of twentythree times the strength required in this monument. which is conceded to be the highest and greatest piece of solid masonry in the world. indiana limestone has great fireresisting qualities. it can he heated to 1.0000 f. and then drenched with water without any appreciable bad effect. and when stained by simoke or by smoke and water. can easily be restored to its original color by scouring and rubbing. oolitic limestone comes in three colors. the buff is of fine texture and used extensively. after standing a while it assuies a beautiful yellowish gray and continues to mellow with the years. this color comes from the upper strata of the ledge. at the lower portion of the ledge the gray limestone with depth of tone in the silvery hazy gray shade. which is also pleasing to the eye. between these two extremes. and mixed with both. is the variegated limestone. which is also now being used extensively. depending upon the tastes of the builder and the nature of the building. it seems a great pity that substitutes and imitations should be used when the creator has given to man building material of rare beauty and permanence that has been under the tempering processes of the forces of nature for untold ages. and which can not be approached by mans mechanical processes. let the age in which we live be wise enough to avoid the mistakes of our fathers in building public buildings out of softer and inferior material. that will not stand. when we examine the original portions of the capitol and the white house. and with remorse know they are but a trifle over a century in age. and see their deterioration. we appreciate what a disappointment it is that they were not constructed of granite. marble. or limestone. to oolitic limestone and the harder stones in comparison a century is more like a year to the softer stones. indiana limestone was intended for the ages. it is the nations building stone. solomon in all his glory. when he built the temple. had no material superior. and most of it not so good. as what we have available today. egyptian limestone contained chemical elements that reduced its resistive quality to moisture and acidladen atmospheres. yet the great sphinx. the pyramids of gizeh. the sun temple of abusir. and the temples of karnak have been standing for thousands of years and are built out of limestone. the tomb of the pharaoh tutankhamen is cut in the solid ledge of limestone. though inferior to indiana limestone. it has preserved the buried treasure for 3.500 years. the purity of indiana limestone makes it practically immune to the action of the frost. moisture. and other climatic and destructive elements. i am for this public buildings bill because i see the government departments here in the capital and elsewhere scattered through houses that are unsightly. unhealthy. void of convenience and beauty. and which subject the life of employees and the public records to the hazard of fire. we are reputed to be the richest nation in the world and are engaged in constantly reducing taxes on the incomes in the higher brackets. it strikes me that in this golden age of commercial supremacy. when gigantic fortunes are being accumulated. that tile government which furnishes the protection. stability. and opportunity to this material progress should not be neglected and abandoned until its activities are nmore poorly housed than those of the private beneficiaries of americas material blessings. furthermore. our government is paying out immense sums for rent and getting poor returns for the money. we are sadly in arrears on our government housing. and i approve the proposed program continued through the years. these luildings should be built where they are most needed and where the income. return. and service will justify. i believe that this is administrative function rather than a legislative one. in this connection we might emplhasize that tills money spent will not only secure these necessary housing facilities. but tie money spent will not be lost if american materials are used and american labor is employed. it will furnish employment in time quarries. the mills. the railroads. and on the construction. and will thereby be a clear accumulation of productive wealth. the spending of money for buildings that are needed to conduct the activities of our government is a production of permanent value and wealth. the government. like the people. should be well housed. indiana hopes to share in this great building project and wants to contribute of her natural resources to help enrich the nation and also increase the comfort and happiness of her own people thereby. we can not believe that this is am unholy desire. if these public buildings are constructed by virtue of the socalled elliott bill. which i supported. then they should be built of a material of strength. durability. and beauty. to have all the elements of successful construction. to meet the requirements of not only this age but the future generations. to obtain the satisfaction of having buildings of which we can always be proud as to looks and permanence. and to do this at a reasonable cost. in which value is received for the expenditure. i would recommend that these government buildings be constructed of indiana limestone. the nations building stone. like the constitution of the united states. we want to erect our buildings for the ages. and we can build the nation securely and permanently with indiana limestone in the governments buildings. indiana limestone is \"the aristocrat of the building materials.\" and in the short space of onehalf a century has become the nations building stone."},{"1":"1925","2":"PEERY","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. chairman. i move to strike out the last two words. gentlemen. i was not fortunate enough to make my position very clear il the few

is now being done in this country. the whole point of our work. of course. is aimed at cheapening the production of the nitrogen portion of the fertilizer that the farmer uses. at the close of the war period the plants at muscle shoals were shut down. there were two plants. plant no. i and plant no. 2. plant no. 2 being the cyanamid plant. and plant no. 1 being the socalled modified haber process plant. or. more generally. the direct synthetic ammonia process. it was recognized from the beginning. or from the time those plants were put up that there was no question but what we could make plant no. 2 operate and make cyanamid. that technique was pretty well known in this country. but it was also recognized that it was to be an obsolete method so far as fertilizer was concerned. it had served its purpose in the development of the art. it was too expen sive. the haber plant. or plant no. 1. was the one we were taking the greatest gamble on being able to work. but the one that would go furthest toward the cutting of the costs if successful. at present we believe we have the no. 1 process in such shape that it is economical. i. for one. have always felt that it was aimed more directly at the fertilizer question than no. 2. plant no. 2 might. when the wilson dam is completed. be able to produce at about the current fertilizer prices. but it gives no promise of appreciably

have preceded me. i do wish. however. to discuss the necessity for the provisions of this bill as a war measure. as shown by actual conditions in the district which i represent. the conditions in that district are perhaps not anomalous. because i am informed. and reliably so. that they exist in many other sections of the country and that they are. indeed. quite typical of powershortage conditions. the .fact of the matter is that there is throughout the country generally a shortage of electrical power at this time. and that this is very nch hampering the war program of the government. this same situation. as appears by the testimony taken by the committee at the hearings on this bill. existed in england a short time after the war. and that their program for the construction of plants for the manufacture of munitions was from 9 to 12 months ahead of the program to supply the proper electrical energy .with which those plants could be operated. and that the electrical engineers of england warned the united states at the outset of this war that that might be. possibly. the condition confronting us in this country if we went along without making special preparations for electrical energy. it was discovered about six months ago that we were likely to confront these conditions. and the war department set about to correct them as well as it could. it had a survey of the country made. and. as was shown on the map which was exhibited before the committee today by the chairman of the committee on interstate and foreign commerce . there exists throughout the country what is commonly referred to as \" the congested section.\" which includes the new england states. new york. pennsylvania. new jersey. delaware. and that part of maryland running down along the chesapeake. now. included in that \" congested district \"-and it is congested for all purposes of fuel and transportation and electrical energyis the lehigh valley. twothirds of which is in the district which i have the honor to represent. in that district there are various large industries located. there is. in part. the anthracite mining region. there is the large cement region. which originated about 30 years ago and which was the origin. really. of the cement industry ii tle united states. in that district there are manufactured now about 23.000.000 barrels of cement -per annum. and a large portion of the mills manufacturing this product use electrical energy in its manufacture. they were induced to use electrical energy because of its economy. its saving of coal. and its saving of labor. and because of those representations and those business reasons they elimninated from their plants their old method of steam power and relied entirely on electrical power. and most of those large contracts were made with a company known as the lehigh navigation electric co. now. the lehigh navigation co. is a company that has been in existence almost a hundred years in that section. it was originally incorporated for the purpose of mining and transporting anthracite coal. and it occurred to them about eight years ago that it would be a most economical thing if they could utilize what is commonly known as the culim banks around the anthracite coal mines in that region. cuhu simply consists of the coal dust. you might saythe fine particles of coal dustthat is produced as the result of the screening of coal. which theretofore liad not been utilized for any useful purpose whatever. so at a cost of something like $15.000.000 this company constructed a plant at hanto. and also another plant which it purchased at harwood nearby. and they entered into contracts with these cement and industrial plants throfghout the valley. transmitting their current a distance of something like 150 miles from the place where the energy was generated on longternm contracts for the furnishing of this electrical energy to them. so that these various cement plants. relying upon this. made their contracts. depending. of course. upon tile uninterrupted furnishing of this service. now. nearby where these cement plants are being operated. and only about 30 or 40 miles also from the place where this electrical energy is being manufactured. is located the large bethlehenm steel plant. now employing over 35.000 men. and being employed practically 100 per cent in the manufacture of munitions for the government for use in the present war. the bethlehem steel plant used a considerable quantity of this electrical energy. but this fact did not at all interfere with the service to the other companies under their. contracts until within a recent period of time. the pressure of the government for the manufacture of munitions by the bethlehem steel co. became so great that it was necessary for the bethlehem steel co. to secure additional electrical energy. a representative of the war department. with full authority from that department to act in the premises. came upon the ground and. after a survey of the business conditions in that section. issued an order to the lehigh navigation electric co. to the effect that it must reduce the amount of electrical energy furnished the different cement plants and other manufacturing ptants in that region 25 per cent of what they were entitled to under their contracts. and that this electrical energy should be diverted to the bethlehem steel co. for the purpose of manufactuling munitions of war. and that was coupled with the further statement that the needs of the bethlehem steel co. would be such in the near future that the diversion of 25 per cent would soon be increased to 50 per cent. with the prospect that in six months time the entire quantity of electrical energy to which these cement and industrial plants would be entitled would be entirely diverted to the bethlehem steel co. so that these cement lndustrles and other industries which were furnished with electrical current in this way were faced with tile proposition of having no means of operating their plants. their old steam method having been entirely eliminated. and they would be unable to use their plants and the men who were employed would practically be thrown out of employment at that place and be compelled to go to some other point to secure employment. and the contracts which they had made for furnishing the cement manufactured by them would have to be vitiated in some way. now. of course. as stated by my colleague from pennsylvania awhile ago. the government has the right to commandeer this electrical energy under these contracts if it sees fit to do so. but in doing so the provision of the constitution still prevails that private property can not be taken for public use without just compensation. the rightthe contractual rightunder the terms of these different contracts between the electrical company and the cement companies was a property right. and when the united states government steps in and takes from them their property. rights under the terms of these contracts it is just as much a taking of property as would be the taking of land. and therefore the serious situation was that the cement companies would be unable to fulfill their cement contracts or manufacture their product. and they would only be eititled to turn a roufnd and ask for compensation from the federal government. which had diverted this power from them. that would be a question. of course. for the assessment of damages. depending as to amount upon the facts that might be developed upon the trial of the issues in the case. now. it is proposed. however. to avoid as much as possible the damiuges that would ensue from this radical act on the part of the government. made necessary by war conditions. the remedy that is proposed is that the government will assist this navigation electric co.ill extending its plant so that it will be able to conform to the contract previously made and also enable the bethlehem co. to receive an adequate amount of electric energy to manufacture munitions that the government needs and also supply the anthracite coal mines in that region wltl a sufficient quantity of electrical energy. so that they will be able to mine an additional quantity of coal so badly needed throughout the country for war purposes generally at the present time. in order to do that it is estimated by the engineers that it will require an expenditure of a million and a half dollars to make this extension. and it is necessary that speedy action be taken in the enactment of the measure such as is contemplated in the bill. for it will require from four to six months to install the necessary machinery."},{"1":"1917","2":"FORDNEY","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"i believe i have gone over that ground pretty thoroughly as to the newspapers. and i believe i have covered most of the items in this bill except one particular proposition that i want to mention. i have always been in favor of a protective. tariff on imports. i am now. if i were permitted to write a tariff law personally. i would not put some of the rates in the law as high as this bill is going to put them. i will give you an illustration. under tie dingley tariff law the duty oil rough lumber was $2 a thousand feet. in the payne tariff law that duty was reduced to $1.25 a thousand. the imports of lumber last year averaged about $22.50 per thousand feet. this bill. if put into law. will put a 10 per cent ad valorem duty on all imports. whether dutiable or free. this bill proposes 10 per cent ad valorem on lumber. and at $22.50 per thousand that amounts to $2.25 a thousand. if that lumber is dressed and made into flooringtongued and grooved. firstclass flooringwhen imported into this country from canada it sells for abut $50 per thousand feet. add the 10.per cent ad valorem duty and you have $5 per thousand feet on that grade of lumber. shingles imported at $2.50 a thousand will pay 25 cents duty. that is about what the tax was under the payne tariff law. or. i think. 30 cents a thousand. if this bill. goes into effect there will be nothing imported into this country free from any country in the world. it must all pay a duty in addition to the rates fixed in the underwood tariff law. there are many articles of raw material that ought to be brought into the country free of duty. i have never been in favor of putting a duty on noncompetitive products. such as tea. coffee. raw rubber. or hemp. for time reason. that we do not produce tea and coffee and crude rubber in this country. and yet practically everybody uses these articles. therefore it is a republican. principle to bring.into this country free of duty articles that we must have but do not produce. but under the provisions of this bill if put into law. coffee now imported at an average value of 9 cents a pound will have to pay ninetenths of 1 per cent per pound duty. last year the importations of tea averaged 18 cents a pound. and therefore tie duty will be 1.8 cents per pound. that will not hurt anybody. i believe tea and coffee could stand a higher rat of duty. but whether you put the import tax on articles that are not produced in this country. or whether you call it a consumption tax. it is a\" consunlption tax pure and simple. for it is a tax on a noncompetitive article. i am not in favor of that kind of taxes. but neither the committee on ways and means nor anybody else can sit here without extended hearings and fix scientific rates of duty to be added to existing law. or substitute for existing law. and get them anywhere near correct. at the present time it would be a very difficult matter. for the reason that prices are abnormal all over the world. as re-* gards the value of manufactured articles. agricultural products. and labor. i want to assure you gentlemen that. with my long experience on that committee. it is my candid belief that no body of intelligent men. conscientiously working together. can now sit down and put a scientific rate of duty on imports in less than from five to seven -months ofeffort."},{"1":"1916","2":"KENYON","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. i desire to place in the record a few more citations from the platforms in the past of the democratic party on the question of economy. in 1876. this party that has always pretended at least to stand for economy. in its platform said: we demand a judicious system of preparation by public economies. by official retrenchments. and by wise finance. again in 1.880. when that splendid old soldier. general hancock. was nominated for president. this same party said: we congratulate the country uponthe honesty and thrift of a democratic congress which has reduced the public expenditures $40.000.000 a year. in 1884 you said: we demand that federal taxation shall be exclusively for public purposes and shall not exceed the needs of the government. economically administered. in 1888 you said: every democratic rule of governmental action is violated when. through unnecessary taxation. a vast sum of money far beyond the needs of an economical administration. is drawn from the people and the channels of trade and accumulated as a demoralizing surplus in the national treasury. * * * debauched by this immense temptation. the remedy of the republican party is to meet and exhaust. by extravagant appropriations and expenses. whether constitutional or not. the accumulation of extravagant taxation. the democratic policy is to enforce frugality in public expense and to abolish unnecessary taxation. in 1892 you said in your platform : we pledge the democratic party if intrusted with power not only to defeat the force bill. but also to relentless opposition to the republican policy of profligate expenditures. in 1896 you said: we denounce the profligate waste of the money wrung from the people by oppressive taxation and the lavish appropriations of recent republican congresses. which have kept taxes high. while the labor that pays them is unemployed. and the products of the peoples toil are depressed in.price till they no longer repay the cost of production. we demand a return to that simplicity and economy which befits a democratic government. and a reduction in the number of useless offices. the salaries of which drain the substance of the people. i wonder what they might have thought when an under secretary of state was provided for in an appropriation act. to emulate the effete monarchies of europe. in 1900 you said: we favor a reduction and speedy repeal of the war taxes and a return to the timehonored democratic policy of strict economy in governmental expenditures. and the people now favor a speedy repeal. i think. of the war taxes. and the return. if possible. to econoihic expenditures. in the platform of 1904 you said: large reductions can easily be made in the annual expenditures of the government without impairing the efficiency of any branch of the publie service. and we shall insist upon the strictest economy and frugality compatible with vigorous and efficient civil. military. and naval administration as a right of the people too clear to be denied or withheld. yesterday i think i placed in the record something from the platform of 1912. to have the matter complete i quote from the platform of 1908: the republican congress in the session just ended made appropriations amounting to $1.008.000.000. exceeding the total expenditures of the past fiscal year by $90.000.000. and leaving a deficit of more than $60.000.000 for the fiscal year just ended. we denounce the needless waste of the peoples money. which has resulted in the appalling increase. as a shameful violation of all prudent considerations of government and as no less than a crime against the millions of working men and women from whose earnings the great proportion of these colossal sums must be extorted through excessive tariff exactions and other indirect methods. it is not surprising that in the face of this shocking record the republican platform contains no reference to economical administration or promise thereof in the future. we demand that a stop be put to this frightful extravagance and insist upon the strictest economy in every department compatible with frugal and cilicient administration. mr. bryan. who has recently left office. i assuime because of the extravagance of this administration. in a great speech to the farmers of minnesota during that campaign took occasion to denounce. as only he can denounce. the extravagances of the liepublican party. he said: why is it that the republican party is so much more extravagant than the democratic party in the expenditure of public money*? .there are two reasons : first. because the republican leaders are lore intimately associated with the tax eaters than with the taxpayers. they hear the hungry clamor of tle men who spend money moore than they do the protests of the masses who contribute revenues. the democratic partysays mr. bryanis in a position to bring reform in the matter of expenditures. yet we find the democratic administration piling up the cost of government beyond what any republican administration has ever done.. tile distinguished senator from texas . l0ng about the close of the roosevelt administration. denounced in a wonderfully strong speech in this (\"lunmber the republican party for its extravagance. he had a right to do it. the senator from mississippi in a speech in this body solie time ago. talking of the extravagances of government. said. among other things:. mr. president. i have drawn a picture. what is the lesson from it? that we ought to strain our nerves to try to circumscribe and limit the expenditures of this government. there is no sense in having the expenditures increase 400 per cent while population increases only 84 per cent. in 1896. i think it was. in the house of represental ives a distiaguished citizen from missouri. once governor of that state or since then govenor of the state. in a s)eech on the river and harbor bill. a gentleman who is now. i think. connected with the administration as third or fourth assistant postlaster ceneral. mr. dockery. said: why. mr. speaker. there wan not a kingof france who ever laid the heavy hand of the tax gatherer upon the people who did not claim to do it in the interest of the people. and there is not a single item in this billhe said. referring to the river and harbor billthat does not come here

widows or orphans. these soldiers now on the tottering side of timei say i could not and i will not vote for a measure which may be construed as an assault upon the pensions of the soldiers of my country. you pass this amendment. and it is only a question of time when other amendments will be offered. and there will be one assault after another until the pensions of the soldiers in this country will be seriously imperiled.\\n630441149|mr. chairman. old dr. johnson said. patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel. and he never uttered a truer word. we have to hear and read these buncombe speeches made by men who want to show their love for the old soldier by dipping deep into the public treasury. what is the question before the house?. the question is as to cutting off a million dollars in pensions now paid to those who have renounced their allegiance to the united states and became citizens of foreign countries. the amendment excepts in every case those who sustained actual injury. clearly meeting the case mentioned by the gentleman from missouri where they lost limbs or health they are expressly excepted under the amendment. it simply cuts off those who are drawing pensions for other reasons than disabilities incurred in the service and who have renounced their allegiance to the united states. that is the proposition. and it seems to me. as a matter of common sense. it ought to be adopted. i do not think there is a nation on the face of the earth outside of our own that pays pensions to aliens. the gentleman speaks of fraud. any lawyer on the floor of this house knows that fraud committed in a foreign country may be committed with impunity in behalf of these alien pensiouers and our courts have no jurisdiction to prosecute them. they are beyond the seas. beyond our jurisdiction. and beyond the reach of our process. and this law. which permits pensions to be paid to aliens in foreign countries. is simply placing a premium upon fraud. and when fraud is committed there is absolutely no remedy. i hope the amendment will be adopted.\\n630441150|mr. chairman. in answer to the statement of the gentleman from ohio . respecting the chances of fraud in the payment of foreign pensions. i want to say i had an experience as american consul at glasgow. scotland. and under the regulations every pensioner was required to come to the consulate every three months. where he or she qualified to the necessary vouchers an d were identified before the american consul. after that performance was completed the vouchers were transmitted by me to. the secretary of the interior. and the pension checks werereturned by mail. so there is absolutely no chance in the world of committing fraud against the treasury of the united states in the payment of pensions to those living abroad. in addition to the exemption stated by the gentleman. that these pensions should continue to soldiers who were diseased or injured. it does not cover the cases of widows of soldiers who live abroad. and i know of one or two instances in the city of glasgow where we are paying pensions to the widows of union soldiers. i hope the members of this house will let these old defenders of the union and their widows die in peace. they have only a few months or years to live. they are 70 and 75 years of age. beyond the seas in foreign lands. and we now propose to strike them down. to bring hardship and unhappiness to the hearts of every one of them who were willing to risk their lives to preserve the union. the american congress is now called upon to forget justice. to forget humanity. and to forget the services of these men in the time of the countrys peril. no man in this house should vote for this unjust amendment.\\n630441151|mr. chairman. will the gentleman yield for a moment?\\n630441152|mr. chairman. i would like to fix on some time when debate shall close on this paragraph and amendments thereto.\\n630441153|i want only five

consent that all debate on this paragraph and all amendments thereto close in five minutes. is there objection?\\n630441156|mr. chairman. reserving the right to object. my understanding is that the gentleman from pennsylvania [mr. huranos] has a substitute which he desires to offer to the amendment.\\n630441157|mr. chairman. i do not like.this amendment very much. and i prepared an amendment to offer as a substitute in its place. but i do not believe i like that very much. the gentleman from tennessee has changed his mind. i do not believe that this is a good time to cut these people off.\\n630441158|mr. chairman. reserving the right to object. i would like to have the opportunity of offering at least a pro forma amendment in order to make reply to some remarks which were made by the gentleman from georgia in charge of the bill in general debate when i was not present.\\n630441159|there is another paragraph.\\n630441160|very well.\\n630441161|the chair hears no objection. and it is so ordered.\\n630441162|mr. chairman. this same proposition has been before the house every year during the past four years when we considered the pension appropriation bill. a few years ago i put into the record the letter of mr. lochren. who was commissioner of pensions during the second administration of president cleveland. judge lochren wrote in his annual report the following: a clause of chapter 187 of the public acts of the second session of the fiftysecond congress provides: that from and after july 1. 1893. no pension shall be paid to a nonresident. who is not a citizen of the united states. except for actual disabilities incurred in the service. i respectfully ask your attention to this clause. in the hope that you may recommend its repeal. it causes great trouble and annoyance to the excepted classes. who constitute the great bulk of nonresident pensioners. in compelling them to make proof that they belong to these excepted classes. and the final result is that payments under it are withheld from but few. save widows and dependent mothers. who have little else for their maintenance. the saving is too little to offset the suffering inflicted in individual cases. if all nonresidents were refused payment of pension some plausible argument might be made in suppor~t of such policy. but none can be urged in favor of this law. which. while giving annoyance to all. strikes only the most helpless. i should not feel warranted in asking attention to thislaw but for the fact that it entails much work on this bureau. in answering communications. and seems to yield little practical results except annoyance and apparent cruelty. i recognize to the fullest extent that my sole duty is to execute and administer the laws as they are enactedfairly and honestly interpreted.. very respectfully. w m. lochrenc co m mi88ioa er.\\n630441163|mr. chairman. will the gentleman yield there?\\n630441164|no. i can not yield. that was the opinion of judge lochren. the democratic commissioner of pensions under president cleveland. what he says expresses my views. and i believe it expresses the views of the people of the united states. the report on this shows that of those nonresidents who receive pension. 504 reside in germany. and almost 500 of them in ireland. and more than 400 in england. does anyone suppose that any considerable number of those ever were citizens of the united states and have renounced their citizenships? certainly not. according to the report of judge lochren a large majority of them must be the widows of soldiers who gave their services to the united states. and those widows are now receiving a small pension of $12 a month. by this amendment you propose to take it away from them. when their husbands enlisted in the cause of the union we did not object to them because they came from germany. or ireland. or england. or canada. we accepted their services. and when we enacted a pension law we called it a service pension. we gave a pension in accordance with the service which was rendered by the soldier. and now we are going to say. no matter how distinguished the service. if a person who rendered that service. or if his widow. lives in a foreign land. he or she shall tot receive a penny of this service pension. i am opposed to the amendment. it has been defeated every time it has been offered. it ought to be defeated now.\\n630441165|the question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from missouri..\\n630441166|mr. chairman. i move to strike out the last word. mr. chaifman.. when the distinguished gentleman from georgia closed the general debate upon the bill i was not upon the floor. coming in just as he was uttering perhaps the last sentence. i was told afterwards that he had indulged in some remarks about the childlabor bill which passed this house day before yesterday and about myself. and cast some animadversions upon the great state which i in part represent upon this floor. since then i have examined the reporters notes of the gentlemans speech. and i find that the gentleman took it upon hiniself to defend the constitution against the violent assault which was being made upon it by this childlabor bill and to defend the imperial commonwealth of georgia against the aspersions of a mere pennsylvanian. i have the highest regard and respect for my colleague. the gentleman from georgia. i have always considered him an able lawyer. a wise man. and a sincere man. i can not help but believe that he is too wise a man and has been too keen an observer of current events to hold me in any wise responsible for conditions in pennsylvania. i grant that conditions with respect to labor in pennsylvania are not what they ought to be. especially with respect to the conditions under which women and children are permitted to labor in that great industrial state. these conditions are caused by the fact. admitted now by all men. that that state is controlled in its governmental operations under a partnership agreement which has long been in force between the great protected interests of my state and the republican machine. and i am quite sure that my friend. the gentleman from georgia. will not suspect that i have any sympathy with either end of that partnership.\\n630441167|i do not.\\n630441168|mr. chairman-\\n630441169|mr. chairman. i can not yield.\\n630441170|i did not mean to interrupt the gentleman without his permission. but.i interrupted the gentleman t6 say i did not think he had anything to do with it.\\n630441171|well. the gentlemans declaration was it was my duty to remove the beam in the pennsylvania eye before i undertook to extract the mote in the eye of the state of georgia.\\n630441172|that was a mere figure of speech.\\n630441173|i have made some effort to remove the beam. and the gentleman must know that i have myself expended some effort and energy-\\n630441174|and money.\\n630441175|at the cost of a seat in this house in order to better conditions in that great state. but i am against the exploitation of child labor-\\n630441176|so am i.\\n630441177|i am *against the labor of women and children under improper conditions in my state and in my district just as much as i am against it in the state of georgia. i have fought in pennsylvania ever since i have been in public and political life to better the conditions under which men as well as women and children shall work. and my own district is one of the districts where conditions have not been what i would like to have them. and where i have made some fight to better them. as some of the gentlemen here present know. i regret that better progress is not being made in pennsyliania. i regret that in regard to child labor it is one of the dark spots in the country. just as i regret georgia is a dark spot. and i regret to say that despite the beautiful promises made in our state by the party candidates who were successful in the late campaign. word comes today from harrisburg that the new governor of the commonwealth has issued a declaration stating that though he is just as much for a proper childlabor law now as he was before election. still he thinks that business conditions in the state are such as to make it necessary to postpone consideration of that legislation until the session of the legislature two years hence.\\n630441178|the time of the gentleman has expired.\\n630441179|mr. chairman. may i have five minutes more?\\n630441180|the gentleman from pennsylvania asks unanimous consent that he may proceed for five minutes.- is there objection?\\n630441181|reserving the right to object. since the gentleman is making an attack upon his own state. i desire to respond. i agree to the gentleman continuing as long as he pleases. if we may have an equal amountof time on this side.\\n630441182|is there objection? the chair hears none. the gentleman from pennsylvania will proceed.\\n630441183|mr. chairman. i expect to have some time.\\n630441184|i shall certainly not object. i am making no attack. mr. chairman. upon pennsylvania. i have heard that kind of talk until i am tired of it. i am a pennsylvanian. like my friend. the gentleman who represents a great philadelphia district. i love my state. my people came there when william penn nosed the good ship welcome up the delaware in 1082. and with his quaker colonists founded his great experiment in the woods. and they have lived there ever since. and i hope i shall be buried beneath her beautiful hills. i love my state. but i would not believe that i could love her if i should stand silent when i see her despoiled by the machine that dominates that commonwealth. pennsylvania is one of the states where we have not protected the little children. and. with all due respect to the gentleman from georgia. so is georgia. he says he was the author-\\n630441185|i did not say that i was the author-\\n630441186|well. that he had actively worked. perhaps. for childlabor legislation in georgia. and yet i find that of 40 states in the union which prohibit child labor under 14 years in mills and factories. georgia is not one.\\n630441187|may i say to the gentleman that is not correct? we have an act which prohibits it now. with children under 14 years.\\n630441188|when was it passed?\\n630441189|in 1908.\\n630441190|i will say to the gentleman that what i am. reading from-\\n630441191|i have seen that publication. and i have taken occasion to put in the record on two different times the statute of the state of georgia. which shows what the law is.\\n630441192|will the gentleman yield on that subject?\\n630441193|if the gentleman will look at the debate two years ago on this matter he will find that the statement is correct.\\n630441194|i was about to say that while i have not examined this myself. this compilation was made by the agents of the child labor committee. who have gone over the matter with great care and in whose accuracy i have great confidence. of 16 states which forbid child labor in mines and quarries. georgia is not one. of 16 states which forbid children working more than eight hours a day in mills and factories. georgia is not one. amongst 33 states which forbid any work by children under 16 years of age in mills and factories. georgia is not one. and it does seem to me. therefore. that i was perfectly justified in the statement that the employing interests of georgia are opposed to this bill. just exactly as they are opposed to the bill in pennsylvania. where a strong and bitter fight has been made by the textile mill owners. as has been made by the cotton mills in georgia. against any law which would forbid night work of children under 16 or work for more than 8 hours a day or more than 48 hours in the week. now. the gentleman from georgia went on to impeach my democracy. i assume because.of the position i have taken in support of this bill. which to his mind is violently against the constitution and against every principle of the party to which we both adhere. well. mr. chairman. i do not profess to be a great constitutional lawyer like my friend from georgia. before i came to congress i was engaged for 15 or 16 years in the active practice of the law. being almost constantly busy in the trial of cases. many of them involving constitutional questions. and i have always been too busy trying cases and practicing law to indulge in the practice. which i find to be so common in washington. of publicly expressing my views about the constitution when the constitution is not in issue [applause] and. because i approve of my own remarks. considering myself a great constittitional lawyer. the trouble with thegentleman from georgia is that he comes from a school of lawyers who interpret the constitution according to their own preconceived notion of what the constitution ought to mean instead of according to what the supreme court says it does mean. they find the constitution bounded by four corners which they set up in their own mind. and refuse to allow to the supreme judicial authority in the land the privilege of erecting the corners which shall. mark the boundaries of that instrument.\\n630441195|the time ofthe gentleman has expired.\\n630441196|mr. chairman. i ask unanimous consent for three minutes more.\\n630441197|the gentleman from pennsylvania asks unanimous consent to proceed for three minutes more. is there objection?\\n630441198|i have. no manner of doubt that this proposed federal childlabor bill is entirely constitutional i get it not from. some idea that. i may have of what i think the. con. stitution ought to mean but whatthe supreme court has said. time and again- the constitution does mean. under the power to regulate interstate commerce. i have no doubt. that the supreme court will hold. when this law gets to it. as il will some day. i. presume that the congress has full power to prohibit from interstate! commerceany articles which are produced- under con ditions which inside of a state call for the exercise of the police power of a state. the supreme court held that we may prohibit the transportation of so innocent a thing as a piece of pasteboard representing. a lottery ticket. because the use to which that lottery ticket may be put in the future is against the public morals. it has been held that we may prohibit from interstate commerce articles which endanger the agents and. carriers in tianusportation. such as explosives and loose hay.. my mind is) clear that if we: can enact a law which the supreme court upholds. prohibiting: the transportation in interstate commerce of articles which. though innocent in themselves.. yet. becauseof the use to which they will be. put. may be prohibited as being against the. morals of the nation. so. we may by law prohibit the transportation in interstate commerce of articles which have been produced- in such a way as to operate against the morals of the nation. if we may prohibit the. transmission of articles in interstate commerce because of the final use to which those articles or products are put. we may follow them back to the system under which they were produced. i shall not argue the constitutional question. but i do not believe that real constitutional lawyers who will. discuss. it and argue it in the light of the opinions. of the supreme- court. without being prejudiced by their own individual opinions. upon its political and economic phases. will ever fail to hold that this law is entirely constitutional.-\\n630441199|mr. chairman. i do not propose to undertake at this late hour to say anything much in reply to what the gentleman from pennsylvania has! said.. i want to say. however. that i did not know at the time that the gentleman was not in the house. i was informed that he was. i would have said what i did say had he been present. and he knows that. i am sure. i do not arrogate to myself any great knowledge of constitutional law. mr. chairman. nor believe or consider myself or pretend to be any great constitutional lawyer. but i do believe and. so far as. i can judge from what the supreme court has decided in. other cases. i am confident they will hold the bill he. refers to to be unconstitutional. if it ever becomes a law. and believing that. in construing. the constitution of the united states. it is my duty when i come to vote upon a question that i believe is contrary to that instrument to vote against it. now. the supreme court of the united states in the- lottery case did not decide that congress had the right to prohibit the transmission of any legitimate article of commerce through the channels of interstate. commerce. they distinctly decided in that case that they would not decide that such was the law. great lawyers. among them one who has been attorney general of the united states from the state of pennsylvania. have in another body rendered reports from. the committee on the judiciary in which they have questioned the constitutionality of laws like this. i have no apologies. mr. chairman. to make for the assertion that i believe in the constitution of the united states. i believe we should preserve it. mr. chairman. because only by preserving it can we maintain and perpetuate this government. and i can not. do better than to call attention to what was said by the great orator.. edmund burke. upon an occasion when he was urged to. agree to a certain bill for reform in the british parliament. when. he refused to advocate. certain measures which. in his. opinion. violated the constitution of great britain. though unvritten. ie said. on that occasion.  we should bear- in mind that. we have a government to preserve as well as a government to reform. and i am unwilling to give my adherence to. the.proposition that the congress of the united states can do. what the. gentleman from pennsylvania sa.ys.it can do. namely.- exercise the power given under the commerce. clause. for the purpose. of regulating or executing the police. laws- of the states.\\n630441200|mr. chairman. will the. gentleman yield?\\n630441201|does the gentlemani from. georgia yield. to the gentleman from pennsylvania?\\n630441202|do not. do me the injustice to say that i said anything of that sort.\\n630441203|i so understood you..\\n630441204|no. what i say is that the congress. has the right to prohibit from. interstate commerce any product which was manufactured. and produced under conditions which call for the exercise of the police power in the state where it was produced.\\n630441205|tt:. that. is. virtually the same.\\n630441206|oh. no.-\\n630441207|yes. it is. i beg the gentlemans pardon. that is the samethat if the state. in. the exercise of its police power.. has hposed upon it the duty of correcting certain evils that exist in it and fails to exercise that power. then it becomes the duty of the uhited states congress to. exercise the power of the interstatecommerce clauseof the united. states constitution to regulate those things.. now. i do not profess to be a great lawyer. but i do not suppose that anybody who professes to be a great lawyer or to be a lawyer at all would make any such- claim as that.. mir. chairman. in all seriousness. i did not mean any reflection upon. the gentleman from pennsylvafia.. i do not doubt that he has. used every effort. as he has stated. in his state to correct these evils. i would not have said anything about the: gentleman. or his bill if he had not challenged the votes. of those who had voted against the bill in his speech in reply to my col league .. i would have contented myself with simply voting my conviction. but i repeat. mr. chairman. that i do not believe congress has the right to exercise the. power of the commerce clause of the constitution to prohibit the transmission through the channels of commerce perfectly legitimate. articles of commerce.\\n630441208|the time of. the: gentleman from georgia has expired.\\n630441209|mr chairman. i. want just five- minutes more.\\n630441210|the gentleman from georgia asks- unanimous consent to. proceed for five minutes more. is there objection?\\n630441211|mr. chairman.. i. believe that we should preserve the constitution of. the united states. i believe it is the great charter of our liberties. and. that if we attempt. because the states do not exercise their reserve rights. to assume on the part of the united states congress. the power to pass police laws. then there is nothing left to it. mr. chairman. the english people have a great constitution. which they call the magna charta. the chart of english liberty. i will conclude by quoting stimson. on: the constitution: it is a sad contrast between the way that so many of our people or our newspapers feel today. 120 years after the adoption ofour magna charta. and the way the people flcit in england. exactly the same time. 120 years after the adoption of their own. for in 1253. 138. years after johns charter. in the thirtyseventh year of the reign of henry iii. a popular king. a great jurist. and- a radical maker of new laws: on the 3d day of may [i read. from the statutes of the realm in latin]. in the great hall of the king of westminster. in the presence. of the king and his brother and the marshal of england and the other estates of the realm. we boniface. archbishop of canterbury. and the bishops of london. and ely and rochester. and worcester. and. lin. coin. and. norwich and. carlyle. and st. davids. all. ap areled in. pontificals. with tapers burning. against the breakers of the hbertles or customs of the realm of england. and. namely. those which are contained in the charter of the common liberties. of england. excommunicate. aceurse. and from the benefits of our holy mother the- church sequester all those who by any craft or wiliness do violate. break. diminish. or change the statutes* and free customs of the realm of england. to the perpetual memory of which excommunication we. the afore. said prelates. have put our seals.. so in 1253 they felt in england when. they called attention to: the great charter of english liberties. and so in. 1910. today. when we. love that great charter of english liberties and! swear to observe thegreatel i charter of american liberties. today we feel that the curses of thosq who love liberty should be visited: upon. those who. violate it. mr chairman. these great lovers of english liberty and of. the magna charta. for more than 120 years after it had been adopted. were accustomed to gather for the purpose of perpetuating that great charter and pronouncing condemnations against those who would violate it. now. nearly 130 years after our great instrument was adopted. when we have lived under it and perpetuated our government under it. i have no love for those who would destroy it by the means that the gentleman from pennsylvania undertakes to destroy it. i have no apologies to make .to him or to any one else of these reform.ers who would destroy our government in order to reform it."},{"1":"1914","2":"SMITH","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"may i ask the senator from missouri a question? does he think. under the illustration lie uses. that the courts or the

the volume on wool. 800 printed pages. we had long hearings. and nine volumes were published. and in those hearings we gave pretty full consideration to the wool question. after the people who desired to come before the committee had been heard. i subpoenaed people who did not desire to be heard. i summoned experts in order to get their knowledge on the subject of wool and the wool duty. i spent a great deal of time trying to work out a schedule. i was not like my friend from alabama. i could not do it in two or three weeks. i was not like any member of the democratic caucus. i could not undersfand the whole business in one evening. i am slower of thought than that. i worked it out. my idea was to put the specific duty on the amount of scoured wool in the fleece the same as we put a specific duty on the pounds of lead in ore or the pounds of sugar with the sugar and dirt together that comes with it. that would make a uniform duty on the wool. that would rid it of any inequalities that there were in the schedule. inequalities exist. but not to the extent that the public or some members of congress believe. but there were some inconsistencies. some differences in duties. i could not convince my colleagues that i was right. we had not time to get the evidence on the subject to clearly present it. enough to satisfy me. but not enough to satisfy others. what other reasons there were for voting against the reduction of the duty. god knows. i do not. but i know that they claimed that they had not sufficient evidence of it to reduce this schedule. you know that they were men that wanted light. they were not like you people on that side. who can take up great industries involving $400.000.000 and with a single dash of the pen. without thinking and without knowing. and not requiring evidence of any tariff board or data. dispose of it at once. they were men who wanted to know the facts. we had a gigantic undertaking on our hands. we had the whole tariff business. the

was ever taken before. i challenge any man on that side of the house who is a candid manand i assume that you all are candid mento read carefully through that evidence and say that the chairman of that committee. or the majority members of it. did not try to get at the truth. no matter who appeared before them or what kind of crossexamination it required to worry the truth out of them. still we did not get all of it. i had made up my mind before that that if we could have notice that -a revision of the tariff was coming. that the best way to gather evidence was for the ways and means committee to form a sort of tariff board under their instruction and their guidance and employ experts. have the money to do it with. get the statements from all parts of the earth and tabulate them and find out what the :cost was. but we have heard a great deal of hypocritical -talk about getting at the exact cost. saying that it is all different in different factories. of course it is. it depends :somewhat on the element of chance. just as it does in selling articles. the force of labor may be weak in insisting on its right. and the employer may be strong -and sturdy in his position.

of that term. i sincerely believe that when the courts are directly confronted with this question. as they will be. perhaps. under this bill. that they will hold distinctly when the question is presented that the functions performed by the commission are administrative and not legislative. mr. chairman. i hurry along to another portion of this discussion. suppose it be taken for granted that we have the right to vest in the commission the authority to substitute a reasonable for an unreasonable rate. then is there any necessity for this legislation? that is an important inquiry that ought to be solved by the house. let us go back once more to what is really proposed to be done. it is not to give the commission a general ratefixing power. it is not to engage in political rate fixing. as the gentleman from massachusetts said. but it is. after hearing by the commission. to substitute an unreasonable rate with a reasonable one. is there any necessity for the granting of that power? let us see. upon what theory are our american institutions founded? when our fathers announced the doctrine that man is capable of selfgovernment. they announced a doctrine that fell with startling effect upon the ears of monarchical europe. but i contend. sir. that they never intended in that declaration to announce the doctrine of individualism. they intended to declare that we were capable of proclaiming a system of laws to meet emergencies as they arose. they intended to proclaim the doctrine that we were able to establish a system of government to which every citizen in the land. when aggrieved. could approach with a confiding faith that a remedy. prompt. just. and effective. would be given. that is what we mean by our american system. i assert the proposition. that where a transportation company fixes an unjust charge the shipping public has no remedy except to secure a change in the rate. you tell me you will point the aggrieved shipper to the courts. why. the impracticability of the remedy renders it absolutely ineffective. in thousands of the cases the amount of the overcharge would not justify the expense of the litigation. but the sum total of them all will swell into an enormous amount. therefore there is no remedy except a change of rate. why. my friend from massachusetts this afternoon discussed the question of rebates and discriminations. that question has practically been provided for. the shipper and the middleman are interested in the law against rebates and discriminations. but the producer and the consumer are the people who are interested in the question whether a rate is extortionate or reasonable. they are the people who are interested. it is no answer to me to say that the rates in this country are now reasonable. i believe the great body of them are reasonable. but that there are many. many specific instances where they are unreasonable. the time was when a great many of them were unreasonable. and the railroad companies have more power now than they had then. my friend from massachusetts compared the american rates with european rates. well. the rates in europe are higher. but he failed to tell the house the reason why they are higher. as i understand it. they have no such system of express charges in european countries. it is all freight. freight that goes by express at high rates here goes by freight there. in the second place. all the lowgrade tonnage is transported by rivers and canals in europe. while with us it goes over the railroads. in the third place. their system provides for delivery at both ends of the line. both from the consignor to the railroad company and from the railroad company to the consignee. and this delivery charge is reckoned is part of the freight charge. this is according to the testimony before the senate committee by men who profess to know. in the fourth place. the capitalization of their roads is over $200.000 a mile. while of ours the highest amount stated is $65.000 a mile. these things render rates higher there than they are here. then the gentleman stated that the wages of labor are better here than they are there. that is true. but there is an average of about five men on an american railway to the mile of road. whereas in europe there are twenty men to the mile of road. in other words. for this excess of price which the american laborer gets the american laborer performs the work of four or five european laborers. these facts explain why freight rates in europe are higher than they are in america and why the wages of railway employees are lower there than they are here. but. mr. chairman. these american railway rates have not always been as low as they are now. formerly they were much higher. and. as i said a moment ago. the railways are possessed of much more power now than they had then. now their capitalization runs over thirteen thousand million dollars and they employ nearly 2.000.000 persons. during the lastfew years this enormous wealth and power has been combined in the hands of a few men. both of these gentlemen who addressed the house against this bill contended that the law of competition ought to -regulate these railways. why. sir. we have no law of competition now. it is a maxim of railway economics that wherever combination is possible competition is impossible [applause].and through the consolidation of these railways in the hands of a few men. as philip said about the great napoleon. competition has fled from themas from the glance of destiny. - now. i will not rest by simply making the assertioni will submit the proof. in the hearing before the senate committee. early in that hearing. mr. sam cowan. of fort worth. tex.. a lawyer of ability and a man of high character. makes the statement that there are sixty. railroads running into the city of st. louis. that they had a general. office. with a secretary and a rate clerk. but that they kept no minutes. that they denied that there was any combination between them. but the fact existed that when one of these sixty roads published a rate on one day that identical day. the other fiftynine published the same rate. this statement went into the printed record before the senate committee. \" shortly after that mr. hooker made a statement that there were four men that fixed all the rates west of the missouri river. that four other men fixed all of them north of the ohio and the potomac. and that four others fixed the rates south of those rivers. in other words. twelve men in the united states fixed the rates of the railways of the united states. judge clements. a distinguished member of the interstate commerce commission. placed before the senate interstate commerce committee this statement. to which i now invite the careful attention of the house. it is a report of conditions prevailing in the pennsylvania railway system. it shows how the power of directorship has been combined in the hands of a few men in that system. for example. he shows that 157 directorships were held by 157 persons on one board only. 63 directorships were held by 26 persons on from two to five boards. 175 directorships were held by 13 persons on more than five boards. and then he proceeds to show how the capital stock is distributed in these railway companies--the pennsylvania railroad company. the pennsylvania company. the baltimore and ohio railroad company. the chesapeake and ohio railway company. the norfolk and western railway company. the philadelphia. baltimore and washington railroad company. and the northern central railway company. it is a statement so instructive and suggestive that i shall read it to the house: report for the vear ending june 80. 1904. cipital stock

mostly in the pennsylvania railroad system. as given in their reports for the year ending june 30. 1904. aggregated 395. an analysis of this number shows that 157 directorships were held by 157 persons on one board only. 63 directorships were held by 26 persons on from two to five boards. 175 directorships were held by 13 persons on more than five boards. distributed as follows : 1 person 1

pennsylvania railroad system has absorbed the capital stock and power of these other roads. and as a consequence has broken down and destroyed whatever competition prevailed among them. that the public has been the sufferer. who can doubt? but let us go further. my distinguished friend from massachusetts quoted from hadleys railway transportation. i take it. therefore. that he. can not impeach his own witness. if he does. i shall object. well. now. here is what president hadley. of ydle. says about this question of consolidation: and the present age is one of industrial monopoly. however we may shut our eyes to the fact. we have.not free competition. nor can we expect to have it in the future. instead of moving toward it. we are moving away from it. this is a fact to which people are just beginning to open their eyes. they begin to see in a great many cases prices are determined not by competition but by combination. * * * on either side of the atlantic most persons who have really looked into the subject have come to regard railroads as.a sort of natural monopoly. not regulated by the ordinary laws of trade. and needing to he closely watched by public authority. now. against mr. mccalls witness. hadley. i quote hadley on the subject to show that the law of competition has now been eliminated from the railroad problem. if that be so. what other law shall control them except some such law as we provide for in this case? why. senator newlands made the statement. and printed it in the senate hearings. that over 200.000 miles of railways in the united states were combined in six groups. and that a few men. and sometimes one man. dominated those groups. this testimony of these gentlemen who testified before the senate committee is not only not denied. but corroborated by the railway companies. mr. bond. of the baltimore and ohio. and mr. harris and mr. lincoln. of the missouri pacific. all three say that great consolidation of railways has taken place. that competition was practically eliminated. mr. bond saying it was the result of the sherman antitrust act. and the other gentlemen saying that it had taken place. but that the public had been the gainer by it. this testimony of these railway witnesses is corroborated by mr. walker d. hinds. of the nashville and chattanooga. by mr. morawetz. of the santa fe. by mr. ramsay. of the wabash. and by mr. tuttle. of the boston and maine. all corroborating these gentlemen when they say that this railroad -combination has taken place by which competition has been eliminated. therefore we have now no law of trade. no law of economics. by which these matters of railway rates can be controlled. and we are compelled to resort to legislation of this character in the interests of the consumers and the producers of this country. well. what has been the effect of this combination? let us see. in 1899 the tendency of railway rates to be reduced was arrested by the elimination of the law of competition. and since then railway rates have been on a steady advance. just in this connection i call the attention of the house to a table contained in a communication from the interstate commerce commission to the united states senate bearing on this question of the advance in freight rates. ntumber of tons of freight carried. freight revenue. and average rate per ton for years ending june 30. 1899-.1903. tons of total freight average year ending june 30- freight ear- rvenue. rate per ried. re ton. 1899 -------_------ -_------------------ 959.763.583 $913.737.155 $0. 9520 1900

95.24 cents. in 1891 it was $10269. in 1.902 it was $1.0258. a slight reduction in the average rate per ton. which is accounted for by the fact of the enormous increase in the lowgrade tonnage of that year. in 1903 it was $1.0793 per ton. now. further along in this same communication from the commission is another table. showing how the earnings .of the roads have been increased by this advance in

contained in this bill upon another proposition that i do not believe -can be assailed. whatever gentlemen may think about this question. there is a large element in this .country that :believes these rates are unfair. the memorials which this body and -its individuail members have received from !state legislatures. from municipal corporations. from individual shippers. convince -us that a large number of people in the united states believe these rates are unfair. mr. chairman. these -people are not anarchists who believe this. they are not communists. they -are not enemies of wealth. or of the railroad -companies. but they are patriotic citizens of the united states. now. independent of the proposition as to whether they are right or wrong. they think they are right. what shall wedo? shall we organize a sworn tribunal without interest in the ubjeetnmatter of the -controversy to decide whether -they are -right or wrong or shall we force them to leave the decision of that question to the people who exact the charge and who are the beneficiaries of the situation2 i say that the latter proposition shocks the moral sense and is contrary to every doctrine of americanism. we americans force no man to submit his grievance. either real or fancied. to his adversary. why. mr. chairman. no one here wants to harm the railroads. i recognize what splendid properties they are and how much they have had to do with the development of the country. they have touched with their iron fingers the deserts in the .west and made them to blossom as the rose. the gleaming eyes of their locomotives have gazed into the face of savagery. and churches and schools and contented people now inhabit the -places where the red man hunted the buffalo. but. sir. while the railroads have benefited the people. the people have benefited the railroads. to tell me to the contrary would remind me of an anecdote related of old ethan allen after the battle of ticonderoga. when he attended church and heard the parson pray very unctuously. thanking the lord for the great victory of the american forces. then ethan got up and said: parson. it is all right to give the lord praise for this victory. but the next time you pray along this line i just want you to mention that ethan allen was there also. so while the railroads have benefited the people the -people have benefited the railroads. why. look at the magnificent land bonuses which they have received. exgovernor larabee makes the statement thatthe various grants made to :the railroads comprise no less than 300.000 square miles of land. equal to four and a half times the area of new england. or six times that of the state of new york. or equal to the total area of iowa. wisconsin. illinois. indiana. michigan. and ohio. that is the amount of land grants they have received. why. in texas we gave them 16 sections to the mile. with .640 acres to the section. and in their greed they actually took it for switches and sidings. not content with -taking it for the main line. until we threw them down and took it away from them when james s. hogg was governor."},{"1":"1905","2":"SPOONER","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"does the senator intend to indulge in an elaborate discussion of this matter?"},{"1":"1904","2":"OCREARY","3":"S","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. the senior senator from pennsylvania . chairman of the committee on postoffices and postroads. in his speech yesterday said: the resolution offered by myself. was offered after deliberation and in good faith. i had reached the conclusion that it would not be amiss for the senate of the united states to order an investigation of the abuses alleged to have existed in the postoffice department. he also said in his speech yesterday: i have reached the conclusion that it is not of very great importance whether the committee on postoffices and postroads act on any resolution or not. the reselution referred to by the senator is as follows: resolved. that the committee on postoffices and postroads. in view of the charges of corruption. extravagance. and violations of law in the administration of the affairs of the postoffice department. is hereby instructed to direct the postmastergeneral tosend to the committee all papers connected with the recent investigation of his department. and said committee shall make further inquiry into the administration and expenditures of the said department. and make report thereon to the senate upon completion of mid investigation on or before the 1st day of may. 1904. that resolution. which attracted considerable attention when it was offered. seems to have slept the sleep that knows no awakening in the committee on postoffices and postroads. although the democrats of that committee have done all in their power many times to have the resolution favorably reported to the senate. i desire to ask why have the chairman of the committee on postoffices and postroads and his associates changed their minds? it seems that last december. when the distinguished senior senator from pennsylvania offered the resolution. he was in favor of an investigation. indeed. he said at the time that according to his reasoning an investigation by the committee wuld do no harm. and if nothing wrong was found would probably strengthen the investigation that had already been made by bristow. the fourth assistant.postmastergeneral. mr. president. what has caused this change to come over the chairman of the committee and his associates? it will not do to say that they have changed their minds because of the bristow report. because mr. bristow. the fourth assistant postmastergeneral. made his report last october. it will not do to say that information sufficient to change his mind has been received from the president. because the written statement of the president was furnished before december last. therefore the country will assume that there is some other great reason why the chairman of the committee on postoffices and postroads and his associates are unwilling that the investigation shall be made. among the great powers which the constitution of the united states granted to congress was the power to establish postoffices and postroads. this power is explicitly stated. and it may be said that in the last hundred years congress has perhaps given more time and enacted more legislation for the postoffice department than any other of the executive departments. we have a number of executive departments charged by law with the management of finances. foreign affairs. the army. the navy. agriculture. commerce and labor. etc. none of these great departments are as much in touch with the people as the postoffice department. ninetenths of the people of the united states rarely. if ever. come in contact with the other departments. but through the postoffices and through rural free delivery they are continually brought in contact with the postoffice department. the appropriation bill now under consideration appropriates $170.000.000. this is the greatest amount appropriated in any of the thirteen appropriation bills. yea. sir. the appropriation contained in this bill of $170.000.000 is equal to the appropriations provided for in eight of the great appropriation bills out of thirteento wit. the army. agricultural. diplomatic and consular. district of columbia. fortifications. indian. legislative. and military academy bills. but this is not all. education is fostered and encouraged by this service. the people are instructed and pleased by the dissemination of millions of tons of mail matter. the farmer is brought into daily communication with the prices of stock and farm products and the current events of the world. business is conducted and promoted in cities. counties. and states by this wdnderful system. which serves equally the potentate in hispalace. the loggerin his cabin. the miner in his mine. the farmer on the prairie or in the blue grass. and the preciousmetal seeker in california or colorado. indeed. the postal service properly administered helps. through the diffusion of information and the cultivation of closer ties among the people. to link together the states of our republic and increase the blessings of free government. therefore. the people have a right to demand that the great postoffice department. costing more per annum than any other department. and ministering to the instruction. wants. and pleasures of millions of people. should be conducted on business plans. maintained in a business way. and operated fairly. justly. honestly. and legally. i can not present the existing situation more clearly than to i read what the president of the united states said about the postoffice department in his rcigular message communicated to the two houses of congress at the beginning of the regular session of congress last december. he said: through frauds. forgeries. and perjuries. and by shameless briberies the laws relating to the proper conduct of the public service in general. and to the due administration of the postoffice department. have been notoriously violated. and many indictments have been found. and the consequent prosecutions are in course of hearing or on the eve thereof. again. on the 24th of november. 1903. the president of the united states in a communication. which was then submitted to congress. says: the investigation made by mr. bristow discloses a condition of gross corruption in the office of the first assistant postmastergeneral and in that of the assistant attorneygeneral for the postoffice department. he then gives a list of names and refers to james n. tyner. sasistant attorneygeneral for the postoffice department. who has been indicted three times. a. w. machen. general superintendent freedelivery system. who has been indicted fourteen times (and since convicted). george w. beavers. general superintendent of salaries and allowances. indicted eight times (and since convicted): james t. metcalf. superintendent moneyorder system. indicted once. james w. erwin. assistant superintendent freedelivery service. indicted once. and w. scott towers. indicted three times. t. w. mcgregor. clerk. freedelivery division. in charge of supplies. indicted twice. all these men occupied positions in the postoffice department. i now read from the conclusions of the fourth assistant postmastergeneral. mr. bristow. who submitted a report. he says: the amount of money secured by the corrupt officials and their confederates is small as compared with the total loss to the government. to illustrate: there is no evidence that louis received any compensation from ault & wiborg. yet during the first year of his administration the expenditures for canceling ink increased over $10.000. it does not appear that kempner received money from the manifold company. yet the cost of manifold supplies increased more than $40sj00 a year. barrett received but $6.000 from arnold. yet that company defrauded the people out of over $3.000.000. machen probably did not receive more than $26000 from the groff fastener. yet the government has paid approximately $130.000 for that device. which represents a net loss. since the department continued. by the terms of the contract for letter boxes. to pay for the original fasteners. beavers and his associates received less than $20.000 from the automatic cashier. yet the department expended $74.275 for this wholly unnecessary machine. the total amount that the perpetrators of these frauds themselves received can not b definitely learned. but it will aggregate between $300.00 and $400.000. while the loss to the government. considering the unnecessary supplies that have been purchased and the inferior quality of those furnished by fraudulent contractors. can not be estimated with any degree of accuracy. as a result of the investigation. four officers and employees of the department have resigned and thirteen have been removed. fortyfour indictments have been found. involving thirtyone persons. ten of whom have been connected with the postal service. the fourth assistant postmastergeneral himself declared in his report that \"the corruption disclosed is not due to lax laws. but to the dishonesty of those who have been charged with the responsibility of administering them.\" this statement in the conclusion of his report shows that an investigation is demanded. mr. president. i have read these statements made by the president of the united states and the fourth assistant postmastergeneral in order to show that an investigation is absolutely necessarya complete. full. and just investigationand i have read them to show that i disagree with the statement made yes-. terday by the distinguished chairman of the committee on postoffices and postroads . who said that he had \"come to the conclusion that it is not of very great importance whether the committee on postoffices and postroads act on any resolution or not.\" investigation is demanded by the people of this countrya full. fair. and complete investigationnot an investigation by men who are in the postoffice department. who are identified with that department. but an investigation by men who on accountof their ability. their environments. and their obligations. will satisfy the country. when they bring in a report. that the report is fair. just. and complete. i am in favor of turning on the searchlight. so that the innocent menand i know the postoffice department is crowded with themwill be vindicated and the guilty men will be punished. it is not enough to say that there has been an investigation by an officer of the postoffice department. there should be an investigation by a senate committee. if everything is all right in that department. why is it that the majority in this senate oppose so earnestly an investigation? there should be investigations of all the departments occasionally. no matter what party is in power. then those who are in the departments will be vindicated before the country. and the people will say \"we know that the executive departments at washington are being properly conducted. because an investigation has been made and the report is good.\" this country will be in a bad condition when the time arrives that the senate or the house of representatives will refuse to investigate a department. let it go out to the country that there shall never be an investigation of the executive departments. let it go to the executive departments that there shall never be an investigation of those departments. and what will be the condition in the departments and what will the people of our country think of the departments? what will they think of senators and representatives if it is determined that there shall be no investigation? and yet that is exactly the condition today. we have been urging an investigation in the senate. we have been doing all we could to get that investigation. and yet up to this time we have failed. and the chairman of the committee on postoffices and postroads has come to the conclusion that no investigation is necessary. there was a strange and unprecedented spectacle in congress recently. the friends of reform. the advocates of economy and honesty. the opponents of fraud and corruption. were asking for and urging an investigation of the postoffice department by a committee of congressmen. and when they had reached a climax where the demand for investigation was irresistible. by parliamentary strategy or political legerdemain. attention was diverted from the postoffice department to about one hundred congressmen. who. as far as the investigation has been made public. seemed to have been faithfully and industriously trying to comply with the wishes of their constituents by asking for an increase of the salaries of postmasters or their clerks. or by asking for increase of rent for buildings occupied by postmasters. this was clearly a diversion and called public attention from the wrongs. delinquencies. and crimes of the postoffice department to a report sent in from the postoffice department referring to members of congress. it was one of the finest strategic movements i have ever known in peace or in war. and it would have been creditable to napoleon or machiavelli. it is a remarkable fact that while the postoffice department was asking congress to appropriate about $170.000.000 for salaries of its officers and for the conduct of its business and occupied the position of a petitioner and beneficiary. it suddenly turned on the. congressmen whom it was petitioning and from whom it was asking favors and sought. by the publication of their letters and by placing their names in the same report with postoffice officials who had been indicted. to divert the attention of the public from the proposed investigation and to compel congressmen who were innocent and who had committed no wrong to turn their attention to an explanation of their own conduct. this is not a question of party. it is a question of honesty: no man has a right to put party above honest administration of the government and faithful discharge of public duties. we owe it. in my opinion. to ourselves. we owe it to the people. we owe it to good government to have an investigation and to vindicate the innocent and to let no guilty man escape. intelligence. integrity. and patriotism are three of the great pillars upon which our republic rests. we must maintain them and strike down any opponent of these foundations of popular government. mr. president. we have already heard mutterings with regard to other departments. i do not charge that there is dishonesty in any other department. but i do say that a full and complete investigation of the postoffice department would redound to the good of the other departments. whenever you say that the postoffice department shall not be investigated. you say also that the other departments shall not be investigated. therefore you place us in a situation not only injurious to the departments themselves. but in opposition to the wishes of the people. i have been surprised at the action of the majority. i have been surprised that there has been such undue haste in reporting this bill. i have been surprised that senators have refused to put through resolutions of investigation. whenever there is a suspicion of taint. there should be an investigation. i want to ask the majority. are you dodging important legislation that you wish to adjourn so soon? is there any reason why this congress should adjourn earlier than any other congress in previous years? we have now reached the last day of march. and yet we have heard on all sides that this congress must adjourn between the 15th of april and the 1st of may. why this great necessity for early adjournment? are you afraid of labor troubles? do you fear the record of the administration. the menace to business. or the dangerous tendencies of the party now in power? there must be some great reason for this unusual. this earnest. this determined effort to secure an early adjournment. the fact is that the action of the majority on the proposed investigation of the postoffice department is in accordance with the record made on other important subjects. advocating honesty in the public service. the majority is not only dumb to the demands for an investigation of the corruption and fraud in the postoffice department. but the majority is active in efforts to prevent an investigation. declaring in favor of suppressing trusts. the president and the attorneygeneral congratulate each other upon the decision of the supreme court in the recent merger or northern securitios 19o4.1 .4035 case. but the decision was hardly published before the attorneygeneral seemed to rush into the newspapers to assure all other trusts not to be alarmed. for there was no serious danger so long as they \".stand pat\" for the republican party. aving friendship for the laboring man. you permitted to come into this country last year. to compete with our own laboring men and contest with them for bread. 572.000 hungarians. austrians. italians. and russians. represented to be the most degraded and pauperized people of europe. and also nearly 400.000 more immigrants from other parts of the world. declaring in 1.892 in your national platformwe favor the admission of the remaining territories at the earliest practicable day. having due regard to the interestb of the people of the territories and of the united states. and again declaring in 1900we favor home rile for and the early admission to statehood of the territories of new mexico. arizona. and oklahomathe republican majority has failed to pass any bill to give statehood to the territories of new mexico. arizona. and oklahoma. or either of them. and it appears that. notwithstanding these repeated promises made by republicans in their platforms since 1892. this session of congress will close without giving statehood to any of the territories that i have named. why is that? there is a suspicion that perhaps the good people of those territories love democratic doctrine more than they do republican doctrine. and if those territories were admitted as states they would send here democratic senators and democratic representatives. or at least a majority of them. and that democratic electors would be chosen at the next presidential election. again. in 1896 the republican partydeclared in its national platform: we favor the extension of ourforeign commerce. etc. although it is well known that if our ships engage in foreign commerce they must be permitted to bring a return cargo. and the republicans have built a tariff wall around the country so high as to almost entirely exclude foreign manufactured goods. the high tariff wall has forced the commercial nations of europe to retaliate by enacting retaliatory tariff laws. germany. france. and russia have passed retaliatory tariff laws. and the question is being agitated with great earnestness in great britain. it was said when the dingley tariff bill was passed and the extra 20 per cent was put on that \"the extra per cent should be traded off in consideration of concessions to be obtained from foreign countries in the way of reducing duties upon farm products and manufactured articles exported from this country.\" but this was never done. under the dingley bill a number of reciprocity treaties were negotiated by mr. kasson. and yet not one of those treaties negotiated by him has ever been ratified. mr. president. these are some of the inconsistencies of the republican party."},{"1":"1903","2":"ADAMSON","3":"H","4":"NA","5":"Yes","6":"i

have. both in speech and vote. to defeat this unholy measure. * if this bill is enacted into law and the executive branch to which it relates does not ignore such law. as is frequently done by other executive branches with acts relating to them. another long stride will have been taken toward the final subversion of the peoples liberties. and i confess that it is an unsolved question with me whether a people are more to be be pitied when in the hands of a lawmaking body that will enact laws to deprive the people of their rights than when in the hands of an executive who will disobey a law enacted by the people. but when they are at the mercy of both such authorities. they not only need the pity of the human family. but the active interference of a higher power. this bill. mr. speaker. is a long step backward. and one upon reading it can find food for reflection and signs which foretell serious destination unless the fork in the road is soon reached. the people had the right to assume. when electing the members of this body. that the administration. having started upon a.policy of spreading civilization. education. and christianity. beginning with the tagals and sulus. and evidently intending to wind up with the mohammedans and buddhiststhat such administration would surely not attempt to prevent the dissemination of knowledge. religion. and civil government in our own land. it may be well to remark here. mr. speaker. that no corrupt. unjust. or tyrannical power was ever able to dominate a people unless it kept them physically weak or mentally ignorant. we were taught from our infancy to despisethe power of might over right. and our children are yet taught in a halfhearted way that physical strength. as such. has no just claim to dictatorship. if the doctrine taught by the lowly nazarene is to prevail in the end. as i firmly believe it will. the children of future generations will be taught to despise the cunning. brainy men of this age who despoil a people by enacting law. i know. sirs. it is claimed this bill is necessary to prevent a deficiency in the postoffice department. and while there is such a deficiency the average citizen can not understand why reading matter shoud be cut off from the peop!e. the public schools. and colleges when such deficiency could be wiped out by refusing to pay railroads prices for carrying the mails enabling them to pocket a large profit on legitimate investment and.then some on watered stock. government ownership of all the public highways. including railroads. would soon solve the question of deficiencies in the postal service. right here is one of the points where the shoe pinches. the people under the present facilities for the circulation of information are rapidly becoming acquainted with the great questions of public highways. finance. education. and liberty in their application to governments. and those who desire the government to aid them in living off the sweat of other peoples brows have scented danger to their tyrannical power. and now seek to prevent the light from shining upon their dark intentions. if i understand this bill correctly. it seeks to deprivethe great masses of the people from the privilege of pound rates upon a large class of reading matter which. under the law. now is within their reach. it will exempt reprints of the works of great authors in subdivisions and cheap form from the secondclass rates. and thus deprive the poor of access to such information. i have upon my desk no. 3. riverside art series. \"michelangelo.\" by estelle m. hurll. a collection of pictures with introduction and interpretation. also no. 1. riverside literature. \"evangeline.\" by h. w. longfellow. with notes and biographical sketches. also no. 6. riverside literature series. \" grandmothers stories \"and other poems. by oliver wendell holmes. also no. 32. riverside literature series. \"the gettysburg speech and other apers. by abraham lincoln. and an essay on abraham lincoln. y james russell lowell. these papers are prepared in form to make them accessible to the poor. and this bill seeks to put them beyond the reach of that class. while it is no doubt true that the department is imposed upon and the poundrate privilege abused. yet the same can be said of every liberty enjoyed in common by the american people. the masses will not complain of an honest attempt to correct the abuse by properly dealing with the offenders. if the proper methods are adopted. yellowbacked literature and disreputable periodicals and papers and all matter carried in violation of law can be excluded not only from the privilege of pound rates..but. if proper. from the mails altogether. without affecting the right of the citizen to that which he is entitled. mr. speaker. this bill not only discriminates against such publications as i have mentioned and all others of like character intended for school and family use. but it would require all publishers \" of newspapers and periodicals to put a postage stamp upon all exchanges. copies to advertisers. extra copies for campaign committees and candidates. always necessary for election purposes. sample copies to influence subscribers. return copies from agencies and news stands. and special and extra editions for any purpose whatdver. besides it would put a new. vicious club in the hands of unscrupulous partisan postmasters to use in the coming and near future elections. this is not all. mr. speaker. by reference to section 5 of this bill it will be seen that under subdivision 1 of said section a publication must be issued as frequently as four times a year to entitle it to the privilege of secondclass matter. i very much fear it would be difficult to convince a postmastergeneral under the present administration that this qualification was complied with until the fact was demonstrated by a years publication. if so. it would shut out from the privilege all new enterprises. by reference to the first paragraph of subdivision 4 of section 5 of the bill. which reads as follows: it must be originated and published for the dissemination and information of a public character. or devoted to literature. the sciences. arts. or some special industry. and must have a legitimate list of subscribers who voluntarily order and pay or agree to pay for the sameit will be seen that to start arural newspaper the projector would be compelled to secure his subscribers without being able first to dsplay the merits of his publication. mr. speaker. this bill would materially injure if notwhollydrive the country newspapers out of business. and the city dailies would monopolize the field. such dailies use carriers and express companies almost exclusively. and would be able to pay increased postage on country delivery if the rural weeklies could be exterminated. when i turn my memory back to the campaign of 1896 and recall the words of a prominent bishop lamenting the fact that the farmers children were receiving too much education. because it disinclined them for the drudgery of the farm and complicated domestic and political conditions. i am not at a loss to understand why such a measure as this bill should be urged. by an examination of the report of the committee it can be readily seen that the table of figures on pages 3 and 4 and committee comments thereon. which i ask to have inserted here in my remarks. and do not read. because the report is before the members. are based upon a false presumption of what will occur if this bill becomes a law: as strikingly illustrating the extent and effect of the abuses to which reference is made. attention is particularly invited to the appended statements aid exhibits. calculating upon the basis of the count of pieces and the weighing of volume made in 1890. and adhering to the rule of estimating which h-.s been observed in the department from that time. the weight in pounds and the receipts for postage on the several classes of matter -mailed during the year ending june 30. 1899. are as follows: class. weight. postage paid. pounds. first class .......................................... 128.517.992 $65.987.732.98 second class: paid at pound rate ............................ 352.703.226 3.527.032.26 free ----------------- -----------------------6 2.241.700 ............ transient

through experienced postmasters and by an examination of the records of the department. and it is believed that fully onehalf of all the matter mailed as second class and paid for at the pound rate is not properly second class within the intent of the law and ought justly to be paid for at the third class rate. this gives the enormous quantity of 176.351.613 pounds from which the department derives only a fraction of the revenue to which it is fairly entitled. the thirdclass rate of postage is 1 cent for each 2 ounces or fraction thereof. nominally 8 cents a pound. but in reality. through the operation of the fractional urovision. the rate is higher. a division of thd amount of postage received for thirdclass matter by the number of pounds of such matter mailed shows that the department actually derives a revenue of 14.75 cents a pound from this class. if. therefore. there had been paid. as there should have been paid. the average thirdclass rate on the 176.351.613 pounds which was wrongfully transmitted at the pound rate. the dclartment would have received m20.011.862.92. instead of $1.763.516.13. which it actually received. and the postal revenues would have been increased by the handsome sum of $24.248.346.79. . the actual financial exhibit of the department for the last fiscal year is as follows: total expenditures ............................................... $101.632.160.92 total receipts from all sources .................................. 95.021.384.17 deficit ....................................................... 6.610.776.75 had this 176.351.613 pounds of mail matter. really of the thirdclass but transmitted at the pound rate. paid as it should have paid. the average thirdclass rate. the financial exhibit would have been this: receipts. as above given --------------------------------------------- $95. 021.384.17 additional revenue from 176.351.613 pounds thirdclass matter. at 14.75 ........................................................... 24.248.346.79 total receipts ---------------------------------------------- 119.269.730.96 total expenditures ................................................ 101.632.160.92 surplus ...................................................... 17.637.570.04 or if it be assumed that the matter would pay only the nominal rate of 6 cents a pound. this would be the showing: receipts. as given above ......................................... $95.021.384.17 additional revenue from 176.351.613 pounds thirdclass matter. at scents ......................................................... 12.344.612.91 total receipts ................................................ 107.365.997.08 total expenditures ................................................ 101. 3. 160.92 surplus ------------------------------------------------------ 5.733.836.16 this is what the financial exhibit of the postal service for the year would be if the matter carried through the mails were classified and rated as the law intended it should be. it would show a large surplus instead of a large deficit. nor do even these figures present the full case. the first table of this statement shows that the amount of postage per pound actually received on the several classes was as follows: cents. firstclass matter. not free ................................................. 85.6 second.class matter ............................................------------- 8 thirdclass matter ------------------------------------- -------------- 14.7 fourth class (seeds. etc.) .........................------------------------ 9. fourth class (ordinary) --------------------------------------------------- 17 foreign ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 46 postal cards ................................................................ 188.2 from these statements it appears: first. that more than onefourth of the entire volume and weight of matter carried through the mails is rated and pays as secondclass matter. when. under the spirit and iitent of the law. it ought to be rated and to pay as thirdclass matter. second. that while this wrongly classed matter amounts to more than onequarter of the whole volume of mail transmitted. it furnishes only one fiftyfifth part of the postal revenue. third. that the expense of transportation being reckoned at 8 cents a pound. the mere carrying of this matter cost $14.108.129.04. while the revenue from it was only $1.763.516.13.involving a loss to the government of $12.344.612.91. it must be plain. mr. speaker. to every man that the 352.703.226 pounds of secondclass matter would not all. nor even any great portion of it. have been mailed if thirdclass rates had been charged. and therefore the deductions of the committee as to the transformation of a small deficit to a large surplus are without merit. again. it would seem to one not well versed in the intricacies of starroute fortunes that a general average by class of 52.6 cents per pound. or the rate in cents for either class for delivering mail matter considering the distributive distances. ought. in a wellregulated service. to prevent a deficit. the facts are that this bill is another long stride toward the centralization of power. even now. sirs. there is a bill pending in this congress to put parcel delivery on a cheaper rate in the postal service than the present rate for secondclass matter 3vhich will burden the postal department with freight instead of mail. sacrifice intelligence as well as just government to the greed of commerce. and drive out of business the crossroad and small city merchants in the interest of large city department stores. thirtyodd years of centralization policy under the domination of a party controlled by corporations. syndicates. and trusts has driven from our villages. towns. and small cities the tailor. the shoemaker. the wheelwright. the blacksmith. the carder. the weaver. the foundryman. the cabinetmaker. the locksmith. the tinner. the tanner. the pottery maker. the plow maker. and in fact almost all classes of mechanics. artisans. and manufacturers. and now the contemplated changes in the postal service will compel the printer and possibly the merchant to follow them. . the argument is advanced by the supporters of this bill that no one class of business should be specially taxed or burdened to benefit another. that no one person should be heavier burdened that another might enjoy greater privileges. it is the same old. old story. cain is on earth again and wholly indifferent to his brother. turning my memory back to the days of subscription schools. when the teacher boarded around. and coming down through the great conflict which was waged to prevent the publicschool system from being enacted into law. i note the similarity of argument. the great subsidized constitutional lawyers of that day pawed the air and burdened the courts and people with ceaseless oratory charging the publicschool system to be highway robbery. unjust. and unconstitutional discrimination between citizens. that it deprived the citizen of his property without adequate compensation or due process of law. that it was confiscation of property in times of peace. that it compelled one man against his will to labor for the support of another. that it subverted the doctrine of the survival of the fittest and encouraged the laggard in his idleness. it is a disgrace to our civilization that greed. avarice. and selfishness should be permitted to dominate the people in their interest. but it is the tendency of the times. the next step will be for the same reason and by- the same argument to abolish the publicschool system. and the next an educational qualification to vote. later on the same argument will be used to urge that an indigent person should not have the right to say when. for what. and how much the property holder should be taxed. and then a property qualification to vote will follow. and thus. one by one. the boasted american liberties will fade from the grasp of the citizen. it is not difficult to define the menial stages through which a people must pass before becoming slaves. now. mr. speaker. in conclusion. permit me to say that the secondclass rate on mail matter is in the interest of the farmer. the wage earner. and the poor people. and i can not consent to cut off from them the bulk of the benefit it gives because a small deficit. probably caused by unnecessary salaries. exorbitant freight charges. and official mismanagement. exists."}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}

president. i rise today to discuss several provisions in an amendment to the faa reauthorization bill that is currently before the senate and that specifically benefits my home state of louisiana. there are more than 253 air traffic control towers throughout the country operating through a successful publicprivate partnership called the federal contract tower program. this program is especially critical to rural areasas i have in louisiana and as does the presiding officerto ensure that americas airspace and the traveling public are safe. however. there are currently 30 towers awaiting the faa to finalize an internal agency formula called the benefitcost analysis. referred to as the bca. which will allow eligible towers to enter the federal contract tower program. one of these airports is the hammond northshore regional airport in hammond. la. the federal contract tower program has been in place for more than 30 years and is a prime example of an effective publicprivate partnership between government and the private sector. contract towers handle approximately 28 percent of the nations air traffic control tower operations but account for only 14 percent of the faas total tower operations budget. repeated studies by the u.s. department of transportation inspector general have shown that the contract tower program increases aviation safety while reducing costs to taxpayers and the federal government. it is also important to note that approximately 80 percent of the contract controller workforce are veterans. congress has demonstrated numerous times in bipartisan fashion the merit and need for the federal contract tower program. given the success of the program and the increasing likelihood of further faa delays. i am pleased the commerce committee included language in the faa reauthorization bill to strengthen and improve the federal contract tower program. senators cornyn. vitter. portman. and wicker have been leaders on this issue. and their work is greatly appreciated. currently. americas trade and economy are being hampered because many cargo planes from other countries are prohibited from flying into u.s. airports because they have not been upgraded to newer types of technology. some aircraft are what is called \"stage 2 aircraft.\" these aircraft were phased out following the passage of the airport noise and capacity act of 1990. which mandated the phaseout for stage 2 aircraft over 75.000 pounds. i have introduced an amendment that would permit flights to a small number of airports under limited circumstances for revenue and nonrevenue flights of stage 2 aircraft over 75.000 pounds. one of the airports that meets the criteria is the acadiana regional airport in new iberia. la. this airport is located in a heavy industrial complex and surrounded by agricultural land. the acadiana regional airport has an advantage over other types of airports because it is surrounded by land use compatible with airport operations. additionally. it is situated near the port of iberia. which is home to more than 100 companies employing close to 5.000 people in industries such as construction. energy. equipment rental. and trucking. this would bolster louisianas economy. help working families. and improve americas ability to trade with the world. louisianas economy relies on the thriving maritime industry. in 2014 a study from the transportation institute showed that 54.850 maritimerelated jobs contribute more than $11 billion annually to louisianas economy. one in every 83 louisiana jobs is connected to the domestic maritime industry. nearly twice that of any other state. with ports along the mississippi and red rivers. our state sees vessels of varying sizes and types. while loading cargo. these ships must drain ballast water that they have taken on to maintain the balance of the ship. this can have varying degrees of environmental effects. with costly and confusing state and federal regulations making compliance difficult. senator rubio is sponsoring the vessel incidental discharge act. which creates a uniform. enforceable. and scientifically based national standard on ballast water discharges. this is needed in order to simplify the highly complicated and overly burdensome patchwork of state and federal regulations that are in place today. everyone i talk to in louisianas maritime industry and also in the inland marine. which would take the agriculture products from states such as the state the presiding officer represents. says it is necessary for these regulations to be harmonized. and they emphasize the importance of passing this bill. i am a cosponsor of this bill. and i am glad to see that senator rubio has filed the amendment to the bill we are considering on the floor today. the faa reauthorization act contains many measures that will protect americans. improve our economy. and protect our environment. i urge all my fellow senators to support the bill and these amendments. i yield the floor."},{"1":"2015","2":"CANTWELL","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"i thank the senator from north dakota. i know we are going to be going back and forth on this issue and that we have other people coming. later this morning we are going to have time divided. but i appreciate the senator from north dakota allowing us to join in the debate this morning and make a few points. i do want to say i appreciate the hard work of the senator from north dakota on the energy committee in general. i look forward to working with him on many energy policies. he and i have worked together on a couple of different agricultural issues. i certainly appreciate his due diligence. but needless to say i do not agree with the process of moving forward with this motion to proceed to the keystone xl pipeline bill. many of my colleagues are going to be coming down and talking about the issues. two of my colleagues. including the senators from utah and arkansas. along with the senator from north dakota. brought up a couple of different points. but in my mind. they are talking about a 19th century energy policy and fossil fuel instead of us focusing on what should be a 21st century energy policy for our country. it is unfortunate that s. 1 is a very narrow. specific. special interest measure for a pipeline that did not go through the proper channels of a permitting process and because of that is flawed. as people are heralding it as the new congress. this process continues today with people saying: lets just give it more special interest attention and approve it. i believe america should be a leader in energy policy and that our job creation is dependent upon that energy policy for the future. we want to see america be a leader in this. i applaud the fact that the president reached a climate and clean energy agreement with china. we are over 60 percent of the worlds energy consumption. if the two countries can work together on a clean energy strategy. i guarantee that will be good business for the u.s. economy. in fact. i read a statistic that something like 50 percent of all energy is going to be consumed by the buildings in chinathere is huge growth in building development. but they do not have good building standards so those buildings consume too much energy. so there is a lot to do on energy efficiency that will grow u.s. jobs and help us. that is why we would rather see us focusing on some of the energy policies that we did in 2005 and 2007. those things unleash huge opportunities for american jobs and huge opportunities for american consumers to get a better deal and not be subject to price spikes. the 2007 bill had fuel efficiency standards in it and laid the foundation for the growth of the hybrid electric car industry and has added over 263.000 jobs in the last 5 years. that is the kind of smart policy we should be pursuing. we also have had energy bills that made investments in clean energy tax credits. something i was just talking about with my colleague from utah. saying we needed to move forward on energy tax credits. if there is nothing else that we should be doing. we should be doing that as s. 1. because the predictability and certainty we would be giving to that industry would certainly unleash many jobs. so the 2005 and 2007 energy bills that we did in a bipartisan fashion helped foster an energyefficient economy and helped support 450.000 jobs according to a 2011 brookings institution report. these are examples of the types of things we have done in the past that have unleashed investment. and have grown jobs in the united states of america. they are important milestones in the type of clarity congress can give to the private sector to spur growth and development. i can guarantee this is the opposite of that. this is about a special interest deal and overriding a process. including the white house process and local government process. that is so essential. two examples of what we should be doing instead: as i said. the energy tax credits which have been delayed. as my colleagues from oregon pointed out at the end of last year. we basically authorized them for about 2 more weeks in december. that was about all the certainty we gave the industry. a mckinsey report has estimated that providing the right incentives for retrofitting buildings and energy efficiency would help employ 900.000 people over the next decade. that the wind energy tax credit would employ 54.000 people. and there are other issues about modernizing our grid and new technology storage. there is also very important work to be done in the manufacturing sector. that is. to help unleash innovation by making sure we set standards on improving efficiency and focusing on lightweight materials for both automobiles and aviation. we have seen huge job growth in the pacific northwest because we were able to transform aerospace into lighter weight materials. we are also working on a biojet fuel. so all of these things mean we have to get the r&d right. we have to get the tax credits right. and we need to help protect consumers from spiking energy prices. this is the evolution. i do not think anybody in america thinks we are going to hold on to a 19th century fossil fuel economy forever. the question is. whether congress is going to spend its time moving forward on a 21st century plan that gives the predictability and certainty to unleash that leadership and capture the opportunities in developing markets around the globe or whether we are going to hold on to the last elements of fossil fuel forever and leave our constituents more at risk. but i would like to take a few minutes and talk about this process my colleagues are trying to describe as to why we need to hurry. because i can guarantee that is what people have been trying to do all along. hurry this along for a special interest. i do not believe that is good for the american people. i do not think it is good for this process. if we think about where we have been. this process is about people who are trying to push a route through no matter what the circumstances. every state. people are saying. has approved this process. i can guarantee there are a lot of people in nebraska and a lot of people in south dakota who do not agree with that. they are very concerned about the public interest. unfortunately. in the case of the keystone xl project. landowners and ranchers in nebraska affected by the pipeline did not feel they were afforded equal opportunity before the law. in their view the process was set up to benefit a special interest. the transcanada corporation. on three separate occasions. beginning in 2011. the nebraska legislature passed carveouts to circumvent the role of the public service commission to approve the keystone pipeline. if this was such a great deal. why cant it go through the normal process. as in every other state. with a transportation and utilities commission ruling on siting? why do we have to take the public interest out of it? the first carveout included the major oil pipeline siting act of 2011. so this bill laid out the rule that the public service commission determined whether a new pipeline project was in the public interest. in making this decision. the legislature required that the commission consider eight criteria. among them: the environmental impact of water and wildlife and vegetation. the economic and social impact. the alternative route. the impact to future development in the pipelines proposal. and the views of counties and cities. ok. that all sounds great. right? that is what the legislature says they should be considering. but the legislature also required the commission to hold public hearings and have public commentok. we are still on the right trackand importantly required the commission to establish a process for appealing the decision. so that any aggrieved party could have due process rights under the administrative procedures act. here is the punch line. tucked away in that nebraska legislation was a special interest carveout that exempted transcanadakeystone xlfrom having to comply with the public service commission process. specifically. the legislation stated. \"... shall not apply to any major oil pipeline that has submitted an application to the us department of state pursuant to executive order 13337 prior to the effective date of this act.\" there was only one company that qualified for this special interest exemption at the time of that legislation. that was transcanada. so you got it. the legislature basically exempted them from that process. even though they were stating that these are the processes that you should go through. so at the very time the legislature created new rules for due process on the pipeline. it exempted them from those rules. i do not understand why transcanada cannot play by the rules. but i guarantee you congress does not have to join in and make s. 1 a special interest bill. they should make sure everyone plays by the rules. in this same legislative session. the nebraska legislature also passed the oil pipeline route certification act. this bill provided keystone xl with an expedited review process by the nebraska department of environmental quality and gave the sole authority to approve the project to the governor. unfortunately. for the legislature and for transcanada. these carveouts quickly became irrelevant because president obama denied the application in 2012. that is in part due to the fact that congress had decided to try to intervene in the matter. that is when congress said this is important and we should go ahead and do this. i am going to get into more detail on that in a second. this is important to understand because the initial nebraska legislation was so narrowly tailored. it was designed to benefit the transcanada pipeline and its pending date of enactment. what happened next? the legislature went back to the drawing board and created a third new special carveout for the keystone xl pipeline. the day following the presidents denial of transcanadas application. a new bill was introduced in the nebraska legislature. this bill was yet another path around the existing due process afforded to citizens in that state. the legislation allowed the company to choose whether to go through a formal process with the public service commission or seek expedited review with the governor. i am sure a lot of u.s. companies would love to have that opportunity. these are u.s. companies that have to pay lawyers. go through environmental processes. make sure all of the issues are addressed. i am sure american companies would love to know any day of the week they can just go past a utility commission and get the governor to stamp \"approved\" on their project. under this expedited approach. the legislature authorized the nebraska department of environmental quality to independently conduct an environmental impact report. however. unlike due process required by the public service commission. this process required only token outreach to the public. there was just one public hearing in 2012. this special process provided no recourse for aggrieved parties. there was no formal appeals process. other than the courts. there was no administrative process with the ability for stakeholders to challenge the facts as a matter of record to base their formal appeal on. these are fundamental differences between an expedited consideration within the governors office and a process requiring a public interest determination by relevant decisionmakers at a commission. i know my colleagues here would like to argue that somehow this has been a long. drawnout process. this has really been a process by one company constantly circumventing the rules on the books and trying to get a special deal for approval. we have to ask ourselves why. why do they want to proceed this way? i know my colleagues always like to talk about their neighbors. my neighbors in british columbia are not so thrilled about tar sands pipeline activity. they are not interested in it. so maybe that is why transcanada wants to hurry and get this process through in the united states. i ask my colleagues. do you have confidence the public interest was really taken into considerationthat you run over the interests of private property owners on these issues? was the department of environmental quality evaluation comprehensive? i can say one nebraska landowner described the report as \"an incomplete evaluation of a natural resource with the magnitude of the ogallala aquifer. and now it is left in the hands of transcanada to do their own policing.\" another family. who has been ranching for more than five generations in nebraska. said the process left landowners with nowhere to turn with their concerns of erosion. water contamination or eminent domain. another landowner had this to say about circumventing the process in nebraska: i feel it is not in the best interest of nebraska. nor the citizens of nebraska. to have our legislators crafting special legislation to meet the specific demands of an individual corporation. i couldnt agree with them more. that is exactly what we are trying to do today. the same stakeholders in nebraska have also questioned the appearance of conflict of interest associated with the nebraska department of environmental quality report since it was prepared by a contractor who also worked for transcanada and exxon on different joint pipeline projects. meanwhile. a majority of the state supreme court. 4 out of 7 justices. just last week ruled that the legislature and the governors actions were unconstitutional."},{"1":"2014","2":"LANDRIEU","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. i was hoping to catch the senator before he left the floor because i wanted to ask himand i am not sure he is going to slip back in here. but i was going to ask him if he thought maybebecause i agree with him that that new approach to bipartisanship could start today. i do not think we have to necessarily wait until january. there are some of us who have been ready. who have worked in a bipartisan way. literally for years. getting very important things done for our nation. i am sorry the senator slipped away. i am sure he has some other pressing business. i wanted to ask himand i absolutely agree with him on the priorities he just laid out. i think he just said the american people want us to act and to act together in their interests. i think i heard him say that on the top of his list. what he is particularly anxious to work on is the keystone xl pipeline. the expedited export of natural gas. i think he said it was important for jobs in america. helping to strengthen the middle class. sending a very positive signal to them that we heard them in this election. that he was troubled about the falling median household income and wants to do something to raise it. and i think i heard him say he was concerned or that he washow shall i say it?-he was thinking that some of these things would really push putin back on his heels. i have been one of the ones sanctioned by president putin. and there are a few others who are on that list. so i have been of that mind for a while. i think he also referred to ted kennedy. one of our dear friends who mentored many of usnot just democrats but republicans as wellwith his straightforwardness. his honesty. his passion. his capacity for extraordinary work. and his willingness to work across party lines. as the senator from texas pointed out. there was a great partnership between senator kennedy and senator enzi. and he talked about the 8020 rule. lets agree on 80 percent. \"we might not agree on everything. but lets move forward\" i think were his words on the 80 percent on which we do agree. so i want to come to the floor today to ask senator cornyn from texas particularly and senator mcconnell and senator reid and others if they will join me in moving forward on the keystone xl pipeline. this has been a project that has lingered far too long. it is clearly supported by 60 or more members of this body. it is a piece of legislation that has been endorsed by the new tobe majority leader. as a cosponsor and a leading cosponsor of the legislation. there are a significant number of democrats on that legislation. i believe with a significant push in the next few hours we could actually get the votes we need to pass the keystone pipeline. in an hour or so. at the request of the minority. i am going to wait for about an hour and then i am going to propose a unanimous consent to do exactly thatto set up 2 hours of debate tonight after the vote and then have a vote on the keystone pipeline tomorrow. i believe it is the time to act. i believe we should take the new majority leader at his word and stop blocking legislation that is broadly supported by the american public and has been for quite some time. i want to say yes to the new majority leader mitch mcconnell. the time to start is now. the public has clearly spoken. i believe we can move forward on several important pieces of legislation. senator reid mentioned the marketplace fairness act. that is another very important piece of legislation that i believe needs to be moved through. with a little push right now. it could get done. it would be a significant boost to businesses and retail that are being hurt every day by our inaction. my comments are going to be about the keystone pipeline because i am chair of the energy committee for the senate. i am going to do everything in my power. here and at home on the campaign trail where i am still in a runoff. as you know. to get this project moving forward. one of the extraordinary facts about the keystone pipeline is not what it is. i am going to talk about that in a minute and what it does. one of the most extraordinary pieces of argument for why we should pass it is the unprecedented coalition that supports it. there are other bills that have a longer list of supporters. there are bills that have pages and pages of lists. this particular bill has a relatively short list of organizations. but they are extremely powerful and diverse. which makes it compelling and i think it makes usor should make uswant to understand and respond to this coalition. i am going to read their names. i have some time to do this before i call for unanimous consent to pass the original hoevenlandrieu keystone bill. which is a standalone keystone bill as originally introduced with 45 republican cosponsors. every member of the republican caucus is already a cosponsor of this bill. and we have on that bill about 12 democratic cosponsors. i am confident we have the additional votes necessary to pass it. the american chemistry council. the american concrete pipe association. the american exploration and production council. the american highway users alliance. the american petroleum institute. the american road & transportation builders. american truckers association. associated general contractors of america. association of oil pipelines. concrete reinforcing steel institute. distribution contractors association. independent petroleum association of america. industrial minerals association of north america. institute for 21st century energy. international brotherhood of electrical workers. laborers international union of north america. let me stop there and make a point. many bills passed here or attempted to pass here either have a list of all business organizations or all labor organizations or all environmental organizations or all highway contractors. this bill has such an extraordinary. diverse group of some of the strongest business leaders in the country. i want to underscore to my democratic colleagues who are supporting this piece of legislation. tremendous support from labor unions because labor unions. like business leaders. want jobs. they want profits. they want success. they want more investment in business. creating good middleclass jobs. the difference between the oil and gas industry. which i have been pleased to be a strong advocate for in many different facets. is that industry does produce the kinds of jobs americans truly want. not minimum wage jobs. not just slightly above minimum wage but jobs that in my statethe senator knows this because he is well aware of thisstart at $60.000. $70.000. $85.000 for a young man or a young woman coming out of high school or trade school. let alone college. these are very important jobs. that is why labor unions are represented here. along with portland cement association. the plastics industry. the united association of journeymen and apprentices of the plumbing and pipe fitting industry. the business roundtable. american supply association. american iron and steel institute. national association of manufacturers. national electrical contractors association. national roofing contractors. why would roofing contractors be supporting the keystone pipeline? there are no roofs on a pipelines. but there are thousands of roofs over workers needed to build a pipeline. all along the route of this pipeline will be increases in populations of housing. industrial sites. retail. residential. supporting over 40.000 workers to build this pipeline. the north american die casting association. the national utility contractorsagain. associated businessesthe u.s. oil & gas association and. finally. steel manufacturers association and western alliance. this is an extraordinary coalition that has come together to support the hoevenlandrieu bill. the bill i am going to call up in a few minutes for unanimous consent to pass because i believe what the new majority leader has said. i believe what senator cornyn has just said. i believe what the current majority leader said. soon to be minority leader in the next congress. that we need to work together and that we can work together. and we need to begin to do that todaynot tomorrow. not in january. not in february. not in march. not around the corner. not next week but today. that would send the most positive signal. i am not asking to have unanimous consent on i0 bills that are controversial. i am not asking us to do the impossible. i am not asking us to do something that just came up last week. i am asking us to move forward on a bill that has labor support. business support. general contractor support. and most importantly the american people. the latest polls on the keystone pipeline. not just in my statei see my colleague from west virginiaand not just in west virginia but polls in this country from california to new york. to michigan. to pennsylvania. to ohio. to florida. and to texas. overwhelmingly democrats. republicansnot everyonebut there is overwhelming support to build the keystone pipeline because americans want jobs. american families deserve goodpaying jobs. in addition. americans are tired of bowing to mideast powers or to russian dictators about what our future is going to be. americans are proud. we want to stand proud. we believe the keystone pipeline is an important first step. it is a signal. it is a symbol that represents american energy power. it is a symbol moving past gridlock. it is a deliverable on promises we have all made. yes. we will work together. yes. but that will start later. yes. we will work together. but it will be next year. yes. we will work together. but it will be in the spring. yes. we will work together. but we cant pass keystone unless we pass these 10 other things. there is always going to be tomorrow. there is always going to be 10 other things. lets act today. tomorrow. we can do this. we can pass the keystone pipeline and answer the frustrations of the american people so they can rest next week and say: oh. my gosh. the senators of the united states of america have ears. they have brains. they have hearts. they heard what we said and we can do this. we have a bill that is on the calendar. i have also passed a similar bill through my committee. but i am not even asking you to pass the bill i passed through my committee. which i think is slightly better than the one on the calendar. but we can all compromise here. i am also the cosponsor of the bill. lead sponsor of the bill. that is on the senate calendar. it doesnt have to go through a committee. it basically technically already has. it is ready for a vote. we have the 60 votes to pass it. i am going to recognize in just a minute the senator from west virginia. i will ask the senator a question because only the chair can recognize. but i would like to ask the senator from west virginia. does any of this make sense to him. i dont know if he was down here. although i am sure he was in his office listening to the comments of the majority leader. the soontobe majority leader. and the good senator from texas saying now is the time to work together. i dont know if the senator heard that. does the senator think that maybe this bill would be the bill to start moving us from gridlock to doing the job for the american people?"},{"1":"2013","2":"HOLDING","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. my office continues to be flooded with calls from north carolinians who are frustrated with the government shutdown. the house and senate clearly disagree on how to proceed. but one thing we can all agree on is supporting our men and women in the military. last monday. congress passed. and president obama signed. the pay our military act. this bill ensures that our servicemen and -women and their civilian counterparts are paid during the shutdown. unfortunately. the administration delayed using this authority to pay all members of the military and dod civilians. meaning many civilian workers who should be working were furloughed. our servicemen and -women deserve our deepest respect and gratitude. these men and women bravely serve their country and their paychecks should not be jeopardized. after pressure from the house. the administration quit delaying the implementation of this law. mr. speaker. i urge the administration to also adopt the other commonsense funding bills

and to streamline burdensome rules and heavyhanded regulations that now thwart new domestic energy development in the united states. the president and the democraticled senate continue to obstruct the utilization of americas enormous natural resources. what are they? these resources are a godgiven asset that has elevated the wellbeing and prosperity of our people ever since the time of our nations founding. now. when we need the wealth of those resources more than ever. we suffer the obstructionism of our own government. the president has prevented the construction of the keystone xl pipeline. the president has shut down oil and gas production offshore. and most recently. this administrationand perhaps most heinouslythis administration has moved forward with plans to add onerous rules and regulations on a new and emerging technology. the efforts of this administration are mindboggling because there is no evidence that this technology has done any harm to our people. and there is ample evidence that this technology would produce significant economic growth. thus jobs. and i am referring to. of course. fracking. which has clearly been targeted by the president and by his environmental gestapo friends. while we are talking today and while we are trying to determine whether or not we are going to be using more resources. gasoline prices are changing the lifestyle of the american people. were talking about people who are paying $3.50 a gallon and. in my state. $4 a gallon. why are we allowing our people13 million people who are currently out of work and suffering under these conditionswhy are we adding such costs for them to bear?"},{"1":"2011","2":"BLUMENTHAL","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"madam president. over the past 2 weeks. i have traveled the state of connecticut. as the presiding officer has done in the state of new york. and she has described eloquently the damage she has seen in her state. i have seen much the same in mine. i have seen the destruction of small businesses. of homes. rivers swelling. flooding of historic dimensions causing significant destruction. the wind and rain striking connecticut with a fury. its ferocity virtually unmatched in recent memory. i met with families and community leaders. farmers and small businesses. about the help they will need to rebuild their homes and their businesses and their lives and their livelihoods. it is a powerful and moving struggle. the citizens of connecticut. similar to the citizens of new york and others struck by this storm. have acted with determination and resolve. not with desperation or despair. they are determined and dedicated to rebuild and recover from this storm. but they need the help that is provided by fema. we are here. hopefully in a bipartisan effort. to make sure these communities and others like them throughout the northeast and throughout the united states have the help and the real consequential aid they need to make this recovery in rebuilding their lives. the early estimates suggest that the damage caused by irene could reach more than $10 billion. making it one of the 10 costliest disasters in u.s. history. the suffering and real sadness of connecticut citizens gives us a bond and a cause in common with millions of other americans who have suffered from hurricanes. tornadoes. floods. and other natural disasters across the country. this year alone. we have seen flooding on the mississippi and missouri rivers and other rivers in the midwest. devastating tornadoes in the south. wildfires in the south and west. and now hurricane irene and tropical storm lee. in times of natural disaster. americans come together. in times when they face crises. americans rally as neighbors. as a community. regardless of specific states where they live. they come together to rebuild their homes. to make common cause. to recognize our bonds as a nation. the spirit of our nation is that we put people above politics every time. without exception. that we provide disaster relief for victims. such as connecticut residents now. and with the resources they need to rebuild. currently. fema is funding disaster relief for over 550 disasters. including 29 in oklahoma. 21 in kentucky. 17 in texas. 19 in mississippi. and 18 in kansas. yet 2 weeks ago. house majority leader eric cantor stated that relief funds for hurricane irene would need to be offset by savings found elsewhere in the federal budget. i reject that contention and so should this body and my colleagues from those states i have just named and all the other states in the union. in fact. all but a handful or less have received and are receiving disaster relief just since january of this year. we need to do everything we can to put connecticut and america back to work. to make sure our economy moves forward again. to create jobs. and to reduce the deficit. yes. we need to reduce the deficit and the debt and cut unnecessary and wasteful spending. however. we cannot permit washington politics to create a legislative logjam and gridlock that bogs down these efforts for disaster relief. the need is too urgent for thousands of families and businesses in connecticut and around the country that have been devastated by these unprecedented floods and other natural disasters. such as hurricanes. wildfires. floods. and tornadoes. turning disaster assistance into a political football is unacceptable and unconscionable. it is a recipe for gridlock and it is just plain wrong. it is wrong and a disservice to the men and women whose homes and businesses have been hit by the forces of nature that are unpredictable and unpreventable. now they are attempting to rebuild their lives. and we owe it to them to match their courage and resilience with efforts from fema. we cant prevent those hurricanes or tornadoes or wildfires. but we can step forward when these disasters occur and lend a hand to our neighbors. as we have done throughout our history. and we can provide these communities with the real resources they need to recover. without distinguishing between what state or what part of the country. there is one story from connecticut which i think tells a lot about the choices we face right now. mel goldstein and his wife arlene. whose home was completely destroyed by flooding caused by hurricane irene. are being told their homeowners insurance will not cover the damage. their only hope of recovery is fema flood insurance and other fema assistance. right now. they are using their savings to stay in a hotel while they rebuild their lives. mel is one of the best known weathermen in the state of connecticut. he is an icon in the broadcasting world and a hero to many of us for his struggle against cancer. his treatment in this unstable environment at this point in his recovery adds an unnecessary toll and stress to their lives. as we have in the past. we must come together to help folks such as arlene and mel goldstein move on after the unthinkable happens in their lives. the unthinkable happened to them and to many of their neighbors in east haven along the shores of connecticut. i have heard their voices and seen their faces throughout our state. in communities big and small. where flooding has put a small business out of business and where homes have been destroyed and people are living in shelters or with their neighbors or were for awhile. these kinds of human stories are part of the fabric of the larger story we need to recognize. i hope my colleagues will come together. as we did on the vote yesterday. to approve this measure. the vote yesterday signaled perhaps a return to the bipartisanship that should prevail when the nation confronts crisis and disaster. our no. 1 goal. which should be a bipartisan goal. must be to deliver help to our fellow americans as quickly as possible. thank you. i yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum."},{"1":"2010","2":"DURBIN","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. i commend the senator from new mexico for drawing our attention to earth day. it has certainly become a national. if not global. observance that calls to mind the relationship we have with this earth that we live on and our responsibilities. we are now considering legislation involving carbon and the impact of carbon on the environment and on this planet. there are some differences of opinions on the floor of the senate about whether this is a challenge and. if it is. how to address it. early next week. three of our colleagues are going to step forward with a proposal. senator john kerry has spearheaded an effort. working with senator barbara boxer and senator bingaman. to come forward with an idea of clean energy. he will be joined by senator joseph lieberman and senator lindsey graham. it is a bipartisan effort. what they are seeking to do in this bill is certainly consistent with the goals of earth day and our national goals: first. to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. to encourage domestic energy sources that are renewable and sustainable so we can build on our future. second. to create jobs. which is our highest priority in this congress with the recession we face. we understand the reality that countries such as china see a great potential for building solar panels and wind turbines and a variety of different forms of technology to promote energy efficiency and to promote the kind of clean energy approach that we should have as part of our future. third. of course. is that we want to do something about pollutioncarbon emissions. the impact they have on our lungs and on our atmosphere. i think this is a noble agenda. it is an ambitious agenda because it engages the entire american economy. we want to be sure we do the right thing. the responsible thing. when it comes to clean energy and our future but not at the cost of economic growth and development. i happen to believe a case can be made that absent our effort. we are going to fall behind in the development of industries that have great potential. there was a time that the two words. \"silicon valley.\" sent a message not only to america but to the world that we were leading in the information technology development arena. i cannot even guess at the number of jobs. businesses. and wealth that was created by that information technology leadership in the united states. now we need to seize that leadership again. it is frustrating. if not infuriating. to think that 50 years ago. bell labs in the united states developed solar panels. now. of the 10 largest solar panel producers in the world. not one is in the united states. that has to change. it is something of a cliche. but i say it in my speeches and it resonates with people. that i would like to go into more stores in america and find \"made in america\" stamped on those products. when it comes to this type of technologysolar panels. wind turbinesthere is no reason we cant build these in the united states so that we are achieving many goals at once: a clean energy alternative. reducing our dependence on foreign oil. creating goodpaying jobs in industries with a future. and in the process doing the right thing for mother earth. earth day is a time to reflect on that. i have often spent earth day back in illinois. downstate with farmers. and i cant think of any class of people in america closer to mother nature every single day of their lives. most of them are not all that comfortable with these socalled environmentalists. they think they are too theoretical and not grounded in the reality that farmers face in their lives. but i have tried to draw them together in conversation. and almost inevitably they come up with some common approaches. whether we are talking about soil and water conservation or reduction of the use of chemicals on the land. all of these things are consistent with both environmental goals and profitable farming. so i look at our stewards of the agricultural scene in america as part of our environmental community who can play a critical role in charting a course in making policies for the future. mr. president. i hope that soon we will be moving to financial regulatory reform. it is a washington term known as wall street reform. or basically trying to clean up the mess that was created by this last recession. this is a bill that is controversial. it has been worked on by many committees in the senate. senator blanche lincoln in the agricultural committee took on a big part of it. most people are surprised to think of wall street and the ag committee at the same time. but those of us from chicago are not. we have a futures market which has been in place for almost a century. starting with the chicago board of trade. and it deals in futuresderivatives. if you willthat are based on agricultural commodities and currency and interest rates and a certain index. that operation in chicago is governed and regulated by the commodity futures trading commission. the jurisdiction of that. as it started with agricultural products. has been relegated to the agriculture committee. senator lincoln met this week and did an outstanding job of reporting a bill on that section of the bill related to derivatives and futures regulated by the commodity futures trading commission. she was successful in reporting the bill from her committee. with the support of senator grassley of iowa making it a bipartisan effort. another republican senator expressed an interest in helping as well. so i give her high praise in this charged political atmosphere in which we work in this body. it says a lot for her that she can put together this type of bipartisan coalition. at the same time. senator dodd. in the banking committee. has been working on a bill as well. trying to bring the two together on the senate floor and have a joint effort to deal with this issue. now. why are we doing this? well. we are doing this for very obvious reasons. we know that leading into this recession. wall street and the big banks in america got away with murder. at the end of the day. the taxpayers of this country were called on to rescue these financial institutions from their own perfidy. when we look at the things they did in the name of profit. it turned out to be senseless greed. at the end of the day. many people suffered. as a result of this recession. $17 trillion was extracted from the american economy$17 trillion in losses. mr. president. $17 trillion is more than the annual gross national product of the united states. so if we took the sum total value of all the goods and services produced in our country in 1 year. we lost that much value in this recession. it was the hardest hit the american economy has taken since the great depression in of course. a lot of it had to do with bad decisions. some individual families and businesses made bad decisions. they borrowed money when they shouldnt have. they got in too deeply. bought homes that were too expensive. they might have been lured into it. but they made bad decisions. the government made some bad decisions. we thought. as a general principle. encouraging home ownership was great for our country. that the more people who own a home. the more likely they will make that home a good investment for themselves. and the more likely they will be engaged in their neighborhood and their churches and in their communities. and the stronger we will be as a nation. that was the starting point. so we opened up opportunities for home ownership. reaching down to levels that had not been tried before. and. unfortunately. that went too far. the private sector was to blame. when we look at so many people who were lured into mortgages and borrowing far beyond their means. we see there was also a lot of deception going on. people were told they could get a mortgage and make an easy monthly payment and werent told their mortgage would explode right in front of them. as the subprime mortgage. in a matter of months or years. would have a monthly payment far beyond their means. they werent told there was a provision in that mortgage which had a prepayment penalty that stopped them from refinancing. and that they were stuck with high interest rates from which they couldnt escape. they werent told that just making an oral representation about their income was not nearly enough. that they needed to produce documentation about their real net worth. these socalled nodoc closings. which became rampant in some areas. led to terrible decisions. encouraged by greedy speculators in the financial industries. so the net result was that the bottom fell out of the real estate market and $17 trillion in value was lost in the american economy. most of us felt it in our 401(k)s. in our savings accounts. and in our retirement plans. we saw it with businesses that lost their leases and lost their businesses and had to lay off their employees. the president was faced with 800.000 unemployed americans in his first month in office. that is an enormous number of people. the total today is about 8 million actively unemployed. with 6 million longterm unemployed. it is huge. and it affects every single state. in my state. there is over 11 percent unemployment. in rockford. il. it is close to 20. and danville about the same. i have visited those communities. and i can see the pain and the sacrifices that are being made by people who have lost their jobs. so the president came in and asked us to pass a stimulus bill. which we did. it was some $787 billion that was injected into the economy in an effort to get it moving again. providing tax breaks for 95 percent of working families and middleincome families across america. it was a safety net for those who had lost their jobs. not only in unemployment benefits but also cobra or health insurance benefits. and finally an investment in projects such as highway construction. which would create goodpaying american jobs right now and produce something that would have value for our economic growth in the years to come. at the same time. though. as we go through this painful process of coming out of this recession. we have to make changes in wall street and the financial institutions to guarantee that we would not face this again. that means taking an honest look at some of the practices that are taking place today. and that are legal today. we got into this thinkingand i was part of it. most of us werethat if we had an expanding financial sector in the united states. it would expand jobs and opportunities and business growth and global competition. unfortunately. it went overboard. many financial institutions. which are now being called on the carpet. took the authority given them by the federal government to an extreme. that is what we are trying to change. we want to make sure there is some accountability on wall street and with the big banks. so that we understand what they are doing and that their investments dont end up being a gamble where people can lose their life savings or investments. we want to make sure as well that we empower consumers in the united states. this bill that is going to come before us has the strongest consumer financial protection ever enacted into law in the united states. we are going to create an agency which is going to protect and empower consumersprotect them from the tricks and traps and shadowy agreements and fine print stuck in mortgages and credit card statements. in student loans. in retirement plans. and all of the things that people engage in daily in their lives where one sentence stuck in a legal document can end up being someones downfall. we want to protect consumers from that and empower consumers to make the right decisions. so that there will be clarity in these legal documents that can bring a persons financial empire to ruin. that kind of clarity and plain english is going to be guaranteed by a federal group that is going to keep an eye on the financial industries. some of these large banks are fighting us. they dont want to see this happen. they do not believe there should be this kind of consumer financial protection. but we are going to fight to make that happen so consumers across america have a fighting chance when they enter into agreements. so that they will have a legal document they can understand and one that they can work with. and then they will have an agency to back them up. currently. we have only had one republican senator vote for this kind of reformsenator grassley of iowa voted for it in the agriculture committee version that came out of senator lincolns committee. but on the banking committee. not a single republican would vote for it. i hope they will have a change of heart. i understand there are negotiations underway. but i hope the negotiations dont water down the basic agreement in this bill. we need a strong bill. we need a bill that meets the test of what we have been through as a nation. after all of the suffering that has taken placethe businesses lost. the savings lost. the jobs lostfor goodness sake. lets not come up with some halfhearted effort. lets stand up to the wall street lobbyists who are going to try to water down this bill and tell them no. we are going to call for a vote on a bill that has some teeth in it. something worth voting for. something that will guarantee that we will never go through this kind of recession ever again in our economy. i think we owe that to the american people. and i hope that next week. come monday afternoon at 5 oclock. when this senate convenes for a vote. i hope we have a strong bipartisan vote to move forward on this whole idea of wall street reform. i believe that is in the best interests of our country. i commend senator dodd and senator lincoln. i urge them to come together. bring their two bills together. and to come up with an agreement that can lead us into this kind of happy day where we have this kind of legislation. mr. president. i thank you for allowing me to speak in morning business. and if there is no one seeking recognition. i suggest the absence of a quorum."},{"1":"2009","2":"GREGG","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"madam president. i rise to speak about the dire situation of our fiscal house and the federal government. which has been confirmed andreinforced by the recent trustees report on social security. we are in big trouble as a nation because of the amount of debt we are running up. this president has proposed a budget that doubles the debt in 5 years and triples it in 10 years. he proposed a budget that runs. on the average. a trillion dollars of deficit every year for the next 10 yearsa to 5 percent of gdp in deficit. in fact. this year the deficit will be almost $2 trillion and it will -be almost 13 percent of gdpstaggering numbers. numbers we have never seen as a nation except during world war ii when we were fighting for survival. these numbers add up to debt that is unsustainable and cannot possibly be repaid by our children and therefore will create an atmosphere for our children and our childrens children where our nation will not be as prosperous or as strong as it was when our nation was passed on to our stewardship. these problems are only massively compounded by the report that came out yesterday from the social security trustees because they pointed out that the medicare trust fund is going into a negative cash flow situation and the social security trust fund will soon go into a negative cash flow situation. what does that mean? well. in the last 15 or 20 years. we have basically been financing our government by borrowing from the piggy bank of social security and using that money to operate the daytoday costs of the federal government. what the trustees are telling us is that the piggy. bank is broken. it has been smashed. it. no longer has any money in it. it is not going to take in money that exceeds the amount of money it has to pay out. in fact. we are going to have to borrow money now in ordet to pay social security benefits beginning in 2016 and medicare benefits right now. this year. this chart reflects the seriousness of the situation. if you take just these basic mandatory programssocial security. medicare. and medicaidthe cost is escalating on a steep upward slope. by around the year 2025 or 2030. these three programs alone will absorb all of the money the federal government has traditionally spent on all of the programs of the federal government20 percent of gdpand then they go up. it is projected that toward the middle of this century. social security. medicare. and medicaid will literally bankrupt our nation by themselves. that says nothing about the basic underlying budget. whichis expanding so dramatically under this presidency. the debt of this country under president obamas proposal and budget. because of spending in these three accounts and because of the new spending the president proposed in all sorts of other accountsmassive expansions in the size of government. where the debt of the federal government just goes up and up. to the point where it will represent. at the end of president obamas budget. 80 percent of the gross national product. today. the federal debt is about 40 percent of the gross qational product. down here. but after the spending spree of president obama and the democratic congress. it will be 80 percent of the gross national product. we will be in a position where we cannot get out of the hole. usually. when you dig a hole that is too deepand we are deep in the hole already. by the wayyou stop digging. that is the old adage. if you are digging a hole and you are underground. you stop digging. weare not going to stop digging as a government. what the president and the democrats are suggesting is that we bring a backhoe into the hole and dig twice as fast. so that we go even further down into the negative. into debt. that is not sustainable. it is not survivable for our kids because they are going to end up with costs and deficits that far exceed their ability to be able to manage. the medicare system alone has an unfunded liability of $37.8 trillion. when you throw in the socialsecurity system on top of that. you are talking about unfunded liabilities of over $42 trillion. what are the implications of that? if you took all the taxes paid in the united states since we were formed as a nation. since we began our government and started to collect taxes. we have paid less in taxes than we have in obligations on those two accounts. if kou took the net worth of every americanall of our homes. cars. and stockand you added it all up. we have a debt on the books for the purpose of paying for the programs that we know already exist under medicare and social securitywe have a debt that ekceeds the net worth of the entire country. that is the definition of bankruptcy. by the waywhen your debt dramatically exceeds your assets. in fact. by the 10th year of this budget. as proposed by president obama and passed by the democratic senatewithout any republican votes because it is such an irresponsible budgetthe interest on the federal debt alone will be $850 billion. to try to put that into context. the interest on the debt will detually exceed what we spend on national defense. it will exceed by a factor of 4 or 5 what we spend on education and on transportation. so we will be putting more money into paying interest. by the way. to whom do we pay this interest? we pay it to the chinese. to the japanese. to southeast asian countries. and. obviously. to the arab and oilproducing countries. we will be paying more interest to those nationsmore american hardearned dollars will go to those nations to pay interest on our debt--than we will have available. what we will be able to spend on our own national defense. does that make sense? no. it doesnt make any sense at all. plus. it is not supportable. there are only two things that can happen to our nation. when you run up the debt in the manner in which this deficit is proposed and in the manner these deficits will do under the budget passed here. when you look at the debt and -the serious financial situations of sdcial security and medicare. there are. basically only two thingsunless we take action on controlling spending nowthat can occur. one is that you devalue the dollar and inflate the currency. that is sort of a combined thing. you basically take the value of the american currency and inflate it. that is the cruelest tax of all. that says to people who have savings that they will find they are worth less the next day because of inflation. it says to the people whbo want to buy thingsthat they can buy less because of inflation. inflation is a massive tax on working americans. that is. one way you get qut of debt. you inflate it. the practical effect of that is that people wont want to buy your debt. if they know inflation is coming. they wont buy your debt. why give you $1 billion to buy a billion dollars of american debt knowing that you are going to pay them back in inflated dollars? if they are going to give you a billion dollars.. or lend it to you. they are going to require much higher interest rates than we presently have to pay because they are going to have to anticipate inflatiof and the fact that the value of the dollar will be reduced and that the value of the debt they just bought will be worth less. so inflation has a lot of very bad ramifications. but how else do you get out from underneath the debt? the other way is to massively increase taxes on all americans. this euphemism that we are just going to tax the richyou cannot do it by just taxing the rich even if taxing the rich is something you want to do. on the other side of the aisle. they claim they are going to raise the rate on highincome americans from 35 percent up to an effective rate of about 41 or 42 percent. as proposed by the president. these highincome americans. making more than $250.000. are the majority of the job producers in america. most of the jobs in america are produced by small businesses today. and almost all of those small businesses would be hit with this additional tax rate. so what happens to the small business. that momandpop activity in new hampshire. which is suddenly starting to grow? maybe they have 10 employees and they want to add 12 or 15 mdre. but they cannot do it because they have to take their money and put it toward paying taxes. they are not going to be able to put it toward adding more jobs. which would be much more beneficial to us than having the money come to washington and having the people in washington decide how to efficiently spend it. it is spent much more efficiently by small business. it is not like they are undertaxed. a 35percent tax rate on a small business means they are taxed more than any other people in the industrialized world for small business activity. most corporate taxes and business taxes in the world average out around 20. 19. 15 percent. in the united states it is 35 percent. if you are an individual or a subchapter s corporation. now they- are talking about taking it up to 41 percent under the proposal from the other side of the aisle. that is their plan for taxes. this is tax the rich. even though for the most part this is small business and it will cost us jobsfine. lets accept the taxtherich argpment. how much money do they get from that? not very much. compared to what they are talking about spending. they. the other side of the aisle. are proposing increasing spending by over $1 trillion on the discretionary side--that is education and things like thatand over $1 trillion on the entitlement side. the revenues from this tax increase are about onefifth of that spending increase. maxinium onefifthand that presumes that wealthy people are not going to be smart enough to go out and figure out ways to avoid taxes. which is what people do who have accountants when their tax rates go tip. they figure out a way to invest so they do not have to pay their taxes at such a high level. legally. by investing in things that are tax avoidance vehicles. it is not a very efficient way to manage the economy. we would rather .have people invest in a way to get the maximum return because that creates the most productivity in society. which promotes the most jobs. but what happens is people invest not to create jobs and create return. they go out and invest to avoid taxes. which is a very inefficient way to spend dollars. but lets accept the theory this is all acceptable. that we should go outand tax the rich because it is a good political statement and makes a nice tv ad and that will address the problem. it does not. we still have a debt curve that goes up essentially on the same pathway because this pathway of debt assumes--this debt assumes this .tax increase on the wealthy. what is the other option besides inflating the economy? it is to tax everyone at very dramatic rates. what is the practical effect of that? if we tax all working americans in order to pay off this debtand remember what this .debtis being.used for. it is being used to expand the size of the government. the president has been very forthright about this. he says: i believe. by dramatically growing the size of the governmenti heard this today on npr. which i found was very appropriate since they happen to be a governmentfunded agencyby dramatically expanding the size of the government. you can create prosperity. that is the argument of the president. that is the argument of the nprs commentator today. i am thinking to myselfexplain this to me. take the debt of the united states up to 80 percent of gdp. run deficits of $1 trillion a year for the next 10 years. and we are going to create prosperity? we are not going to create prosperity. we are going to create a momentary blip in the activity of the government in the private sectornot momentary. a permanent blip. and we are going to significantly increase the size of the government and maybe we will create some government jobs. but in the end what we get is a massive expansion in debt. a massive expansion in deficit. and a commensurate expansion either in inflation or in taxes. which have a huge dampening effect on prosperity. we dont create prosperity by increasing inflation. we dont create s5414 co: prosperity by creating a nonproductive workplace where capital is being invested. not for the purposes of efficiency but for the purposes of avoiding taxes. basically. what we are absolutely guaranteeing when we are running up this type of debt is that we are not going to get prosperity. we are going to get a weaker economy. a less prosperous country. and a country that is not as strong. these numbers that came out yesterday from the social security trustees only highlight. in a\" most devastating way. how significant our problem is. if we fail to take it on. if we fail to address this issue. if we continue on this path of just spending money as if there is no tomorrow. there will be no tomorrow for our children because the burdens will be so high and so extreme from all the costs of government. and especially from the burdens of these entitlement programs. what is the answer? to begin with. yes we are in a tough fiscal time right now. and we have to spend money that we do not want to spend in order to try to get things going. but lets acknowledge the fact that this recession is not going to go on forever. hopefully. there are some lights at the end of the tunnel and some glimmers that things are turning around. and we all hope that is going to occur and it appears it may. the federal reserve chairman .thinks it will. as we move out of this recession. we should not continue to spend as if we are in a recession. rather..we should draw back on the spending we put into the system. we should start to take some of that spending back. all of the spending programs that came in the stimulus shouldhave been sunsetted so these programs end after the recession is over. 1 years from now. or maybe 1 year from now. but -that is not the plan. the plan is to build all of this spending into the baseline and have this spending go on for as far as the eye can see. and that is why the presidents budget expects to have a $1 trillion deficit as far as the eye can see. or at least as far as the budget window---10 years. then after retrenching on the spending that is being proposed just in the short term. saying: lets stop this spending when we get out of the recession. lets start curtailing this spending. lets go back to the former spending patterns of the governmentwhich were not very good to begin with but at least a lot better thanwhat is being proposed now. lets put someplace some strict fiscal discipline. lets freeze discretionary spending for i or 2 years after we move past this recessionin other words. in the year 2010. 2012. 2013. lets also. at the same time. look at these entitlement accounts and see how we can put them on a more sustainable path. that means making some courageous decisions around here.

about the issue we are waiting for. waiting to address here hopefully later this evening. and the issue is whether we are going to providenot a grant. not a gift. not a bailout to two auto companies. gm and chrysler. but whether we are going to provide them a loan. some of you recall 28 years ago when chrysler was in difficult straits and their ceo. lee iacocca. called on the federal government to provide a loan. we did not do that. we provided a loan guarantee. chrysler made a lot of changes within the company to reduce their costs. to make them a lowcost provider of vehicles. and they came back to health. the loan was repaid. federal taxpayers actually made money. about $300 million on the deal. because we had takenin return for taking on the risk of making that loan. we got warrants. and we converted those warrants into stock. which treasury sold and made about $300 million. today. i think the thing that has been dragging this process down is the question of. as we think about providing a loan to chrysler and a loan to general motors. what can we do to make sure that within that companylabor. management. bondholders. lenders. dealershow do we best ensure that they are going to make the further sacrifices. shared sacrifices. to make gm and chrysler a lowercost competitor. so that when they emerge from this process and begin operating with these loans. how can we make sure they will be successful. not just for a couple of months but how are we going to be encouraged that they will be successful for yearsactually. for decades. as chrysler was subsequent to our 1980 involvement. the two positions that we are looking atone is a negotiated deal by the white house and by chairman dodd and others here in the senate that says we want to put in place a car czarsort of like a trustee. if you will. almost like a bankruptcy trusteewhose job it would be to work with the relevant stakeholders. folks i already mentionedlabor. management. lenders. bondholders. dealers and othersto ensure that they make the kinds of sacrifices and reductions that will lead to making gm and chrysler more vibrant. more competitive when the economy recovers and people start buying cars. trucks. and vans again. so on the one hand. that is what the administration has proposed and what senator dodd and others have negotiated with them. on the other hand. we have some of our friends on the republican side here in the senate who believe it is appropriate for the senate almost to sort of stipulate the conditions of this shared sacrifice. almost for the senate to serve not exactly but kind of like the bankruptcy judge or almost to be the car czar itself and to put those changes in legislative language. so those are sort of the two positions where we are. and we have been sort of in a logjam for much of the day. i am encouraged that there is still good will on both sides. and a lot of folks have been involved in these negotiations. hopefully. we are finally coming closer to some consensus. and not one where we actually have the congress playing the role of bankruptcy judge but we do take some steps to better ensure that the additional cost savings that are needed are realized so that these companies will be successful for a long period of time. i rode down on the train today. before i got on the train. i ran into somebody. like our presiding officer. i like to work out almost every day. i stopped off at the central ymca in wilmington. while i was there. this one fellow who had just bought a chevrolet came up to me. he said: tell me that if you all are going to do something. i will still have a dealer to take my car to to have it serviced and for the warranty to be good. i said: there is nothing i can promise you for sure. but we dont want to just walk away from the industry and see these folks go down. but i am convinced there are a lot of people who. frankly. would like to drive a car. truck. or van. and they might want to buy a product from ford. chrysler. or gm. before they do that. they want to make sure the dealer and the company will be around for a while. for however long they will own their vehicle. so if they do have a problem and it needs warranty work they will get that. if they have a problem in the years ahead and they need parts. they can get them. if they need service. they will be able to get that as well. that uncertainty is keeping people from buying vehicles. the other factor is the captive financing arms of the car companiesgmac. chrysler financial. and ford financial. they not only help provide people who want to buy cars with loans to enable them to buy their vehicles. they also help finance dealer inventory. if a dealer wants to finance inventory. they have to get the money from someplace. sometimes they can get it from the local banks. sometimes they cant. sometimes they get that financing from the captive finance vehicle of each of the auto companies. the captive financing arm also will make loans and then they will take those loans and bundle them and securitize them and sell them around the country and around the world to provide more money to be used to either finance auto loans or. in some cases. finance the inventory for dealers to put on their parking lots and showrooms. as we go through this. one of the things we have to do is not only hopefully work out this deal so we figure out who is going to play the role of the federal bankruptcy judge with respect to these two companies. without going into bankruptcy. so we can make sure these companies will be around and provide warranty work and parts and service. but how do we make sure the captive financing arms start working again as they are supposed to. we have a lot of banks that havent been providing the kind of loans to families. small businesses for working capital. for kids to go to college and people to buy homes and cars. we have been working on that for a couple months. liquidity is freeing up a little bit. but as we deal with that and with the more immediate issue of the nearterm survival of ford and chrysler and gm. it is important that we also keep in mind the captive finance arms and how we can make sure they are in a position. like banks being able to lend money. the financial arms of the car companies are able to lend money as well. that may be a battle for another day but not very far down the line. i am encouraged that some progress is being made. i wanted to express my thanks for the people of delaware. we have a chrysler plant in my state that has been there for about 60 years. we make the suvs for chrysler. we build the dodge durangos and the chrysler aspens. they were selected as the best suvs in terms of quality by jd powers. that plant will be closed in 20 days. a plant that i have worked to keep open for 28 years. it is painful for me and for the people who have worked there. who still work there. but it is going to happen. we have a gm plant not far from there in wilmington where we make all the saturn skys. we not only sell those in this country. we sell them around the world. we export them to south korea. we sell the saturn sky in about 15 or so countries in europe. it is a very good vehicle. we are proud of the work they do. i have believed over the years in making sure these plants stay alive and make a good product. they do a great job on quality. productivity. and labormanagement relations. we are very proud of both plants and their workforce. management and labor people. and the record they have achieved. we want to make sure our chrysler plant. as they are shut down and a lot of people are going to be losing jobs. we want to make sure the folks who work there. the people who build the durangos and aspens. we think those are hands that can also build windmill turbines for the windmill farm we will put off the coast of rehobeth beach starting a year or two from now. those are hands that can build solar energy panels and can build homes with geothermal heating and cooling. can build a new nuclear powerplant on the other side of the delaware river. there is plenty they can do in terms of providing clean energy. in terms of providing us with a reduction in fossil fuels. and to enable us to build products that we can sell around the world to reduce our trade deficit. i think it is important. as we face a very sad closure of our chrysler plant in newark. that we have in place not just in newark but in all kinds of plants around the country training programs that will help people who have a good work record. they want to be gainfully employed. they have good skills. lets make sure they have the opportunity to find jobs where they can make a real contribution. i see we are joined by the senator from utah who may or may not want to speak. he is approaching the presiding officer. it is always good to work with him. his presence always augers well for us doing something constructive. keep up the good work. i yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum."},{"1":"2007","2":"CLEAVER","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"there is a great deal of movement toward wind energy in missouri and in the state of kansas.

missouri. one of the things i think is extremely worth noting. particularly as the three of us speak about this subject. is that some people are nervous about discussions that we are having with regards to the changes thatneed to be made in this country. they falsely believe that we are going to reduce the quality of life. that we are going to damage industry. and what i have said is that if we will. unleash this incredibly creative american creativity and ingenuity. that we will be able to transform our energy use in a way that we would create new jobs. . for example. there is a plant in china that produces most of the highly efficient light bulbs. they dont use them in -china. we buy them here. and there is not a single plant in the united states that manufactures this particular light bulb. so i think we have the capacity to make alterations without damaging our economy. by not even causing a dent. let me just say that. in having had the opportunity to meet with some of the mps in london. i found out that a bill was introduced march 13. 2007. -to the parliament. members from three of the parties were in the dialogue. they said. without any reservations. the bill is going to pass. there is no question. it is going to pass. now. these are people who \"dont agree about much else. they agree on one thing. that we are in the midst of climate change. and. number two. they have to do something about it. so the bill that was introduced is aimed at moving the united kingdom to a low carbon economy. it would require a mandatory 60 percent cut in the uks carbon emissions by 2050 compared to the base level. which was 1990. with an intermediate target of 26 to 32 percent by the year 2020. the eu has also agreed to cut by 20 percent emissions by the year 2020 and by 30 percent if it is a part of an overall agreement that will include the united states. i will just say what we heard .over and over again was. what is. the united states going to do? the united states

was a bipartisan delegation. that we were not there to cast aspersions on any of our colleagues. that we do haye a deliberative body. that there are some people who have not quite caught on yet to what the rest of the world seems to have caught on to. but it is my hope. it is my prayer. that this body will realize what the rest of the world already realizes. that there is climate change and that there is no need to debate the science. only what we are going to do as a result of it."},{"1":"2006","2":"KENNEDY","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. this legislation. s. 22. is not a serious attempt to address a significant problem being faced by physicians in some states. it is the product of a party caucus rather than the bipartisan deliberations of a senate committee. it was designed to score political points. not to achieve the bipartisan consensus which is needed to enact major legislation. in fact. the legislative language was not even available for review until late last week. for these reasons. it does not deserve to be taken seriously by the senate. we must reject the simplistic and ineffective responses proposed by those who contend that the only way to help doctors is to further hurt seriously injured patients. unfortunately. as we saw in the patients bill of rights debate. the bush administration and congressional republicans are again advocating a policy which will benefit neither doctors nor patients. only insurance companies. caps on compensatory damages and other extreme \"tort reforms\" are not only unfair to the victims of malpractice. they do not result in a reduction of malpractice insurance premiums. not only does this legislation fail to do what it claims. but it would do many things that its authors are attempting to conceal. in reality. this legislation is designed to shield much of the health care industry from basic accountability for the care it provides. while those across the aisle like to talk about doctors. the real beneficiaries will be insurance companies and large health care corporations. this amendment would enrich them at the expense of the most seriously injured patients. men. women and children whose entire lives have been devastated by medical neglect and abuse. s. 22 would drastically limit the financial responsibility of the health care industry to compensate injured patients for the harm they have suffered. this legislation is extremely broad in its scope. it defines a \"health care liability claim\" as any claim \"based upon the provision of. use of. or payment foror the failure to provide. use. or pay forhealth care services.\" it is attempting to use the sympathetic family doctor as a trojan horse concealing an enormous array of special legal privileges for every corporation which provides a health care service. or insures the payment of a medical bill. for example. this proposal would shield hmos and health insurers that refuse to provide needed care. less accountability will never lead to better health care. every provision of this bill is carefully designed to take existing rights away from those who have been harmed by medical neglect and corporate greed. this legislation would deprive seriously injured patients of the right to recover fair compensation for their injuries by placing an arbitrary cap on how much they can receive for noneconomic loss. that is for the very real pain and suffering these victims experience every day. this cap only serves to hurt those patients who have suffered the most severe. lifealtering injuries and who have proven their cases in court. they are the paralyzed. the braininjured. and the blinded. they are the ones who have lost limbs. organs. reproductive capacity. and in some cases even years of life. these are lifealtering conditions which deprive a person of the ability to engage in many of the normal activities of day to day living. it would be terribly wrong to take their rights away. the bush administration talks about deterring frivolous cases. but caps by their nature apply only to the most serious cases which have been proven in court. a person with a severe injury is not made whole merely by receiving reimbursement for medical bills and lost wages. noneconomic damages compensate victims for the very real loss in quality of life that results from a serious. permanent injury. it is absurd to suggest that $250.000 is fair compensation for a person paralyzed for life. the sponsors of this bill claim that they have increased the cap from $250.000 to $750.000. but that claim is very misleading. the $250.000 limit would still apply to the overwhelming majority of malpractice victims. no matter how severe their injuries. the $750.000 limit would apply only to the small number of cases in which three different defendantsone doctor and two health care institutionswere all responsible for the victims injury. it would not even apply in cases where three doctors all committed malpractice. in reality. nothing has changed from prior republican bills. nearly all victims would still be prohibited from receiving more than $250.000 for their injuries. caps are totally arbitrary. they do not adjust the amount of the compensation ceiling with either the seriousness of the injury. or with the length of years that the victim must endure the resulting disability. someone with a less serious injury can be fully compensated without reaching the cap. however. a patient with severe. permanent injuries is prevented by the cap from receiving full compensation for their more serious injuries. is it fair to apply the same limit on compensation to a person who is confined to a wheelchair for life that is applied to someone with a temporary leg injury? caps discriminate against younger victims. a young person with a severe injury such as paralysis must endure it for many more years than an older person with the same injury. yet that young person is prohibited from receiving greater compensation for the many more years he will be disabled. is that fair? caps on noneconomic damages discriminate against women. children. minorities. and low income workers. these groups do not receive large economic damages attributable to lost earning capacity. women who are homemakers and caregivers for their families sustain no lost wages when they are injured. so they only receive minimal economic damages. should a woman working in the home receive less compensation for the same injury than a woman working outside the home? is that just? a seriously injured child may be confined to his or her home for years of painful recuperation. but that child has no lost wages. should he get less compensation than an adult with a similar injury? is that fair? noneconomic damagescompensation for lost quality of lifeis particularly important to these vulnerable populations. in addition to imposing caps. this legislation would place other major restrictions on seriously injured patients seeking to recover fair compensation. at every stage of the judicial process. it would change longestablished judicial rules to disadvantage patients and shield defendants from the consequences of their actions. first . it would abolish joint and several liability for all damages. this means the most seriously injured people may never receive all of the compensation that the court has awarded to them. they may not even receive full payment for their lost wages and medical bills. under this provision. health care providers whose misconduct contributed to the patients injuries will in many cases be able to escape responsibility for paying full compensation to that patient. second. the bias in the legislation could not be clearer. it would preempt state laws that allow fair treatment for injured patients. but would allow state laws to be enacted which contained greater restrictions on patients rights than the proposed federal law. this oneway preemption contained in section 11(c) shows how resultoriented the legislation really is. it is not about fairness or balance. it is about protecting defendants. third. the amendment preempts state statutes of limitation. cutting back the time allowed by many states for a patient to file suit against the health care provider who injured him. under the legislation. the statute of limitations can expire before the injured patient even knows that it was malpractice which caused his or her injury. fourth. it places severe limitations on when an injured patient can receive punitive damages. and how much punitive damages the victim can recover. under the bill. punitive damages can only be awarded if the defendant acted \"with malicious intent to injure\" or \"deliberately failed to avoid unnecessary injury.\" this is far more restrictive than current law. it entirely prohibits punitive damages for \"reckless\" and \"wanton\" misconduct. which the overwhelming majority of states allow. in the very small number of cases where punitive damages would still be allowed. the bill would cap them at twice the amount of economic damages. no matter how egregious the defendants conduct and no matter how large its assets. fifth. it imposes unprecedented limits on the amount of the contingent fee which a client and his or her attorney can agree tolimiting it to 15 percent of most of the recoveries. this will make it more difficult for injured patients to retain the attorney of their choice in cases that involve complex legal issues. it can have the effect of denying them their day in court. again the provision is one- sided. because it places no limit on how much the health care provider can spend defending the case. if we were to arbitrarily restrict the rights of seriously injured patients as the sponsors of this legislation propose. what benefits would result? certainly less accountability for health care providers will never improve the quality of health care. it will not even result in less costly care. the cost of medical malpractice premiums constitutes less than twothirds of 1 percent. 0.66 percent. of the nations health care expenditures each year. for example. in 2004. health care costs totaled $1.88 trillion. while the total cost of all medical malpractice insurance premiums was $11.4 billion. malpractice premiums are not the cause of the high rate of medical inflation. this bill will not make health care more affordable. the white house and other supporters of caps have argued that restricting an injured patients right to recover fair compensation will reduce malpractice premiums. but. there is scant evidence to support their claim. in fact. there is substantial evidence to refute it. between 2000 and 2003. there were dramatic increases in the cost of medical malpractice insurance in states that already had damage caps and other restrictive tort reforms on the statute books. as well as in states that did not. no substantial increase in the number or size of malpractice judgments suddenly occurred which would have justified the enormous increase in premiums that many doctors were being forced to pay. now rates have stabilized. again both in states with and states without damage caps. comprehensive national studies show that medical malpractice premiums are not significantly lower on average in states that have enacted damage caps and other restrictions on patient rights than in states without these restrictions. insurance companies are merely pocketing the dollars which patients no longer receive when \"tort reform\" is enacted. lets look at the facts. slightly more than half of the states have a cap on medical malpractice damages. many of them have had those statutes for a substantial number of years. the other half of states do not have a cap on malpractice damages. the best evidence of whether such caps affect the cost of malpractice insurance is to compare the rates in those two groups of states. based on data from the medical liability monitor on all 50 states. the average liability premium in 2005 for doctors practicing in states without caps on malpractice damages $45.719was actually lower than the average premium for doctors practicing in states with caps. $51.405. there are many reasons why insurance rates vary substantially from state to state. this data demonstrates that it is not a states tort reform laws which determine the rates. caps do not make a significant difference in the malpractice premiums which doctors pay. this is borne out by a comparison of premium levels for a range of medical specialties. the average liability premium in 2005 for doctors practicing internal medicine was more18.7 percent morefor doctors in states with caps on malpractice damages-$16.212than in states without caps on damages$13.658. internists actually pay more for malpractice insurance in states that have caps. the average liability premium in 2005 for general surgeons was more19.4 percent morefor doctors in states with caps-$57.662--than states without caps-$48.267. surgeons are paying more for malpractice insurance in the states that have caps. the average liability premium for ob/gyn physicians in 2005 in states with caps-$80.341was also more than for doctors in states without caps$75.233. ob/gyns in states with caps paid slightly more7 percent morethan in states without caps. clearly. a states tort laws do not determine that states medical malpractice insurance rates. this evidence demonstrates that capping malpractice damages does not benefit the doctors it purports to help. it only helps the insurance companies earn even bigger profits. as business week magazine concluded after reviewing the data at the height of the malpractice rate crisis \"the statistical case for caps is flimsy.\" in 2003. weiss ratings. inc.. a nationally recognized financial analyst. conducted an indepth examination of the impact of capping damages in medical malpractice cases. their conclusions sharply contradict the assumptions on which this legislation is based. weiss found that capping damages does reduce the amount of money that malpractice insurance companies pay out to injured patients. however. those savings are not passed on to doctors in lower premiums. the weiss report. stated: since the insurers in the states with caps reaped the benefit of lower medical malpractice payouts. one would expect that they would reduce the premiums they charged doctors. at the very minimum. they should have been able to slow down the premium increases. surprisingly. the data show they did precisely the opposite. between 1991 and 2002. the weiss analysis shows that premiums rose by substantially more in the states with damage caps than in the states without caps. the 12year increase in the median annual premium was 48.2 percent in the states that had caps. and only 35.9 percent in the states that had no caps. in the words of the report: on average. doctors in states with caps actually suffered a significantly larger increase than doctors in states without caps ... in short. the results clearly invalidate the expectations of cap proponents. since malpractice premiums are not significantly affected by the imposition of caps on recovery. it stands to reason that the availability of physicians does not differ between states that have caps and states that do not. ama data shows that there are 283 physicians per 100.000 residents in states that do not have medical malpractice caps and 249 physicians per 100.000 residents in states with caps. clearly there is no correlation. if a federal cap on noneconomic compensatory damages were to pass. it would sacrifice fair compensation for injured patients in a vain attempt to reduce medical malpractice premiums. doctors will not get the relief they are seeking. only the insurance companies. which created the problem. will benefit. insurance industry practices were responsible for the sudden dramatic premium increases which occurred in some states between 2000 and 2003. the explanation for these premium spikes can be found not in legislative halls or in courtrooms. but in the boardrooms of the insurance companies themselves. there were substantial increases in a number of insurance lines. not just medical malpractice. during that period. insurers make much of their money from investment income. interest earned on premium dollars is particularly important in medical malpractice insurance because there is a much longer period of time between receipt of the premium and payment of the claim than in most lines of casualty insurance. the industry creates a \"malpractice crisis\" whenever its investments do poorly. the combination of a sharp decline in the equity markets and record low interest rates several years ago was the reason for the sharp increase in medical malpractice insurance premiums during that period. what we witnessed then was not new. the industry has engaged in this pattern of behavior repeatedly over the last 30 years. when \"tort reform\" laws are enacted. the insurance companies pocket the resulting savings to bolster their profits. data from the national association of insurance commissioners shows that in 2005. the profits for the five largest forprofit medical malpractice insurers were more than double those of the fortune 500 average 17.7 percent v. 8.7 percent. doctors. especially those in high risk specialties. whose malpractice premiums have increased dramatically do deserve premium relief. that relief will only come as the result of tougher regulation of the insurance industry. when insurance companies lose money on their investments. they should not be able to recover those losses from the doctors they insure. unfortunately. that is what is happening now. doctors and patients are both victims of the insurance industry. excess profits from the boom years should be used to keep premiums stable when investment earnings drop. however. the insurance industry will never do that voluntarily. only by recognizing the real problem can we begin to structure an effective solution that will bring an end to unreasonably high medical malpractice premiums. there are specific changes in the law which should be made to address the abusive manner in which medical malpractice insurers operate. the first and most important would be to subject the insurance industry to the nations antitrust laws. it is the only major industry in america where corporations are free to conspire to fix prices. withhold and restrict coverage. and engage in a myriad of other anticompetitive actions. a medical malpractice \"crisis\" does not just happen. it is the result of insurance industry schemes to raise premiums and to increase profits by forcing antipatient changes in the tort law. i have introduced. with senator leary. legislation which will at long last require the insurance industry to abide by the same rules of fair competition as other businesses. unlike the harsh and ineffective proposals in s. 22. this is a real solution which will help physicians without further harming seriously injured patients. unfortunately. the republican leadership continues to protect their allies in the insurance industry and refuses to consider real solutions to the malpractice premium crisis. i want to conclude with a quotation from the analysis of medical malpractice premiums by weiss ratings. inc. weiss ratings is not speaking from the perspective of a trial lawyer or a patient advocate. but as a hardnosed financial analyst that has studied the facts of malpractice insurance rating. here is their recommendation to us based on those facts: first. legislators must immediately put on hold all proposals involving noneconomic damage caps until convincing evidence can be produced to demonstrate a true benefit to doctors in the form of reduced med mal costs. right now. consumers are being asked to sacrifice not only large damage claims. but also critical leverage to help regulate the medical professionall with the stated goal that it will end the med mal crisis for doctors. however. the data indicate that. similar state legislation has merely produced the worst of both worlds: the sacrifice by consumers plus a continuingand even worsening--crisis for doctors. neither party derived any benefit whatsoever from the caps. before yielding the floor. i want to briefly address the second malpractice bill. s. 23. that the republican leadership has brought before the senate. the only difference between them is that the first bill would take basic rights away from all patients. while the second bill takes those rights away only from women and newborn babies who are the victims of negligent obstetric and gynecological care. that difference does not make the latter bill more acceptable. on the contrary. it adds a new element of unfairness. the proponents argue that they are somehow doing these women and their babies a favor by depriving them of the right to fair compensation when they are seriously injured. it is an alice in wonderland argument which they are making. under their proposal. a woman whose gynecologist negligently failed to diagnose her cervical cancer until it had spread and become incurable would be denied the same legal right as a man whose doctor negligently failed to diagnose his prostate cancer until it was too late. is that fair? by what convoluted logic would that woman be better off? both the woman and the man were condemned to suffer a painful and premature death as a result of their doctors malpractice. but her compensation would be severely limited while his is not. she would be denied the right to introduce the same evidence of medical negligence which he could. she would be denied the same freedom to select the lawyer of her choice which he had. she would be denied the right to have her case tried under the same judicial rules which he could. that hardly sounds like equal protection of the law to me. yet. that is what the advocates of this legislation are proposing. of course. this bill does not only take rights away from women. it takes them away from newborn babies who sustain devastating prenatal injuries as well. these children face a lifetime with severe mental and physical impairments all because of an obstetricians malpractice. or misconduct by a health care provider or insurer. this legislation would limit the compensation those children can receive for lost quality of life to $250.000 in nearly all cases--just $250.000 for an entire lifetime. what could be more unjust? there are babies who suffered serious brain injuries at birth and will never be able to lead normal lives. there are women who lost organs. reproductive capacity. and in some cases even years of life. these are lifealtering conditions. it would be terribly wrong to take their rights away. the republicans talk about deterring frivolous cases. but caps by their nature apply only to the most serious cases which have been proven in court. these badly injured patients are the last ones we should be depriving of fair compensation. the entire premise of this bill is both false and offensive. our republican colleagues claim that women and their babies must sacrifice their fundamental legal rights in order to preserve access to ob/gyn care. that they must leave their rights at the door. the very idea is outrageous. for those localesmostly in sparsely populated areaswhere the availability of ob/gyn specialists is a problem. there are far less drastic ways to solve it. this bill is based on the false premise that the availability of ob/gyn physicians depends on the enactment of draconian tort reforms. if that were accurate. states that have already enacted damage caps would have a higher number of obigyns providing care. however. there is in fact no correlation. states without caps actually have 29.1 ob/gyns per 100.000 women. while states with caps have 25.5 ob/gyns per 100.000 women. states without caps actually have more ob/gyns serving their female population. this is not a more acceptable bill because it applies only to women and newborn babies injured by obstetrical and gynecological malpractice. that makes it even more arbitrary. even more outrageous. not one victim should be denied the basic rights that this bill would take away. i urge my colleagues to oppose both of these very unfair bills."},{"1":"2005","2":"JOHNSON","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. today the senate is poised to pass the energy policy act of 2005. the most sweeping comprehensive energy bill in over a decade. we need a comprehensive set of policies to attack the energy crunch facing americans on multiple fronts. electricity systems on the west coast are strained as electrical transmission lines lack capacity and interconnection to move power throughout regions. the dependence of our economy on foreign sources of energy continues to climb unabated. with close to 60 percent of the oil used to power the economy originating from foreign ports and oil fields. as a member of the senate energy and natural resources committee and as member of the conference committee charged with hammering out an agreement. i have steered my colleagues in the house and in the senate to look towardthe heartland asa rich land ready to contribute to our energy security. the energy policy act of 2005 incorporates many of the ideas i have long championed to spring forward south dakota and the great plains as a key future energy producer. first and foremost. the energy policy act of 2005 establishes a robust renewable fuel standard that will lessen imports of foreign sources of energy and encourage the use of cleanburning renewable fuels. beginning in 2006. the energy bill establishes a robust renewable fuels standard requiring refiners to blend 4 billion gallons of renewable fuels. such as ethanol and biodiesel. that standard vould be increased -over the next several years until 2012. when refiners would be required to blend a total of 7.5 billion gallons of renewable fuels. just in south dakota alone. over 8000 farm families are invested in ethanol facilities through direct deliveries of corn or in more indirect paths. such as equity shares. the nations economy will get a significant and positive boost from enactment of the rfs. there are several other provisions in the bill that bring south dakotas strength to solving the nations energy challenges. key tax incentives included in the final version of the energy bill extend the tax credit for small ethanol producers and expand the eligibility of that credit to plants with an annual capacity of up to 60 million gallons is a major victory. the conference report also provides incentives for biodiesel. ethanol is not the only renewable fuel that can be produced in the united states soybeanbased biodiesel holds great promise for use in the nations fuel supply. we focused also on tapping wind energy resources by extending for 2 additional years the production tax credit for wind energy facilities. the production tax credit is a tool used by developers of wind energy projects. such as the wind energy farm near highmore. sd. .one final tax provision that i feel holds particular promise is the authorization of $800 million in tax credit bonds to finance the construction of renewable energy projects by notforprofit utilities and rural electric cooperatives. i have heard from dozens of electric cooperative and municipal utilities that want to undertake the construction of wind energy projects. however. until this bill. these nonprofit entities were excluded from some of the incentives provided for investorowned utilities pursuing similar renewable energy projects. now. rural cooperatives can finance. construct. and operate clean energy projects. such as wind turbines and geothermal facilities. the conference report does not include what i believe is an important provision to set benchmarks and targets for producing electricity from renewable energy resources. like a renewable fuels standard. a renewable portfolio standard would not only reduce the use of fossil fuel sources. but increase economic activity in south dakota through wind energy and biomass projects. a modest renewable portfolio standard of 5 or 10 percent is achievable and can be done without increasing retail electricity rates. the benefits of balancing traditional energy sources. such as coal. nuclear. and natural gas. with new technologies will reduce air emissions and spur the creation of jobs in developing energy technology sectors. i include clean coal technologies. such as integrated gasification combinedcycle as an. emerging clean coal technology that along with wind and geothermal plants hold the promise of producing cleanburning electricity. as congress and the states and cities move forwar on addressing the energy challenges of the 21st century. policymakers and industry leaders can lose sight and leave behind developing renewable energy sources. as the nation and world strain finite fossil fuel resources the need to bring online these technologies will only become more acute and practical. i intend to vote for the energy po1icy act of 2005. as a member of the senate energy and natural resources committee. i am proud of the job we did in fashioning a bill that will make strong strides forward in tackling the disparate parts of energy supply. transmission. and distribution. the bill also holds strong promise for making south dakota a substantial energy producer of clean energy and renewable fuels. i urge my colleagues to support the energy policy act of 2005."},{"1":"2004","2":"INHOFE","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"understands he did yeomans work. as we speak. the house is talking about a bill bigger than ours. they criticized president eisenhower for a bill being too big and they criticize us for a bill being too big. in my opinion. the bill is too small. part of the reason for president eisenhowers bill. the interstate highway system. has been completed. we have many more different responsibilities now than we had then. in recent years. we have done some very good work with highway transportation. going back to 1982 when i first came to washington. we had the surface transportation assistance act. this bill established the mass transit account. the highway trust fund. the reason that became important was. people came to the realization that for every vehicle we keep off our highway system. it saves money. it was determined that it would be good if we became partners with the mass transit folks and worked together on legislation. that was what we did in 1982 and that is what we are doing now. that is why it is such good news that the banking. housing. and urban affairs committee. that handles mass transit. has agreed on a proposal. senator inhofe. senator jeffords. and i met today with the chairman of the finance committee and the ranking member of the finance committee. senators grassley and baucus. and they have agreed to that. that is really important. that started back in 1982. at that time. there was an 85 percent minimum return provision. that means for every dollar put into the highway trust fund in a state such as north carolina. there was a guarantee they would get at least 85 percent of the money they put in. some states got more than that. but 1982 was the first time there was a minimum return provision. one of the controversies in that bill was an increase in the federal gas tax from 4 to 9 cents per gallon. it was a good bill and passed. in 1987. 5 years later. we had a bill called the surface transportation and uniform reallocation assistance act. it was not a very sexy name but it got the point across. it increased the speed limit. which was so important for states such as nevada. from 55 miles per hour to a higher speed. it worked out well and we hope that continues to be ok. in a state such as nevada800 miles from the top to bottom. 500 miles across--you need to be able to travel in a safe manner on an interstate highway system faster than 55 miles per hour. it also included a provision requiring states to spend a specified minimum amount for environmental purposes. that was the first time the highway bill had really taken that into consideration. so that was important. congress felt so strongly about this that president reagan vetoed this bill. it was overridden by the house and the senate. that does not happen very often. but the presiding officer. who was part of the administration during that time. recalls that. in 1991. we had the intermodal surface transportation efficiency act. istea. that is where the name comes fromistea. this created the congestion mitigation and air quality. cmaq. program. which has been a program that the environmentalists love. and some who are not as environmentally sensitive do not like it. but these programs were established then and dealt with air quality. with the interstate system largely complete. as i indicated earlier. istea shifted the federal program from capital construction to focus on people and the movement of goods. this is where senator moynihan was so good. it also expanded the transportation decisionmaking process to include local officials. stakeholders. and citizens. and that passed. it seems as if it was just a short time ago when. in june of 1988. we passed tea21. the transportation equity act for the 21st century. this continued the basic policy structure established in istea. it dramatically increased funding of the federal surface transportation program and established important budgetary protections or firewalls to guarantee highway and transportation spending. and. for the first time since 1982. we increased the minimum return to 90.5 percent. which was very important. i also want to make sure the record is clear from this senators perspective of the contributions to highways and transit. and basically good government. that came from john chafee. i have been so fortunate. i worked through all these bills that i have talked about. and i have had the very good fortune to work with senator stafford. as chairman of the committee. the great senator from vermont. senator moynihan for a short time. senator baucus. senator chafee. and these men set a high level that we who are now trying to move this bill must meet. but senator chafee was such a good friend to me personally. he did so many things to help me in my political career. even though he was a member of the other party. he went out of his way to always try to make me look good. i will always be indebted to him and his family. and that includes lincoln. for all the good things that senator chafee did for me. even though i was closer to senator moynihan than i was to senator chafee. i felt such a kinship to senator chafee and cared a good deal about him. and his imprint is also on this legislation. senator moynihan could not have done much of what he did without senator chafes working with him. this bill we have before the senate is good legislation. it is imperfect. this legislation that is before this body is imperfect legislation. but it is the best we could do. for 50 states. having a formula that you put into a computer and do your computer run which comes out as good as this one says a lot for the great work of our staffs. as senator inhofe has said. i would like to do different things in this bill. if i had been the person dictating what was in this bill. it would be different than what we have in it. but. frankly. i am down the totem pole. you have the chairman and ranking member and the subcommittee chairman and then me. but i did have some input in this measure. i think what we have come up with. as i indicated. is far from being perfect. but i think it is good legislation. and that is what legislation is all about. legislation is the art of compromise. i have been fortunate that a number of measures i have introduced are now law in this great country. i have never ever gotten everything i wanted. everything that is now law that i introduced had to be changed. anyone who is of the mind that they are going to get what they introduced is wrong because it just does not happen. i have never known it to happen. this legislation we have been given by the two leaders we have 2 weeks to finish. if we do not finish it in 2 weeks. i am sorry to say what might happen. what might happen is this bill will be pulled. and we will have to extend the highway program for a year. that does not help any state. no state is helped with that program. every state gets hurt. so we have to move and move quickly on this bill. at the birth of the interstate system. safety and the efficient movement of people and goods framed the national transportation debate. fifty years later. as president eisenhower indicated. that is still the talk. the same speech. you could give the eisenhower speech today on the floor of the senate. and if we did not tell you it was 50 years old. you would think it was being given by someone who wrote it today. fifty years- after president eisenhowers interstate highway system. safety and efficiency remain our foremost objectives. this year. traffic congestion will cost americans more than $67 billion in lost time and productivity67 billion in lost time and productivityand it will waste almost 6 billion gallons of fuel. i cannot imagine 6 billion gallons of fuel. i do not know where you would put all that. but that is how much is wasted. which only increases our dependence on foreign oil. as for safety. traffic accidents last year killed 42.000 people. we can reduce the toll of traffic congestion. we can save lives by making our highways safer. we have a responsibility to keep working on these problems and to find meaningful solutions. the bill currently before this body represents a major commitment to maintain and improve our national transportation infrastructure. it also creates jobs. again. there has been controversy over there not being enough jobs created during the 3 years that president bush has been president. those people who are trying to damage this bill should understand this legislation will create hundreds of thousands of jobs. some say as many as 2 million jobs. the majority leader of the senate was here today. and he said for every $1 billion we spend in this highway bill. $2 billion will be created by other things. the offshoot of this legislation. we know for every $1 billion we spend on infrastructure development. 47.000 highpaying jobs are created. we know that. and these are well paid. skilled jobs for americans. this bill is also a referendum on improving our quality of life. no other measure will we debate in this congress that has the potential to so dramatically impact every facet of our everyday lives. i thank my colleagues. the entire committee. but especially senator jeffords. senator inhofe. and senator bond for working to craft a bipartisan package that continues the intermodal legacy of its predecessors. istea and tea21. our proposal does not make dramatic changes to the core program structure because it does not need to. the groundwork has already been laid. during a years worth of reauthorization hearings. the committee learned that the basic structure does work. this package refines and improves the current program to ensure that our investments have the maximum impact on improving our surface transportation system. nevada is the fastest growing state in the union and has been for more than a decade. clark countythat is where las vegas is locatedhas experienced the bulk of that growth. this growth represents unique challenges but also opportunities. the bill before the senate provides resources and programs that encourage the effective management and operation of our nations transportation system. the continued success of that system is essential to fast growing metropolitan areas such as clark county. where traffic congestion and air quality are serious issues. this legislation also places a renewed emphasis on safety by consolidating the various safety initiatives spread through the federal highway program into new core safety programs. one of the aspects we have worked on includes something called the safe routes to school initiative. it was felt that we wanted to do everything we could to have kids walk to school. ride bicycles to school. why do they have to have a bus pick them up and drop them off at their door? one of the things we are doing is creating safer routes for children. if they want to use a bike or walk. we have bike paths and sidewalks. this is important because. for example. in clark county. we have opened. in the last 2 years. 18 schools a year. a total of 36 schools. by opening one new school a month we cant keep up with the growth in clark county. we have high schools that are approaching 5.000 kids. so the safer routes to school program will help promote healthy living by making it safer for children to walk or ride to school on bikes. not cars and buses. i am pleased this package moves the nations surface transportation program forward without jeopardizing our natural environment. one of the things we did in this bill. which was difficult. states have complained about. originally back before 1982. some states were barely getting 80 percent of what they put into these trust funds. we moved it to 85. 90.5. and now with this bill. the formula now before the senate. every state. by the end of this legislation. will get 95 percent of what they put in. that is very difficult. it goes without saying that some of the states who were getting more than a dollar in years past. a lot of them continue to get more than a dollar. but some of them dont. the state of nevada. under this formula. gets less than a dollar. but in fairness. the formula is a formula. it wouldnt have been right for the formula to be any different for me than it is for others. so this is fair. we have made it so every state at the end of this bill will get at least 95 percent. in this legislation every state will get a percentage increase. this legislation is not perfect. but it is about as fair as we could do. i have worked with my staff the last 4 or 5 days to say. could you come up with something. i had a few problems with the legislation. come up with something. i will talk to senator inhofe because we might have a formula that may be better. we couldnt come up with one. i wish we could have. but we couldnt. but what we have done here is the best we could do. the vast majority of the states will do extremely well compared to what they did in the past. as with any compromise. this is not perfect. it is inevitable that some states will not be completely satisfied with the results. but it is important to note every state benefits from the growth in this program. we worked hard to create a funding mechanism that allows all 50 states plus the district of columbia to benefit from program growth while addressing several competing fundraising priorities: donor versus donee. old versus new. urban versus rural. these have all been put in this formula. and we have come up with what is as fair as we think we can do. the bill before us accomplishes that goal. once more. let me emphasize. every state benefits from the growth in the program. so again. i extend my appreciation to my colleaguesthe chairman of the subcommittee. the chairman of the full committee. and senator jeffords. the ranking memberfor the good work they have done. we are all going to have to be vigilant. i hope those who want to change the bill come here and offer amendments. i hope they do it as soon as possible. we hope to get to this bill tomorrow. we are hopeful and confident the motion to proceed should be overwhelmingly approved. i cant imagine anyone voting against this. i was told by the person who asked me to object on their behalf on the motion to proceed that that senator was concerned about the transit portion of the bill. that has been taken care of. the chairmen of the two committees have signed off on this. i hope we can move forward on this very quickly. again. i am glad we are here. what we do on this legislation will set a tone for the rest of this legislative year. i hope we can permit it. i should be more confident. like the players in the super bowl and the coaches: we are going to finish this legislation."},{"1":"2003","2":"BRADY","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr.

raising some concerns about the present situation in which the united states finds itself in terms of its relationships around the world. and as we all know. we are about to begin the debate on one of the most serious. perhaps more. in fact. the most serious topic that can ever confront this or any legislative body. and that is. whether or not we should commit the young men and women of this nation who have valiantly volunteered their services to the defense of the nation. whether we should commit them into harms way in a faroff land in a war that could certainly become cata-. strophic in its dimensions. we do not know. of course. how to plan for its outcome except to say that we do know that it will be fought. if. in fact. we engage in this thing. it will be fought by brave men and women who have always. as the president said. made us proud. if we commit those precious resources to the task at hand. the task that was laid out by the gentleman from colorado . then it appears to me we must do everything humanly possible. everything humanly possible to protect and defend them in their duty and to protect and defend the people of the united states of america. that is. after all. our primary responsibility. our raison detre. our reason for being. the federal government has assumed many responsibilities over the years since the constitution was written. and we have assumed those responsibilities sometimes. i think. without regard to what constitutional restraints were so clearly identified by the founding fathers. we are involved in innumerable activities. programs and sponsorships that were never. ever contemplated by -the framers of the constitution. but the one thing that we must carefully consider is the responsibility that we were given to protect and defend the people and the property of the united states of america. i can be persuaded by the gentleman from colorados arguments that our interests. our vital interests do. in fact. demand that we take a preemptive strike. i should say that we take preemptive action in iraq. i can be persuaded that that is possiblythe case. i must admit. however. that i need more information personally to cast a vote about which i have absolutely no misgivings if i am going to bevoting to send sons and daughters off. to war because i. i am sure like hopefully most of -our colleagues in this body. will consider this in the following fashion. do i believe personally that this problem we face. that the threat that we face in the united states is so great that i am willing to send my son off to war. not just vote to send someone elses son or daughter. but am i willing to do so myself? this is a very high standard. and it is one that i believe every single member must establish for themselves. and i can be persuaded that it is necessary to do so. i must say that in this deliberation. there is something that is being left out. when people. even the president of the united states. says things like we will do everything necessary to defend the interests of this country. i like hearing it. i want to believe it. i want to believe that we will. in fact. do everything necessary to protect country. and while that might very well be to send men and women to iraq. or places far flung all over the world. it is also completely logical. selfevident. that what we must do even before we do that in order to protect and defend the people of this country. what we must do is to defend our own borders. and this. i suggest. has not been done and is not being contemplated. over my august district work period i went to the borders and went to the southern and northern borders of the country. i first went to arizona and then on to california where i observed firsthand the problems that we face on those borders. and let me say. mr. speaker. that the face of illegal immigration into this country. people coming across our borders without our permission or without our knowledge. the face of illegal immigration in my district. in littleton. colorado. perhaps the chairs in arkansas. but the face of illegal immigration in my district is one of a benign activity for the most part. people working menial jobs. for the most part in restaurants and landscaping activities. and people we say to ourselves. well. yes. they are here illegally. but after all. they are just trying to make a living. the face of illegal immigration on the border. on our borders with mexico and on our borders with canada. that face is much. much uglier. that is the face of drug smuggling. of murder and of people coming into this country for the purposes of doing us great harm. that is what we see when we actually go to the border before it becomes diffuse throughout the land. i visited the tohono oodham indian reservation where they are under siege. and i mean that in the most literal definition of the term. they are under siege. the tohono 0odham indians have a 76mile border coterminous with mexico. across that 76mile border come 1.500 illegal aliens a day. and they are not just people coming for the good life. they are not just people coming to work at some sort of menial task in the united states. a task that \"no american will take\" and send their money back home. in this case to mexico for the most part. they are coming into the united states. many. in fact. perhaps even a majority. of the people coming across that border a day. 1.500 a day. it is estimated that well over 1.000 are involved with the drug trade and they are bringing with them literally tons of illegal drugs every single day. they have. in fact. put this indian reservation into thestatus of being a captive nation. they have taken over two of the small communities in this reservation. when i say taken over. what i mean by that. i mean that they have threatened or coerced or bribed or addicted so many people in these two communities that they are essentially now nothing more than extensions of the drug trafficking of several mexican cartels. [] 2145 i met with people who told me that they are afraid to go out on their street at night. that they cannot let their children out. i saw 5yearolds who were stoned. who had been given drugs. their parents had been given drugs in order to coerce them and/or entice them. is perhaps the better word in this case. into becoming part of the drug trafficking network established by these cartels. i saw the devastation to this particular indian reservation. they are begging for help. as they say. their way of life is being destroyed. the vandalism. the robbery. the rapes. the incidence of all these things has gone up dramatically. just one aspect. the trash alone that is hauled in and discarded by 1.500 people a day coming into their reservation is enormous. where. may i ask. is the sierra club when we need them? where are the friends of the earth? where are all of the people who decry the devastation of our. of the natural habitats around the country and around the world? this nations natural habitat. their ecology is being destroyed by illegal immigrants coming across that border. hundreds of thousands of plastic water bottles. clothing. trash of every kind and description. discarded everywhere along their path. people racing through their communities. either trying to escape the border patrol agents or simply trying to make their way north have endangered the lives of their children so that they do not allow their kids to go outside and play. what i have just described. mr. speaker. is the face of illegal immigration on the border. one of the things that they told us when we were down there is that it is not just mexican nationals coming across now. but a dramatic increase. they have witnessed. in what they refer to as otms. or other than mexicans. a dramatic increase in the number of chinese coming through. a dramatic increase in the number of asians from countries all over that part of the world. a dramatic number of middle easterners coming through. for what purpose. i would ask? does anyone think these people are coming across in order to get landscaping jobs? are the middle easterners that are coming across that border illegally looking to work in restaurants as dishwashers. cooks andservers? in my own state. and in my own city. the biggest gang element is asian. and they are quite predominantly illegals. but beyond that. what. we may ask. i think. are the middle easterners coming in for? what are they doing here? why are they coming in illegally through mexico? now. i suggest that there is a great possibility that they are coming in for purposes that are heinous. i do not know that. i have not been able to interview them because. of course. they come through without the slightest bit of intervention on our part. we do not stop them. we cannot stop them because we have no resources in place to do so. and even when we do stop them. even when they are interdicted farther inland. farther up into the united states. and when the ins is called and told we have a lot of people here in a van. in a truck. in a house. we have a lot of people here who are here illegally. the ins tells the local law enforcement agents. let them go. we do not have time. we do not have time. twentyfive illegal aliens were caught in a tractortrailer truck in dallas on july 27. the ins initially detained several.then released even these and \"paroled them\" into the united states. they have an automatic parole process. the ins can do this. the ins can say we will parole these people we have just caught. let them go. and then we will sena them a letter later on telling them to report for their deportation hearing. now. this would be laughable. of course. if it were not so dangerous. this is a saturday night live skit. \"here is your letter. we know you have snuck into the united states. so please report in 6 months to the following location for your deportation hearing.\" right. \"thank you. of course. i will.\" they actually call these letters \"run letters.\" what they mean by that is that when the people receive them. of course they run. they go away. they do not go back to their country of origin. they run into american society. now. if we are so concerned about the possibility of a terrorist attack on the united states. which is the only thing we have heard again and again and again from the leadership. from members of congress who support our efforts. support the president in his desire to depose saddam hussein. if we are so concerned about that. and believe me. i am. then why would we not take just as much. no. not just as much. why would we not take even more care and concern about our own national borders? on august 4 in rogers county. oklahoma. state troopers caught seven aliens who admitted they were illegally present in the country. the ins again would not pick them up and remove them. during the memorial day weekend in new york the ins reportedly \"did not want to be bothered.\" so they refused to take custody of several mid eastern illegal aliens. local police officers had caught them at the brooklyn battery tunnel during a terror alert. i remember this incident. mr. speaker. they actually had these people in custody. these were mid eastern illegal aliens. they called the ins. it was memorial day weekend. and so the called was routed from new york. because no one was at their workstation. it was routed to vermont. where the person answering said to the police in new york city. \"let them go.\" these are just a few of the literally hundreds. if not thousands. of cases like this that i could relate to the body tonight. with all of the talk about the need to increase our efforts of vigilance and be careful about things we see and things we hear. with all of that. and with all of the efforts being made now to extend the war against terrorism beyond afghanistan and into other parts of the middle east. it is amazing to me. it is incredible to me. and it should be to every single member of this body. that we leave our own borders undefended. does anyone believe for even a second that should we prosecute this war in a more aggressive fashion than is presently the situation that there will not be some reaction on the part of the people. specifically saddam hussein and al qaeda and fundamentalist islam? we are told that if we go into iraq. we must be concerned about the ramifications throughout the middle east. that perhaps other countries with governments more friendly to the united states may fall as a result of having internal dissent because the phenomenon of fundamentalist islam is so pervasive in these countries. we are told that that is what we must watch out for. what we must be careful of. but we are not told. and there is no precaution being made right now. for our own security within this nation. we know there will be a reaction. what will that reaction be? does anybody think it will simply be confined to the middle east? now. everyone knows. certainly saddam hussein knows. that he cannot win in a conventional war against the united states. he can make it bloody. he can make it ugly. but he cannot win. he knows that. the world knows that. what makes us think for a moment that we will be left unscathed in the united states if we embark upon this path of action in the middle east? certainly the possibility exists that al qaeda agents. that fundamentalist islam will react in a way so as to increase the number of people that they already have in the united states. the cells that are operating here. that we are told by our justice department are operating. that are here in the united states and are ready to go into action at a moments notice. we know there are cells operating in canada. we know there are cells operating in mexico. why is it not the most logical thing for us to say. well. we have to be careful here. before we even go into iraq. we must secure our borders. the reason. i fear. mr. speaker. that we do not do that is because. as governor ridge said. right there in the well of the house. to a question posed to him from. i think. this microphone about his reluctance and the reluctance on the part of the administration. and in fact most of the congress. i suppose. no. i should qualify that. because the house has in fact passed an* amendment to the defense authorization bill allowing for the military to be used on the border. and we have done that year after year after year. but it has failed in the other body. but when asked why we have not used all of our resources to defend our borders. including the military. governor ridge said there are political and cultural reasons why we cannot do so. well. there may be political and cultural prices to pay. i do not even know what he meant by cultural reasons. i do know what he meant by political reasons. we are concerned that if we in fact secure our borders and prevent people from coming into the united states illegally. we will in some way or other jeopardize our relationship with the government of mexico and that we will simultaneously lose votes from mexican americans who somehow feel that this is a personal affront if we try to defend our own borders. mr. speaker. i do not believe that for a moment. i do not believe mexicanamericans are any less concerned about the safety of themselves and their families than any other group of americans. i believe that a case can be made to them and to every single person in the united states as to why it is imperative that we secure our own borders. i believe we can do that. i believe that we will benefit as a result in terms of the politics. but whether we do or do not benefit politically. who cares. is it not our absolute and total responsibility to do so? there are cultural and political reasons why we cannot defend our own borders. i wonder how if there is another event of some great magnitude. which we all anticipate. which we hear every single day is a distinct not just possibility but probability. and if this is perpetuated by someone who has entered this country illegally. and/or people who have been recruited into a terrorist network by people who have come here illegally. i wonder what we will tell the spouses. the sons. the daughters of those people who are killed in that event. we will make many. many speeches about how heroic their loved ones were. how heroic the efforts were of the people who tried to save them. will we also say. i wonder. that there were political and cultural reasons why we could not protect them? i do not know how anyone could look into the faces of the people whose loved ones have been lost in an event of that nature and say those words. but say them we would have to if we follow the path we are on today. the president has just submitted an action plan in which he calls for smart borders. and there is quite a lengthy list of things the administration has proposed: biometric identifiers. permanent resident cards. single alternative inspection systems. refugee and asylum processing reforms. handling of refugee asylum claims. visa policy coordination. air preclearance. advanced passenger information. joint passenger analysis. a lot of stuff about customs and how to bring goods into the united states. and i applaud them all. i do not for a moment suggest that these are not good and salutary measures to take. but i look in here. i look in vain for the most important measure we can take to create a smart border. and that is to put the military in place to defend that border. right now we cannot do that. we cannot do it with the border patrol. they are inhibited from actually achieving the goals of securing our borders by .the fact the administration. the ins. is incompetent and completely unmotivated to act in this particular capacity. they are restricted by a myriad of laws we have passed here. confusing. conflicting laws. allowing for people to be retained in this country even after they have been found to be here illegally. we have refused to provide the resources necessary to actually secure the borders for one reason and one reason only: because it is politically and culturally unacceptable. well. i do not know who it is culturally unacceptable -to. i do not know who it is politically unacceptable to. but those are not legitimate reasons for abandoning our own defenses. and no matter how much we do in the middle east. no matter how many resources we put into accomplishing the goal of deposing saddam hussein. no matter what we do around the world to increase the number of countries that would be categorized as democracies rather than dictatorships. we will be at every step of the way in that process putting our own people in greater and greater danger if we do not do everything possible to secure our borders. i. of course. cannot promise even if we do everything i have asked for. even if we completely reform the ins. even if we give border patrol agents greater authority and ability to actually do their job. even if we put military on the border. i cannot promise that someone with malicious intent cannot or will not get through. but at least i can say we did everything we can do. which is living up to the presidents admonition to us. that we must do everything that we can do. that includes defending our own border. what an amazing world we live in. what an interesting and incredible dilemma we face. we are told every day that it is a war that we are in. a war for our own survival. that americas way of life is at stake. what nation can we think of in history that knowing that that is the situation they face. have not in fact done the most obvious thing to try to protect themselves? what this demands is leadership. it demands that the president of the united states tell the people of the united states what needs to be done. even if there is a political price to pay. mr. speaker. i suggest that it would not be a negative reaction politically. i suggest that the people of this country are yearning for and desiring him to establish the exact nature of the conflict and also the exact way in which we are going to defend against it. they are hoping that he will say to them that we will in fact secure our borders. and this may mean that we will not have the opportunity to hire cheap labor or recruit people into a political party as new voters. but nonetheless. it has to be done. along with all of the other things that have been outlined by the president. with which i agree and for which i commend him. the border must be secured. i ask. no. i beg the president of the united states to use his power. to use his executive authority to do just that: protect our borders. order the military to the border. allow us to use the expertise and the technology and the manpower we have available to us on our first line of defense. i mentioned that i went recently to the mexican border. but i also shortly thereafter went to the canadian border. a little town called bonners ferry. idaho. where i witnessed a very interesting activity. at the time i got there. there were 100 marines stationed there just to see whether or not they could in fact coordinate their activities and help the border patrol and the u.s. forest service and the customs agency control the northern border because i assure members. although i have spent a great deal of time talking about the southern borders. i assure members that the problems are just as large on the northern borders. there are over 20.000 muslims living in calgary. canada. which brings into the united states component parts of methamphetamines. they are sold and the proceeds go back to -the muslim groups in canada. and the money is used to finance terrorist activities throughout the world. osama bin laden. because of canadas peculiar process of establishing who is or is not a refugee. osama bin laden could land in ontario. claim he is omar the tent maker. not show any identification. and walk immediately into canadian society. and. of course. shortly thereafter walk unfettered probably into the united states. the problems up there are significant. so there are 100 marines. and i do not know the genesis of the stationing of these people on that border. i do not know if it was part of a larger strategy or not. but they were using three uavs. unmanned aerial vehicles. more often commonly referred to as drones. and a couple of radar stations that were to help identify people coming across that border illegally. it worked. the marines told me that it was the best training they had ever received because it was real time. real bad guys. and very difficult terrain. we need the resources of the military. we do not have to put people arm in arm along 4.000 or 5.000 miles of border. we have the technology to aid in this. i saw it with my own eyes. it can work. we can make our borders very secure. not perfect but much more difficult to cross illegally than is presently the case. we can do it. the only thing we do not have is the will to do it. we unfortunately create a facade. a potemkin village. prince potemkin used to put up facades along the villages in his area and when catherine the great would sail down the river. she would see these beautiful villages. but behind these facades. of course. it was abject poverty. that is where the phrase potemkin village comes from. in a way that is what we have created or we have tried to create on the borders. we have increased the number of border patrol. we have established something called smart borders. we have told americans that we are doing what is necessary to defend our borders. but it is nothing more than the creation of a potemkin village along the borders. they are just facades. they are not true defense mechanisms. because what we are trying to do is to pretend to the american people that we are taking our responsibility of border defense seriously while at the same time assuring that people can come through illegally in order to. quote. take the jobs that no one else will take and in order to increase the ranks of political parties in the united states that benefit as a result of massive immigration. one particular political party. of course. the democratic party. and the fear that if we actually got tough on the borders. there would be a political reaction. and there would be certainly outcries by immigration advocacy groups. especially immigration lawyers. they would raise cain. but is our responsibility here to pander to those political extremists? or is our responsibility to protect and defend the people and the property of the united states of america? again what a strange world we live in. whereby we can be talking about going off to war. recognizing all of the danger that that entails for the people we are sending but also for the people who are here. the people who remain. and not do anything to protect us. what an amazing situation. mr. speaker. i hope and pray that our words. our admonitions. our concerns will be heeded by our other colleagues and by the administration. the stakes are so high. the risks are so great that we cannot possibly avoid doing what is right even at our own political peril should that be the case which. as i say. i do not believe for a moment would happen. but even if it did. that is what is required of us here. to do the right thing. even if it is politically or culturally problematic."},{"1":"2001","2":"MURKOWSKI","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"madam president. i rise today to introduce legislation which will facilitate and promote the successful commercial reuse of the former naval air facility on adak island. ak . at the same time. this legislation will allow the aleut people of alaska to reclaim the island and to make use of its modern infrastructure and important location. the legislation i introduce today is very similar to a bill i introduced nearly four years ago in the 105th congress. it ratifies an agreement between the aleut corporation. an alaska native regional corporation. the department of the interior and the department of the navy. in 1997. the aleut corporation. the u.s. navy and the interior department were still in the process of negotiating and structuring the agreement to provide for the fair and responsible transfer of the former military facility. i am pleased to tell you that \"the agreement concerning the conveyance of property at the adak naval complex. adak ak\" was signed last september. -thus. the time is now appropriate for congress to consider the agreement and ratify its provisions to allow for final transfer. the bill and the agreement also further the conservation of important wildlife habitat within the aleutian islands region of alaska. a portion of adak is within the aleutian islands subunit of the alaska maritime national wildlife refuge. the agreement facilitates the department of the inferiors continued management and protection of the refuge lands on adak and even adds some of the navy lands to the refuge. more importantly. in exchange for the developed navy lands. which are not suitable for the refuge but are commercially useful. the aleut corporation will convey environmentally sensitive lands it holds elsewhere in the refuge to the department of the interior. thus. not only are the former military lands put to productive use. but the refuge gains valuable new habitat. for many years the navy has played an important role in alaskas aleutian chain. its presence was first established during world war ii with the selection and development of the island because of adaks ability to support a major airfield and its natural and protected deep water port. the navys presence contributed greatly to the defense of our pacific coast during world war ii and throughout the cold war. through the navys presence. adak became the largest development in the aleutians as well as alaskas sixth largest community. with the end of the cold war our defense needs changed. however. and adak was selected for closure during the last base closure round. those very same features that made adak strategically important for defense purposes also make it important for commercial purposes. adak is a natural stepping stone to asia and is at the crossroads of air and sea trade between north america. \"europe and asia. with the ability to use adak commercially. the aleut people. through the aleut corporation. can establish it asan important intercontinental location with sufficient enterprise to provide year round jobs for the aleut people. these goals are consistent with the promises and the alaska native claims settlement act. the legislation that created the corporation. this rebirth of adak is already well underway. the local aleut kesidents assumed responsibility for the operation of the island from the navy last october and there are a number of new commercial enterprises and endeavors. at the same time a new community has begun to take shape. just last month the new city of adak was established asa result of a public referendum and it is now in the process of taking over responsibility for the docks. utilities. roads and other public facilities. the agreement resolves a number of important issues related to the transfer of this former military base and the establishment of the new community on adak. including responsibility for environmental remediation. institutional controls. indemnification. required public access and reservation of lands for government use. the environmental remediation work of the navy is still ongoing and will continue to an extent for several more years. however. all the interested parties agree that a final transfer can occur within the next twelve months. hence the need for this legislation. this bill furthers our nations objective of conversion of closed defense facilities into successful commercial reuse. it benefits the aleut people and restores them to their ancestral lands and it benefits the national wildlife refuge system. i believe everyone will agree that such legislation is important and worthy of our support. by mr. lugar: s. 1326. a bill to extend and improve working lands and other conservation programs administered by the secretary of agriculture. to the committee on agriculture. nutrition. and forestry. mr. lugar.madam president. i rise today to introduce the working lands conservation act. the bill is intended to achieve two major goals: first. to assist our farmers and ranchers in meeting shortterm environmental challenges. such as water and air quality concerns and the regulation of animal feeding operations. and. secondly. to enhance the longterm quality of our environment and sustainability of our natural resources. as some of my colleagues may recall. the senate agriculture committee has a long history of bipartisan cooperation on conservation. from the conservation reserve. to the wetlands reserve. to the environmental quality incentives program. we have conscientiously sought to do what is best for our nations environment. we have laid aside partisan differences when it has come to conservation and our natural resources are better because of our joint efforts. in that spirit. my bill joins those of several of my colleagues and represents a foundation for our work on the conservation title of the farm bill. senator harkin has introduced the conservation security actan innovative idea that would reward good conservation farmers for their environmental efforts and thus foster conservation and environmental improvements. senators craig. feinstein. and thomas have introduced a grasslands reserve act that. would protect and restore one million acres of our fragile grasslands while allowing the owners to maintain economic use of the land. senators hutchinson and lincoln have a bill that reauthorizes and expands the wetlands reserve program. senator crapo has introduced a bill. of which i am a cosponsor. that covers many of the items in the conservation title of the current farm bill. i know he has put much thought into his bill and i look forward to working with him and my other colleagues as. we fashion the conservation title of the new farm bill. while there are many valid approaches on how we should foster improvements in our environment. this bill invests in our working landsthe land we use to grow our food. our fiber. the land we depend upon for sustenance. this working land cropland. pasture. rengeland. and private forests. makes up some 70 percent of the land areas of the contiguous 48 states. how this land is managed has profound effects on our economy and environment. the farm bill we are cross developing is one of the most important pieces of environmental and natural resource legislation this congress will address. it is essential that the conservation title be a major component of the legislation we develop together. since 1985. the last time congress made a major investment in conservation as part of a farm bill. we have spent most of our conservation dollars through programs that set asideproductive cropland as a primary means of achieving our environmental goals. these efforts are certainly worthwhile and i support continuing them. indeed the preeminent landidling program we have. the conservation reserve. was introduced on my farm in- indiana and i continue to support it. but we cannot landidle our way to environment performance. the folly of this. solely from a resource conservation standpointis evident from the situation we now see after fifteen years of extensive land idling through the conservation reserve. after having set aside up to 36.4 million acres at one point. state water quality reports today will name nonpoint source pollution as the nations biggest water quality challenge and agriculture as the biggest culprit. primarily due to sediment. nutrient loadings. and pathogens. while the conservation reserve has many benefits. particularly wildlife habitat in the great plains. it is obvious that largescale landidling schemes will not solve all of the problems associated with water and air quality. yet these are the environmental challenges that confront most farmers today. and the ones most likely to result in costly new regulation for our farmers and ranchers. how we deal with these environmental challenges will affect the commercial viability of farming and ranching over the next decade. a quick review of how we are spending our voluntary conservation dollars will show just how much ground we have to make up. in 1985. 97 cents of every financial assistance dollar from the u.s. department of agriculture went to working lands. three cents went to land retirement. today. the situation is nearly reversed with some 85 cents going toward land retirement. primarily through the conservation reserve. and only 15 cents going toward working lands. this overreliance on removing land from production comes at the expense of caring for working lands. and. given the contemporary environmental issues facing landowners. this imbalance must be addressed during our reauthorization of the farm bill. for our working lands to continue to be productive. and to ensure that agriculture can tend to its environmental concerns. i believe that the overarching goal of the new conservation title should be to emphasize conservation on working agricultural lands. much as president theodore roosevelt championed public land conservation early in the last century. today we must champion the care of our working lands. bringing conservation programs up to levels needed to address priority issues will require new funding. if you exclude the shortterm emergency funding. the budget resolution provides an additional $66.15 billion for agriculture above the baseline. i believe. that a significant portion of this new spending should be devoted to conservation. my bill increases mandatory conservation spending by approximately $2 billion per year. this amount would effectively double our investment in voluntary. incentivebased conservation programs. and. because of the funding provided by the budget resolution. we can enhance our working lands programs without cutting or diminishing our existing land retirement programs. to focus. on working lands. our first order of business is to strengthen the environmental quality incentives program. eqip. as it is called. offers financial. technical and educational assistance to farmers and ranchers and is generally seen as the workhorse conservation program for working lands. congress created eqip in 1996 by merging four other conservation programs and provided $200 million a year in mandatory spending. today. requests for eqip assistance far outstrip available funds and analyses show there is a demonstrated need for an additional $1.2 billion per year to address the anticipated needs of the livestock industry alone. my bill established national priorities for eqip. makes several needed reforms to the program such as shortening the length of the contract and removing discriminatory size restrictions. and provides $1.5 billion a year to be phasedin over a three year period. in addition. my bill provides more flexibility and financial incentives within eqip to create partnerships at the state and local level. partnerships that are essential to meeting the environmental challenges agriculture faces. my bill establishes a grants section within eqip to leverage federal funds with funding from nonfederal entities and encourages states to develop plans that bring together multiple federal. state. and local programs to create coordinated conservation initiatives to address critical environmental challenges. there is already good experience on this score through the conservation reserve enhancement program and the continuous signup program for buffer practices. my bill expands this concept by making private and other nonfederal entities eligible for a special $100 million matching grant program within eqip. the grant program would create cooperative federal/nonfederal ventures that would spur conservation on private lands through marketbased initiatives. under my proposal. nonfederal entities would bid to have their projects approved and then combine their funds with federal money to stimulate more use of marketbased solutions in areas such as water quality or carbon credit trading. for example. drinking water suppliers facing the necessity. and cost. of building new treatment facilities might find it less expensive to pay upstream farmers and ranchers to voluntarily make reductions in pollutant discharges. thereby obviating the need for new treatment facilities. taken together. these provisions will spark creative and innovative approaches to conservation that work better for farmers. ranchers. communities. and the environment. reforming. adequately funding. and focusing the environmental quality incentives program*on national environmental issues will dramatically accelerate the amount of conservation on our landscape. but it will also require that we resolve one of the key problems we face todaythe lack of qualified technical assistance to help our farmers and ranchers plan. design. install. and maintain conservation practices. insufficient annual appropriations for usdas natural resources conservation service over the past decade have caused a steady decline in real terms in the number of field staff available to give landowners technical advice. at the same time. demand for technical assistance has ballooned as producers grapple with conservation challenges. my bill ensures that technical assistance will be available to implement conservation by reforming the socalled section 11 cap in the commodity credit corporation charter act. the commodity credit corporation is allowed to reimburse agencies for work they do for the various programs under the corporation. but the section 11 cap limits total reimbursements to no more than $36.2 million annually. the cap was put on by congress to control computer purchases by the department of agriculture. but is has also had the unintended side effect of limiting technical assistance reimbursement for conservation programs. to resolve the problem. my bill exempts conservation technical assistance reimbursements from the cap. reforming the section 11 cap will help solve part of the problem. but my bill also looks to the private and nonprofit sector to help fill the technical assistance gap. crop advisors. farm managers. private agronomists and engineers. conservation district professionals. and other qualified individuals could help fill the technical assistance gap for many landowners who are willing to pay for their services. my bill creates a feebased certification program within usda to increase the number of technical assistance providers and provides for the use of incentive payments to help farmers and ranchers pay for qualified technical assistance for nutrient management plans. in all cases. work done by third parties would have to meet the technical standards of the natural resources conservation service. maintaining the confidentiality of producer information contained in usda files is vital to voluntary private lands conservation. farmers and ranchers must be confident that their private business information will not be compromised if they participate in a conservation program. farmers and ranchers are increasingly concerned about this issue as both government agencies and nongovernmental entities have attempted to secure usda data for regulatory purposes. in order to maintain the trust that exists between producers and usda. my bill includes provisions to protect the confidentiality of the information farmers and- ranchers disclose when developing and implementing conservation plans without affecting current freedom of information act procedures. strengthening eqip and our technical assistance capabilities are the two most important priorities my bill addresses. but there are other programs that add important features to a comprehensive conservation program that my bill reauthorizes and funds. my bill reauthorizes and increase funding for the wildlife habitat incentives program. created in the 1996 farm bill. this program provides technical and financial assistance to landowners that agree to develop wildlife habitat. the program was originally funded at $50 million over the seven year life of the 1996 farm bill. my bill increases the funding level to $50 million per year. devoting an aggregate of onehalf billion dollars to wildlife habitat over the life of the bill. similarly. my bill reauthorizes. amends. and increase funding for the farmland protection program. this voluntary program. also created in the 1996 farm bill. assist state and local programs purchase development rights on farms and helps farmers on the urbanrural interface stay in farming. the program has been lauded for its assistance to communities wishing to preserve agriculture. open space. wildlife habitat and other environmental benefits. my bill expands participation in the program to nonprofit organizations. allows grassland easements. and inicreases funding to $65 million per year. my bill preserves the conservation reserve program at its current level of 36.4 million acres. this leaves room for enrolling more than 2 million acres of additional land right now. as well as the acres that become available as existing contracts expire. the bill amends the program to create an incentive to increase the amount of hardwood -trees entering the program and statutorily reserves 4 million acres for the continuous signup and for the conservation reserve enhancement program. both the continuous signup and the conservation reserve enhancement program target high priority environmental concerns such as water quality. my bill also makes a major new commitment to wetland restoration through the wetlands reserve program by reauthorizing the program and adding 2.5 million acres to the enrollment authorization. more than doubling the rate of wetland restoration we have achieved since 1990. of the new acreage. the bill targets 50.000 acres of wetland restoration a year to cooperative agreements with states for high priority environmental needs such as hypoxia. eutrophication. wildlife habitat. flooding. and groundwater recharge. in the area of reform. within existing usda conservation programs there are numerous overlaps and redundancies. my bill requires the secretary of agriculture to aggressively look at the entire range of usda conservation programs to identify program overlaps. explore potential consolidations. develop ways to simplify and streamline program administration. and then report her recommendations to congress. as we continue the process of reauthorizing the farm bill. several fundamental choices lie before us and will require us to make decisions that will set the course of voluntary private lands conservation efforts for the next decade. the choices we make will determine the overall health of our environment. the working lands conservation act provides a solid basis for making those conservation decisions. the bill helps restore balance between working lands programs and landidling programs without cutting popular programs such as the conservation reserve. the focus of my conservation reforms is to assist farmers and ranchers to not only meet regulatory requirements. but to proactively resolve them before they enter a regulatory context. it increases the coherence of conservation policy. protects producer confidentiality. and assures that more technical assistance will be available to our farmers and ranchers. as a nation. we entrust the care of over 50 percent of our land to just two percent of our citizensthe farmers and ranchers who work the land and produce the food and fiber we demand. this bill recognizes that farmers and ranchers are much more. than food and fiber producers. they are the most important natural resource managers in this nation. my bill will give them the technical and financial tools they need to care for the landand our environment. as they make a living from it. it recognizes that conservation is a shared responsibility. a partnership between farmers. ranchers. and the public. this bill strengthens those partnerships and ensures conservation will be a fundamental part of the mission of this committee. congress. and the department of agriculture."},{"1":"2000","2":"HOLLINGS","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. i call up amendment no. 4135. mr. president. the other eye opener in international trade is the matter of

allegedly the finest in the world. we produce enough to feed ourselves and 15 other countries. but we only have 3.5 million farmers and there are 800 million farmers in the peoples republic of china. they are not only now producing to the extent where they have a glutmind you me. i said that advisedlya glut in agriculture. they will continue to expand upon their agricultural production once they solve the transportation and distribution problem. and start feeding the entire world. it is very difficult to understand how any of my farm friends herewho are always calling us protectionists when we have never asked for any kind of subsidies or protection whatsoeverbut if people lose their jobs. 38.700 who have lost their textile jobs. they are supposed to be retrained. you know. and get ready

appropriate the money to take care of it. i will never forget this socalled freedom to farm measure that was put in here 3 years ago. each year. now. we have gone up and increasedrather than the freedom. the subsidies: some $7 to $8 billion. in contrast now. with the peoples republic of china. we have a deficit in a lot of items. the total agricultural trade balance is $218 million for the

carded but combed. it would be unfair to talk. with this particular amendment. about the deficit and all of these things because we already have a deficit. we do have a plus balance of trade in wheat. corn. and rice. it is listed under cereals. is the way they list it at the department of agriculture. we have a plus balance of trade in wheat. corn. and rice. and a plus balance of trade in soybeans. that is why i made this amendment to read \"wheat. corn. rice. and soybeans.\" i wanted to start off. as in soybeans. i have a plus balance of trade of $288.1 million. so we are happy. we have a plus balance of trade of wheat. corn. and rice of $39.6 million. i am looking at that particular category and whereby 4 years ago we had a plus balance of $440.7 million. it is down to $39.6 million. it

agreement calls for. we are trying to really improve the competitor. these are the kind of agreements we make when we send barshefsky and that crowd abroad. i read: china and the united states agree to actively promote comprehensive cooperation in agriculture. in the field of high technology. and encourage research institutes and agricultural enterprises to collaborate in hightech research and development. do not for a minute think the chinese are not coming. they are going to come for those hightech items. go to our agricultural colleges. go to our experimental development stations. and they are going to collaborate on all the hightech research and development. mostly. they will be taking. they are not giving any. reading further: china and the united states agree enterprises should be urged to make investment in each country to produce and do business in hightech agricultural products. they will have to make investments in that country to produce and do business in hightech agricultural products. they agree with the content provision in agriculture. and yet my colleagues say: whoopee. this is a wonderful agreement. i think i will be around here long enough for these

to put ourselves out of business. they come to the floor and say: oh. we have so much more fertile. arable land than they have. so many millions of acres. they have more land under irrigation than the united states. it is an offset now. but they will be getting more irrigation. in addition to the advanced productivity we already have. but we politicians in congress say: you dont understand. global competition. globalization. you are just resisting globalization. that is yesteryears politician. you have to modernize. we are for change. we are global. we are globally going out of business. that is why i have this amendment. that is. if this exceeds $5 billion in those four categories. it is only $3.5 billion now. but if we start losing on wheat. corn. and soybeans. we are goners in agriculture. this amendment provides that if this occurs and this was misrepresented to usthe senate is charged under the constitution. article i. section 8. to regulate foreign commerceif we were misled. we can say: please renegotiate and see how we can right this situation. we do not have this in advanced technology. we do not have this in electronics and manufactured products. we do not have a plus balance of trade in agricultural products. but the little bit we have left. my farmers realize if you are voting against this amendment. you vote against americas most productive farmer. we are agreeing to make the chinese more productive. if you think an american farmer can outwork a chinese farmer. you are whistling \"dixie.\" they are the hardest working people in the world. they are like us in the south. we are still hungry. that is why the bmw plants not only produce more but they produce better quality. that is why we are doubling the size of the bmw plant from munich. germany. and we will continue to compete. generally speaking. the rest of the country. up in your aeck of the woods. i say to the presiding officer. they have gotten spoiled. we started the globalization in rhode island. we started 50 years ago trying to move every industry that was in rhode island because you had them and we did not have them. we moved them down to south carolina. now they have been moved from south carolina to malaysia. mexico. and now to china under this particular agreement. that is what is really happening. we know how to get the industry. and we know how to lose the industry. we

chairman. i rise today in strong opposition to the foreign operation appropriations bill for fy 99 reported out of the appropriations committee. once again. the gop leadership has all but ensured confrontation with the republican led senate and has set the congress on a collision course with the white house. this bill has several serious flaws that fail to address the ongoing global economic crisis and is simply not adequate to meet our national security requirements or to meet our obligations and responsibilities as the worlds only superpower. specifically. this bill ignores the presidents request of the total $18 billion for the international monetary fund (imf) and is vital to serve and replenish the imf funding base which has been severely depleted by the financial crisis in mexico. asia and russia. again includes restrictive language on international familyplanning funding. fully funds the united states school of americans (soa) which has a long history of instructing human rights abusers. and underfunds important international programs that are crucial to an effective foreign policy. the changes that have occurred in the world in the last decade have provided the united states unprecedented opportunities to enhance our national and economic security by solidifying our global leadership and by bringing democracy to many countries. the congress has debated the imf replenishment for a full year. in that time. the economic crisis has spread from asia to russia. and is now threatening to strike in latin america. it is not time for congress to take a proactive role on this replenishment. the imf is an imperfect solution. not the problem. and it is one of the only tools available to address the serious global economic turmoil. as a senior member of the house banking committee. i visited southeast asia last winter and met with political and financial leaders in china. korea and japan. following the trip. i was convinced more than ever that the asian economic contagion would not be isolated to asia. just yesterday. federal reserve chairman greenspan and treasury secretary rubin stressed again the importance of increasing the funding for the imf. furthermore. the republican led senate included the full $18 billion requested by the administration in its passed foreign operations bill. the fact remains that the replenishment of the imf will ultimately benefit american workers. businesses and farmers by protecting our economic strength. this bill also contains language restricting foreign organizations who receive family planning assistance from using their own funds to seek to change laws in their own respective country. this provision punishes organizations for engaging in legal activities in their own countries that would be protected by the first amendment. if carried out in the united states. funding for preventive family planning leads to a decrease in unintended pregnancies. a decrease in maternal deaths. and a decrease in abortion. funds under these programs are legally prohibited from supporting or encouraging abortion as a method of family planning. these restrictions are safeguarded by legally binding contracts with the organizations that receive u.s. funds. by close technical monitoring. and by regular audits by independent. nationally recognized accounting firms. none of these funds are utilized for abortion purposes. international family planning assistance is intended to help women make informed health care decisions. improve the quality of life for citizens of developing nations. and promote economic responsibility in allocating scarce resources. ultimately. i believe it will be in the best interest of the united states to support programs that strive to help the poor and underprivileged. especially women in such need. such funds prevent unwanted pregnancies and the abortions that may follow. in its current form. this provision would even muzzle organizations from speaking out against abortion in their own countries. again. the gop led senate did not include this restrictive language in its version. thus setting up a difficult conference negotiation. furthermore. the president has indicated clearly that this language is unacceptable and that he will veto any bill containing such language. again. the gop leadership insisted on providing full funding for expanding the international military education and training (imet) programs to countries with horrific histories of human rights abuses. specifically. funding for the school of the americas (s.o.a.). the s.o.a. was established in 1946 to train military officers from latin american countries. to date. nearly 60.000 military personnel from various latin american countries have attended the s.o.a. unfortunately. upon returning to their home countries a number of graduates have participated in the overthrow of democratically elected governments and in broad abuses of human rights. the lessons taught by the u.s. at the s.o.a. were clearly not very effective in guidin democratic military conduct. i have serious apprehension to any congressional commitment to s.o.a. instruction that will bring about positive change in latin america or in the global theater. only the closure of the s.o.a. could better serve this objective. that is the right thing to do symbolically and substantively. this bill appropriates only $43 million of the $300 million requested by the president for the global environment facility (g.e.f) of the world bank. this important facility funds environmental projects throughout the world. the g.e.f. was created in response to the vast needs in developing countries for multilateral resources devoted to mitigating environmental problems. currently. the g.e.f. is funding programs to address a variety of environmental problems including the promotion of a biodiversity. creating energy efficiency and cleaning up polluted water. without additional funding. g.e.f. will run out of money soon and this vital work will stop. many funding levels for programs that the committee has reported will severely undercut our ability to provide leadership throughout the global community. specifically. the peace corps defining programs. the export import bank. and the protocols to implement the comprehensive test ban treaty. overall. this bill fails to provide adequate resources to meet our national security requirements and reaffirm our obligation and responsibilities as the worlds superpower. the republican leaders has again illustrated its indifference to meeting the needs of the global financial crises. reaffirming its commitments to human rights. providing environmental leadership abroad. and assisting those who need our help the most in this age of poverty. civil discord and economic turmoil. i urge members to vote no on this bill."},{"1":"1997","2":"BRADY","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. today on capitol hill there were a number of representatives of the national federation of independent business. the organization that represents more than 600.000 of our small and independent entrepreneurs in america. led capably by jack farris. they were here today to talk about government and about the role it plays in stifling small business and the jobs they have the potential to create. it reminds us and helps remind us that small business is the engine of our economic growth in america. they are the quiet. very quiet heroes of our american economy. we all know that most of the jobs in america are created by small businesses. but they are creating jobs at 8 times the rate at small businesses than are created in the larger companies with 500 or more employees. in fact in 1995. there were 800.000. 800.000 new businesses starred in america. a 5 percent increase over the year before. not only do these small businesses help our economy. but they help stimulate the economy in our community as well they have a ripple effect each time one is created. a business with up to 100 employees not only brings new families and school children to -our communities. but they also spin off another retail establishment to help support it. they create over half a million dollars in retail sales within that community and over a million dollars of more personal income to be spent to generate the local economy. not only do small businesses stimulate the economy. they always give back to the community in which they live. employees of small businesses. by research. are more charitable. give back to their communities. give more donations to the service providers that help our community run. these quiet heroes are all around us. recently in a local newspaper. the family image. which is run by an entrepreneurial company. ron and barbara frazier. who like to reinforce the family values that are the foundation of our country. there is a profile of a small business. of a small businesswoman k.c. choe. she is owner of schlotzskys restaurant on 1960 west near the intersection with 145 in north houston. k.c. was born in seoul. south korea. came to america after high school and in 1979 became a u.s. citizen. after working in the houston hotel for three years. she caught the entrepreneurial spirit of this country and bought a restaurant in 1984 that her mother helped her buy. that restaurant became. schlotzskys later in 1995. k.c. and her coworker tammy karpas work 70 hours or more a week. her mom works there as well and helps take care of k.c.s 12yearold son joey. who attends twins creek middle school in spring. tx. and k.c.. tammy and her mom work there day in and day out providing quality service to their customers. she and her family have faced a thousand challenges to keep that company alive and growing and prospering. and like a lot of businesses. it is hard to believe the type of regulation and the challenges they are up against that government helps create. recently herman cain. who is the chairman and ceo of godfathers. jotted down in a local magazine. success magazine. some of the regulations that they face. just federal regulations. that a typical restaurant in our communities will face. and it is amazing. let me read just some of these organizations and agencies they have to comply with. the department of justice. for accessibility to disabled customers. bureau of alcohol. tobacco. and firearms. for the occupational tax for alcohol sellers. occupational safety and health administration. for bloodborne pathogen program for employees who give first aid. the epa. for car pools for employers in high pollution areas and cooking emissions in high pollution areas. department of justice. for copyright law and restaurant music. food aild drug administration. to comply with egg refrigeration standards. department of labor. the family and medical leave act. the grease trap waste disposal regulations by epa. health claims and restaurant food regulations by the food and drug administration. health benefit plans and americans with disabilities act by the eeoc. the immigration control act regulates them as well. job application forms and the questions they can ask are regulated of their employees are regulated by the eeoc. their lockout and tagout requirements are complied with through osha. minimum wage is determined and audited by the department of labor. the national origin discrimination is regulated by the eeoc. the fda regulates the nutrientcontent claims and restaurant food. the irs. of course. outlines overtime pay rules and the payroll tax deposits. the department of labor has the ban on the polygraph for employee testing. the department of labor has regulations on restaurant closings and advance notice to employees. the

restaurants. also have to comply with state permits and regulations. city health inspections. and other registration requirements. mr. speaker. we need to reduce this kind of burden on people like

water act amendments of 1994. many people are responsible for bringing this bill to the floor today and i would like to thank the gentleman from california for his tireless efforts over the past several months to forge the compromises necessary to achieve this bill. i also want to take a moment to thank the gentleman from oklahoma for his role in drafting this legislation. and so many other good bills during his tenure in congress. he will be missed. while drinking water treatment in the united states is among the most sophisticated in the world. many people continue to drink water that is contaminated with biological pathogens. heavy metals and possible cancercausing agents. according to the environmental protection agency [epa]. waterborne diseasecausing pathogens. such as cryptosporidlum which killed more than 100 people in milwaukee in 1993. kill about 1.800 and cause another 1.8 million americans to get sick every year. currently. the epa does not regulate cryptosporidium. some water supplies are also contaminated with suspected cancercausing agents such as arsenic and nitrates. another problem with our current drinking water supply system is the large numberof small systems. usually defined as those serving fewer than 3.300 people.- small systems often lack the financial resources necessary to install the latest- treatment technology. small systems almost uniformly serve rural areas of the country. these systems need financial and technical assistance to upgrade or consolidate to ensure that rural americans have drinking water which meets the highest standards. the bill before us today addresses these and other important issues. it implements a more manageable framework for epa to select contaminants which might pose a threat to human health. study them and issue regulations to protect the public. the epa must immediately act to review at least 15 unregulated contaminants which might be present in water systems to determine whether regulation is required. over the long term. h.r. 3392 requires the epa administrator. within 5 years of enactment and every 4 years thereafter. to develop a list of 12 contaminants w ich may require regulation. after the list is finalized. regulations must be promulgated which set maximum contaminant levels [mcl] in drinking water and specify treatment techniques. importantly. the administrator is instructed to develop a mcl for cryptosporidium and radon and enter into an agreement with the national academy of sciences [nas to conduct a comprehensive study of the possible health effects of arsenic in drinking water. it is vitally important that cryptospondium be regulated to reduce the likelihood of another disaster like the one in milwaukee. moreover. when setting drinking water standards. the administrator must pay special attention to the possible effects of contaminants of certain groups. such as children. pregnant women and the elderly. it is essential that standards are stringent enough to protect these. and other. vulnerable groups. the bill requires states. using guidance from the epa. to develop programs to certify laboratories and system operators. this is necessary to guarantee that lab analysis is aocurate and that operators have the technical expertise to run systems properly. one inaocurate test or human error at a treatment plant can have serious consequences for those consuming the water. possible human error lead to a boil water order in the district and parts of northern virginia this spring. in addition. states are required to establish system viability assessment programs to gauge which systems have the technical. managerial and financial capability to meet all the requirements of the act. this is especially important because many small systems can not meet the full range of the acts requirements. but have not been adequately supervised under the current statute. states risk losing financial assistance if they fail to establish a viability program. finally. h.r. 3392 provides for federal grants to states to establish sdwa state revolving funds [srf]. states will make loans and grants to systems to upgrade and install new treatment technology. the bill authorizes $1 billion for contnbutions to srfs in fiscal year 1995. 1996 and 1997 and such sums as may be necessary thereafter. in fiscal year 1995. the congress has appropriated $700 million for this purpose and $599 million remains available from fiscal year 1994. these funds will help systems across the country to upgrade treatment technology. the bill prohibits loans and grants to small systems for any expenditures which could be avoided through consolidation with other small systems. but funds may be used for such consolidation. the goal of this restriction is toreduce the number of small systems which are not viable and often fail to protect public health. mr. speaker. this is a bipartisan bill which is backed by a wide range of interests. including the national governors association. conference of state legislatures. water system representatives and members of the environmental community. to ensure that every american has safe. healthy drinking water. it is essential that we pass this bill today."},{"1":"1993","2":"CLEMENT","3":"E","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. spa. i rise today to endorse the north american freetrade a.\"men

billion in this program when they are already behind on spending. you will hear senator payor with an amendment. immediately following senator sassers and my amendment. saying that they are spending money wildly. trying to get rid of it. he held a hearing which shows that they ride firstclass all over the world. trying to spend as much money as possible. nobody is riding herd. but i want to make the final point: every dime we spend is borrowed. all of you know that. i guess it was last friday. or maybe on monday. the super collider debate. last monday. i tried to kill that program. $20 billion for nothing. not one single person on the floor of the senate could tell you one single spinoff that we were going to get from the super collider. except a few jobs in texas and a few jobs in louisiana. do you know what the argument was. especially from the other side of the aisle? i do not mean this to be partisan. but it is the truth. you know. \"it is entitlements that cause the deficit.\" it is as though the $11 billion to build the collider and the $20 billion to run it for 25 years. that is funny money. that does not count. it is those entitlementemedicaid. food stamps. ssi. they say that is what is causing the deficit. not the 320 billion we are going to spend on the super colllder. that money does not count. is it not interesting that some people around here. if you increase wic spending so poor. pregnant women get prenatal and neonatal care. so their children have a halfdeoent chance in this world. they will tell you that is an outrage to increase that budget by such a sum. but when you get down to the super collider. next year. $500 million. over the next 6 years. $11 billion to $15 billion. over the next 25 years. $20 billion. they say the amount we are putting in that program next year is thirtythree thousandths of 1 percent. just a token. they sound as if it is money you put in as bus fare. when you put your little tokens in the coin box. so it just depends on what you are spending the money for. mr. president. that ts the mentality here. we have a $4 trillion debt and a $400 billion deficit this year. because it is always that that is just a fractiona million here and there. how can you talk about depriving this guy of $1 million? that is nothing. you cannot compute what a small portion of the debt that is. and so on we go. some people are saying. well. if we cannot get it in entitlements. we cannot do anything. others say if you cannot get it from defense. and things like the space station and the super collider. you cannot do anything. mr. president. i do not care where it is. i just do not want to. leave the senate and the congress with this terrible burden on my children. it is not selfserving to say i love my children. i certainly do not love my children any more than anybody else in this body does. my children are so priceless to me. i could not describe it in 1.000 years. do you want me to tell you a little story? one morning. i was watching an interview on the today show of a person who was running for the senate against a sitting senator. he was a challenger to an incumbent. jane pauley was asking that person about all the tremendous successes he had had. he had been a success at everythingfirst in his class. all those kinds of things. he made money. finally. she said: mr. so and so. \"what do you fear most?\" and he studied a moment. and he looked very ponderous and thoughtful. and he said: \"i fear defeat. i fear failure more than anything else.\" i turned to betty bumperswe were sitting at breakfastand i said \"that guy aint going to be elected.\" she said. \"why not?\" i said. \"because that is a terrible answer.\" she said. \"why is that a terrible answer?\" i said. \"well. it just is. people who fear failure are not likely to take chances.\" i never made a speech to a high school graduating class that i did not tell them to take risks. abraham lincoln got beat for about everything he ran for. just about. except for one term in the house and president. what if he said he feared failure? he would still be a practicing lawyer in springfield. il. but to get back to the point. do you know what i fear more than -anything else? that my children will die before i do. i do not want to outlive any of my children. i do not think i could bear it. but you know something else i fear? not having gotten this country back on track. i am not going to get into partisan -politics here. as much as i am tempted. because all of you know my governor is our candidate this year. but i would like to believe that at some point the collective intelligence of the u.s. congress is going to take hold and they are going.to say a billion dollars is important. and i want to say to my colleagues. we did not change the mining laws--i do not want to revisit that. i have considered that to be the clearest cut issue i have ever seen on the senate floor. the absolute scam of allowing the mining companies of this country to take $100 billion of minerals. gold and silver principally. off federal land and not pay a nickel for it and leave an unmitigated environmental disaster for us to pick up the tab for. there is not a single u.s. senator that does not know that is wrong. i got 42 votes. and i did not sleep that night. mr. president. i will tell you a secret. i did not sleep that night. i am a poor loser. among other things. i hate to lose. but i especially hate to lose on issues that are so clear cut. if we collected royalties from the mining companies like they pay to private people or like they pay to states. we would make a dent in the deficit. and then i would.get a good nights sleep. knowing i made a contribution. you cut a billion dollars out of sdi and i will get a good nights sleep. because i will know i have kept faith with my children and yours. so i say to my colleagues. do not be impressed with the fact that these sdi contracts are in 40 states or 50 states or whatever it is. i found out even the people who run the superconducting super collider projects have let contracts in 43 states. you see. the pentagon started this 50 years ago. now nasa does it. the super collider does it. sdi does it. and your people back home say. \"please dont cut this budget. we have 100 jobs down here depending on this little contract sdi gave us.\" so we spend $4.3 billion. so i say to my colleagues. why do you not make up your mind that today is the first day of the rest of this session that you are honestly going to think and act responsibly about trying to do something about the deficit and. mr. president. without jeopardizing this project one scintilla. i yield the floor."},{"1":"1991","2":"WHITTEN","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. chairman. this bill includes funds for many important programsveterans. environmental protection. housing. the national science foundation. and the national aeronautics and space administration. this is one of the bills. mr. chairman. that takes care of america and. through research. americas future. the needs of the present and the future must be accommodated in order for us to continue as a great nation. mr. chairman. the chairman of this subcommittee. the gentleman from michigan [mr. traxleri and the gentleman from new york. the ranking minority member [bill green] and other members of the subcommittee have covered the principal provisions of the bill. im glad i am a member of the subcommittee. mr. chairman. at this time i direct attention to a particular problem which the subcommittee and the full committee on appropriations and the congress have to solve. the subcommittee members realize that the space program is needed but feel that it should not be at the expense of essential domestic programs. mr. chairman. some weeks ago it was my suggestion to the chairmen of the various subcommittees on appropriations that those essential programs of the government which could not be funded under present limitations be funded and that we obtain a rule to prevent them from being counted in order to avoid sequestration. that has been done by the executive branch time after time. i support the space program. but i do not believe it should be used to drastically cut existing and necessary programs. i am sure that is also the intent of the subcommittee. in the report by the full committee. it was stated that funds for the space program were not included. without prejudice to the space program. in order to avoid cutting important existing programs. mention has been made in the press about asrmthe advance solid rocket motorfacility presently under construction at yellow creek in my state. the facts about that existing and ongoing construction are as follows: first. nasa said that the most important reason to fund asrm was to improve shuttle safety. why? because the new asrm has fewer case joints and eliminates four critical 1 failure modes. next. nasa said that the asrm design eliminates the necessity to throttle the space shuttle engines and that increases shuttle safety. next nasa said that all asbestos materials are being replacedand that improves safety and health. next. nasa sold us the asrm because it increases the shuttle payload by 12.000 poundsrecapturing much of the payload capability that was lost after the challenger accident. nasa told us that it was essential to build a new governmentowned facility to produce the asrm. now obviously. asrm would also be important to the space station because it permits the launching of both the laboratory and the habitat with fully integrated payload racks. but thats not why nasa proposed the asrm. they proposed it for the reasons i just statedand virtually none of those had anything to do with space station. nasa proposed the asrm because it wanted a new. more reliable. safer. solid rocket booster with increased payload capability. may i say again. my original advice to the full committee as chairmanthat these things that are *essential should be off budget and not used to bring about sequestration. is sound but also the committee position is sound. i know its intentions are good. i repeat again. the report was that the committee left it out at this time because of the effect it would have on existing important programs. we need both. and i think the committee approached it in the right way."},{"1":"1990","2":"DIXON","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. my friend from colorado has now been kind enough to indicate that i can proceed. and i will proceed very briefly. mr. president. i rise today to let the record show the reasons influencing my vote on the clean air act amendments of 1990. s. 1630. i have come to the floor more than half a dozen times to express my views on this bill as it went through its many changes. as the bill evolved. i called for balance and fairness. pointing out inequities in the acid rain title. and economic inefficiencies in the air toxics section. among the amendments that i offered. along with senator gortox from washington. was an amendment to preserve the competitiveness of u.s. businesses that will be injured as a result of the unilateral actions the united states will take to clean the air. that amendment failed. but the closeness of the vote revealed that many other members are also concerned about the grave implications this bill will have for the u.s. economy. perhaps it will take some time before the economic effect of this bill will be realized. but i assure you. this issue is not going away. it is true that this bill has gone through many transformations which have helped make things less devastating for the industrial heartland. i want to make sure that my friends. the majority leaders. the floor managers. and others who labored to fix this bill. for about 1 month in a room just off this floor. know that i am profoundly grateful to them. but the truth is. the bill which was pulled off the floor shortly after being called up on january 23. was in need of major surgery. unfortunately. in the acid rain section. what has been performed was only minor surgery. before i go on to describe the serious problems that remain in the acid rain title. i feel compelled to mention the areas where the compromise greatly improved the bill. first. i am pleased that the current laws definition of a major source in the ozone nonattainment section will be retained. this will permit small businesses to remain in operation while still attacking the real causes of urban smog. second. i think it was a wise decision to allow nonattainment sources to net out increases and decreases in emissions following plant modernizations. this will actually encourage pollutionsaving plant upgrades because businesses will not be penalized for making modifications. third. as a representative of a car manufacturing state. i am very pleased that a compromise was reached on second round tailpipe controls. tying the second round of controls to whether there is a need for further controls for cities to reach attainment is an example of a balanced approach that i wish was the rule. rather than the exception. in this bill a fourth important change to the bill involves an assessment of residual risk under the air toxics title. i very much support the provisions requiring the national academy of sciences to review our risk assessment methodologies. and the subsequent revision of those methods based upon the findings of the academys study. because of the enoromous costs of controlling emissions. it is important that risk assessment attempt to approximate actual risk to real people. rather than theoretical risk to hypothetical persons. finally. a fifth. and very prudent. change to the bill in the air toxics section deals with the treatment of coke oven emissions. i support the compromise which allows coke ovens to achieve a lowest achievable emission rate in lieu of shutting down for failure to meet a theoretical residual risk standard. i support this not only because we manufacture a great deal of steel in illinois. but because i feared for the entire national economy if we were to lose the ability to make steel in this country. mr. president. as i see it. these are the most significant changes to the first three titles of the bill. and i am very pleased that they have been made. unfortunately. title iv. the acid rain title. was not sufficiently amended . the acid rain section is without doubt the most divisive issue in the bill. and i sincerely appreciate the leaders and the floor managers willingness to listen to the problems this section creates for the midwest. however. following months of regular meetings and an untold number of staffhours devoted to finding an equitable solution for the midwest. a fair compromise for the midwest was not reached. the midwest received too little through the negotiating process. and perhaps that was all that we could achieve. considering the structure of the acid rain bill at the start of the negotiating process. the acid rain bill which was reported out of committeea committee. i might *add. that has not one member from the industrial midwest. and not one member from a highsulfur coal statewas so fatally flawed that we never had a chance of amending it into an equitable bill. the parameters given to us by the committee in terms of what changes would be acceptable were so restrictive that there was no possibility to make the significant changes. i would like to elaborate on how both the administrations and the senate committees acid rain titles were designed to be against the midwest from the start. as my colleagues know well by now. i am not pleased by the way the bill before us has allocated the costs among states for cleaning up our national acid rain problem. the bill seeks to get 90 percent of acid rain reductions in the first phase from just nine states. i suppose that would be fair if these nine states were responsible for all of the pollution. but that is not the case. in fact. these states contribute only 51 percent of the total sulphurdioxide emissions. it makes sense to seek the lowest cost emission reductions first. and i recognize that there is potential to make relatively more costefficient reductions in the nine states targeted by the bill. it does not make sense to me. however. that a great number of states will actually be allowed to increase their sulfurdioxide utility emissions as a result of this bill. mr. president. the following 18 states will be permitted to increase their utility emissions from 1980 levels. while my state is being asked to cleanup more than its proportionate share: vermont. connecticut. delaware. arizona. louisiana. north dakota. kansas. nebraska. oklahoma. montana. wyoming. colorado. new mexico. utah. arkansas. nevada. oregon. and texas. i note that 8 of these 18 states are represented on the committee that reported the bill. and that the 9 states required to make excess reductions are not represented on the committee. mr. president. the increases these states will be given amount to 910.000 tonsnearly 1 million tons worth of increases in annual emissions are being handed out to certain states. while nine states make extra reductions to pay for them. not only is that infuriating to a senator from one of those nine states. but it is also confounding that we would take these drastic measures to protect the environment with one hand. while the other hand partially wipes away our gains. fairness has not been achieved. nine states will make a disproportionate share of this countrys investment in acid rain control. and the other beneficiaries of this investment will not share in the cost. illinois is being targeted for big reductions under the principle that polluters should pay. the problem with that is that only some polluters have been identified and asked to contribute to the solution. this bill violates the very polluter pay principle that its sponsors tout. and instead. a very conscious decision was made to place nearly all of the burden on nine targeted states in the midwest. mr. president. someone unfamiliar with the facts would assume that the midwest plants were our onlyor even our biggestsource of sulfur and nitrogen oxidesbut that is not the case. i would like to set the record straight with regard to this misperception. i have already mentioned the 18 states that will increase their utility sulfur emissions by nearly 1 million tons. it might be assumed that these states are being rewarded for being extraordinarily clean. but in fact. some of these states are among the biggest so2 polluters in the country. new mexico. louisiana. arizona. and texas rank sixth. fifth. second. and first in terms of industrial emissions of sulfur dioxide. texas is the no. i industrial so2 polluter. and no. 3 overall sulfur polluter. and yet its utilities will be allowed to pump 333.000 more tons of sulfur into the air than they did in 1980. texas increased emissions will offset over onehalf of the reductions required of my state. not to single out the state of texas. let me point to arizona. in 1985 arizona put 718.000 tons of sulfur in the air. as a result of this bill. arizona will now put 786.000 tons into the air. louisiana. the nations fifth biggest industrial s02 polluter. april . 1990 will increase its utility emissions by 86.000 tons annually. mr. president. this bill is skewed. mr. president. i ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record at the conclusion of my remarks a list of states that will increase their utility s02 emissions as a result of s. 1630."},{"1":"1989","2":"LIEBERMAN","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. today i am introducing legislation amending the clean water act to close some serious loopholes that hamper the cleanup of oil spilled in our waterways. these are loopholes that became obvious in the aftermath of the wreck of the exxon valdez in prince william sound off alaska. i am pleased to be joined in this introduction by original cosponsors senators charee. reid. durenberger. and cranston. the aim of the legislation is to make sure that all those who are related to the spilled oil bear the full cost of cleanup and damages resulting from the spill and that they pay substantial civil and criminal penalties where appropriate. while accidents are inevitable. what is particularly galling to people. including me. is the mounting evidence that exxons preparedness plans failed to take into account any significant oil spilllet alone one of the magnitude of the valdez spill. i was frankly shocked by the contents of the report on the exxon disaster submitted by epa administrator reilly and secretary of transportation skinner to the president last month. for example. exxons plans for cleanup of spills in the waters of the united states from exxon vessels. including the spills from the valdez. had no details. it contained no information which related in any way to the prince william sound or the valdez terminal. it had no equipment list other than mention of a van and sampling equipment. it did not even discuss the use of booms. skimmers and dispersants. in short. it was entirely a paper exercise bearing no relationship to reality. the plan prepared by alyeska pipeline transit co. was equally surrealistic. for example. the plan relies on the use of dispersants for cleanup of a spill in prince william sound. at the same time. the plan states that it would be difficult to apply dispersants effectively because. for some reason. the necessary equipment was far away in arizona. the reillyskinner report to the president gets worse. the person in charge of cleanup for alyeska simply decided it was not necessary to accompany the coast guard to the scene of the spill because the plan didnt require it. the arrival of vital equipment was delayed precious days during the early part of the spill. training of workers did not take place until after the spill had occurred. the fact that under our current laws exxons liability is limited simply adds insult to injury to the american people. the disaster thus leaves us not with one mess to clean up. but two: the one in the water and the one on the booksin the laws and contingency plans that actually failed us and that may prevent us from adequately protecting alaskas environment and exacting the kind of justice the american public demands. in my experienceand i speak particularly of my experience as a former attorney general of the state of connecticutone way to ensure that companies or individuals will act in a manner which protects our environment is to have laws which clearly spell out the consequences of their failure to do so. call it deterrence. it is clear that current laws did little to compel exxon to prepare for an oilspill. nor did they compel exxon to act responsibly once a spill occurred. i compared the liability provisions of the clean water act for oilspills with the very strong provisions of the superfund law concerning the disposal of hazardous substance on land and what i found warl surprising because there are some very startling differences between these two laws. the superfund law. which was enacted by congress in 1980 and amended in 1986. contains a strict liability scheme with no cap on the cleanup costs which the government can collect from the responsible parties. it also gives the government the power: first. to order polluters to clean up. second. to force them to pay triple the cleanup costs if they do not. and three. to pay. in addition a penalty of up to $25.000 each day the order is violated. the older clean water act. which covers oilspills. has none of these protections. the clean water act places a cap on potential liability. and it gives the government no power to order cleanup of oil from a vessel. no power to issue administrative orders for cleanup of oil. no power to assess triple cleanup costs. and no power to impose a $25.000 per day penalty for violation of an order. the existing clean water act also does not hold the company which owns the oil or arranged for its shipment liable for the cleanup costs. this means that. if the vessel carrying the oil at valdez had been owned by a small company with minimal assets. it is possible that there would have been no responsible party to bear the huge cleanup costs. even if the oil itself had been owned by one of the large oil companies. the superfund law. by comparison. has a broader definition of responsible parties. the legislation i am introducing today seeks to establish the same strong scheme of liability for the cleanup of oil dumped into water as the superfund law provides for the cleanup of hazardous substances on land. in some circumstances. where appropriate. it is even stronger than superfund. specifically. the proposed legislation: first. gives the government authority to issue administrative orders or seek injunctive relief in court ordering the polluter to clean up an oilspill from a vessel or facility. second. allows the government to assess daily penalties of up to $25.000 per day of violation of the order and triple the cleanup costs incurred by the government if the polluter fails to comply with the order. third. extends the class of persons responsible for cleanup costs and damages to include any entity which owns an interest in the oil. any entity which arranged for the transport of the oil. and any entity which transported the oil. and fourth. provides that those responsible parties are liable for all cleanup costs and damages without any limit on the amount of potential liability. finally. many provisions of the clean water act provide for large penalties for violations of the actboth civil and criminal. but the penalty provisions of section 311 of the clean water act governing discharges of oil are extremely ambiguous. under one very plausible interpretation. the companics could be let off the hook simply by paying $5.000. those penalties are not clearly applicable to companies that are involved in an oilspill. my proposed legislation clears up this ambiguityit raises the civil penalties to an amount up to $25.000 per violation per day or $1.000 per barrel of oil discharged. whichever is greater. it sets a minimum penalty of $250.000 where the discharge was caused by willful negligence or violation of a safety rule. it also provides for a range of criminal penalties. including. in the event of knowing violations causing others serious injury. imprisonment of up to 15 years. the american people are frustrated and angry. they dont like it when they hear that exxon may only face a civil penalty of up to $5.000 for the spill. they dont like it when they hear that there is a cap on exxons cleanup responsibilities. they dont like it when they hear that our laws do not compel companies to prepare for environmental disaster or to clean up after it happens. i know how they feel and i know that now is the time to move forward to changethe inadequacies in our laws to protect our environment. mr. president. i ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the record."},{"1":"1988","2":"GLENN","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"i yield myself such time as i may require. mr. president. let me respond to these jurisdictional things that the senator from nebraska brought up. i was the at .hor of this amendment. i think i am fully justified in moving this on priceanderson. for the reasons i read into the record earlier. i am trying to prevent a nuclear accident. not wait and compensate someone after it has happened. that was the intent of the original producers of the priceanderson legislation. i have met my colleagues on the armed services committee. of which i am also a member. much more than halfway. i say to the distinguished senator from nebraska that it was not anybody except the parliamentarian of the senate who determined that this bill be referred to the governmental affairs committee. not the armed services committee. the fact is that when the senate armed services committee requested that they be permitted to hold hearings on this. i was the one who acquiesced. i made that decision. not the parliamentarian of the senate. it was in no way an official action of the senate. i could have fought that referral and kept jurisdiction of this bill in the committee and ignored the armed services committee. i chose not to do that because i know of the interest in that committee on nuclear weapon matters. so i agree to sequential referral on title i. which is the one that we are concerned about. the defense nuclear safety board. we had five hearings in armed services. and we worked out a agreement. i agreed to a compromise on title i. it was not something i fought. we discussed it. the staffs worked together on it. that title was unanimously reported by the armed services committee. so. substantively. there can be no disagreement with this title. the whole bill was voted unanimously out of the governmental affairs committee. and title i. the major part of the bill. was voted out unanimously by the armed services committee. so there was no disagrement on that title. senator exon and senator thurmond both voted for title i. out of the armed services committee. and i agreed with them. i told them informally that whatever i brought to the floor would be that agreedupon version of title i. and that is exactly what i have done. nothing less. in reply to the distinguished floor manager of the bill. i offered to sit down with the distinguished chairman of the committee on energy and natural resources and interested members of the armed service committee to work out a mutually acceptable list of priceanderson conferees on this matter. jurisdiction is not the issue. the issue is nuclear safety for this country. the distinguished senator from louisiana has said that i am a great marine and all that. maybe that means i am supposed to bump my head up against the wall sometimes. i am not sure what the implications of this are. he likened this to a ball game. and murderers row was up. if i have to face murderers row. i will have to face murderers row. that is the way it goes. i have faced a few of those before. sometimes you have to bite the apple where you think it is right. but let us not confuse this situation with a ball game. it is life and death for thousands. perhaps even millions. of americans. safety at the doe nuclear complex has been too long ignored. let me go back to the matter of jurisdiction. the history of this amendment is most instructive. over 3 years ago i led a governmental affairs committee investigation into the management and operation of the feed materials production center in fernald. oh. the fernald site is used by doe to among things. manufacture uranium metal ingots. which are then irradiated in doe production reactors to produce plutonium. what i discovered at fernald was shocking: during the 35 years of the plants operation. more than 300.000 pounds of radioactive uranium had been released into the surrounding air and water. contaminating offsite wells and seriously jeopardizing the health of plant workers and nearby residents. the fernald situation suggested to me that the operation of doe facilities in other states might be equally flawed. dozens of hearings. a study by the national research council of the national academy of sciences. and no less than 1.. gao reports have confirmed that saiety and health at doe nuclear facilities is indeed a nationwide prqblem of critical proportions. i say to the distinguished senator from nebraska. with respect to the report by gao. that my concern is that all things in there have not been addressed. he cannot say that the majority of things have been addressed. i have a statement by gao. who my staff spoke to a little while ago and i will relate some of the remarks. some of the suggestions they have made either been rejected or not yet been fully implemented. they give examples: first. development of a health and safety strategy for the entire weapons complex. second. disposal of 81 percent of transuranic waste. third. establishment of an outside. independent safety board. they say: where recommendations have been accepted by doe. gao has generally not had sufficient time to determine if these recommendations have been successfully implemented. so these items are not considered to be closed yet by gao. let me reiterate that this was a governmental affairs committee investigation from the start. no other committee was looking into this. and i have been looking into this matter for about the last 5 or 6 years. no other committee took any cognizance of this. so i took action on it. and when the senate armed services committee of which i am a member requested sequential referral. i gave it. i did not fight that. the distinguished senator from nebraska knows that i did not bring the issue to the floor and say \"we will not grant a referral.\" it was the governmental affairs committee investigation from the start but that did not make any difference. i was concerned about the substance of the bill i introduced last april to counter does neglect to safety and health. this bill was referred to the governmental affairs committee by the parliamentarian. it was marked up b the governmental affairs committee. and it was reported out unanimously by the governmental affairs committee. it is titles ii and iv of the bill along with title i as modified by the armed services committee that are now before the senate in the form of an amendment to priceanderson. i am a member. as i said. of the armed services committee. and i have nothing but respect for that committees expertise when it comes to matters affecting our nuclear weapon stockpile. that is why i consented to the sequential referral requested by armed services of title i of the billthe title creating a nuclear safety board to oversee safety and health at doe production and utilization facilities. the armed services committee held a series of hearings on this one title alone. five hearings. i believe. were held. and i attended all of those. it was a review that the committee report describes as \"comprehensive.\" so we cannot say that armed services did not get their inning. in the end. the armed services committee unanimously agreed to report out my bill with a favorable recommendation. there were some changes made in title i. and i expressed some reservations about these changes in the committee report. but i went along with it and have assured the leadership of the armed services committee in writingand i will assure them again nowthat i am willing to accept the committees changes because i am convinced that they do not fundamentally alter the structure or purpose of title i. that purpose is very straightforward: to alleviate does conflict of interest between materials production and protection of worker and public safety through outside. expert oversight. i would think they would want that. if i was head of doe i would not only form a committee. i would want the committee to say where there is this doubt about whether we are safe. whether we are going to have a meltdown at one of these plants. i would want that to go to the president. i would ask the president to make that final judgment. i would be stupid if i did not. and yet the secretary of energy fights this and has gotten his fellow secretaries to bring up all these specious objections that i will not have time this morning to go through item by item. i have read those letters and there are plenty of things in there. what it is is a gang up on the other side. murderers row from the administration is what it is. if i were secretary. i would want the president of the united states saying whether we need that production at the expense of safety. and there might be such times that we vnuld want that. but to say we do not even give an outside group the authority to raise issues with the president is preposterous with the track record that doe has established over the past couple of decades. in the end the armed services committee unanimously agreed to report out my bill. as i said. i assure them i am willing to accept their changes. i stress that i would and i have. this is because the main purpose of title i would be preserved. that purpose is to alleviate does conflict of interest between production and safety. let me reiterate that this was a governmental affairs committee investigation from the start. and the bill i introduced last april to counter does neglect of safety and health is a governmental affairs committee bill. it was referred to the governmental affairs committee. marked up by the governmental affairs committee. and reported out unanimously by the govenmental affairs committee. it is titles ii and iv of this bill. along with title i as modified by the armed services have offered the following assurances to my armed services colleagues prior to coming to the floor today: i repeat here: first. i would use the armed services version of title i. second. once affirmatively passed by the senate. i would oppose any effort to exceed the scope of the conference on my amendment. third. i would sit down with members of the armed services and energy committees to work out an agreeable manner for conducting the conference. some of my colleagues on the armed services committee have expressed their desire that i withdraw my amendment and offer title i later on the defense authorization bill. as much as i had hoped to avoid a discussion of this kind on the floor. i cannot go along with my armed services colleagues. let me give three examples of how nuclear safety would be compromised if i were to wait and offer title i on dod authorization. first. waiting for dod authorization would mean yet another delay in addressing does legacy of safety and environmental neglect at its nuclear facilities. since the passage of the atomic energy act. plantworkers. nearby residents. and the public have been increasingly at risk of being poisoned or irradiated by the peacetime operation of the bomb complex. last april i introduced the measure now before the senate to provide some longoverdue protection against the hazards of nuclear weapon materials production. this bill has now been considered by the senate for close to a year. if the dod authorization bill were on the floor today. i would be offering my amendment on that vehicle rather than on the priceanderson act. but are we really prepared to tell our consitituents that nuclear safety must remain on hold once again after all the years and all the reports. 21 gao reports. hearing after hearing after hearing. five on the armed services committee. four this year on this particular legislation on the governmental affairs committee. and i do not even know how many hearings back through the years going back 6 or 7 years that i have been involved with this. are we going to tell the people of this country to put safety on hold again because we have a little jurisdictional fuss between the committees of the senate? what a big deal for the people of this country to know we are more concerned about jurisdiction of the committees than we are the health and safety of the people in this country. i think that is atrocious because that is not the way it is. it was not jurisdiction. i agreed to give the armed services committee jurisdiction at my own volition when requested. it was not something done by the parliamentarian of the senate. let me repeat an offer i made in writing to my colleagues on armed services: if they will support me in attaching title i to priceanderson. and the conference gets held up i will offer an identical amendment to defense authorization when that bill reaches the floor. that way. the public will be assured that oversight of doe nuclear facilities will be established as soon as either bill is signed into law by the president. why on earth would we wait? second. while armed services has offered to accept title i on dod authorization. no similar pledge has been forthcoming for the remainder of my amendment. apart from title i. the other titles involve osha and provision of outside review of doefunded research on the health effects of radiation. we could not get agreement that these titles would be accepted on the dod authorization. if i had that. perhaps we could have made a deal and avoided a confrontation on the floor. these provisions are strongly supported by the labor community because they would guarantee workers a minimum level of protection in what gao has called one of the most hazardous industries in the world. these provisions are an integral part of the overall package i have put together to improve worker and public safety. mr. president. i believe that i have gone the extra mile to satisfy the jurisdictional concerns of the armed services committee. the fundamental issue here is not jurisdiction. it is nuclear safety. i cannot emphasize this strongly enough. our nations securityboth in terms of the reliability of the production complex and the protection of the public from a nuclear catastropherequires that we act swiftly and comprehensively to promote nuclear safety. this has been going on for some 35 years and it is time we took action on this. for more than 35 years. doe and its predecessor agencies have disregarded safety and health in the name of nuclearweapon materials production. behind the veil of secrecy. the doe bomb complex is rife with potentially unsafe reactor designs. deteriorating processing plants. sloppy operations. and disregard of internal reports documenting safety and environmental deficiences. the workers at these plants. nearby residents. and the general public have waited long enough for protection from this threat. we cannot keep them on hold for jurisdictional disputes that should have been long resolved. let me address one other thing while i have the floor. mr. president. how much time do i have remaining?"},{"1":"1987","2":"BYRD","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. i am pleased to introduce today the clean coal technology deployment act. i believe that the development of clean coal technologies is essential to our energy and economic security. clean coal deployment will preserve jobs as well as create new ones. it will promote competitiveness of our energyintensive industries. and it will improve the quality of our environment. now and for future generations. mr. president. my bill will encourage the commercial deployment of clean coal technologies by providing 3.5 billion dollars worth of matching grants over a 10year period. this legislation will also remove some federal regulatory impediments to the use of selected innovative technologies. this approach is the natural next step in the clean coal technology demonstration program that i supported 3 years ago. that program has successfully demonstrated a number of innovative control technologies that were not yet ready for commercial scale applications. now there are a number of technologies that are ready for such applications. the problem we now face is that that although the utility industry is eager to push the frontiers of clean coal technology. there are high risks associated with demonstrating those new technologies. an individual utility might not be able to afford to risk plant reliability and environmental performance. however. once a utility takes this risk. and successfully applies the technology. all utilities and all their ratepayers benefit from having a new improved option available for generating electric power. the experience of those first few units reduces the technological risks for everyone else. what this bill will do is provide the extra insurance that utilities need in order to deploy those first few projects. the insurance comes in two forms. one is direct financial assistance. with the federal share limited to 50 percent of a projects cost. the other is in providing assurance to utilities that whatever costs they incur in deploying these technologies for everyones benefit will be treated fairly by federal and state regulators. once the initial steps have been taken. widespread deployment can follow. i submit that this is just the kind of situation in which government funding is effective. even essential. in allowing society to reap significant benefits. what are the benefits of the next generation of clean coal technology? they are numerous. first of all. clean coal is the key to a secure energy future for all of us. coal is our most abundant indigenous energy resource. at least fossil energy resource. the more cleanly and efficiently we burn it. the more assured we are of our energy independence for the foreseeable future. our nations electricity supply capability may be seriously tested before the end of this century. the department of energy recently issued the energy security study and confirmed that very serious energy shortfalls are likely to occur unless immediate action is undertaken on several fronts. i am told that many experts are now predicting that the united states will require 100.000 to 200.000 megwatts of additional new electric generating capacity this century. much of this new capacity will be coal fired. the newer technologies integrate environmental concerns into plant design. whereas current technology sacrifices efficiency in order to accommodate addon control technology. new clean coal technologies are both cleaner and more efficient. new clean coal technologies can meet this demand and increasingly stringent environmental and siting requirements without sacrificing productivity. such plants can be constructed in modular fashion to better match capacity additions with actual demand. thus assuring future electricity supply in the most costeffective manner. according to recent congressional testimony provided by the electric power research institute [epriu: new clean coal technology now under development could reduce the cost of this neessary capacity expansion by more than 50 percent relative to current experience. lower electricity costs translate into savings in all of our monthly bills. lower electricity -rates for industrial firms will improve industrial competitiveness and our balance of payments. the clean coal program will impose our competitiveness in other ways as well. if we do not develop and deploy these technologies ourselves. other countries will. we now have the opportunity to gain a comparative advantage in producing clean coal technologies for our domestic needs as well as for export to foreign customers. if we miss this opportunity. we will wind up importing these technologies. adding still more red ink to our trade deficit. clean coal technology will also help solve the acid rain problem. all of the acid rain control bills introduced to date force us to make the hobbesian choice between the severe economic dislocation of fuel switching on the one hand. and the enormous expense of conventional scrubber technology on the other hand. large scale coal switching would cause unemployment in northern west virginia to increase by 17 percent. a full scrubbing approach would cost west virginia ratepayers over $1 billion per year. that would translate into industrial electricity price increases of 15 percent to 40 percent. increases of that magnitude to electricity intensive industries could undermine our ability to compete in the international marketplace. clean coal is a way out of this dilemma. if we are willing to put in the time and money to make this program work. we will achieve longterm reductions in the emissions of acid rain precursors. mr. president. i hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation. i note that the administration. which at one time staunchly opposed the clean coal program. is now one of the programs strongest advocates. in this years budget request. for the first time the administration asked for funding for the clean coal program over the next several years. on march 19. the president announced that he would seek $2.5 billion in new appropriations over the next 5 years for the demonstration and deployment of clean coal technologies. i will not speculate on what might have caused this rather dramatic turnaround. but i warmly embrace any support from the president for a program i have long believed is of great national importance. with the presidents shared commitment to the development and deployment of clean coal technologies. i feel certain that. together we can craft a productive. national clean coal programone that is helpful and supportive of the needs of our good neighbors to the north. and importantly. at the same time. one that is productive and targeted toward benefiting the people of the united states. mr. president. i ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and a sectionbysection analyses be made a part of the record at this point."},{"1":"1986","2":"SHAW","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. for those of us who have made a

particular tribute to the patience and the efforts that all of my colleagues showed in bringing to the house a compromise that has been offered in the form of legislation sponsored by the distinguished majority leader. mr. wright. and the distinguished minority leader. mr. michel. i believe this action shows the importance that the leadership on both sides of the aisle attach to the programmatic aspects of the bill. i want to make it clear. i take no position at this time and make no suggestions to the house with regard to the tax portions of the legislation. those matters are. of course. within the jurisdiction of another committee. and that committee should make the necessary recommendations on the tax portions of the bill to my colleagues in the house. with regard to the content of the legislation. there will be an abundance of time for the explanation of the provisions of the legislation. suffice it to say. that essentially it is a compromise between the amendments reported by the committee on public works and the committee on energy and commerce. and suffice it to say. that although there has been give on both sides. the package is fully acceptable to. and is supported by. the leadership in both committees on both sides. my good friend from pennsylvania recently had some comments about budgets and budget costs. there are certain things that are not subject to quantification. one is the cleanup of hazardous waste sites which threaten not only the environment but the health and the wellbeing of american people everywhere. more importantly. these sites not only threaten all americans health now but. even if there is no new hazardous w*aste generated from this moment forward. there is significant peril to future generations through contamination of soil and surface water. subsurface water. the water supplies. the air and the other environmental dependencies of this nation. i would urge my colleagues to recognize that the cost of this cleanup may be one of the best investments that can be found in the budget document. the need to finance this fully and adequately is extremely important. the number of sites is something above 10.000. and may be as high as 20.000. the peril is enormous to our citizens. it is particularly obvious when you go to places like love canal or globe. az. it is also apparent when you look at the contamination of major aquifers like the ogallala aquifer. which begins at the canadian border and flows south to the gulf. this aquifer has a tremendous impact on the millions of people. who are dependent upon it. remember. a third of our population is dependent upon aquifers for clean water. the effect is enormous. we have a limited time to deal with this issue. i am urging my colleagues to move speedily to resolve this matter. and it is my hope that consideration of this legislation can be con cluded today at least insofar as the programmatic parts are concerned. i am urging action today. not tomorrow. but today. because it is important that we provide funding to clean up one -of the major environmental problems of this nation. . it must be observed that the funding portions expired september 30. at that time there was something like $130 million available in the fund for. the cleanup of hazardous waste sites. those funds are being expended. not only are the funds approaching an intolerably low level in terms of addressing the problems of cleanup but the program is also beginning to lose momentum. it is extremely important. my colleagues should know. that we move forward rapidly today to

the navigation season on the upper great lakes and a 10month extension on the st. lawrence seaway. traditionally. the navigation season in the upper great lakes has ended on december 15. plus or minus 2 weeks. the corps proposal extends the navigation season through the construction of bubblers. iceboons. underwater dams. harbor and channel dredging and widening. and the use of a fleet of new icebreakers. the corps presently estimates the projects initial investment cost to the united states at over $600 million. the corps 1979 draft \"survey study for great lakes and st. lawrence seaway navigation season extension\" prompted extensive criticism. a series of major studies raised substantial questions about the corps analysis of the projects economic benefits. its real costs. and its potential environmental impact. i am pleased to have this opportunity to share with my colleagues an analysis of the current proposal. prepared by geraldine strozier for outdoor america. the publication of the izaak walton league of america. ms. strozier correctly analyzes the discrepancies between the various corps and private reports devoted to a great lakes season extension. she does a fine job. as well. addressing the numerous problems and lack of support for the current proposal. [prom outdoor americal winm navioatoina bruon*-dollar booxoooots? (by geraldine strosler) at this moment there is a struggle going on in congress over one of the most ambitiousand potentially environmentally damagingpublic works projects ever undertaken by this nation. in a unanimous vote last summer. the house public works committee authorized the u.s. army corps of engineers to undertake the task of keeping the great lakes open to commercial shipping year round. because of severe winter conditions. the lakes are typically closed from middecember to early april. the shipping extension has the backing of some influential great lakes congresmem. in particular. rep. arlan stangeland (rminn.). supporters claim that yearround lake shipping would provide a cheaper way of transporting midwestern grain. steel. coal and other commoditles to eastern markets. and. they say it would revive a sagging great lakes shipping industry while aiding recessionwracked port cities. the proposal. however. has brought a storm of protest from a wide army of opponents. including environmentalists. some other great lakes congressmen. canadian officials. the governors of michigan. ohio. new york. wisconsin and minnesota. homeowners. fishermen and taxpayers. incredibly. the list of opponents even includes most of the groups supposed to benefit from winter shipping. the proposals critics believe that its extraordinary cost. estimated by some experts to be as high as $50 billion. makes no sense at a time wherk the country has severe economic problems. the steel industry. which is in a recession. doesnt have the shipping volume to warrant an extension of the navigation season. the lake carriers association. which represents shippers. and the national grange. which represents agricultural interests. have both gone on record opposing the proposal because of its extraordinary cost to the public. but cost isnt the only controversial aspect of the proposal. if approved. it will involve massive environmental destruction. according to michigan united conservation clubs (mucc). which is spearheading the opposie 1890 may a 1984 tion. \"winter navigntion would be disastrous for the great lakes. it would usher in a new era in manipulation and degradation of the great lakes and st. lawrence river ecosystem.\" the winter navigation proposal has been around for years. it was initially introduced by influential members of congress from minnesota in the booming days of the steel industry to promote their states iron ore business and to make u.8. steel corp.s new giant ore boats economical by allowing them to operate year round. in 1970. congress asked the detroit district of the corps to undertake a demonstration project to see whether the idea was feasible. in a 1979 report. the corps concluded that winter shipping on the great lakes was economically viable. the corps determined that winter navigatiop would require the use 22 new leebreakers to smash up the lee. a massive rebuilding of locks and erection of huge underwater dams and dikes to control the breakup and movement of the ice: and the dredging and widening of the st. marys river and the virtual redigging of the st. lawrence river in order to accommodate both ships and the displaced ice. even with these expensive modifications. the corps estimated that profits from the increased shipment of commodities and the creation of new jobs aboard the vessels and in great lakes ports would produce a return of $4 for every $1 invested in the project. virtually every other study of the project. however. has contradicted the corps conclusions. a series of reportsincluding one commissioned by the state of new york. one by the canadian seaway authority. another by the u.s. general accounting office and even one commissioned by the corps itself and then ignoredfound that the corps had overstated the benefits. understated the costs. simply ignored the environmental damage involved in tearing up the ice cover and assumed that roughly half the cost would be borne by canada although that government has expressed its opposition to the project. most damaging of all. the corps own oversight board recognized many of these problems and refused to recommend the project to congress. the corps claims the project will cost $1 billion. but other studies put the figure anywhere from $9 billion to $50 billion. the wide variation due to the corps own contradictory statements of exactly what is involved. from every independent analysis. it is clear that winter navigation would become far and away the nations most expensive public works water project. representing an enormous subsidy to the shippers using the great lakes and an enormous loss to those who hunt and fish there. as well as to the general taxpayer footing the billall for a handful of benefits that virtually every study. even including one sponsored by the corps. has cast doubt upon. the economic benefits the corps attributes to the project are arrived at partially by ignoring environmental costs. ro make the deal look less costly. for example. the corps has not made clear the details of its massive construction plans. according to bob haas. a biologist with the michigan department of natural resources and an expert on the effects of winter navigation on the great lakes. the hidden agenda. he said. includes huge dikes on the detroit and st. clair rivers and the dredging of the middle neebish channel in the st. marys river. all prime fishing areas. the corps is hiding the specifics. he said. to prove that winter navigation is economically beneficial. a position that is \"ridiculous.\" he said. \"they havent even begun to estimate potential losses in aquatic habitat and produc. tivity due to the project.\" moreover. even though recreation is a primary industry in michigan. the corps has failed to assign it an economic value. he pointed out. the corps has. therefore. totally failed to estimate \"losses in recreational benefits. whether they be economic. esthetle or whatever. i submit to you that these could be very substantial losses.\" the corps argument against including the cost of environmuntal damage rests on its promise to study potential environmental problems as the project progresses and correct them as they are identified. hence. the corps argues. there will be no environmental damage. if a problem arises that cannot be resolved. the corps promises it will halt construction. however. many conservationists believe that once substantial money and time have been invested in the project. the corps will not easily abandon it. the u.s. environmental protection agency is among those that have challenged the corps reasoning. in 1979. the agencys midwest regional administrator officially told the corps. \"we have serious reservations about potential environmental impacts that could result\" from the \"inherent uncertainty of this type of approach.\" while no one can prove with absolute certainty the harm winter navigation will do to the environment. conservationists point to a number of different ways in which the project could do serious damage."},{"1":"1983","2":"MOYNIHAN","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"madam president. even with our proposed cuts. the corps of engineers will still receive $141 million in supplemental appropriations for operation and maintenance. emergency flood control work. and maintenance along the mississippi river. the bureau of reclamation will receive $79.3 million for construction. operation and maintenance. and its loan program. our amendment specifies that all funds appropriated to the corps. the bureau of reclamation. and epa will remain available only until september 30. 1983. the committee bill would allow the funds to remain available until expended. we believe this provision is consistent with the purposes of this emergency jobs legislation. our amendment reduces the corps construction appropriation from $85 million to zero. the assistant secretary of the army testified before the environment and public works committee that the corps has requested congress to defer a total of $180 million from the fiscal year 1983 construction budget. obviously. the corps does not believe it can obligate additional construction funds in this fiscal year. part of the corps $180 million deferral of construction funds will be directed to additional operation and maintenance. $110 million. therefore. our aimendment provides only an additional $76 million for operation and maintenance. oor amendment further reduces the committee appropriation to the mississippi rlvrr and tributaries project. this project is presently receiving $209 million !n the fiscal year 1983 budget. the presidents fiscal year 1984 budget request includes an additional $290 million. the total cost of this project is over $10 billion. nearly $3.5 billion has already been spent. our amendment also provides $25 million for flood emergency preparation. flood fighting and rescue operations. and repair of flood control and federal hurricane or shore protection works. it also will provide for emergency supplies of clean drinking water where the source has been contaminated and in drought distressed areas. provision of adequate supplies of water for human and livestock consumption. the allocations for the bureau of reclamation suggested by our amendment are identical to those proposed by the bureau in its fiscal year 1983 supplemental appropriations request. which has not yet been sent to congress. the presidents fiscal year 1984 budget request includes an overall increase in the bureaus construction budget of $115 million. a 20percent increase over 1983 levels. in summary. i believe our amendment is responsive to the national need to put americans back to productive work. responsive to our desire for a regionally equitable distribution of scarce construction dollars. and responsive to the nations goal of achieving clean waters in the decade. madam president. the purpose which has brought senator chafee and me to the floor is something which has brought us and other senators to the floor over the past half dozen years. it is the great disparity in both regional terms and in terms of the spectrum of available projects in our water resources programa disparity which may once have served the regions and the sectors. you might say. of water that was advanced under these arrangements. but which no longer does. the disparities are such as to have produced a reluctance in the other regions. in congress. in institutions across the nation. to maintain these programs at the level at which they need to be retained. one result is that the last real rivers and harbors bill. as it might be described. passed the congress in 1970. the carter administration came and went with none. this administration might well do the same. the construction programs of the corps of engineers declined precipitously across the seventies. and they will decline further into this time. the needs of general purpose water systems are neglected while the irrigation programs and flood control programs that are also needed are not funded. and this is the sectoral imbalance i speak of. the program we have before us is characteristic. in the house an enormous amount of money. more than onehalf of a billion dollars. was simply plugged into this bill for corps of engineers projects. to be open about i. as the house was. in the lower mississippi. another $101 million was just tacked on to the bureau of reclamation. which is by definition 17 western states. and nothing for any other purpose and nothing for any other region. this is a jobs bill but not a penny of the corps of engineers construction money can be spent in anything like a timeframe that would have effects upon employment unless you anticipate a decade of depression. the typical project of the corps takes 10 to 15 years to embark upon. this is a jobs bill. the bureau of reclamation can put it into effect to the point that we provide for it. and here is the point i should like to make now. what do we propose? we propose to reduce the amount available to the bureau of reclamation from $101 million to $79.3 million. seventynine point three million. madam president. is exactly the sum the bureau of reclamation requested in writing on feb. ruary 16. saying their moneys had been reduced for 1983. they would like more. they explained exactly what they would like. where they would like it-$79.3 million that can be spent and will be spent in the timeframe we are talking about. for the corps of engineers we reduced the construction program to nothing. for the simple reason that there is no prospect of any construction taking place as a result of such an appropriation. we keep the operation and maintenance moneys which can be spent and should be spent. exactly the sums the house and its appropriations committee provided. may i say. madam president. that in testimony before the committee on environment and public works. the very able assistant secretary of the army. who is responsible for the corps. mr. william gianeili. testified that he would like to have his construction appropriations for this year reduced by $180 million as he had no prospect of spending them in any useful sense. now. madam president. to conclude. what we then propose is to provide $200 million to the environmental protection agency construction grant program with the provision that this money be obligated by the end of the fiscal year. september 30. it will create jobs. it will create jobs equitably and everywhere. no one knows this in more detail than the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on environmental pollution. my friend and colleague from rhode island. who is the cosponsor of this measure. i wonder if he would like to speak about what the program will do."},{"1":"1982","2":"PORTER","3":"E","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. the 500th year anniversary of the discovery of north america is approaching. the year 1992 will mark 500

would be the most attractive area for a worlds fair to close the 20th century in glory. optimism. and creativity. chicagos plan included pictures of the site. charts. over 700 pages of documents. and a multimedia show using 16 slide projectors and a 16millimeter movie projector. the new york times described chicagos approach to the review bureau in paris as a grand effort \"to extol the windy citys virtues with fire and thunder.\" e 3496 public initiative aided the private sectors blitz to make the 1992 fair a reality. the fair corp. and mayor jane byrne of chicago hosted a fourperson inspection team from paris in may 1982. immediately before the provisional approval was given by the bie. they acted as i welcoming committee in order to dazzle the delegates from paris during their visit to chicago. a \"whirlwind of briefing sessions and dining\" entertained the visitors. chicago had previously been designated in washington. d.c. as the u.s. candidate for a 1990s worlds fair. the hosts wanted to assure initial approvrl by the paris council in june 1982. the final go ahead will be granted at the bies general assembly meeting in november or december 1982. gloriously drawn siaps describe a 500acre lakefront site. 200 acres of which will be landfill in lake michigan. more specifically. the area is delimited by balbo drive on the north end of the city to 31st street to the south. the illinois central gulf railroad tracks to the west. and the lake/ landfill area on the east. seventeen sites were proposed by major architectural firms in the city. including skidmore. owings and merrill. builders of the world famous skyscraper. the john hancock building. major monuments already standing on the site grounds include chicagos shedd aquarium. the adler planetarium. the field museum. soldier field. and meigs field. the people of illinois and chicago are excited by the many ideas for this global celebration. fair c -rps outline includes great expectations for the fair. various boards of the city. the bureau of street traffic. bureau of transportation planning. chicago urban transportation district. chicago transit authority. chicago area transportation study. illinois department of transportation. and the traffic consulting and urban planning firm of bartonaschman associates. have made predictions of the fairs success. the planners foresee: 65 million visitors between april and october. exhibits from 70 countries. new jobs. parks. transportation lines. hotels. beaches. and harbors. millions of dollars in revenue from enhanced trade and commerce. finally. a onceinalifetime education available to fairgoers of all ages. these ideas are just samplings of the shining outcome of the age of discovery. in anticipation of the fair the corporation hopes to accomplish city improvements to aid crowd control as well as visitors access to the fair grounds. the dan ryan expressway will be widened from 8 to 10 lanes between the eisenhower and stevenson expressway interchanges in the downtownlakefront area. a south loop connector expressway will run north from the present stevenson expressway to a large remote parking lot at 18th street north of chicagos chinatown area. the south loop new town is a rapidly selfimproving area. further positive mutations are planned: shifting the northbound lanes of lake shore drive to allow motoring along the lakefront. as well as a new interchange to serve soldier field. eastwest pedestrian walkways and bridges at three points west of the fairgrounds will help fairgoers cros the illinois central gulf railroad tracks. the festival planners are appropriately seizing the opportunity and spirit of the worlds fair to benefit the city and enhance transportation along the sparkling freshwater shores of lake michigan. of major concern to the planners is daily crowd management. 700.000 visitors are expected each day where 34.000 parking spaces are available. the city will prepare itself to receive the overflow. parking lots to facilitate the accommodation of thousands of cars will replace where the amtrak rail road stands at present. cost allocations shared by private and public sectors will be pstablished to fund the ambitious. inspiring projects. projected cost of the improvements runs near $200 million. a sum. incidentally. substantially less than the cost of the senate office building extension. a healthy exchange of ideas is occurring each day concerning daily fair management. a giant fleet of busesabout 455will shuttle visitors to and from the loop area. two hundred of the 2.400 buses of the ctas line will be used. a rail shuttle bordering the chicago riverbank. as well as passenger boats floating through lake michigan and the chicago river are speculations and considerations to aid tourist mobility. a prominent transportation project includes a rapid transit line running between chicagos midway airport and the downtown loop. the motivation for this transportation project is a product of much of the success from work already in progress: the rapid transit extension to the nations busiest airport. ohare international. the facelift of the \"l\". the downtown loops elevated metro. and the connection of the dan ryan and howard rapid transit lines. it is evident that lively enthusiasm characterizes the attitudes of the mappers of this future world celebration. transportation considerations accompany practical considerations such as sewer and water connections. and construction on the sanitary districts deep tunnel below the chicago river. these renovations have practical future implications. the sewer and waterlines will be needed as the near south side changes from an unpopulated railyard area to a residential neighborhood. success will be assured for the worlds fair group because of their attempt to consider the needs of a variety of sections of the city as well as the future impact of their actions and improvements for these areas. chicago hosted two worlds fairs previously. the 1893 columbian exposition realized profits of $500.000 as well as the 193334 chicago worlds fair \"century of progress\" which also realized $500.000 in profits. the 1992 fairs $700 million price is expected to be covered and to produce a profit as well. the year 1992 seems a far jump in time. yet many are looking beyond that year to the citys future. futuristic communication and transit systems are being considered: a monorail linking mccormick place. a major national convention center on the lakefront. to the heart of the city further west. or. perhaps. a weatherfree tunnel to soldier field. these sophisticated systems would remain once the fair is dismantled. the planners ideas are imaginative and provocative. guaranteed to create a jubilant. significant worlds fair. environmentalists are voicing their interest and concerns for the \"age of discovery\" fair. a manmade island along chicagos lakefront could impact on lake currents. shoreline erosion. fish and wildlife. navigation. as well as recreation and water quality. three sources of landfill are being considered: sand dunes from the state of michigan. industrial slag. or rock from chicagos deep tunnel project for water pollution and flood control. the new islands landmass is expected to cost $120 million. the u.s. environmental protection agency. the illinois environmental protection agency. and the illinois transportation department are agencies involved in the assessment of costs and planning. some of the environmentalists appear to want to place blockades in the path of success on which the fair is riding. thomas g. ayers. president of fair corp.. comments that doomsayers like to \"point out that these are recessionary times * * * that this is not a prudent time to be planning such a large undertaking.\" certainly. negative voices are vocalized often when inspiring forwardreaching ideas are set forth. rather. the fair is medicine at a crucial point in our economic period. thirty thousand temporary jobs will be created. tax revenues produced. and an enduring cultural educational experience. despite ever present pessimism. the significance of a worlds fair in chicago is dawning. injecting excitement and spirit in all who come into contact with the plans for the festivities. stunning architectural introductions have marked world fairs since 1851. the crystal palace designed by joseph paxton in london was a landmark of the 1851 london world fair. the crystal place was 1.848 feet long and 108 feet tall. prefabricated glass. iron. and wood were assembled in less than 5 months. paris famous eiffel tower was erected in 1889 at the paris exposition universelle. renowned architects such as louis sullivan. charles atwood. and frank lloyd wright have all constructed innovae 3 49 7 tive buildings in the city and surrounding suburbs. louis sullivan designed ite neoclassical buildings along -.e south side lakefront in the 1893 columbian exposition. charles atwood designed the museum of science and industry. as well as an early skyscraper in the loop. the reliance building. well ahead of his time. the prairie school design by frank lloyd wright. and the holabird & roche style in chicago both contrasted the neoclassic trend introduced in chicago at that time. daniel burnham devised a lakefront park system for chicago in 1909. burnham drew many ideas directly from the 1893 columbian exposition. the art nouveau style in 1900 predominated the paris fair at the turn of the century. art deco made a great impact 25 years later in 1925 at the exposition international des arts decoratifs et industriels modernes. art deco made a profound statement in the united states. especially in new york city at rockefeller center. four years later. in 1929. at the barcelona international exposition mies van der rohe installed an elegant marble and glass pavilion. for which he also designed a chair covered in white leather. the celebrated barcelona chair. recent world fair architectural experiments have includrd. in 1960. alfred caldwells 2.000 feet square. 18 stories high cablesuspended roof building which could hold 1 million persons. the university of illinois chicago circle campus produced a plan for an inflatable exhibition structure 1 mile long and 500 feet wide. bigness. beauty. and computerassisted structure engineering will all aid architectural modern thinking at chicagos 1992 worlds fair. the history of worlds fairs is long and impressive. the first recorded fairs mentioned in the bible were held in asia and africa before the birth of christ. often. fairs were religious celebrations. merchants and people throughout the middle ages traveled hundreds of miles to attend fairs. their lives were much more lonely than our lives today. and the week of a fair was an exciting time when they could meet and be merry and gay with many other people. in 1851 in london the \"great exhibition of the works of industry of all nations\" was set in hyde park. at this fair antoine sax displayed his new invention. the saxophone. the united states displayed the colt revolver. mccormicks reaper for harvesting farmers fields. chewing tobacco. and false teeth. in 185354 america held its first worlds fair in new york. china. glass. artificial flowers. hats. wigs. modern transportation including horsedrawn carriages. and fire engines were displayed. farm machinery. taylors printing press. houses telegraph. and cannons showed the progress of industry and invention. in 1876. the centennial exhibition was held in philadelphia. new inventions at this fair included a refrigerator car for use in trains. the latest printing press. thomas edisons automatic telegraph. and the typewriter. alexander graham bell brought his new talking instrument to the exhibition. 167 buildings were constructed. and the new corliss steam engine powered all the fair machinery. an enormous elevator could house 40 people and carried fairzoers to the top of an observatory. chicago hosted the 1893 worlds columbian exposition to commemorate the 400th anniversary of columbus discovery of america in 1492. george washington gale ferris. an engineer. constructed the ferris wheel which held 36 cars each large enough to hold 36 people in one car. over 1.000 men. women. and children revolved each time the wheel turned. this fair was described as the \"white city\" because the buildings shone marble white. the palace of electricity was a special attraction. the question was raised about electricity similar to the questions being raised today about nuclear energy: would it be a dangerous toy. or a new power to serve man? george westinghouse developed a new electric light bulb to light the fair. the first electric railway in the world indicated the progress being made in transportation. st. louis hosted the 1904 universal exposition to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the louisiana purchase. by 1904 cars and airplanes were modern wonders. iced tea was a clever innovation at this fair which refreshed hundreds of visitors. a crafty concessionaire dreamed up the ice cream cone. so one could hold the creamy cold substance while walking. nearly every state had a building. s ad the st. louis fair provided the stadium for the first olympic games ever held in america. two california worlds fairs. san francisco in 1915. and san diego in 191516. celebrated the completion of the panama canal. the san francisco fair was called the panamapacific international exposition. thomas edison attended this fair. also called the light fair. a transcontinental telephone line connected california and new jersey. the panamacalifornia international exposition in san diego was a grand showplace. farming and car exhibits adorned the fair. one could park his car on one of the first and. then. largest parking lots for 25 cents. chicago held the worlds fair in 193334 and called it the century of progress. the 1933 fair celebrated science and industry as well as chicagos 100th anniversary. in 1833. 100 years earlier. fort dearborn was a swampy outpost hardly resembling the magnificent city that chicago had become by 1933. an elevator lifted crowds to a rocket platform where a car would then transport passengers from one tall tower to another. the drama of transportation exhibit revealed henry fords lifework and the future of transportation. san francisco hosted the golden gate international exposition in 193940. the completion of two new bridges. the san franciscooakland bay bridge and the golden gate bridge. was celebrated. in the same years. 193940. new york city projected the world of tomorrow. new york city celebrated the 150th anniversary of the inauguration of george washington as president of the united states. new yorks building the world of tomorrow fair introduced nylon. home airconditioning. and television. a time capsule was encased and erected to tell the story of our civilization as it was in 1939. the start of the atomic age marked the brussels world fair in 1958. atomic powerplants. an atomic powered clock. and space sattelites were the u.s. exhibits. \"man in the space age\" was the theme of the seattle worlds fair 4 years following the brussels fair. in j962. a 600foot space needle was cofbstructed in seattle with a revolving top. a 4.600 gallon pool of perfume and a 25.000 pound cake added flamboyance to seattles fair. in new york between 1964 and 1965 an enormous unisphere towered 135 feet in the air. flushing meadow park held this worlds fair. \"mans achievements on a shriying globe in an expanding univers.. during the same decade the lincoln center for the performing arts in new york city opened. shea stadium remains a permanent reminder of this fair. most recently. the knoxville worlds fair. \"energy turns the world.\" is in progress. and by the end of the summer of 1982 11 million people will have visited knoxville to view 1980s energy development and deployment capabilities. the history of worlds fairs has been active and spectacular. chicagos \"age of discovery\" in 1992 will prove to be just as spectacular. probably more so. hundreds of national and international exhibits. concerts. theater productions. business. science and industry shows. as well as an amusement park will ehtertain crowds daily. cries of support for the fair have surfaced in all parts of the city. chicago is a tough. enduring city of the future. the chicago tribune portrays that \"chicago always has been a city of vitality and growthrising from the ashes of a devastating fire to become an international mecca of business and commerce.\" the fair will benefit the entire city because visitors will want to explore all corners of the city. ethnic neighborhoods. and restaurants. a worlds fair in 1992 could be to chicago like a family having friends to dinner. the entire city. like a house. will be spruced up to make the best impression possible. chicago is not waiting for the economy to turn around. yet through action it is cause 3498 july 27. 1982 congr ing a turn around. this positive spirit has made the city great. \"chicago has built its reputation on transforming dreams into realities. and as such. has always been the master of its destiny.\" chicago is setting the example on how to close the 20th century in pomp and pageantry. the citizens of the city and illinois welcome the world to the chicago worlds fair in 1992 the \"age of discovery\" will be an age of discovery of the city of chicago by millions from every nation. the \"age of discovery\" will also exhibit the genious of freedom and democracy as well as the infinite capabilities of every man and woman where a spirit of peace and cooperation abounds. when discovery occurs progress is made which reaffirms mans intuitive comnmitment to the enrichment of life of earth.

published by the mayfield messenger.* the messengers editorial writer points out how the excessive importation of foreign products into this country is stifling american production in mayfield and throughout the nation. september .9.1981 congi i feel the editorial is one which should be shared with my colleagues and i wish to do so at this time. the editorial follows: there is no doubt that imports are destroying jobs at a rate that is absolutely unacceptable for a healthy economy. this paper cannot understand why any legislator would permit such a large inbalance of trade with foreign countries of hundreds of products which flood our market place and cause the demise of small and large businesses alike. this editorial asks why. when our economy is suffering. and while there have been wholesale layoffs in the automobile and allied industries. that the administration. the house. and the senate are insensitive to this situation. all it will take is to put a quota on products or demand parity with any country. the main offender is japan. whose government. subsidizes their industries and dumps some $13 billion in cars and hundreds of electronic products intd the united states every year. voluntarism on theirpart while commuendable is hardly the proper manner to approach so vital a matter. just stop it or demand that we sell to them as much as they sell to us and do this in every country where the inbalance is so great. one out of every 5 workers in the. u.s. is employed because of the automotive industry. many workers here in mayfield are not working because imports of clothing and automobiles. it is past time when we can continue to buy foreign made products. it is time for businesses to know where their products are coming from. the public should look at the labels and try where possible to buy u.s. made products. those who defend an \"open and free market\" note that it is a two way street and when we act to restrict imports. we could be jeopardizing jobs here in this nation. we are not suggesting absolute parity. with every country. but primarily japan. which spends virtually nothing on their own defense. while we maintain a vast arsenal for their defense costing us billions of dollars. they take the money they save and help their industries undersell us. all the advantages are going to them while unemployment in this country is excessive. especially here where we could be furnishing tires for american made vehicles and enhance the sales and profits of our largest industry. general tire and rubber company. this is the largest plant of general tire and if demand increases. we could expect it to reap the benefits. consequently. this would mean more unemployed put. back to work. it is no secret that foreign labor has the reputation for less work stoppages. higher productivity. and generally lower rates of paylper hour. these are problems that can be solved in this country with negotiations that take into consideration both labor and management needs. labor must make wages necessary for them to have a decent living standard. management must have the .prerogatives to manage. in these times of doubledigit inflation. where the survival of. plants and jobs are at stake. it is imperative that any advers~ary situation be avoided and that negotiations be made in a positive. intelligent manner reflecting the responsibilities of both parties. we believe this can be done and that circumstances have dictited here and across the nation that everyone give their best effort to whatever job they have. otherwise. we can expect worse conditions than now exist. a good attitude and a new appreciation of the necessity of higher productivity would ~ssional recordextensions of remarks do wonders for this nation. we are optiistic that the economy will improve. but it depends upqfl every individual having an appreciation of the free enterprise system. the present administration is on the right track by curtailing costly regulations. lowering taxes. seeking to balance the budget. eliminating an intolerable bureaucracy. and seeking to turn. government back to the people. government exists. because we created it. it needs at every level to recognize that to be an elected representative requires an understanding that government is our servant and not our master. please write to the president. representative

island. pa. 1. ticularly the city of woonsocket. thf s i am pleased to see finally settled. it - the issue of industrial cost recovery i the clean water act. if there is on o water act issue having a significan o burning effect on our small businesse i especially textiles. our cities and town! r our food processors and general manu h facturers. it is icr. of course the legislation we are con sidering here deals with many section of the water act. but icr is the on i which has occupied the greatest amoun of my attention. s. 2725 repeals icr. i might add tha the repeal is probably the one issue tha the house and senate agreed upon ii this clean water reauthorization bill. thi senate had voted repeal of the provisior earlier on in its reauthorization bill. s 2725 which we are considering tonight * the story of how we got here is an interesting one. to say the least. icr was originally enacted in the 1971 clean water legislation. the provision requires that industrial users of a municipal sewage plant pay for that portion ol the federal share of the plants construction costs which is attributable tc the treatment of the industrial wastes. the administrative burden falls on the towns and cities who must collect these charges. because of these administrative burdens and harsh economic effects on our industries the congress mandated a moratorium on icr in the 1977 clean water amendments and required the environmental protection agency to study the effects of icr on industry and communities. both in rural areas and in economically distressed or high unemployment regions. the conclusion of that study was submitted to the congress in january 1979. the epa administrator determined that icr is not doing its job. the provision fails to accomplish the purposes that were outlined in that original study. namely. parity. water conservation. appropriate capacity. and selfsufficiency. the epa study did not contain horror stories of closed plants or lost jobs. but icr is indeed a factor when an industry decides whether to expand or locate a new plant in a particular area. so we are talking about a loss of potential jobs in a community. if that community must assess an icr charge because of construction grant expenditures after 1973. i also firmly believe that icr is one of a combination of factors that causes a marginal business to shut down and emplovees to lose their jobs. ive heard it with my own ears. from the rhode island textile industry. we do not want to lose what industry and jobs we do have in communities such as woonsocket. i cannot stand here and watch that happen. last session i introduced an icr repeal bill. s. 901. in december 1979 the .- congress voted to extend the icr ir moratorium until june 1980. even epa had recommended such an extension. .n this past april. along with senator n bentsen. senator pressler. and senator cochran. i again introduced icr legislaw tion. this was after the senate environment and public works committee. parlt ticularly the environmental pollution is subcommittee held hearings in march of n this year on the icr provision. e at that time. the epa. local officials. t industries. and other groups presented s. their thoughts on icr. the cities of 3. nashville and dallas. both members of - the association of metropolitan sewerage agencies. testified strongly in favor of - repeal. representatives of the textile. s food processors. brewers. and the pulp e and paper industries likewise wanted t repeal. the senate environment committee t voted to repeal icr and the full senate t agreed. the repeal was added to a pendn ing clean water reauthorization bill. the e subject which we are addressing today. 1 the house committee had also included . repeal in their bill. and our environment and public works committee has reached agreement with the house on the items which were in disagreement in the two bills * * * so that if we act today. there will be no need for a conference. we can send to the president a bill which reauthorizes important sections of clean water legislation. including the rural clean water program. repeals icr. and mandates the epa to do a study for the congress on construction grant funding problems and suggestions. there is no doubt that we have a lot of issues still to confront in the sewage treatment program. each year the appropriations are considerably less than the authorized level for the construction grant program. some suggestions for construction grant reform came out during our icr hearings * * * from environmental groups. cities. and industry. i am talking about such items as holding capacity down. requiring local governments to pay for future plant needs if the grant program goes out of existence. and tightening up cost effectiveness guidelines. we will need the help of all the groups i mentioned in creatively coming up with ways to get the grant money out to the greatest treatment needs. this effort will be undertaken in line with the congress review of the clean water act over the next 2 years. thus. the study of the grant program mandated in the legislation we are considering today will be of great use to the senate environment committee in this review. there is another section of this legislation which will be a tremendous boost to getting our municipal treatment needs accomolished. it is a provision to require the federal government to reimburse local communities. based on available authorization and appropriations. when such communities go ahead and use their own resources to meet immediate treatment needs through priority projects. the language in the house bill which we are considering today is relatively the same language as a bill. s. 2872. which i introduced in the senate on june 24. 1980. senator pell joined me as a cosponsor of that legislation. in my own state of rhode island we are facing a crisis. the treatment plant for the city of providence and surrounding areas was built in the early 1900s. although the state and the city have made great progress in upgrading this facility. they have a tremendously expensive. federallymandated project yet to complete. the price for not renovating and upgradir g the providence plant and dealing with the combined sewer overflow problem would be disaster for our states greatest natural resource. narragansett bay. the bay. which provides our citizens with priceless commercial and recreational opportunities. has become so polluted from wastes that parts of it have been closed to fishing and swimming for most of the year. rhode island and other states. i am sure. need more flexibility in federal assistance. this idea was strongly impressed on me when i brought administrator costle of the epa to our state last november to view firsthand the serious providence treatment problem. that is why i introduced s. 2872. which has now been included in this pending legislation and which will encourage states and local communities to move ahead with treatment projects which are clearly priorities. this provision would help us achieve our clean water goals in a more timely manner and would save taxpayer dollars by avoiding construction cost increases which come with delay. the provision allows states to move ahead and then seek reimbursement from the federal government in line with future appropriations and state allotments. my own state of rhode island is seeking in november voter approval of a $87 million bond issue for sewage treatment. this legislation gives rhode island the right to recoup some of these expenditures. i would expect that the epa would certainly give timely and effective consideration to that request. mr. president. i applaud the work of both the senate environment and public works committee and the house committee on public works and transportation in reaching agreement on the many pending clean water issues in this bill. chairman randolph. senator bentsen. senator gravel. senator baker. and senator stafford especially worked for solutions on our side. with the passage of this bill. the congress is telling the epa that their time would be better spent in coming up with constructive ideas on the wastewater treatment grant program. rather than sending out threatening letters of upcoming sanctions if icr systems are not in place. we look forward to the prompt submission of this epa study on the construction grant program and i will join with other members of the environment committee and full senate in investigating whatever further changes to the program may be necessary. among these will hopefully be changes in the allotment formula. as proposed in legislation. s. 1962. introduced by myself and senator pell. mr. president. i wish to express my thanks to the ranking member of the environment and public works committee. mr. stafford. for his help on this issue. it has been a very difficult one and we are very grateful to him. i also want to pay tribute to those in the house who worked so hard on it. as well. i think particularly of representative clausen. of california. who has been outstanding in his work on it."},{"1":"1979","2":"HEINZ","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. last month the senate debated a similar provision to exempt the tellico project in tennessee from compliance with the endangered species act. that amendment was brought up during discussion of the reauthorization of the endangered species program and was rejected by this body. i see no reason why this decision should be reversed just a few weeks later. such an exemption in the face of the enormous factual record that has been amassed by the federal courts. the senate environment and public works committee. the house merchant marine committee. the gao. the tennessee valley authority. and a special cabinetlevel committee authorized by congress last year to study the economics of the project and its alternativesall would be ignored by allowing this sweeping statutory exemption to remain in the appropriations bill. a very logical procedure was devised by the environment and public works committee and enacted by congress last year to deal with exemptions such as this. serious damage will be done to that process if we allow this provision to remain in the bill. unlike the simple exemption that we rejected a few weeks ago. however. this provision would be of the most sweeping exemptions we have seen. besides exempting the project from the endangered species law. it would also exempt the project from any other law that might in some way affect the project. it is estimated that some $35 to $40 million would be necessary to complete the project as a reservoirbased development project. that includes an additional $14.5 million in construction funds necessary to make the dam capable of safely passing the maximum design flood. the tva admits that the project is not currently in compliance with several other environmental laws such as the historic preservation act. the rivers and harbors act. and the water pollution control act. the proposal included in the house bill would exempt the project from all of these laws. and potentially could exempt the project. with massive sum.. still to be spent. from laws related tc hiring practices. labor protections. and other laws that affect the expenditure ol federal funds. such a sweeping. unspecific statutory repeal for a federal project such as this sets a dangerous precedent that will likely return to haunt us in the future. the fact that this cuts across so many committee jurisdictions should not be lost on this body. .as to the tellico project itself. the project was originally designed as an economic development project for several eastern tennessee counties. approximately 38.000 acres of land in the valley of the little tennessee river. near to or adjacent to the great smoky mountains national park and the cherokee national foresthas been purchased for the proj ect. much of it. over 15.000 acres is prime farmlandsome of the richest in the statewas largely purchased with condemnation powers. tva now admits that more than twice as much land was acquired for the project than necessary for a lake. and that the agency had planned to sell these lands at a profit to improve the benefit figures. the small power benefits-$2.7 million/year--claimed for the project derive not from direct generation of power but from diversion of water through a navigation canal into the fort loudon reservoir generators a few miles away. these benefits. 22.8 megawatts annually. have been termed \"negligible\" by the tva in light of many large coal and nuclearfired projects as well as energy conservation and alternative energy projects now underway by the tva. flatwater recreation. the largest benefit category in the projects original justification. 38 percent. is made somewhat ludicrous when one realizes that there are 22 large recreation resorvoirs within a 50mile radius of the tellico project area. what would be lost is one of the most prolific stretches of troutfishing water in the entire southeast. heavily used by trout fishermen throughout the country. not to mention important historic and archeological areas. tva has now said that nearly equivalent benefits can be gained without a reservoir. that most of the costs (lands. roads and bridges) are recoverable. and that more jobs (3.025 jobs without the reservoir versus 2.675 jobs with a reservoir by 1990) will be created through development of the land in intensive farming. development of housing. recreation. and industrial development than would be possible with a reservoir. for these reasons. i oppose the exemption. support the amendment. and urge my fellow senators to do likewise.o"},{"1":"1978","2":"ABOUREZK","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. i had the pleasure of taking part in the third national

problem. the bill is designed to amend the marine mammal protection act of 1972 in a way that will provide for continued conservation of marine mammals taken in the course of commercial fishing operations. accelerate research concerning reduction of incidental mortality and injury rates of such marine mammals. assist the conservation and development of the yellowfln tuna resources. preserve a healthy u.s. tuna industry. and promote other important policies. a significant percentage of the u.s. tuna catch is done by fishing in association with porpoise by encircling schools of porpoise with purse seines. this process. pioneered by the u.s. tuna fleet. takes advantage of the little understood relationship between yellowfin tuna and various species of porpoises. this sophisticated fishing method 1rs led to a substantial increase in the yearly harvest of yellowfln tuna. unfortunately. purse seining also results in the incidental mortality of porpoises encircled in the net along with the tuna. we are currently in the midst of an extraordinarily counterproductive crisis. the u.s. tuna fleet has been tied to the dock for months. cannery workers in california and puerto rico have been thrown out of work. and the void is being filled by the foreign fleet. whose kill rate far exceeds that of our domestic fleet. further. there is a real danger that a significant portion of the u.s. fleet will transfer to foreign flag if the current deadlock is not broken. in fact. i have been informed that the maritime administration will shortly approve a portion of the pending applications for transfer to foreign flag. the bill will. i hope. provide the relief needed to tide the fleet over through 1978 and put the cannery workers back on their jobs while at the same time protecting marine mammals and promoting research. the current permit and regulations prescribe quotas for the various species of porpoise that are so restrictive that the tuna fleet maintains that the quotas preclude any economically sound fishing in association with porpoise. for example the designation for the eastern spinner as technically \"depleted\" means that the fleet is totally prohibited from intentionally setting on any mixed school of porpoises including that stock. at march oversight hearings by my committee on the 1977 regulations. the testimony presented indicated that although the eastern spinner is technically \"depleted\" as that term is defined by the marine mammal protection act. an incidental mortality of 6.587 could be permitted this year and still allow a virtual certain increase in the population. in early march. dr. robert m. white. administrator of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. appeared before the house subcommittee on fisheries and wildlife conservation and the environment and described the bitter irony of this situation. he said: i have expressed my views that given the court interpretations of the act as now written that the course we are now following is going to be disastrous. both for the tuna industry and for the porpoises. i agree. i believe that everyone. including responsible environmental organizations. view the present situation as unsatisfactory and counterproductive. the reduction of the presence of the united states in the yellowfln tuna purse seine fishery will drastically reduce the ability of the united states to control the tunaporpoise problem. in addition. the absence of the u.s. fleet in this fishery poses a substantial tuna conservation problem as fishing patterns are

all ages are duly concerned about the financial viability of the social security trust fund. and i believe the time has come to put some of these worries to rest. accordingly. the purpose of this bill is to reconfirm and implement the federal governments responsibilities in this regard. a few months ago the wall street journal in an editorial warned that the social security program may be heading toward the same financial disaster which now faces the city of new york. understandably. the article attracted widespread attention throughout the nation and my office was flooded with letters from anxious constituents who. quite naturally. were concerned about their old age security. while it seems that the wall street journal unduly dramatized the problem. it still remains true that the 1975 expenditures under the old age survivors and disability insurance programs will this year exceed income by about $3 billion. moreover. current estimates show that under present law. outgo will exceed income in each future year. it is. therefore. not surprising that a great number of public organizations and well qualified private individuals have since come forth with various proposals aimed at preventing an insolvency of the system. in this connection. it is necessary to remember that oasdi was never designed and should not be expected to perform the entire job of assuring economic security for the aged and the disabled and their families or survivors. however. as the primary means of providing a minimum retirement income base. oasdi is the core of our countrys total system of income protection. this oasdi must be supplemented by effective private pensions as well as by special programs for those whose earnings were so low that their social security benefits are inadequate. we also must keep in mind that the cash benefits program has been financed from the very beginning by an earmarked tax levied equally on employers and employees. when the social security systern was planned. and at times since then. the possibility of general revenue support for this system was considered. fortunately though. over the years congress has insisted that with minor exceptions. social security cash benefits should be financed out of payroll taxes. such financing helps to distinguish oasdi from purely welfare programs and promotes greater understanding of the program costs. it could be expected that at this critical juncture. proposals would come up again to open the gates of general revenue subsidies. but as before. many question the dangers implicit in such an approach. others are suggesting an increase.of the 5.8 percent tax rate on employees and employers. since the payroll tax system is regressive in nature. the burden of the tax falls disproportionately upon lower paid workers. moreover. in my opinion. current rates are already burdensome to the point of becoming counterproductive. again. others proposed that a much higher taxable earnings base than the present $14.100 would be a desirable way to solve at least part of the financing problem. this step. though. would increase revenues inadequately. moreover. such an increase would be inequitable because the additional tax burden placed on a higher paid employee would far outweigh the increase in his benefits. as indicated. the oasdi program is financed from taxes on covered earnings. because congress has historically attempted to insure that the benefits of the program are related to the earnings of the worker. this is true even when the beneficiary is a spouse or dependent survivor. the same principle. however. does not apply to benefits under part a of the medicare program. there. the amount of the benefits is determined by the hospital and related health care costs of an individual and bears no relationship to his wages. under these circumstances. there does not seem to be any real reason for funding such costs by a tax on wages. hospital insurance expenditures would seem to be more properly funded from general revenues. accordingly. the advisory council on social security recommended. and i am supporting. this approach. if adopted by congress. it would make a significant contribution to the continued solvency of the oasdi program without an immediate increase in total social security tax rates to which i remain opposed. i know alternatives will be suggested by others. and am confident many will prove superior in some fashion to my suggestion. it is time for the discussion to begin. though. the problem is with us now. and further delay will only magnify the difficulty of achieving responsible. and affordable. answers. i introduce this bill in hopes that it will encourage others to join in meeting our common responsibility to the social security system and those whose personal security depends upon it. by mr. mathias:"},{"1":"1974","2":"GOLDWATER","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. chairman. i am pleased to rise today in support of h.r. 16371. the

process of hearings. markup. and floor action. this expedited handling is indicative of the continued concern regarding our energy problems. mr. chairman. earlier this year it was my privilege to participate in the passage of the solar heating and cooling demonstration act of 1974. this act established a 5year program to demonstrate the practicality of solar energy for heating and cooling residential and commercial buildings. in contrast. the bill before us today aims at tackling and conquering a wide variety of technical problems impeding progress in solar energy. hearings held by the

power. windpower. and photovoltaic conversion. while each of these concepts offer significant results. much remains to be done in order to perfect them. this legislation will focus on solving the technical hurdles to these new ways of exploiting solar energy. the committee recognized that at the outset there was a need for focus and direction at the federal level. to achieve this result the bill establishes a solar energy coordination and management proj ect. the project will be composed of representatives from those federal agencies having interest in solar energy. the proj ect will have the responsibility of coordinating the federal solar energy effort. the solar energy program is one which needs to be carried out in an orderly manner. the bill provides that the project will undertake a program definition effort at the earliest opportunity. the program definition will survey the current status of solar energy development. it will set up a game plan which will serve to guide later federal programs. this will minimize duplication and maximize the efficient use of our federal resources. the solar energy program is divided into three major phases. they are: resource determination and assessment. research and development. and demonstration. the resource determination and assessment phase will undertake a regional and national appraisal of all solar energy sources. topics to be investigated include wind. ocean thermal gradients. and photovoltaic conversion. the project will inventory all forms of solar energy resources. in performing this mission the project will utilize the latest meteorological. oceanographic. and spacerelated techniques. maps. surveys. and other appropriate documents will be published in order to encourage the commercial development of solar energy resources. the research and development phase will tackle head on the technical problems obstructing the full application of solar energy. the research will stress not only technical achievements but also pay attention to environmental effects. economic feasibility. and longterm reliability. this phase will not only foster laboratory breakthroughs but also will be concerned with bringing the results into the marketplace in an expeditious fashion. the demonstration phase will build on the progress of the first two phases. it will concern itself with the design. construction. and operation of solar energy systems. demonstration projects are appropriate for each of the different sources of solar energy. these demonstration projects will verify both technical and economic feasibility. in addition. the demonstration projects will serve as a test bed for a further refinement of components and techniques. the project is directed to dispose of the electric energy and other byproducts generated by demonstrations projects. this will supplement existing power supplies even before solar energy systems become ready for widescale use. likewise after a demonstration project is completed the project is to dispose of the test sites. closely related to the resource determination and assessment phase is a provision establishing a solar energy information data bank (bank). the bank will collect. process. and disseminate information on solar energy technologies. this data will be available to governmental bodies. educational institutions. and private enterprise groups working on solar energy programs. a solar energy incentives task force also will be set up to foster solar energy use. the task force will study commercial and consumer attitudes and make recommendations. mr. chairman. i believe the solar energy research. development. and dem.onstration act is a welldrafted piece of energy legislation. it is a strong congressional response to our nations energy problems. i believe that solar energy can make a significant contribution to correcting our energy shortcomings. solar energy has been available but untapped for far too long. h.r. 16371 provides the means for exploiting the full potential of this nonpolluting. uninterrupted source of energy. i urge my colleagues to join me in support of it."},{"1":"1973","2":"HUMPHREY","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. the nixon administrations budget proposes drastic cutbacks in research and research training programs in our nations graduate schools. this represents not only misplaced priorities but extreme shortsightedness. we may save a little in the short run. but we shall certainly lose heavily in the future. the decision to terminate and phase out many research programs is not sound public policy. we will simply have to face the huge expense of restarting these programs 5 or 10 years from now. when we fall behind and confront another crisis as we did when the soviets launched sputnik. this stopgopolicy is terribly inefficient and ineffective. two years ago. the presidents task force on education reported that during the next decade. resources available to colleges and universities must more than double if we are to meet our research needs and alleviate the inequalities in our education system. new discoveries are needed in the area of biomedical research. energy development. and environmental technology if the united states is to continue to be the worlds leading industrial nation. in the areas of social science. governmentsponsored researchers have found ways to allocate the costs of municipal services more rationally to promote balanced community growth. economists are working on a project to link several national econometric models so that international trade and inflation may be studied. and. recently the benefits of federally sponsored research was clearly demonstrated by the announcement of a new discovery that could lead to effective solutions to the problem of drug addiction. this discovery was made at johns hopkins as the result of a grant from the national institute of mental health. if this discovery should eventually result in a cure for drug addiction. the investment which we have made will have been repaid many times over. yet despite results like this. the national institutes of health will receive little new support for research. what is most disturbing is that the areas of nih research to be funded are chosen by the office of management and budget. without consulting the scientific community. as science magazine reported: when it comes to the budget proposals for the national institutes of health (nih) and. therefore. federal support of research. there are few. if any. leaders of the biomedical community who are happy with the choices that the president. through his office of management and budget. has made. there is certainly a need for program evaluation in the area of research. but all members of society. and especially scientific experts. should take part in this evaluation. finding indicators of social benefit from scientific research is too difficult a task to be left to omb. unfortunately. it is still the case that college education is primarily the prerogative of the young person from an upper income family. i find this to be morally. socially. and economically wrong. for too many low- and middleincome children who cannot afford to go to college. much less attend graduate school. the real cost is that of not getting a higher education. they are denied the opportunity to develop their talents and obtain appropriate. highpaying jobs. the misguided nature of the proposed cutbacks can be found in the following examples: first. a new graduate fellowship program for disadvantaged students is cut by 25 percent. thus. our efforts to bring about a longneeded diversity in the student population of graduate schools are being frustrated. second. the national science foundation training grant program receives only phaseout money. this could have disastrous longrun consequences. scientists and research specialists do not grow on trees. there must be trained professionals if quality research is to continue. third. funds for the health manpower act are cut by almost 40 percent from 1972 levels. this includes a twothird. reduction in funds for nursing schools while the need is growing the effort i: shrinking. fourth. support for foreign language and area study programs is terminated. some of our countrys finest programs. particularly in the field of asian studies. may be ended completely. and all at a time when asian experts are desperately needed to deal with the increased importance of china and japan in world affairs. how can we expect to maintain good relations and formulate sound policies toward these countries if we lack expertise in their languages and cultures? fifth. finally. graduate schools throughout the nation are beginning to feel the pinch of trying to make less funds go further. university after university has reported that graduate training programs are suffering massive dislocations as a result of the nixon budget. said the dean of the university of california at berkeley. sanford elberg: the graduate education enterprise is being torn apart. its a - disaster. dean elberg noted that he will lose funds for almost a thousand of 8.900 students next year. dean elbergs predicament is shared by graduate deans at other schools. a recent article in the washington post by andrew barnes catalogs some of the cutbacks and the impending loss of fiscal support as it effects graduate training. barnes notes that \"enrollments are off. sharply at some schools. and all face financial trouble.\" mr. president. the american people stand firmly behind our nations commitment to be the worlds leader in the field of research and education. congress will not allow this commitment to be watered down. the investment in graduate research and education must be continued. i ask unanimous consent that an article from science. detailing these reductions in research commitments. and an article written by andrew barnes of the washington post entitled \"elite graduate schools are in trouble.\" be printed at this pointed in the record."},{"1":"1972","2":"RYAN","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. chairman. there is significant need for the congress to enact strong legislation to protect ocean mammals. unfortunately. the legislation before us todayh.r. 10420falls short of living up to its name. \"the marine mammal protection act.\" for while the committeereported bill does provide an elaborate mechanism for the development of a permit system for the management of marine mammals. it does not go nearly far enough in providing restraints against unchecked commercial killing of such mammals as seals. porpoises. whales. polar bears. and other animals which are severely threatened by the rapacious nature of man. it is my firm belief that. if the continued existence of these ocean mammals is to be protected. this legislation must be strengthened to include at least four essential features. and i will fully support any amendments to do so. first. there should be a 10year moratorium on the killing of marine mammals. with the possible exception only of the take of probilof fur seals. which is presently regulated by international treaty. and taking for native subsistence and scientific study. as tom garrett. wildlife conservation director of the friends of the earth. recently pointed out: a hiatus of ten years in killing by u.s. citizens of marine mammals will help permit endangered and depleted populations to recover. it will set an example for foreign governments. it will allow a period of careful study. to monitor the effects of environmental pollution. and to develop some understanding of the behavior and population dynamics of the animals. second. i believe that there should be a ban on imports of the products of marine mammals. it is clear that the united states and its citizens do not bear the sole blame for the devastation of ocean mammals. for instance. japan and the soviet union account for most of the worlds whaling. although it is not within this nations exclusive control to halt the slaughter of whales. polar bears. walruses. and other species. our actions can have an enormously powerful trickledown effect. for example. while we engage in little whaling. we do account for about onethird of the consumption of whale products. if we close our doors to the importation of ocean mammal products. therefore. we inevitably must decrease the profitability of their destruction. and in turn. we increase the likelihood of cessation of that destruction. thus. we must ban the import of all ocean mammal products. third. there should be a 1year deadline in which to eliminate the killing of dolphins and porpoises incidental to tuna fishing operations. it is estimated that each year some 250.000 dolphins are killed in purse sein nets by u.s. fisherman in the eastern pacific alone. this is a tragic example of the effects of ruthless and unrestrained international competition for marine resources. this murderous undertaking must be ended. and fourth. the act should be administered by a single agencythe department of the interior. perhaps the most graphic explanation of why such stringent legislation is imperative is the description of the slaughter which this country and others have perpetrated against the whale. the whales are among creations most intelligent creatures. they communicate with each other. using numerous sounds in their language. they demonstrate an intense loyalty to each other. so that a school of whales will beach itself and thereby commit mass selfdestruction in its efforts to come to the aid of a captured or beached brother. certainly. mans hunting down these creatures cannot be condoned. it does not involve the extermination of a vicious. diseasecarrying animal such as the rat. but rather the slaughter of a complex. intelligent and harmless animal of the highest order. what has man succeeded in doing? in december 1968. the committee on rare and endangered wildlife species of the department of interiors bureau of sport fisheries and wildlife compiled a list of \"rare and endangered fish and wildlife of the united states.\" this compilation listed six large whale species of just american waters which are in jeopardy. of the gray whale. 8.000 were estimated to be left in the california herd. as of 1965. the compilation listed \"perhaps a few hundreds in the atlantic\" as remaining of the blue whale. and less than 1.500 in the pacific herd. less than 5.000 humpback whales remained in the north pacific. as for the atlantic right whale. the compilation stated that \"possibly only a few hundreds persist.\" the same dire situation existed for the pacific right whale. as for the bowhead whale. there were an estimated 1.000 in the beringchukchibeaufort sea population. with lesser numbers elsewhere. the fate of the blue whale is a tragic object lesson of the pillage which has been committed. the blue whale is the largest creature ever to inhabit the earth. an adult blue whale measures up to 98 feet long and weighs perhaps as much as 160 tons. even its newborn young are larger than a fullgrown elephant and are reputed to consume more than onehalf ton of milk daily. at the beginning of this century. the blue whale population was over 100.000. today. only a few hundred blue whales. perhaps as many as 3.000 according to some estimates. populate our entire planet. as lewis regenstein has written. in a recent article entitled. \"the vanishing whales: long odds against survival.\" which appeared in the august 22 edition of the washington post: there is serious doubt that enough males and females will be able to find each other over the great expanse of the ocean to enable the species to breed and perpetuate itself. james fisher. noel simon. and jack vincent have starkly identified the cause of the blue whales demise in \"wildlife in danger.\" at page 60: the demise of the dinosaurs remains veiled in mystery and surmise. but there is no need to speculate on the reasons for the disappearance of the blue whale. the rapaciousness of man is wholly responsible. seas and oceans comprise 70 per cent of the earths surface. and one would have thought this ample habitat allowed more than enough space for the whales survival. but pursuit of the whale has been so persistent that nowhere on the face of the sea or in its uttermost depths. however remote or vast or forbidding. is there any longer a true sanctuary beyond the reach of mans ruthless exploitation. it may well be too late for the blue whale. the asiatic gray whale population has apparently disappeared. the largest known colony of nominally protected southern right whales was wiped out in threatened with imminent extinction are the humpback. the sei. the finback. the bowhead. the sperm. the gray. and the right whales. the frightening pace at which extinction is coming upon these species is indicated just by examining the figures for the estimated average population size of the fin whale. published by the international whaling commission: 195556 ----------------------110. 000 195657 ----------------------101.700 195758 ----------------------89.000 195859 ----------------------88.600 195960 ----------------------65.700 196061 ----------------------59. 700 196162 ----------------------45.300 196263 ----------------------40. 000 196364 ----------------------32.400 this need not be. whales do not threaten man. there is no need of selfdefense to kill them. they do not endanger our crops. crowd our territory. the commercial products which are derived from them are not unique: whale meat. used for dog and cat food and on mink farms. can easily be replaced by other meats. whale oil can easily be replaced by other products. in simple terms. then. we are embarked on destructionpure and simple. nor are whales by any means the sole victims of our rapaciousness. to document this we need only look at the fate of the polar bear. the male polar bear averages about 900 pounds. although specimens twice as heavy have been recorded. it stands about 5 feet at the shoulders and is 7 to 8 feet or more long. the polar bear is found in the arctic. distributed around the pole. for much of the year. it lives on the pack ice of the arctic ocean. a magnificent animaland again an animal which in no way threatens manthe polar bear. like the whales. is endangered. the largest and most flourishing white bear population is found in the canadian arctic where only 6.000 or 7.000 existpossibly more than half the worlds total. the bear population of greenland. once high. has severely declined as a result of excessive hunting. similar overhunting has reduced the population in the soviet sector of the bears range. thus. we see a magnificent creature declining. he does not threaten man. he offers no commercially essential products. he is. however. a handsome trophy. and so he is sacrificed to those who mark their accomplishments by the number of heads mounted over their mantle. such wanton disregard for nature and the environment cannot be countenanced. the congress has an obligation to protect ocean mammals from the possibility of extinction. i urge my colleagues to support those amendments which would strengthen the bill before us in order to truly make it a \"marine mammal protection act.\""},{"1":"1971","2":"STRATTON","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. i have just returned from the international air show in paris. where i saw both the soviet tu144 and the french concorde. the two operational foreign ssts. what struck me most was that both airplanes. especially the soviet tu144. have borrowed very. very heavily from the b70. americas prototype for a new manned bomber that was built by us and then rejected in the 1960s. the one remaining copy of that b70 sits today in the air museum at wrightpatterson air force base in dayton. ohio. mr. speaker. since both the soviet and the french ssts are now obviously in existence and are going to be operating in the future. whatever we in the congress may or may not do in the years ahead. and since the major popular argument against an american sst has been the environmental issue. it does seem highly desirable that we proceed as rapidly as possible to find our own answers to all the perplexing environmental questions that have been raised in connection with sst operations in the upper atmosphere. in fact this was one of the things the two prototype ssts were going to be able to do for us. before congress shot the whole project down. but now that it is so obvious that our illstarred supersonic bomber of the 1960s is the working model for this first generation of foreign ssts. i believe we have a unique opportunity to get the answers to all these environmental questions. without waiting any further. simply by making use of our own original american supersonic aircraft. i am informed that there are no insurmountable problems involved in getting the b70 out of the air museum and getting it flying again. after all. the federal taxpayers did spend about $1 m billion developing 2 prototype b70s. the first one crashed through no fault of its own. so here is a marvelous chance for the taxpayers to get some of their original investment back by using the remaining aircraft for high altitude environmental research in supersonic flight. even a superficial examination of the tu144 and its engines shows a marked similarity to the b70. the statistics are even more remarkable. the b70 is 192 feet in length. the tu144 180 feet. the b70s wingspan is 105 feet. the tu144s is 81 feet. the b70 cruises at 2.000 m.p.h.. the tu144 at 1.550 m.p.h. the service ceiling of the b70 is 75.000 feet. the ceiling of the tu144 has not been made public. but the concorde. which is comparable. is 65.000 feet. and the maximum range of all three planes is around 4.000 miles. surely it would be the easiest thing in the world to put the b70 flying back and forth in the lower troposphere. where the ssts will be regularly operating. and find out once and for all whether the nitric oxide chain reaction which some of the scientists have claimed would result from sst operations. would actually occur and would actually destroy the protective layer of ozone in the upper atmosphere that shelters us from excessive exposure to the ultraviolet rays of the sun. so. mr. speaker. i have today written a letter to president nixon bringing these facts to his attention. and urging him. both as president and as commander in chief. to release the b70 from the air museum. and turn it over to the faa and the environmental protection agency to serve as a high altitude flying laboratory to settle once and for all the various environmental questions raised with regard to the sst. especially the matter of the skin cancer threat. if the environmental problems prove to be insurmountable. then we will know that it will not be safe for us to proceed any further with any american sst development. whether public or private. and we can also make this information available to the rest of the world for appropriate response in connection with their own sst operations. . on the other hand. if the skin cancer and other environmental hazards that have been suggested prove not to be valid on the basis of the data picked up by this flying laboratory. then we will be in a much better position. when the economic situation permits. to resume the american effort to build a second generation sst that will prove far more efficient and very possibly may be able to take over from these early generation foreign models the predominant american leadership in supersonic jet transport aircraft which we presently hold in the subsonic field."},{"1":"1970","2":"WOLFF","3":"E","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. as i have done the past 2 days. and shall do again next week. i wish to include in the record the statements of two of the witnesses who appeared at the recent hearing on the environmental impact of atomic energy which i held with my colleague from new york . today i am including the statements of frank tooze. who spoke on behalf of the international brotherhood of electrical workers. and william e. wall. of consolidated edison of new york: statement of mr. frank tooze my name is frank tooze and i am appearing before this hearing on behalf of ibew local 1049 and make the following statement: we of local 1049 look forward to the sconstruction. by long island lighting company. of an atomic powered electric generating plant near shoreham on the north shore of long island on long island sound. we have listened to and read statements by men who have spent years in the study of nuclear energy who see great benefits to be derived from atomic power. we believe deeply. that the atomic energy commission and its staff have carefully and scientifically considered their actions and activities in the development of safe atomic power. we consider that the men of industry and commerce who produce the machines and tools to harness atomic energy for producing electric power to be men of good will. integrity and foresight. we decry those nonexperts who take unfounded statements and charges and offer them as bonafide arguments to stay this necessary development in our progress to better things and ways of moving forward. to declare a moratorium in the building of nuclear driven electric generating plants is to continue the methods we pursue today. which everyone appears to agree upon leaves great room for improvement. environmentally and aesthetically. long island continues to grow rapidly in population. but more than additional people. our present population uses more than 70% of all added electric generation for their own growing use. if we are to prosper and develop as a modern community. and provide the machinery for development and growth. we must have adequate power. electric power is the very essence of our economy. adequate power is vital to industrial and commercial growth. industry and commerce means jobs for our people and for their children when they are ready to assume their roles in our economy. an area inadequate in power supply for the tools of production stagnates and dies. we of local 1049 urge that the building of nuclear fueled electric generating plants be encouraged. and not be stopped or delayed by a useless moratorium. 1049 believes emphatically that nuclear plants are clean. quiet. reliable and very safe. and that the fears so generally expressed are not substantially supported."},{"1":"1969","2":"FONG","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. i am pleased and proud to tell you that nearly 100 of the leading marineoriented citizens of the state of hawaii have just completed a broad study of the marine opportunities. in my state. called \"hawaii -and the sea.\" this study proposes an action plan for the public and private sectors of our community. as well as some sectors of the federal government having interests in the pacific basin. at -the request of the governors task force. the highly competent study group that prepared \"hawaii and the sea.\" was organized and led by mr. william s. beller. u.s. department of the interior. on loan to the state for this purpose. it is highly significant that this study group included state. federal. university. and industrial representation. with this report. hawaii has become the first state with a report that looks at the marine environment in as broad a fashion as the national commission on marine science. engineering. and resources did earlier this year. in addition. it is the first state to publish a report based in part on the findings of this marine commission. as you may recall. the national report is different from others on marine affairs because it deals with broad policy matters rather than questions of technical detail. unless the details have to be acted upon to effect the policy matters. these policy matters in the marine field involve major interests such as recreation. national defense. food from the sea. research and development. and relations with other lands in the pacific basin. they necessarily involve all levels of the state government and of the university of hawaii. therefore. the governors task force sought a \"commission\" report for hawaii. because of its concern with the assets of the sea. \"hawaii and the sea\" will undoubtedly be of interest to all coastal states. the measure of the intensive interest in the sea in hawaii is seen in the fact that the report was completed in a period of 3 months and yet is about 300 pages long and has approximately 75 actionable recommendations in it. one of the major recommendations is for a 5year marine science program. in which scientists and engineers would seek the best ways to use and conserve the states marine environment. projects involving the shoreline. nearshore environment and ecology. and the states territorial seabed will receive the greatest attention. the projects will include beach and reef studies. skipjack tuna investigations. and water pollution control studies among many others. an important product of the program will be an atlas of the coastal areas of hawaii. detailing the locations of living and nonliving resources to be found there. the report points out that there is a demand in the state for an oceanographic research park where marineoriented industry and government could work in close proximity to each other. hawaiis land area. suitable for major combined scientifictechnological and related industrial expansion. is limited and. in the near future. may be prohibitively costly. therefore. it is necessary for the state to study the precise needs for an oceanographic research park in time for the 1970 legislative session to consider the problem. among the other recommendations: that the state organize and assist public and private oceanographic interests in seeking the establishment of an environmental forecasting center in the islands. the report points out that longrange weather and marine prediction. the -ability to forecast biological changes in the ocean. and the accurate forecasting and monitoring of unusual phenomena. such as earthquakes and tsunamis. would be of tremendous help to most people in the pacific basin. that the state support the concept of the international decade of ocean explorationidoe. this is a time. presumably starting in 1970. when marine scientists and engineers all over the world will be studying the seas with a goal of deriving practical benefits from them. there is little doubt that studies of the pacific ocean will be of great benefit not only to hawaii but also to the nation. the pressing need for new technology to master the ocean in order to extract fish and minerals from it and to control or ameliorate erosion effects on the coastline. all depend upon our knowing how the ocean operates. the report. therefore. recommends that the governor urge the president and the congress to take appropriate action to bring the decade into being. that if the national administration does not endorse the doe. that the state seek a pacific decade of ocean exploration in order for the state and the nation to reap the benefits of an intensive study of the pacific ocean as soon as possible. that the state create a marine extension service to aid the developing nations september -16. 1969 in the pacific basin. as well as hawaii fishermen. this marine extension service would advise on fishing techniques and on setting up conservation rules to prevent the depletion of stock. it also would provide books. pamphlets. and courses which would deal with the problems of aquaculture. pollution. and other coastal zone processes. this service. a pacific center for marine sciences. would probably be affiliated with the university of hawaii. that counties and cities initiate a program to assure their people that beaches are not walled out by buildings. and to develop additional permanent rightsofway and access routes to hawaiis shoreline. the report urges counties and cities to inspect present and future access routes on at least an annual basis. in order to insure that they are properly maintained and unobstructed. that on all publicly owned shoreline lands that are less than fully developed. there be 300 feet of open space. measured from the sea landward. which would be permanently dedicated to public use. access routes would also be provided. and the combination of a 300foot corridor plus the routes. would assure the people of hawaii the use of their shoreline. one of the states most valuable assets. that the program of establishing underwater parks and preserves be accelerated and expanded to include the islands of maui. molokai. and kauai. that the hawaii civil defense agency be appointed to organize and head a coordinating body of state and federal agencies to plan and implement the states response to spills of oil or other hazardous materials into the waters around hawaii. that the state give high priority to the rigorous enforcement of state water quality standards. that the state give increased assistance to industry and encourage the u.s. bureau of commercial fisheries to accelerate their development of new fishing methods that will help hawaii fishermen increase their catch of skipjack tuna. the central pacific and eastern pacific probably could yield thousands of tons of skipjack every year. yet the total catch in these areas runs considerably less than 100.000 tons per year. skipjack tuna is a highpriced fish worth between $200 and $265 a ton dockside. at todays prices. a catch of only 100.000 tons of skipjack would bring fishermen almost $25 million. and processors almost $62 million. by comparison. the pineapple crop in hawaii. in 1968. was worth slightly more than $40 million. and processed value. $133 million. the problem is that the poleandline way of catching skipjack is simply not good enough when volume production is needed. that the state find out why fresh fish are so highly priced on the islands. that the federal government take the lead in sponsoring research that would show how to recycle sewage waste into food through fish farming. the harvest of fish farms. or aquaculture. could give essential animal protein foods to many of the starving peoples of the world. that the federal government dissuade foreign coral fishermen from operating in the waters near the hawaiian islands. and that the state conduct a survey of the precious coral resources along the hawaiian archipelago. hawaii could become one of the three major centers in the world working with precious coral. the two others. japan and italy. turn out roughly $70 million a year worth of coral jewelry at the wholesale price. that the university of hawaii gather the parts of its present program in marine sciences and engineering into a single entity. this new body would have the added advantage of being able to treat. without excessive coordinating effort. entire problem areas. including the economic and sociological implications. the university of hawaii already has the ideal location and all the other ingredients needed to be one of the leading universities in the nation in the marine and geophysical sciences. its overall marineoriented program is supported by a budget of about $7 million a year. the university considers the entire pacific basin as its laboratory and as a special beneficiary for its studies. that the state government focus on marine affairs by designating the heads of state departments having responsibilities in marine affairs as the governors cabinet for marine affairs. this cabinet would also have coordinating responsibilities particularly with problems involving multiple demands on the coastal zone. the report concludes: hawaii can surely gain through the judicious use of the resources in and around the sea. the development of the technology needed to exploit these resources. marine businesses founded and enlarged. safer marine recreational facilities. and programs dedicated to better understanding of the marine environment. hawaii can surely lose by damaging its marine environment. perhaps through actions such as dumping excessive pollutants in the water. overbuilding the shoreline and neglect. i am happy that hawaii. as the nations only island state. has through \"hawaii and the sea\" looked so perceptively ahead not only to use its marine environment but. more importantly. to preserve it for the enjoyment of other generations. i commend all the citizens of hawaii who participated in the study. i particularly congratulate the 23 members of the advisory group which guided the preparation of the report for the governors task force. chaired by mr. adrian perry. president of kentron. hawaii. ltd. the caliber and diversity of the advisory group are indicated by the responsible positions held by its members. as listed below:"},{"1":"1968","2":"MOLNAR","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"thank you. mr.

now gradually unveiled and exposed. permit me to add now my own observations gathered on three continents of the socalled third world. observations i wish to summarize under two headings. or rather. in the form of two recommendations: 1) let us discard the myths fabricated by ideologies. and 2) let us state the factors which. under favorable conditions. may lead to development. myth: capitalism is responsible for making rich nations richer. poor nations poorer. it is easy to observe while traveling that wherever a degree of success is achieved in third world countriesa modicum of prosperity. a hopeful outlook on the future. stability and freedoman important factor is the presence of one or more industrial nations from the west. japan. australia. etc. since in these countries by and large a free economy prevails. it is not hard to see that some of the spirit of freedom penetrates through their presence. the concrete forms this spirit takes are the following: companies and exploitations set up by them provide steady work for a part of the population whose income they raise and whose standard of living they stabilize. they contribute. through locally paid taxes and other forms of participation. for example vocational schools. to government revenue and general progress. they help diversify the host countrys economy through the secondary industries they encourage. the roads they build. the ports they install. finally. they maintain schools. hospitals. and other services. western presence also refutes. at least partially. the clich6 about the general unreliability and laziness of local populations. while it is true that in most countries of the third world the inherited social structure. plus the socialistic tendencies of the present governmental policies help maintain a climate hostile to progress. it is no less true that there are many individual exceptions to this rule. one of the crucial points in the whole problem of underdevelopment is. in my opinion. the encouragement to be given to the exceptional individual. the exceptional enterprise. the exceptional situation. after all. when india is criticised. and rightly so. for the lack of social discipline. the existence of 60 million untouchables. the impediments on the slaughtering of cattle. etc. one may point to the active indians in east and south africa. it is true that in such instances it is the removal of a minority from its home environment and its displacement to a new and challenging situation which constituted the chief factor of progress. yet. western industrial presence should act precisely as creator of challenges and new situations. and as a talent scout. examples of islands of prosperity in underdeveloped countries abound. and the promising thing about them is that with a modicium of local cooperation. they do not remain islands. whether in venezuela or gabon. mauretania or chile. western exploitation of mineral or other resources is a stabilizing factor in the above sense. even in socalled socialist economies. like that of guin6e (aluminum). western presence is a harbinger of hope. thus. it is very alarming that this link between western industry and underdeveloped countries is constantly attacked. let me list two such attacks. one is by men like the brazilian economist. celso purtado. who promotes the idea that since local government knows best the local needs. foreign enterprises should be nationalized. this is. of course. a nonsequitur. he also blames these enterprises for developing certain selected regions. thus creating a disequilibrium in overall uniform growth. this view conflicts directly with the hope that the western presence may act as encouragement for local talent and initiative. it is strange in the mouth of a brazilian whose government. rather than giving all help to its northwestern and amazon regions. preferred to build a huge capital. brazil. in the middle of nowhere and contributing to no conceivable development. even regional. another attack against the western presence is contained in the papal encyclical. \"populorum progressio\" (art. 26). where not only the \"profit motive\" and \"competitive spirit\" are condemned with hardly important qualifications. but also the concept of \"private ownership\" which recognizes no \"social responsibility\". now. if we look. for example. at the african tribal system. we realize that one reason why enterprising africans 1) do not achieve a successful land exploitation. and 2) prefer to acquire diplomas which. in mr. myrdals words. are \"passports to escape hard work.\" is that private ownership is discouraged by the tribal structure and at present by what goes under the name of \"african socialism\". in this instance. the encyclicals exhortations are clearly based on erroneous information. myth: foreign aid is owed by rich countries to underdeveloped ones. this myth is spread by irresponsible politicians. but also by respectable scholars like prof. jacques berque of the college de france in paris. it is then accepted by many western economists and businessmen who think that by paying a kind of tribute to the underdeveloped countries and to a mythical \"world opinion\". they will not have to make serious and constructive efforts in the direction of a more correct approach. the whole idea received a recent formulation by president boumedienne of algeria who even suggested a new class struggle on a global scale against the rich nations. now let us remark that in colonial times the colonies benefited by preferential treatment in their economic relationships with the mother country. their products were bought at the world price or above (unlike the practice of the soviet union which for years treated its satellites in a much harsher manner. selling to and buying from them at arbitrarily set prices). since decolonization. let us not forget that leaders like nkrumah. castro and nasser helped undermine the system by selling cotton and sugar to the soviet union at lower than world pricesfor political advantage and ideological support. it should be kept in mind that the departing colonial powers. as well as the western countries now present in developing lands and accused of \"neocolonialism\". have decisively contributed to the infrastructure of these countries. they built. and keep building and repairing. roads. bridges. railroads. airports. factories. schools. which are lasting contributions and for which the local government would have no funds or competent personnel. even such a coolheaded man as expresident albert lieras camargo of colombia. has complained that american companies behave in his country and continent the way they would never dare behave in their own. lleras camargo forgets. together with more radical men. like celso furtado and archbishop helder camara of recife (brazil). that in south america these companies are often obliged to act like pioneers of progress. creating and maintaining an environment they find readymade in the united states. once the lastmentioned. mgr. helder camar. complained to me that since 1945 the united states had taken $14 billion worth of raw material from the soil of south america. compensation was in order for this loss. he suggested. he conveniently forgot two things: 1) local capital would have been unable to open up the continents resources on such a large scale. and 2) no market other than the north american would have been able to absorb the available tin. coffee. oil and copper. not to mention the work and jobs offered. the schooling and other services introduced by these companies. myth: land reform is a sine qua non of development. many of the existing or projected land reforms are false solutions because the peasant. now owner of his plot. has no staying power. capital or equipment. yet. in a sense he is attached to his land like the medieval serf because he cannot legally sell it. so. in many instances. as in mexico. he will find subterfuges and become. in fact if not in law. a tenant farmer for richer \"kulaks\". we find. nevertheless. that \"populorum progressio\" (art. 24) encourages stateexpropriation of land when it is \"poorly used\". of course. only large estates are meant because. again. the encyclical seems not to know the problem. just mentioned. of new small owners. nor does it seem to know that governments. such as brazils. for example. possess enormous territories it could exploit. valorise and distribute. but that they prefer to take over already existing and wellequipped estates and plantations. this is a cheaper way. and more rewarding in terms of votes. present and future. attention must also be called to the fact that in tropical climates. land cultivation needs different techniques than under temperate climate. because of the heat. chemical reactions in the soil are more rapid. because of the extremes of rainfall and drought. plants may rot or perish. because of the wind and the wholesale destruction of forests by the tribes. erosion carries away the topsoil. because of the social and family structure. cattle breeding is notoriously inefficient. all these factors should be considered before land distribution is undertaken. generally such distribution (reform) should not have the size of land as a criterion. but the degree of its efficient exploitation. otherwise. food production in developing countries will continue to lag. and lag dangerously behind the rate of population growth. here again. this is not the foreign governments which should be blamed for insufficient aid in food products. but. as f.a.o. has finally admitted. the inadequate attention given to the problem by local governments which do not invest sufficiently in food production and fail to mobilize manpower for it. no wonder their food imports are growing. myth: priority should be given to industrialization over agriculture. this myth. it is true. has lost some of its earlier force. but it is still very much alive. except where foreigninitiated industry has helped create jobs and steady income. the local population has no income to buy and consume local products. under governments dedicated to a planned economy. the private sector of industry tends anyway to be suppressed or. like in india. it finds itself hedged in by so many bureaucratic obstacles and licenses. that it prefers to sell out to the state or liquidate its operations. the reverse process. observable in austria and argentina. is rather rare. that is when a nonsocialistminded government resells the industries and businesses its predecessors have started or acquired. otherwise. it is notorious that staterun enterprises (argentina and its railway comes in mind) keep operating with fantastic deficits. spawning and perpetuating a gigantic bureaucracy. it is sad to note that on this issue. too. the recent encyclical (art. 47) recommends that governments raise the tax level so as to \"intensify development efforts\". it must be pointed out that many of the governments so nobly urged. are incredibly corrupt. so that the existing tax system does not bring the expected results. private companies. local and foreign. pay out more in bribes than in taxes. and would have to continue doing so even if taxes were raised. thereby they enrich the party in government. and contribute to the political strife between parties. all of which want to benefit from these extra sums. for which no accounting is required. putting more money in the pockets of these governments is by no means a guarantee that the new funds will be better spent than the old. 2) let me now state some factors leading to development and consequent wise use of foreign aid. a) first among these factors is a reasonably stable government in the developing country. such a government will not demand. under extremist pressure. unexpected and nonnegotiated new taxes. and will not unexpectedly curtail production of foreign companies. it will not threaten nationalization (as in chile. venezuela. recently zambia). governments that come to mind in terms of stability are ivory coast and taiwan. the first is a striking example of a wellmanaged state in troubled west africa. maintaining excellent ties with the industrial powers. developing its trade. local industry. road networks. internal security. school system. etc. in taiwan. land reform was orderly. gradual. creating minimal bitterness and encouraging former landowners to invest in industries which help market the countrys agricultural products. b) such a stable country will not maintain a huge bureaucracy which drains both local resources and foreign aid funds. in \"socialist\" guin6e and mali the bureaucracy swallows up more than half of the budget. recently 80% and 60% respectively of the budget increase was channelled into higher salaries for bureaucrats. in this domain too. it is necessary to examine whether higher taxes do not simply mean a yet higher standard of living for members of the elite. and new luxury for foreign missions and embassies. nor should it be forgotten that when a bureaucratic class possesses power over economic life. such as licensing imports. new companies. etc.. its interest may indirectly be to perpetuate poverty and corruption. c) the stable and economicallyrun (nonbureaucratic. nonsocialistic) government will also be less wasteful. the worst example in this respect was. perhaps. ghana under nkrumah. in a few years. he squandered the four hundred million pounds left in the countrys treasury by the departing british. waste takes various forms: a steel mill in egypt. a national airline in ethiopia. the manufacture of new cars in india. splendid public buildings and presidential palaces. prestige nrojects. military expenditures. without going into the merits of their stand and. only looking at it from an economic angle. it is significant that the nuclear nonproliferation treaty is most adamantly opposed by two of the worlds most slowly developing countries. india and brazil. the lesson of these several points for a healthy american policy of aid. can now be drawn. it is a simple lesson: there are deserving and undeserving countries in terms of their response to factors of development. in the long run. it may be hoped that foreign aid will create increasingly favorable market conditions for american companies. meanwhile. however. these benefits are limited. and they could accrue to american companies more directly by certain internal fiscal reforms too. yet. recognizing the obvious imperative of helping develop the countries of the third world. i wonder if the new approach should not concentrate on the encouragement of individual effort and initiative. the alternative is clear: it is the increasing luxury guaranteed to a small elite. bureaucratic. nonproductive. addicted to status symbols. and even to the repression of the local citizenry. how much more useful would be to seek out the private sector and its deserving individuals and groups. even small countries. like guatemala. benefit very little by governmenttogovernment aid. like the alliance for progress. i was told in that country that alliance and aid are a good thing not because of their official contribution. but because of the presence of some 3000 americans (the officials and their families) who spend handsomely a remark to be pondered by all those discussing foreign aid policies. sensible policies could be based on this approach. namely on the attitude that individuals. rather than governments. should be helped. as mr. guido fernandez. then executive secretary of the national association for economic development (anfe) of costa rica. wrote in 1963. the alliance for progress \"with the best intentions. amplifies the radius of action of the public sector ... the private sector which is supposed to produce added income and a permanent source of increased employment. remains stagnant or reduced to a minimum.\" true. in this manner progress will be less spectacular. but spectacular progress displayed by governments addicted to planning is usually of the potemkinvillage type. whereas concrete aid to concrete persons. industries. cooperatives. or other branches of activity would create not only islands of prosperity. but would also encourage a desire to imitate. to compete. this implies. some might remark. a clear attempt to influence the prevailing internal economic policies within the recipient country. but all types of aid necessarily do so. and not only aid. but other actions and events as well. it is illadvised to argue. for example. that the end of the vietnam war would liberate new funds for purposes of foreign aid. on the contrary. one consequence of ending that conflict. if it ends. with american loss of face and with doubt spreading as to american promises. would be that many asian nations might turn to socialistic policies and into socialist regimes. people. even against their longrange interests and better knowledge. tend to imitate the victor. or the one who appears more powerful. why not use american power intelligently. towards influencing the economic policies of countries desirous of american economic aid? and correspondingly. why not deny aid to countries which refuse our conditions? i note this healthy tendency towards making american foreign aid more selective and hence more concentrated. in secretary of state dean rusks recent statement before the senate foreign relations committee. he also emphasized the necessity of local effort and willingness to work. and the obligation on our part to help the willing. not the indolent. the bureaucratic. the troublemaker. we must hope that these are no mere words. but the expression of a new. more realistic. attitude. in conclusion. i would like to remark that when professor myrdal calls upon us to become pedagogues in this field. i trust he allows for the fact that we pedagogues may have rather different philosophies. thank you very much."},{"1":"1967","2":"SAYLOR","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. the united mine workers of america are understandably concerned with some of the legislation that has been proposed to restrict use of fuels as a deterrent to air pollution. undue limitations affecting coal recommended particularly for metropolitan areas would seem highly shortsighted and uneconomic. at the same time they would create hardships for an industry that. in alliance with its major consumers. has made remarkable progress in the crusade to clean up the atmosphere. science and research have developed equipment to capture almost all particulate matter before it leaves the stacks. at the new minemouth generating stations in central pennsylvania. 99 percent of the fly ash will be removed. there is every reason to believe that the research effort now underway can dispose of the sulfur oxide problem. either by taking the sulfur out of the fuel before it is burned or from the products of combustion before they are emitted into the air. current intensification of the research attack on air pollution may. in effect. reduce fuel costs by producing elemental sulfurnow in short supply throughout the worldfrom oxides in flue gases. in capturing fly ash through use of electrostatic precipitators. the utilities are not only disposing of an ugly atmospheric contaminant. they are making available a byproduct of combustion which can be used in the production of cement. cinder blocks. and bricks. i should like to point out that a 3day meetingsponsored by the edison electric institute. national coal association. and the bureau of mines--on new markets for fly ash will open in pittsburgh march 14. experts from the united states and foreign countries will consider possible uses of fly ash for highway building. construction. and agriculture. the event should serve as a tribute to scientists and engineers who have found a way to deal with a nuisance that has a history of accumulating on window sills and porches. now they are putting it to a useful purpose. the new research interest in sulfur oxide omissions is equally encouraging. the atomic energy commission has announced that its brookhaven national laboratory will undertake to study the feasibility of pinpointing sulfur oxide emissions from plant stacks by use of a tracer isotope. meanwhile the office of coal research and the u.s. bureau of mines have put other laboratories to work on the problem of eliminating or reducing this gas contaminant from coal combustion. in drawing up legislation to control air pollution. the federal and state governments must cautiously avoid imposing unrealistic handicaps on the coal industry by recognizing fully the improvements both achieved and in the making. a similar philosophy needs to be applied in the field of water pollution. where research is being directed at solving the mine drainage problem. the state of pennsylvanias department of mines and minerals has directed considerable research effort to mine drainage. and the federal government must provide full support in this phase of the program to clean our streams. in this regard i should like to insert in the record a statement to the pennsylvania sanitary water board by mr. c. howard hardesty. executive vice president of consolidation coal co.. and vice chairman of the keystone bituminous coal association. who reviews what industry is doing and also warns of the urgent need for communication. cooperation. and collaboration between the federal and state governments in the design and production of stream criteria. mr. speaker. scientists are at work in a new jersey laboratory on a project to produce electricity without the conventional generator. an experiment which if successful would be a major breakthrough in air pollution control. meanwhile. the coal industry and electric utilities. in cooperation with government and with equipment manufacturers. are steadily improving facilities and techmiques to reduce contamination. the calgon corp.. of pittsburgh. recently announced a process for treating organic wastes to a quality higher than is possible with conventional treatment. and at a cost below that of secondary treatment. the prospects are bright. they cannot be overlooked in proposed legislation either here in washington or in state capitols. mr. hardestys statement follows:"},{"1":"1966","2":"GROSS","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"we were also told in the hearings that the present location of this river endangers the military installations in the valley. i took the trouble to call the military services and they said they had not lost a single dollar from a flood. i am not going to further belabor this issue. but i am totally unconvinced that the taxpayers of this country should be called upon to expend $12.6 mlillon to take over an obligation that belongs to private property owners and the public interests which control this river. including the channel and which will be enormously benefited in terms of enhanced land values. i cannot support this bill on the basis that i do not think a valid case has been made for it."},{"1":"1965","2":"HOLLAND","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. i thank my good friend the senator from wisconsin for having given me notice ahead of time thathe proposed to make the speech that he has just made. i thank him for furnishing me with a copy of the major portion of his remarks. that is in the finest tradition of senatorial courtesy. i shall deal with the matter as briefly as i cansince it is a matter of great importance not only to my state but also to the nationwith some of the matters which the senator from wisconsin has advanced. first. with reference to the cost of the construction of the crossflorida barge canal. i doubt if the senator knows. and therefore i shall state for his informatipn and for the record. that in the several contracts that have been let to date by the engineers. the actual contract price is well below the estimate of the engineers. there is every indication that the cost price will be decidely less than that which i think was a conservative estimate by the corps of engineers. second. with reference to the volume of traffic which was estimated. and upon which is based the estimate of revenue. i have noticed that. as to each of the important canal links which have been built while i have been herei have been around here quite a whilewhether they be in the inland of our country or along the atlantic seaboard. the estimate of the engineers has been well under the amount of traffic that has been realized thereafter. in the work on the mississippi. i noted that the same thing has occurred. it has occurred on the ohio river and on the tennessee river. the vast volume of business which has moved through these canal routes has shown time and time again that the engineers have been too conservative in estimating the great growth of the country and the great growth of barge traffic. and particularly have they underestimated the growth of traffic on canals. the fact of the matter is that the traffic on the mississippi river. on the gulf intracoastal waterways. and the east coast and the central waterways has so increased over and above what was estimated that. in that very fact. we have one of the princllal arguments for the early construction and completion of the crossflorida barge canal. there is no doubt about it. if the senator would read the transcript of the hearings. he would note that the vice president of the mississippi valley assocfation testified before the committee so ably headed by the distinguished senator from louisiana. that. in the judgment of their body. this project is very badly needed. the name of the gentleman. the vice president of the mississippi valley association. is robert l. shortle. of louisiana. his testimony will be found on pages 2198 and 2199 of the transcript. not only has the canal volume of traffic greatly exceeded the estimates. but also. in this case. it has been shown frequently that traffic around the end of florida is dangerous traffic. barges very rarely attempt such a course unless they are very large barges. ever since the days of the wreckers on the florida keys. the straits of florida- have been considered a dangerous place for barge traffic. this canal would save 611 miles of the. transportation route from the gulf coast. and from the mississippi valley to the great markets of the eastern seaboard. and particularly markets in the northeast. in my judgment. this would be one of the valuable connecting links. if not the most valuable. in the entire canal system. the estimate of the engineers has been below what i predict will be realized. i am basing my prediction on what i have seen happen with reference to the gulf coast waterway. the mississippi. tennessee. a nd ohio river waterways. and with reference to the intracoastal waterway along the east coast of the united states. mr. president. i have some knowledge about the next point i shall discuss. the senator from wisconsin admitted. and it is. of course. true. that in making their estimates of benefitcost ratio. and particularly the last one in 1962. which is 1.1 on one basis. 1.17 on another basis. and 1.2 on a third basis--and i believe that the 1.2 is more accurate than the others--they excluded the benefits from service rendered to the national defense. i happened to be serving. due to the generosity of the people of florida. as governor of florida during the second world war. i remember how the representatives of the federal government came to florida and asked for every bit of help that we could give them to expedite a connecting pipeline service across the north end of the peninsula in order that the pipeline and pumping stations could be put in so that the needed oil supplies and gasoline supplies for which most of the eastern coast was going hungry could be quickly and safely made available. the united states was losing a large number of tankers at that time due to the submarine attacks. particularly off. the gulf coast of florida. the lower part. of the peninsula. it was a nightandday affair. i say to my distinguished friend. the senator from wisconsin. to install that important pipeline and the pumping stations. it was a 24houraday job to keep the barges coming from the west coast so that gas and oil might cross to the east coast in the required amounts. so i happen to know. from some personal experience. that even though there was a far lesser amount of oil and gas consumed in those days. there had to be a shortened safe route across the north part of the peninsula of florida to protect the people of our nation and the defense efforts in a large part of the nation. the canal has a very great defense value. so much for that. mr. president. let me turn now to page 905 of the record of the hearings. where will be found the testimony of maj. gen. a. c. welling who is the division engineer of the south atlantic division. in reply to this problem. one thing. he reports is that the benefittocost ratio is 1.1. and he particularly says \"exclusive of defense benefit.\" in that same testimony he* states that the appropriated amounts. to date. are $6.685.000. of which $4.800.000 had been committed to construction. in that same statement he states that the budget bureau had requested $10 million for fiscal year 1966. as a matter of fact. the engineers put into their budget a larger amount. but $10 million was all the budget bureau allowed. because of the straitened condition of the budget. with which the senator is familiar. so the distinguished general who was testifying there gave the basic facts on which this amount is based. on page 906. in another part of the statement of general welling. will be found the paragraph which i think gives the basic facts about the canal. i read it: the barge canal will unite the atlantic and the gulf intracoastal waterways into a system encompassing an area of 34 states. savings in distance via the barge canal would be 356 miles compared to the okeechobee waterway across south florida. and 611 miles compared to the exposed and hazardous route around the florida keys. interpolating there. i should say only that if the canal were approved through the okeechobee waterwaya waterway which is underlaid with rock. it would be a vastly more expensive operation than this one. continuing: certain vessels require partial dismantling in order to transit the okeechobee waterway with its limiting clearances. this expense could be saved by use of the barge canal. which would provide adequate clearance. the barge canal will also reduce flood damages by assisting the rapid removal of runoff from areas repeatedly subject to flood damage. the whole fact of the matter is that the question of a crossflorida canal was determined long before this canal. as now projected. was the object of congressional action or research by the engineers. with respect to the earlier planned sea level ship canal. it involved cutting into the structure of rock and subterranean water in the ocala area. there are important subterranean streams there. and there was vast opposition to it in that southern part of the state. where 3 out of 4 of the voters and of the population of the state of florida can be found. so the engineers. looking at the feasibility of a canal with locks and looking at the entire situation. worked out the present project. and in 1942 this was the project which was authorized. i was serving as governor at that time. i made a complete study of it. and approved it though i had strongly opposed the sealevel ship canal. i made known my views about it. i did it each time i ran. and i have been honored by the generosity of my people to be elected to the senate four times. there is no question where i stood on it. there is no question where the present governor stands. every governor since my time has been for it. every legislature. every cabinet member. and there are six cabinet members. who are elected on a statewide basis. just as the governor is. and every member of the congressional delegation from florida is supporting the project. the reason for it is that it is a lock barge canal project similar in depth to canals which are now along the gulf waterway and up the mississippi river and along the intracoastal waterway. in other words. barges can go from one to another without difficulty. the fact of the matter is that the real objection now has shifted from those people who originally had a fear of the effects on subterranean watersbecause there is no substance to that pointto those who now want to conserve the beauties of the oklawaha river. i am sorry the senator from wisconsin could not pronounce the name correctly. i know it well. i have been there. it is a beautiful stream and a beautiful valley. part of it will be inundated and made into a lake. there is no question about it. but instead of being harmful to fish. it is going to be a blessing to those who like to go fishing. i think it might be well to read from the fish and wildlife report. as included in the statement of governor burns when he was heard on this matter before our committee. mr. president. i read from governor burns testimony on page 2204 of the hearings of the committee. the senator from wisconsin has spoken of the opposition which has been made by some florida people. a minority of them. and it is only a small minority who are opposing the canal. i read from the statement of governor burns: as an example of the distortion perpetrated. the folder lists in detail the fish and wildlife losses at separate locations along the canal route totaling 18.249 mandays of hunting and 30.600 mandays of fishing. there is no reporting. however. of similar increases in hunting and fishing resulting from the project development as detailed in the same official report. that is the report of the u.s. fish and wildlife service. continued reading: for the entire canal project the u.s. fish and wildlife service estimated in their report a net loss of 18.150 mandays of sports hunting but also shows a net total increase of 78.200 mandays of sports fishing in the project area. let me say to the senator from wisconsin that it has been my privilege to fish. both in the oklawaha river and in the backwaters of the withlacoochee. above an old dam there. this socalled backwater is a similar lake to the two or three new lakes that would be formed by this project only it is on the western endin the backwaters of the withlacoochee. that is where the fishing camps are. that is where the fishermen go by the hundreds. that is where i have enjoyed some of the finest fishing in my life. by going from the river into the backwaters. i can report with some authority that it is in the backwaters that the real fishing exists. therefore. even the fish and wildlife service reports hereas it shouldthat there will be a large net gain in fishing. fishing facilities. and fishing opportunities in the state of florida due to this canal project. mr. president. there are other things that i would be glad to mention. but i do not believe it is necessary to mention any of them. i wish to make clear that i believe the governor of florida. our cabinet members. the 2 senators and 12 representatives from florida. know something about the temper of our people. we know perfectly well that more than 3 out of 4 voters and residents live below this canal. we have certainly got sensitive ears to complaints which come from them. we know perfectly well that the governor is correct in his statement when he says that at least in the past 5 or 6 years the people of florida have substantially gotten together behind support for this barge canal. realizing that it would bring even more blessings than harm to the nation. in the assurance of traffic through that canal from the gulf to the atlantic. which is badly needed. and on which there will be a net saving of 611 miles. mr. president. without further laboring the question. let me say that in my judgment this is a project which is of great value to the nation. we would not find the gulf coast waterways coming in here to support it. or the mississippi waterways interests. or the east coast intracoastal waterways. if they did not know that it would afford an added opportunity for quick. safe traffic from the gulf to the atlantic. and from the atlantic to the gulf. at the great rate which the nation is growing today. and the great rate in which traffic needs are increasing. this is a connecting project. long needed. and which we are about to get seriously underway. in closing. let me remind the senator from wisconsin that every one of his arguments has been made before the able public works committees of the house and senate at the time the project was authorized. every such argument was made in 1958 when the project was reconsidered. and again approved. and every argument was repeated in 1962 when the same process was gone through. these same arguments have all been made. time after time. to every representative from florida at the state level and at the national level. i believe that we know what is involved here a good deal better than do some of our distinguished friends. who do not even know how to pronounce the names of the rivers which are involved in this particular transaction. we hope that our distinguished friend who did not urge this matter before the committeei think he said to me that he realized he was the only one on the committee who would be for it. and that others would not--and i remind the senate that there were 27 members of that committeewill not urge this matter too far. because we are well embarked on it. it is moving at less than the estimated cost. it is moving as rapidly as congress will allow it to move. i believe that it is moving to the advantage and the good service of the entire nation. mr. president. i thank the distinguished chairman of the committee for having so lucidly stated the matter from the standpoint of one who is disinterestedas i know he isin this and other projects in the 50 states. he has shown a complete impartiality and fairness to all projects which i greatly admire. i wish to pay tribute to him at this time for being willing to carry the onus of this debate. just as he has done on all other projects. i suggest that i believe he knows more about fishing in the oklawaha river than does the learned editorialist in the new york times who asserts that fishing will be adversely affected there. that gentleman does not know what he is talking about. that is not true. fishing will be greatly helped by the construction of this canal."},{"1":"1964","2":"HEBERT","3":"E","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"who knows more about the military. what it is. and what it does. and what it should do than many generals or admirals that i know. last february. after sitting in secret session over a period of several days. with the service

there need be no fear on that score.\" the only thing i might add to this is that this year the defense department will spend $51.2 billion on our national security program and if we generals cant provide this country with an adequate defense for that kind of money then wed better hope that the good lord is watching over us for sure. i dont want to bore you with a lot of facts and figures but i want to give you some idea of the magnitude of our national defense effort. counting the civilian employees. we have 3.7 million people actively involved today in the defense establishment of this country. the army has half of its 16 combatready divisions located outside of the united states in positions to counter communist aggression long before it reaches the united states. the air force that 5 years ago had zero operational capability in the intercontinental ballistic missile field. today has more than 600 operational longrange atlas. titan. and minuteman missiles ready to fire--and these are supplemented by about 1.300 strategic air command bombers that have kept this country safe from nuclear destruction for the past 10 years or more. over 500 of these bombers are maintained on 15minute ground alert and a small number are actually in the air every minute of the day. this is about twice the bomber force that is available to the soviets. the navy has 17 polaris subs commissioned and this force is being added to every year. by 1968 well have over 40 of these unbelievably powerful boats prowling the underneath area of the seas surrounding our enemies. added to this is the navys aircraft carrier force that alone can deploy more atomic bombers than the entire soviet bomber force. and along with this. ready to give somebody a good punch in the nose. is the marine corps with three divisions and three air wings. and theres the coast guarddoing its tremendously important job of maritime navigation. safety. and security. we have made real progress in strengthening our defenses over the past 3 years and our forces will continue to improve in their combat effectiveness. compared with 1960 we have made a 100percent increase in the number of nuclear weapons available in the strategic alert force. a 45percent increase in the number of combatready army divisions. a 60percent increase in the tactical nuclear force deployed in western europe. a 75percent increase in airlift capability. and. a 100percent increase in general ship construction. all of our army divisions have been reorganized to take maximum advantage of the modern weapons and equipment that is being produced for them. our increased use of helicopters and light planes. for example. is permitting a tremendous increase in battlefield mobility that in turn permits us to develop entirely new tactics in defeating the enemy by surprise and shock action rather than the traditional slowmoving costly ground attacks. when you take all of this together and back it up with the finest. most ready reserve force that this country has ever had. this is the most powerful force we have ever assembled in peacetime. the other day i listened to a speech by senator jackson from the state of washington in which he made the point that a good policy. if effective. tends to invite its own discard. the point being that after a tough problem is countered we forget it ever existed. as an example. we have for some time now pursued a policy of military superiority over the russians. we have spent untold billions of dollars to attain and maintain strategic superiority and in recent times we have spent more billions of dollars to bolster our strength in the area of limited wars and subversion. as a result of this policy of military superiority we have relative peace and we have deterred further communist aggression. now. because we are not menaced by overt communist aggression there is a tendency on the part of some to say: \"well. now that the communists have apparently lowered the gun. we dont need to worry so much about our security.\" as secretary rusk recently indicated we should not be under any illusions as to the designs of the communists against us and the entire free world. the communist menace is deadly serious and the fact that they move from the direct attack to the indirect. or that they lower the loaded gun does not alter in one iota the fact that moscow. as well as peiping. remains committed to communist world revolution. because of this i am certain we will move with great care in making any significant changes in current national security policy. at the same time. it is probable that as this period of relative peace. which in a literal sense our policy has forced upon the russians. continues. there will be more and more voices raised calling our attention to the mproved international situation and insisting that the high tide of danger has subsided and we can now afford to carry a smaller stick. one authority recently said: \"we should make our detense forces more unobtrusive.\" i suppose i tend to oversimplify these complex issues but i believe it is necessary that our defense forces be clearly visible to our potential enemies. i heard a speech not long ago in which the speaker in support of his thesis of preparedness said: \"last year there were 50.000 armed robberies committed in the united states and only 2 of these were committed against uniformed policemen.\" and i think that tells the story pretty well. in this connection people often ask me why we keep so much of our army overseas. why do we keep troops in berlin or why do we need 5 divisions of troops in europe or 2 divisions in korea or 15.000 men in vietnam? the answer is a fairly obvious one. we have learned from bitter experience that communism by its very nature moves like floodwaters into every power vacuum or unprotected area left by the free world. we have learned from experience that the only way to stop communist aggression is to meet it at its borders. the place to prevent a flood is at the river bank. not at your own doorstep. we are in berlin. in europe. in vietnam. and in korea primarily because it is in our selfinterest to be there. and not out of some purely altruistic motive of protecting the other fellow. there are two opposing power centers in the worldone russian and one american--and the stakes in the conflict between the two is the survival of our way of life. we need all the friends we can get on our side and we want them to be as strong and contribute as much to our mutual defense as they possibly can. this is why we assist them by selling. and in some cases giving them military equipment. this is why we train and advise them. the south vietnamese. in fighting to prevent a communist takeover in southeast asia. are fighting not only their fight but our fight. in a sense. we are playing in a poker game where the stakes are as high as they can get: survival. this isnt a game we can withdraw from without losing and it isnt one that is likely to be won by bluff. we need the high cards--and this means military might. we need house menand this means friends. and we need patiencebecause this is not a shortterm proposition. i i often hear the question: \"can we afford these heavy defense and military aid expenditures?\" i hope you will agree that the answerinvolving as it does. the security of this countryhas got to be \"yes.\" were going to spend about $50 billion on defense next year. this is an amount that almost staggers the imagination. yet. do you realize that we spent $33 billion on gambling last year? or that we spent $22 billion on vacations? my point is that we can afford whatever it takes to secure our way of life. and my commitment to you as a representative of the armed forces is that we will keep this nation free and we will do it at the lowest possible cost. i cant resist the opportunity to at least comment on the assignment that i have had for the past 3 years of handling the armys business with the congress. this is an experience that comes to far too few of our military officers. i doubt that even you good citizens fully realize the work that is done in your behalf by your delegation in congressand i must say that it is a potent one. mr. htzeat for example is one of the most senior men on the house armed services committee that is responsible for practically all military legislation. of course. i am most familiar with the work of mr. h1sert and this committee that has done so much in shaping our current military force structure. has led the effort to make our reserve forces the positive force they are in national security. has tightened the laws under which most of the vast procurement expenditures of the department of defense are made. has laid the groundwork for our national civil defense policyin other words. if you really wanted to learn something about the armed forces this afternoon. the fellow who ought to be talking to you is mr. habtst. and then you have hale boggs. the majority whip in the house of representatives. second in line behind the chairman of the ways and means committee that is responsible for the tax structure of this country. not to mention the power on the democratic side to make all new committee appointments. you have senator ellender who is only chairman of the committee on agriculture but also sits as a senior member on appropriations. and senator russell long. the ranking democrat behind harry byrd on the senate finance committee that controls all legislation affecting the financial basis of the united states. these four men alone. not to mention the rest of your fine delegation. wield great influence over the affairs of our nation. this is a fast moving world were living in and the pace seems to be constantly increasing. as the world has grown smaller to the point where even the countries farthereat from us are only a few hours away. all the world has become our neighbor and their problems have more and more become our problems too. in such an environment there is a terrible temptation to seek quick solutions to problems. to discard principle for expediency. to permit the ends to justify the means. fortunately. one of the builtin safeguards against such tendencies in our system is the congress. it represents the people and because it does. it moves with deliberate speed. it does so because. as a body. it is highly conscious of the principles and the heritage upon which our way of life is based and it moved with extreme caution to avoid vlolating either that heritage or those principles. i have come to deeply appreciate the role that congress plays as the conscience of our armed forces. it serves as an effective voice or spokesman for the men and women within the services. we owe a great deal to men like mr. htbert in congress. who understands the problems facing the sergeant with 20 years service trying to raise and educate a family on $345 per month takehome pay. who knows what the $30 per month that this sergeant saves at the commisary means to him. who knows the agony that this sergeant feels when all too frequently he must leave his family to fend for themselves as he leaves for duty overseas. who knows the crying need of this sergeant for a reasonably adequate house when he is reunited with his family. and who knows that this sergeant never heard of a 40hour workweek. i have talked earlier about our increased strength in terms of new equipment and new weapons. but the true measure in our increased effectiveness is in the caliber of the men and women of the armed forces. in the army. about 75 percent of our enlisted personnel are high school graduates and about 90 percent of our lieutenants are college graduates. ten years ago these figures were only slightly more than half of that. these standards are directly related to the great technological changes in our armed forces and the need for higher technical skills and greater aptitudes. the armys global missions today demand that the modern soldier be trained and ready to carry out a multitude of demanding assignments. i can testify that our soldiers. sailors. and airmen are of a breed of men you can trust to defend our nation on any field of battlenow or in the future. they serve with dedication and pride and very little recompense and they deserve your support. in my book a general has two jobsa2675 to win battles and take care of his men. i have been well trained in battle tactics and i am confident in that regard. but i am going to need your understanding and your help in taking care qf my menyour men. if i had one thing tb ask of you today. it would be that you hold in your hearts for the other 364 days of the year the compassion and regard for the men and women of the army. navy. air force. and marines that is so wonderfully demonstrated by your presence here today. the air we breathe"},{"1":"1963","2":"MUSKIE","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. a few days ago the house passed a bill h.r. 6196. known as the cooley bill. designed to abolish the socalled twoprice system for cotton in this country and thereby to relieve american cotton textile mills from unfair foreign competition. i am wholeheartedly in accord with the purpose of this legislation. mr. president. and i hope the senate will soon have an opportunity to perfect and adopt such a bill. however. i also am of the opinion that there is a better way to deal with the cotton problem than the method called for in the house bill. a far more sensible approachindeed. a fresh. a new approachto the cotton problem is provided in a bill introduced in the senate last march by the junior senator from georgia and cosponsored by the senior senator from minnesota this bill. s. 1190. entitled the \"cotton domestic allotment act.\" makes a lot of sense. i urge my colleagues of the senate. who have not already done so. to get a copy of this bill and study it carefully. to me. the talmadgehumphrey proposals appear to offer the most sensible solutions to our present problems in the cotton and cotton textile industries suggested to date. i hope. mr. president. that soon the senate can consider h.r. 6196. the house bill. amend it so as to include the basic provisions of the talmadge bill. and then go on to pass it. with this approach we can save our textile industry from destruction. insure a fair return to cotton farmers. and cut the costs of our agricultural programs. the cotton textile industry is threatened today because. under the twoprice system. american mills must pay 81/2 cents a pound--or $42.50 a balemore for american cotton than the foreign mills have to pay. for too long now. we in the congress have failed to reach a real solution to the cotton problem. while we have postponed and delayed and temporized and quarreled. hundreds of american textile mills have shut down. throwing tens of thousands of workers out of jobs. textile jobs in this country have fallen from more than one and a quarter million in 1947 to less than 840.000 last year. this has created economic hardship in the textile manufacturing areas of new england and of the south. in my own home state of maine. there has been a 50percent decline in the number of cotton mills in the last 5 years. employment in the textile industry in maine has dropped more than 50 percent in the past 12 years. from 25.900 in 1950 to 12.000 in 1962. domestic cotton textile producers are being displaced not only by manmade fiber substitutes. but also by foreign grown cotton and by increased imports of cotton textiles. cotton exports during the 196263 marketing year were down sharplya total of only 3.4 million bales. domestic mill consumption this past season was 8.4 million balesabout onehalf million bales less than the previous year. it cannot be said. under these conditions that this industry is a growing and prosperous segment of our economy. we cannot be satisfied with less than around 5 million bales as our share of the export market for cotton. neither can we be satisfied unless our biggest and best customersour own millsuse more cotton as population rises and buying power is at favorable levels. at present. it is an ailing segment that is being forced into an even worse position. this is a segment too closely tied to our economy and national welfare to permit it to wither on the vine for lack of legislative action. if inaction continues to preclude this industry from competing we simply give carte blanche to foreign competitors to capture world markets. and to dominate domestic markets. also. we open the floodgates wider for use of manmade fibers. and everyone will sufferthe grower. the mills. the consumer. there also has been a sharp increase in imports of cotton textiles. for the first 8 months of calendar year 1963. cotton textile imports were up about 2 percent above the comparable 1962 period. total imports of cotton textiles on a raw fiber equivalent basis were at a record level of 457.000 bales in the first 8 months of this year. there has been increasing evidence of the loss of cotton markets to competing manmade fibers. we hear of more and more instances where rayon and other synthetic fibers are being substituted for cotton. the production of manmade fibers for the first half of 1963 was about 7 percent above the same period a year earlier. mill consumption of cotton for the first 3 months of the current crop year is slightly below the same period a year earlier. cotton suffered a total competitive loss. as estimated by reliable economists. of 1.150.000 bales between december 1960 and march 1963. over this period. consumption of rayon in cottontype spinning mills rose 74 percent. consumption of dacron and similartype fibers rose 147 percent. cottons share of the fiber used in the cotton industry spinning operations has declined almost monthly. there is another important factor which should be neither overlooked nor dismissed. this is that the cotton situation has sharply increased government costs. as of august 31. 1961. commodity credit corporations investment in -upland cotton amounted to approximately $300 million. by august 31. 1963. it had risen to approximately $1.2 billion. the carryover on august 1. 1963. was 11.2 million bales. up more than 3 million bales over last year. mr. president. the cotton bill passed by the house would eliminate the unfair twoprice system. but it would go about it in the wrong way. by piling one 8y2centapound subsidy on another. the house bill would do nothing about solving the problems of mounting cotton surpluses. it does not provide the answer to the decline in cash income to the cotton farmers. and. while it may help the mills and the workers. it does not help the taxpayers. the talmadgehumphrey approach would do all of these things. it would end the twoprice system and enable our domestic textile mills to compete once again with foreign mills. costs to the mills would be lower under the talmadge bill than under the house bill. it would protect the jobs of american workers. it would protect the income of the american cotton producers. small family farmers would receive greater protection under the talmadge bill than under the house bill. it would encourage the exportation of american cotton. and. by taking the federal government out of the business of buying and storing cotton. it would effect great savings to the taxpayerssavings not possible under the house bill. although no cotton is produced in my state of maine or in the new england region. i recognize the importance of cotton to the agricultural economy of this nation. when we enact legislation designed to help the cotton mill worker in new england or the southeast. i think we also should try to help the cotton producer of the south and the southwest and the far west. especially the small farmers. wherever they are. the talmadge bill would do this by providing for adequate price supports and compensatory payments to farmers on cotton they produce within their domestic allotment quota. at the same time. the talmadge bill would allow the producers to grow and sell as much cotton as they please at the lower world market price. this would eliminate the necessity for the export subsidy. it would restore american cotton to a competitive position in the world markets. it would improve cottons competitive position with synthetic fibers. it would lower cotton textile prices and savings to the consumer. another great advantage to the talmadgehumphrey plan. mr. president. is that it would free the cotton farmer from acreage controls. i would suggest one amendment to the talmadge bill. mr. president. to give the secretary of agriculture standby authority to impose controls on cotton production or marketing when and if the world price drops below 50 percent of parity. this would provide added insurance against runaway production. my distinguished colleagues. the junior senator from georgia and the senior senator from minnesota are experts in the field of agriculture legislation. and. mr. president. they have combined their knowledge and talents to propose a program that i think needs to be enacted by this congress. i hope the committee on agriculture and forestry will soon take up h.r. 6196. amend it to include the basic provisions of the taimadge bill and send it to the floor of the senate so that we may be permitted to vote our approval of it. in this manner. mr. president. we will be able to accomplish the avowed purposes of s. 1190: to maintain the income of cotton producers. to permit cotton producers to grow and market cotton on a free enterprise basis. to protect the welfare of consumers and of those engaged in the manufacture of cotton textiles. and to encourage the exportation of cotton. we have an opportunity here to benefit the farmer. the millworker. the mill operator. the consumer. and the taxpayer. and i hope we can seize this opportunity at the earliest possible moment."},{"1":"1962","2":"PROXMIRE","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. i con- tion of indirect benefits. it can be seen that tinue to read from mr. ecksteins article: the entire analysis is carried out on the with and without\" principle. the indirect table 39. reproduced from the bureau benefits are divided into three categories. manual. gives an example of the computa- category a is designed to measure the profits earned on commodities of the projects which are sold locally. the figure is derived by simply multiplying the total local sales by 5 percent. which approximates the average profits earned on sales by local distributors. category b measures the profit expected to accrue to \"all other enterprises between the farmer and the final consumer. from handling. processing. and marketing.\" in order to facilitate the analyses of specific projects. the bureau has derived statistically a set of indirect benefit factors. each factor represents the ratio of total profits in later processing to the value of the commodity at the farm. by multiplying the list of output quantities by the respective indirect benefit factors. the total extra profit is approximated. these two categories of benefits have been called the stemming benefits. category c represents the \"profits of all enterprises from supplying goods and services for the increase in farm purchases for family living and production expenses. usually called the induced benefits.\" in other words. it is the profit earned on the purchases made by the project. the profit rate has been computed to be an average of 18 percent for all farm purchases. and this figure is multiplied by the sum of the production expenses and the purchases for family living. in addition to the three categories included in table 39. indirect benefits are also expected to accrue from the rise in residential land values in towns near the project. to get an annual figure. a rate of return of 4 percent is applied to the rise in residential real estate values. this figure measures the induced benefit of additional rental services. the procedure outlined above were submitted by the bureau to an independent panel of three distinguished consultants. profs. j. m. clark. e. l. grant. and m. m. kelso. who made a number of criticisms but who endorsed the general approach. after examining the alternative. abandonment of measuring secondary benefit and inclusion of relevant statistical facts in project reports. they conclude: we see force in this view (that the evaluation of offproject effects be left to the judgment of higher authorities). but we recognize also that the pressure for rules of thumb is strong. and the advantages of more definite uniformity great. we therefore propose continued use of formulas. regarded as rules of thumb. and altered from present bureau practices. for \"stemming\" and \"induced\" benefits. but for some elements we propose that they be left to the exercise of judgment. without attempting quantitative measurement. stemming i wish to stress what i am talking about. because this \"stemming\" is a little complex. and i think it deserves repetition. to emphasize what it means. \"stemming\" includes two categories. the first category includes profits earned on commodities of the projects. like glen elderwhich. let us say. to make it simple. would produce nothing but grain sorghums. although the projects produce alfalfa. et ceterasold locally. in other words. that category includes the profits on commodities which are sold locally. that is category a. that figure is derived by multiplying total local sales by 5 percent. because that approximates the average profits earned on sales by local distributors. in other words. this is not a profit which the farmer would receive. if the farmer should sell his grain to a local processor. who in turn sold it to a miller. the profit which the local processor would receive would be considered in category a and would be said to \"stem\" directly from the irrigation project. that is the category a of the two categories which make up \"stemming.\" the second category. or category b. measures the profit which is expected to accrue to all other enterprises between the farmer and the final consumer from handling. processing. and marketing. in order to facilitate analyses of specific projects. the bureau has derived statistically a set.of factors. each representing an indirect benefit. each factor represents the ratio of total profits in later processing to the value of the commodity on the farm. then the bureau multiplies the list of output quantities by the respective indirectbenefit factors. for a total extra profit. i suppose. simply stated. what \"stemming\" amounts to is the profits which are received by all persons who handle the products produced on the land which is irrigated except the farmer. because. of course. the farmers benefits are directly calculated. they do not \"stem.\" and so would be calculated separately. continuing the quotation: as a rule of thumb the consultants question these procedures on the grounds that the factors vary too much among commodities. ranging from 6 to 83 percent. with those commodities which appear to have the firmest demand. such as fresh fruits and vegetables. and dairy. meat. and poultry products. having low factors. while cotton and wool. for which there is little need. have the highest factors. they also recommend that the benefitcost ratio be expressed in a way that makes clear what portion of benefits are indirect. and that separate ratios be given for separable segments of projects. with regard to stemming and induced benefits. they find that present procedures involve double counting. they reason as follows: to increase national income. both the supply and the demand of commodities must be increased. the first to prevent higher monetary demand from merely raising prices. and the latter to prevent higher output without a corresponding increase of monetary demand to take the goods off the market. they conclude. therefore. that either one or the other should be counted. but not both for any period of time. the consultants interpret induced benefits to be those originating in the fuller utilization of underemployed resources and labor. stemming benefits are assumed to be caused primarily by increasing the productivity of resources. they conclude that induced benefits should be granted during the period of construction. with the amount related to general employment conditions. and that stemming benefits be credited during operation. the amount to be much reduced below present practice. they also propose that an indirect benefit factor be applied to project costs. to indicate what indirect benefits would have been generated if the resources had been used elsewhere. if the factor applied to project costs were as great as the average of the other indirect benefit factors of a project. this recommendation alone would be sufficient to eliminate justification of projects through the use of indirect benefits. for any project with direct benefits smaller than direct costs would have more foregone indirect benefits on the cost side than positive indirect benefits from its outputs. indirect benefits could only magnify the difference between a projects benefitcost ratio and a ratio of 1.0. they could never push the project above or below the justification point. before we turn to a critique of the use of indirect benefits. one important distinction must be made. benefits accruing locally or in the region are different from national benefits. economic activity generated by a project will lead to an increase in wages. profits. and other incomes in the proximity. this is quite important. and it is ignored. in general. in computing the benefits. to some extent these increases will be offset by decreases elsewhere. but this is irrelevant from the local or regional point of view. conversely. some of the benefits may accrue outside the area. now i should like to take up both the national and regional points of view. the impact of a project on the rest of the national economy depends very much on the state of the economy at the time. let us first examine induced benefits. which are assumed to be the benefits caused by the monetary payments which spring from the project. in a time of depression. when the national output is far below capacity and there are idle resources diffused through the economy. induced benefits from the construction of a project are very real and important. the income payments which are made are respent by the recipients for the purchase of goods and services. setting off a long chain of impulses. putting idle men and resources back to work. this is the range of effects which is analyzed by the kahnkeynes theory of the multiplier effects of public works. the appropriate induced benefit factor is the multiplier. which can be estimated from a knowledge of the marginal propensity to consume in the economy. if national average figures are considered too crude. a better multiplier can be approximated by estimating the marginal propensities to spend of the groups which will receive most of the income payments. and calculating a multisector multiplier as outlined by j. s. chipman. induced effects from the operation of projects are likely to be either very small or nonexistent during a depression. since commodities are in oversupply. the money payments received for the projects output and respent by the farmers are likely to displace income payments to other farmers. if the commodity is sold in a free market. the extra supply will lower the price. and in view of the low elasticities of demand for farm products. may lower the total income received by farmers. if there are government pricesupport programs. the extra supply will simply mean an increase of government purchases of surpluses. this will lead to an increase of income payments and does open the doors to multiplier effects. but the effects are due to the increase in the government deficit caused by the pricesupport program. mr. president. that is an interesting point of departure. in other words. the argument is that there may be some real benefit for the economy by having farmers produce not merely the regular surplus they would ordinarily produce. but a supersurplus. the argument is that if we build the glen elder project for $60 million to bring more land into production or. i should say. make the land which is in production more productive. it will be necessary for the federal government to engage in a more expensive farm program than we engage in now. that is true. and no one can deny it. that is why i deplore the project and why i have offered an amendment to knock it out. but those who favor the project. those who believe that the government should engage in the irrigation project at a cost of $60 million. can argue that whereas the project will increase the deficit. it will. after all. increase payments to farmers. it will increase farm income. and those farmers might then buy more tractors. milking machines. television sets. farm trucks and any number of other things. it is argued that in an economy such as ours. in which we are operating far below capacity. in which we have unemployed people. and our factory capacity utilization on the average is about 85 percentwell below what we could have although the federal government will have to run a deficit or the taxpayer will have to ante up more to pay for the project. it may be a good thing because it would mean more economic activity. mr. president. that is about the only argument that can be made against my amendment and for the bill as it is presently drafted. i doubt very much if the argument will be made. but i think it is the only argument that can be made at all. i reject it. because certainly if our country is in such a fantastically weak economic condition. if the understanding of our financial. business. and political leaders is so feeble that the only way we can revive our economy is to build unneeded and. as i pointed out in this case. unwanted irrigation projects which will perform the service of increasing the surplus supply of food. then we are in a very sorry condition. indeed. i seems to me that we should be able to justify public works. we could justify any number of things that ought to be done in our country. including improving our educational system greatly. we should be hiring more teachers. we should be training more teachers and paying teachers better. we should be emphasizing education. for it is our greatest shortcoming in america. we should reduce taxes so that people will have money to spend as they wish to spend it. but to rely on a system of increasing surpluses so that we can pay the farmer more in surplus payments is about as bankrupt. unsatisfactory. and ridiculous a method of stimulating our economy as i can imagine. as mr. eckstein points out: there are other ways that are far more desirable by which the deficit can be increased. which do not take the roundabout route of building irrigation projects. with farmers working to grow crops in order to be able to sell them to the government which will put them in storage. tax cuts or useful public expenditures are preferable ways of having the government increase personal income. we therefore conclude that the operation of projects does not create induced benefits in depression other than the effect of the pricesupport program. but that the construction of projects does induce substantial amounts. in times of inflation. when the total monetary demand for commodities exceeds the supply of goods. thus forcing a rise of prices. the induced effects are reversed. project construction adds fuel to the inflation by bidding up prices and pumping more money into income streams. while project operation has relatively small induced effects. since the additions to expenditures made by farmers are largely offset by the increased output streams of commodities. in times of economic balance. when there is high employment and a relatively stable price level.* induced effects are likely to disappear. with the pattern of money flows and the production of commodities in harmony. the construction of a project should have no induced effects. especially if the governments revenue policy is linked to its expenditures. which. of course. include the project. and the operation of the project again merely adds to both the income and the output streams. i think it is desirable and necessary for us to consider the economy in all phases. because the project is one which will be spread over 100 years. during that 100year period. we shall have periods of recession. deflation. depression. economic balance. and inflation. as dr. otto eckstein has pointed out. we cannot possibly justify such action in a period of inflation. because in a period of inflation it cannot do anything more than aggravate the inflationary situation. increase government spending and cost. and increase the burden on the taxpayer and consumer. as dr. eckstein has pointed out. in a period of balance it is a wasteful operation because there is no net contribution whatsoever. the result is zero. in a period of depression. when we have falling prices and profits and heavy unemployment. there are many other things that are far wiser. far more useful. and far better justified that could be done in place of the proposed project. to continue readingthe picture is quite different for the stemming benefits. which are defined to originate in the processing stages of production and which therefore must be confined to the period of operation of the project. in times of depression. the extra profits earned in processing commodities for the market must be nil or negative. since similar profits for processors of alternative sources of supply have been displaced to some extent and since the price drop caused by the increase in supply and the low elasticities of demand will reduce the total profits of all processors. if the farm output is sold to the government as part of a price support program. usually no processing actually takes place. precluding stemming benefits altogether. should the government buy processed commodities at fixed prices. there would be an increase of processing profits. but an increase at the governments expense. while there may be the induced benefit of an increase in the government deficit. there is no stemming benefit which raises real national income since the commodity ends up in storage. in times of inflation. open or suppressed. when there is a genuine shortage of goods. stemming benefits become possible. particularly if there is a shortage of the outputs of a project. stemming benefits in processing are likely where the increase of output makes possible an increase of processing. the magnitude of the benefits will depend on the nature of the shortage. if it is very severe. so that the commodity can be assumed to be rationed. all of the profits in processing can be taken as a measure of stemming benefits. not only because they are made possible by the existence of the projects output. but also because that profit will be a reflection of the state of demand. it will represent the economic value of the processed goods minus the cost of other inputs. which must be assumed not to be in short supply. but it should be noted that the shortage of the project outputs must take the form of some sort of interference in the market. such as rationing. for otherwise it would express itself in higher prices at the farm. and would be reflected completely in the primary benefits. i should like to point out here that there is no shortage of output. we have a fantastic surplus in this country. it is the greatest we have ever had. it is a surplus which is increasing. and there is every prospect that we shall have that surplus for many long years to come. certainly there is no indication on the basis of legislation that has been considered. passed. or contemplated by the administration that we are going to be able to end this enormously serious farm problem. under those circumstances it is perfectly obvious that the eckstein analysis shows the stemming benefits to be nil. when there is economic balance. stemming benefits become possible only if some extraordinary assumptions are made in the analysis. if the premise of mobility is denied. so that it can be assumed that none of the factors of production would be put to a useful purpose in another location. and if there are pockets of unemployment in the area. then the output of the project may create processing opportunities and earning possibilities for resources that would otherwise be idle. these possibilities are the source of stemming benefits. in this case. the people in the area do not want it. they say they cannot use it. they say the only benefit would be presently available recreational benefit. there will not be any irrigation. because they will not join a district. which it is necessary to do under kansas law. dr. eckstein goes on to say: in our earlier discussion of this premise we pointed out that in a capitalist system. in which the movement of resources into their proper places is accomplished through the existence of differentials in reward. policies cannot be predicated on a general denial of mobility. policies which reduce mobility. such as removal of the differentials which are to induce movement. destroy the foundations on which the viability of the system rests. if the attempt is made to hold farmers in the area. or to hold people there by building a project like the glen elder project. or any other project. it runs counter to the mobility element in capitalism. which is so important. as people adjust their location and production to the needs of the market. like all policy criteria. the premise of mobility must be applied with moderation. there are situations where mobility is simply impossible. if processing facilities already exist in an area. are not used up to optimal capacity for reasons such as depletion of the soil. and cannot be moved because of excessive transportation costs. then the premise can legitimately be denied. this is likely to be particularly significant for projects which provide supplementary irrigation in areas in which the agricultural economy has been declining because of falling supplies of water. we saw another example in the case of flood control. where we assumed that movement of productive facilities could not be expected in anticipation of rare floods. and where we thus justified the existence of indirect benefits. there are other instances where the mobility of people cannot be assumed. perhaps because of specific ethnic or sociological obstacles. stemming benefits can also occur where output prices are not set competitively and the processors are able to earn monopoly profits. since the markets for most agricultural commodities are competitive. this will be a rare but not an impossible case. for example. sugarbeet processors are likely to have some monopoly power in dealing with their suppliers. since transportation costs are so important that the beets cannot be shipped far for processing. yet the optimal size of processing capacity is so large that it will not pay a second processor to move into an area to compete. thus the processor may be able to set a price that does not reflect the full value of the beets. but any exceptional instance must be warranted by circumstances that are peculiar to the case. we definitely reject the idea that all irrigation projects involve circumstances which permit denial of the premise in order to justify the use of indirect benefit factors on all its outputs even in times of economic balance. i might say that in this case. in the glen elder case. shown on the map in the rear of the chamber. there are no such extraordinary circumstances whatever. the indirect benefits are very negligible indeed. economies of scale in associated enterprises may also give rise to stemming benefits. fuller use of transportation facilities is the most important instance likely to be found where a project is located in a previously undeveloped area. following the reasoning of our transportation analysis in chapter vi. stemming benefits from this source will equal the difference between the total transportation charges for the projects inputs and outputs and the long run incremental costs incurred by the transport system. the quantitative significance will depend on the magnitude of transportation charges in relation to the values of the commodities and the difference between marginal costs and transportation rates. physical interdependence among economic units is another possible source of stemming benefits. an irrigation project involves such interdependence. the management of the water at the reservoir. in canals. and in irrigation ditches requires full recognition of these physical relationships. but the measurement of primary benefits and of costs already presupposes that these problems have been solved. that is. that the water is released and distributed according to a reasonable plan. and so no further benefits can be anticipated from this source. to claim benefits under this heading. it would need to be shown that the water supply of persons not on the project is improved. the benefits here are very marginal. indeed. it would mean that the people in beloit. kans.. the 3.500 people there. would have a water supply improved at a cost of $60 million. i must say that that is the most expensive water supply that any people in the world have ever constructed at any time. the appeal of the idea of stemming benefits is very strong. anyone can quickly discover that processors do earn substantial profits on the commodities produced by projects. and it seems only natural that these benefits accruing to others be computed and included in the benefitcost ratio. the premise of mobility leads to rejection of this line of thought because it implies that neither the processors nor their capital would be unemployed if the project did not exist. perhaps they would be absorbed in a similar business somewhere else. or perhaps entirely different industries would offer alternative opportunities where they would earn an equal return. in times of economic balance it must be assumed that the alternatives do exist. in summary. we conclude that stemming benefits are very unlikely in depression. are a possibility during inflation if the specific commodities are in particularly short supply. and can only be granted for periods of economic balance in those instances where the premise of mobility can be denied because of extraordinary circumstances. the routine calculation of stemming benefits. therefore. is not warranted. induced benefits. on the other hand. are largely confined to the construction of the project. they are large in times of depression. nonexistent in times of economic balance. and negative during inflation. mr. president. the pending bill contains a provision for $500 million. appropriated for public works acceleration. public works projects which can be set up very quickly. and which provide for maximum employment. they can serve a real public use which meets these standards. this is only the first payment on a $900mlllion public works acceleration program. which we approved only 10 days ago. in the event that the president of the united states or congress feels that public works programs at this time are desirable. i suggest that the thing to do is to provide public works in areas where there is heavy unemployment. in areas where public works can do a productive job to meet a public need. not in areas such as in this valley in kansas where the people who would be benefited by the project overwhelmingly say they do not want it. where 90 percent of them have petitioned against it. centainly in this time. which is said to be a time of economic balance in kansas. because there is certainly no cry to put people to work in this rural area on construction jobs. i believe it would be. as dr. eckstein points out in this definitive work. reasonable to conclude. so far as glen elder is concerned. that the benefits would be nonexistent. he goes on to say: but the basic assumption of benefitcost analysis is that the investment in natural resources is made in a framework of economic stability and of steady growth. the increased need for resources and the justification of the entire program in the minds of the public are predicated on the future growth of the system. the entire economic analysis and the financial analysis as well rest on the absence of wide departures from economic balance. especially in view of the long interval between the time the project reports are drawn up and the time the project is built. it has been found wise to assume neither inflation nor depression. with benefits expected to be reaped over an extraordinarily long period. usually 50 years or morein this case. 100 yearsit has been felt impossible to make more specific as-. sumptions. . yet a condition of economic balance is the state of affairs in which both induced and stemming benefits are nil or very small. it can therefore only be concluded that the use of indirect benefits in benefitcost analysis must be confined to cases where it can be shown that there are unemployed and immobile resources or that there is underutilized capacity in associated economic activities. i submit that that is not true in this case. this project involves $60 million of spending that cannot be justified."},{"1":"1961","2":"ROUSH","3":"E","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. with the 1st session of the 87th congress now a matter of history and record. i would like to review the activities of the session and the relation of these actions to my district and the state of indiana. for more than 5 months of this legislative year. the fifth congressional district of indiana was without representation in this body. it was a most unfortunate circumstance for the 460.000 residents of my district to be without a voice in this national assembly. the reason for this vacancy was the investigation into the election by order of the house of representatives. the manner of the investigation into our extremely close election again proved the integrity of the house and its committees. the result of the complete recount of the ballots proved that errors in tabulation and reporting could have denied the will of the majority of the voters in the district. a simple recount and tabulation of the ballots counted on election night by local precinct election officials gave me a majority of the votes. a count based on the application of uniform acceptance standards throughout the district also showed a majority in my favor. members of both political parties acclaimed the fairness and objectivity of the investigation. in their separate views to the unanimous committee report of my election. the republican members expressed their opinion that the contested election matter \"was directed in a thorough and fair manner.\" the defeated contestant himself complimented the committee which handled the matter for \"conducting the recount in an equitable manner.\" upon being seated. i introduced legislation which would provide a system of recount for congressional elections. my plan would allow states to pursue their own election contest procedures before certifying the results of the election to the clerk of the house. this would speed the contest procedures and reduce the possibility of a district being without representation again for this reason. i am hopeful that the committee will consider the bill early in the next session. statistics of the session indicate that it was a hardworking. productive year. the length of the session was the longest in peacetime in decades. the number of measures introduced and acted upon were at nearrecord highs. most important to residents of the fifth district of indiana was congressional approval of the flood control construction in our district. after years of planning. construction will finally begin on the threereservoir flood control system along the wabash river. congress appropriated $700.000 to begin construction of the salamonie reservoir in wabash county. the mississinewa reservoir will be begun with a $500.000 appropriation. the huntington reservoir will undergo final planning and design. $53.000 was appropriated for this purpose. president kennedys strong support for flood control and water resources development was a great factor in our legislative work this year. it gives renewed promise for rapid completion of these needed projects. his revised public works program included the three projects after the final eisenhower recommendations had neglected the important mississinewa project. thus. we begin the flood control system which is so vitally needed by the people of peru. wabash. and all those along the wabash river in indiana. with the construction of these reservoirs come additional benefits to the residents of the area. plans for the development of the reservoirs as recreation and conservation areas are progressing in the indiana department of conservation. the construction period will provide jobs for hundreds over the next several years. the ready supply of water will help alleviate desperate needs experienced by marion. huntington. and other area cities in recent years. the good of these projects is just beginning to unfold as construction starts. the federal judiciary of the state was increased with the addition by this congress of one additional judge each for the northern and southern districts of indiana and the addition of a judge to the seventh circuit court of appeals. this increase in the staff of the courts will aid the cause of justice by relieving the backlog of cases in each court and speed judicial action. indianas benefits from legislation which bolstered the general economy are measurable. more than 36.000 unemployed persons in the state took advantage of the extension of unemployment compensation immediately after it was effective. this alone pumped more than a million dollars a week into the indiana economy. rapid return of federal income tax payments. payment of veterans insurance annuities and the speedup of military spending aided indiana in its recovery from the recession of 1960. economic statistics in the state are encouraging and the general economic outlook for indiana is favorable. indiana and fifth district farmers have been enthusiastic in their reaction to the feed grains program. this program. initiated by the 87th congress. has been largely responsible for the increase in total national farm income. it will. for the first time in years. cut the total grain surplus in storage. by doing so. it can cut the total cost of the farm program. as a former prosecuting attorney. i know the need for the attorney generals crime program. the benefits to be derived from the anticrime legislation he was given by the congress will accrue to all. it will be of assistance to every lawenforcement agency in the nation and will go a long way toward final success in the fight against organized crime. the social security amendments of this session of congress have improved the program in light of todays needs. these new benefits include: optional retirement for men at 62 with proportionately reduced benefits. a raise in benefits to widows from 75 percent of that to which the primary insured was entitled to 821/2 percent of those benefits. raised earnings ceiling for retired persons. and broadened insured status requirements. the housing act of 1961 was the most comprehensive housing bill passed by congress in years. the provisions of this bill will make it easier for families. especially moderate income families. to own their own home or to make improvements in their present dwellings. the program of urban renewal and development in this act is of great encouragement to towns and cities in our district which are planning needed local projects. the programs for housing for the elderly citizens. for farm families and for colleges will be of great use in our district. several communities in our district are planning airport improvements. the extension of airport programs by this congress will enable these cities to provide more modern. safer airport facilities. marion is completing work on a runway built under this program at the present time. anderson. huntington. and wabash have contacted my office concerning their own airport development plans. many workers in the district have been affected by the change in the federal wage and hour law. this congress broadened the coverage of the law to include some 3.6 million more workers nationally and raised the minimum wage. in steps. to $1.25 per hour. the national defense posture was a subject of much concern in this past session of congress. acting on the recommendations of the president. congress quickly approved increased strength both in conventional and modern armaments. and in our fighting forces. at the same time a concerted drive by the congress and the administration has resulted in giving the nation more for its defense dollar. the badly mismanaged m14 rifle procurement has been corrected and this improved weapon is being delivered on schedule to our fighting men around the world. the shocking labor problems at key missile bases which existed in past years have been corrected. the administrations efforts have reduced the time lost in labor disputes from an average of 21.500 mandays per quarter in 1960 to 768 mandays in the second quarter of 1961. the small business administration program was expanded by this congress. activities of this agency have increased rapidly this year. the sba provides valuable assistance to small independent businessmen and to communities. conferences are being arranged in the district to better acquaint businessmen with their activities. my assignment on the house committee on science and astronautics has enabled me to observe the nations space efforts at first hand. the successes of our program this year. including the two successful suborbital manned launchings. give preview to the developments of our space technology which are to come. with the impetus of increased emphasis for the moon program and other space efforts. our progress should be swift and the evidence of our progress increasingly more dramatic. the committee activity is but one area in which i have taken special interest. i introduced a bill to provide for the establishment of an indiana dunes national park. my plan would enable both the park and the indiana deep water port to be established. these two projects complement each other. the port is of great economic significance to the state and i am happy to see the leadership in this project being provided by gov. matt welsh. the park is of great conservation and recreation value. we can and should have them both in indiana. to this end i have directed my efforts. the construction of the mississinewa reservoir will necessitate the removal of the grave of the historic indian figure. frances slocum. the present slocum cemetery will be inundated by waters from the reservoir. attempts to have her body reinterred in pennsylvania have been thwarted. i believe. by the alert expression of intense local interest in this historic monument. plans are being made to secure a suitable site for her grave near the present location and i have introduced legislation to have it recognized as a national historic memorial. in this age of nuclear terror. civil defense is valuable insurance for every family and a strong deterrent force for the nation. to encourage the needed local efforts in our area. i called a district civil defense conference. response to the conference was enthusiastic. i hope the results of the ideas expressed by civil defense experts to some 350 community leaders from the district will soon be evident in projects in the various communities. the federal government has a program of disposing of its surplus properties to certain governmental and civic groups. i introduced a bill which would allow youth services and welfare organizations. the ymca. boys clubs. and the like to take advantage of this program. these are the activities and products of the 1st session of the 87th congress which stand as highlights to me. it has been an active. productive session. i look forward to the second session next year to continue the work begun this year of constructive. responsible legislation which will benefit the nation. our state of indiana. and my district. report of legislative activities of the committee on the district of columbia. 1st session. 87th congress"},{"1":"1960","2":"OLIVER","3":"E","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. on may 26. mr. bernard e. esters. of houlton maine. appearing as chairman of the legislative committee of the national editorial association. made a forceful and convincing statement before the house post office and civil service committee in the interests of the smalltown press of america against proposed postal rate increases in secondclass postal rates. in the interests of informing the membership of the house. and the nation as a whole. of this factual and objective presentation. i am privileged to include mr. esters statement. herein: mr. chairman and members of the committee. my name is bernard e. esters. i am the publisher of a weekly newspaper in houlton. maine. i would like first to express the thanks of the members of the national editorial association for the indulgence of this committee in permitting us time to present the views of the smalltown press of america. for which this association is the only national voice. on the matter now before you. i appear at this hearing as chairman of the legislative committee of this association and as a weekly newspaper publisher. i am privileged this morning to be accompanied by the executive vice president of our association. mr. edgar s. bayol. of washington. and by mr. walter potter. of culpeper. va.. president of the virginia press association and cochairman of the legislative committee of the national editorial association. it will be our purpose to outline in as brief detail as possible the opinions of smalltown newspapers on proposed adjustments in secondclass potal rates. these opinions are reflected in replies to a questionnaire circulated to our complete membership. in letters from publishers and in personal interviews. they represent a factual as well as a documented estimate of the impact on these thousands of small but vital newspaper operations across the country that will be caused by increases in secondclass postal rates as proposed by the post office department. at the outset i would like to make it very clear that the national. editorial association is far from an affluent newspaper trade association even though it is the largest association of its kind in this country. hence. we are proud to inform this comr. mittee that the entire survey from which will be drawn the facts and figures that will follow. was done at a cost that will add less than $1.800 to our deficit at the end of fiscal 1960. we ask that you compare this figure with the $137.000 reportedly paid by the post office department for the mckinsey & co. study which will. we assume. be chargeable to that departments deficit. on which so much stress is being laid in these hearings. contrary to what this committee may have been led to believe by previous testimony from those favoring upward postal rate adjustments. and by material contained in the study of the \"impact of postal rate increases\" prepared by mckinsey & co.. smalltown newspapers across the nation. in every congressional district and in practically every county. are expressing very grave concern that the increase in secondclass postal rates and the accompanying request that the freeincounty privileges be abolished. will cause serious and burdensome hardship. i can also state very frankly that we are not only greatly disturbed. we are deeply shocked. at what appears to be an irresponsible assumption in the mckinsey & co. study which declares that the newspaper publishing industry can \"apparently adjust to postal rate increases with no serious difficulty.\" this. i solemnly assure your gentlemen. sa gross misstatement. a conclusion entirely unwarranted by the facts as we have found them. there is no information anywhere in this published study that will reveal the identity of the weekly newspaper publishers who. when interviewed by mckinsey & co. representatives. \"generally expressed little concern that an increase in the scale proposed would cause them any particular difficulty.\" such modest anonymity is quite unlike weekly newspaper publishers as we know them. he is the exception in the weekly. semiweekly. and smalltown daily field. with whom we are familiar. who will be bashful about identifying himself with an opinion. especially on a matter of this gravity. and when these replies are quoted as stating that \"they have had to adjust to large increases in their chief costs. paper and wages\" and \"hence they felt that minor increases in subscription rates that would be necessary to cover increases in postage would be passed on to the subscriber.\" we cannot help but become more skeptical. as i say. we do not know nor will we be told. apparently. the identity of these publishers casually referred to as \"they.\" i might also add that we could easily doubt their existence in the light of the overwhelming testimony that has flowed in a steady stream into the washington office of the national editorial association from publishers in 49 states saying just exactly the opposite. these responses came to two questionnaires which were sent to 5.057 smalltown newspaper publishers when we first were warned of the intention of the post office department to seek drastic increases in postal rates and when it was also realized that these increases. if granted. would be far more burdensome on smalltown newspaper operations than the advance publicity by the post office department would have everybody believe. for instance. when we had an opportunity to study the actual bill and read the fine print. so to speak. and then applied the schedule of rates to a few newspapers with which we were familiar. we were astounded to find that. instead of the 40percent increase we had been told we might expect. the increase was more likely to be 600 percent. however. we will go into the facts whicjh these questionnaires revealed later on in this testimony. suffice it to say at this point that we. as of may 10. have receive a total of 1.900 replies to these questionnaires. or a remarkably high response of 38 percent. it is our intention to confine our testimony strictly to those provisions of this postal rate increase measure which directly affect our membershipnamely. those dealing with second classand to show to you what great harm such increases would work on our people. if they are enacted. we are supported and encouraged by two fundamental principles that are so well established they call for little or no elaboration. the first. which has been recognized time after time by the congress. is that the postal system of the united states was originally conceived as a public service. instituted and operated for the benefit of all people. the second is that newspapers are quasipublic institutionsindependently owned and operated to be sure. but dedicated to the service of their people and their communities. since before the founding of this country and continuously to this day. all branches of the government as well as the public. have recognized that free and independent newspapers are essential to the growth and to the welfare of this nation. the principle that the post office is a publie service is abundantly supported. by the great volume of testimony given before previous hearings by the committee on post office and civil service. particularly that a4561 which in large measure resulted in the passage by the congress of the postal policy act of 1958. i am sure you are familiar with its welldocumented findings which are. in principle. no less true today. the principle that a newspaper is indispensable to the welfare of the nation and thus susceptible to fosterage by the postal system was well expressed by senator hardwick. of georgia. when he was a member of the senate post office committee. in a statement made before the senate committee on finance on may 28. 1917. he said: \"the principle is that under a free government the diffusion of news and intelligence among the people is indispensable. and in order to promote it the postal system should carry matter of this kind at a very nominal rate. even if a heavy expense to the government is thereby entailed.\" even our postmasters general have. on occasion. supported this principle. in his annual report for the fiscal year 1901. postmaster general charles e. smith stated it as follows: \"our free institutions rest on popular intelligence and it has from the beginning been our fixed and enlightened policy to foster and promote the general diffusion of public information. \"in harmony with this sound and judicious policy.\" postmaster general smith went on to say. \"it (meaning the congress) has deliberately established a low rate of postage for genuine newspapers and periodicals with the express design of encouraging and aiding the distribution of the recognized means and agencies of public information. it is not a matter of favor but of approved judgment.. it is not for the publishers but for the people.\" we would like at this point to comment on an inference in testimony previously presented at this hearing which would suggest that \"advances in communications and transportation. the spread of news and educational media. and the growth of the postal service since the mid19th century have been so extensive as to make obsolete virtually all of the considerations which prompted withincounty rates.\" if we are to assume that advances in communications mean the development of radio and television. plus the expansion of daily newspapers and the growth of national magazine circulation and if we are to assume that advances in transportation mean the development of the airplane. we still are unable to accept any glib conclusion that the importance of the role of newspapers in the dissemination of vital information. has diminished to the point of becoming obsolete. if anything the importance of newspapers has increased. and more particularly is this true of the hometown newspaper. to illustrate this point i have here for your examination just a few typical examples of the many thousands of dollars worth of free space given away by hometown newspapers to inform their readers on matters of vital importance to the government of the united states and its various departments. it would be folly for us to contend that radio and television do not have their place in the social. commercial. and economic life of many american families. but to suggest that these comparatively young media of communication can supplant newspapers and/or other printed media to the extent that these media now fill no useful purpose in the widespread dissemination of valuable news and information is an utterly false assumption that will be indignantly denounced by every newspaper and magazine in this country regardless of size and frequency of issue. it would be pertinent. we believe. to inquire what means the government and its agencies at all levels would use to get their messagss to the people of rural america if the smalltown newspapers were put out of business in great numbers. any increase in the burden of costs could mlake it necessary for them to curtail use of the flood of free government releases each week to devote more space to income producing advertising or more interesting and important local news. a case in point is the exhibit i just offered in evidence. the recent 5columnby10inch mat offered for newspaper use by the census bureau entlled \"have you been counted.\" and designed to assist in the mopup tally of persons whom the regular census enumerators may have missed for one reason or another. such distribution could hardly have been achieved by radio or television. i am not aware of the extent to which large daily newspapers used this free material. i am quite sure that weekly and small daily newspapers of the size that make up the membership of the national editorial association used it extensively. some even informed us they used it twice instead of the onetime insertion that was requested. this amount of space in these newspapers could profitably be sold at a price varying between $30 and $60. depending on the advertising rates of the individual newspapers. if only onehalf of the newspapers in our class in this country used this mat and if we assess an average of $40 as a reasonably representative cost of the space involved. we come up with a figure of more than $11 million of donated space for this one public service alone. this amount of space given away by a newspaper costs each one of them money they will never be able to recover. either from advertisers whose paid message this free space may have displaced or in the loss of the normal costs from rent. heat. light. taxes. labor. depreciation. paper and all of the other costs that go into every column inch of white space in every issue of a newspaper regardless of whether that inch is occupied by material that is paid for or by material from which there is no income. the foregoing example is but one isolated case in a continuing parade of services to government donated by smalltown newspapers and not available on an equivalent basis in any other medium of communication. among the other services to government that will be jeopardized by any act or law which might have the effect of reducing the number of newspapers available to provide such types of service as the one just mentioned would be the frequent airmail releases that come from the post office department. including information by which publishers of newspapers would be better prepared to fight the departments battle for higher postal rates. including those proposed for their own publications. the list of such \"information services\" can be expanded to almost any extent. smalltown newspapers are being constantly importuned by the savings bond division of the treasury department to encourage more widespread buying of war bonds by the public. civil defense is a constant supplicant for free space to get its messages across in the areas served by our small newspapers. the department of agriculture. both state and national. the recruiting services of all branches of our armed forces. the departments of commerce and interior. and so on. ad infinitum. and now. gentlemen. we believe it is important to tell you something of the current economic status of americas hometown press that has very pertinent bearing on the additional costs of doing business which this legislation proposes to impose on them. the national editorial association. as an integral part of its function. maintains the weekly newspaper bureau. a special department devoted to research. it was my privilege to have had a part in founding this bureau more than 15 years ago. this bureau works in close cooperation with newspaper association managers. which is. as its name implies. the national association of press association executives. for the past 9 years the two organizations have conducted an annual weekly newspaper cost study. this is a nationwide study designed to learn. for comparative purposes. the average income and the average expenses in all principal categories for weekly newspapers in six different circulation brackets. it is the only national study of its kind and is highly regarded in the industry. this ninth study covers the year 1959 and gives a remarkably reliable picture of the financial condition and the economic position of the average weekly newspaper. its findings are not for general- publication. but we have obtained permission from the cost study committee to excerpt some of the data and to provide each member of this committee with a complete copy of the 16page analysis for further examination. may i emphasize again that this is the ninth annual study. it was made in the customary manner entirely without regard to any question of higher postal rates. it was not made to prove anything. its purpose this year. as last year. and as it will be next year. is to provide a yardstick by which a weekly publisher can measure his particular operation in his circulation class. thus he may be enabled to correct defects in his own operation. to his profit. in the cost study newspapers were divided into six groups according to circulation. as follows: group 1: under 1.000 circulation. group 2: from 1.000 to 1.500 circulation. group 3: from 1.500 to 2.000 circulation. group 4: from 2.000 to 3.000 circulation. group 5: from 3.000 to 4.000 circulation. group 6: over 4.000 circulation. now let us consider the average total income for newspapers in each group. and we ask that you take especial note of the fact that. in the great majority of cases. this income includes money received from printing and other sources as well as from advertising and circulation. in group 1newspapers under 1.000 circulationthe average total income in 1959 was only $14.417. the average net income. including an allowance of $4.500 for the publishers own salary. was only $5.392. after deducting this very low publishers salary allowance. the average net income was the munificent sum of $892 for 12 months of hard work. in group 2newspapers with 1.000 to 1.500 circulationthe average total income was $33.327. the cost study analysts allowed this publisher $5.000 as a salary allocation and. after that. the average net income. over expense. was $1.499. for group 31.500 to 2.000 circulationwe find an average gross of $47.709. an allowance of $6.000 was made for the salary of the publisherperhaps slightly more than he paid his linotype operator but probably less than he paid his shop foreman. reducing the average net to $2.206. or 4.6 percent of his gross. in group 42.000 to 3.000 circulationwhich. incidentally. probably represents the middle 60 percent of weekly newspapers. the average total income reached a figure of $66.949. in this bracket a publisher salary allocation of $6.500 was made after which the net average income figured out to $2.873. or 4.3 percent. in group 5 things appear to get considerably better. this group comprises papers with 3.000 to 4.000 circulation. here we find an average total income of $120.571. the publisher was allowed $7.000 for his annual salary and his net then turned out to an average of $9.036 or 7.5 percent. in the top group. 6 newspapers having more than 4.000 circulation. we find the elite of the industry. at least in terms of dollars. however. it is estimated that less than 15 percent of the countrys smalltown newspapers are in this category. in this bracket the average total income was $172.190. the publisher was allowed $7.500 and the average net return. after expenses. was $10.580 for the year. or a percentage of 6.1. from this survey it is amply clear that the vast majority of the weekly newspapers of the country are struggling to put out their papers and still earn a modest living. it is also very clear they have a very thin margin between income and costs and any increase in expenses can easily result in a serious dislocation. every item of expense. then. is significant. no expense. however small it may be considered to be. will fail to have a telling. even a possibly disastrous. effect on their security and welfare. and now. mr. chairman. may we return to the industrywide questionnaires to which we referred earlier. the information derived from it is completely documented and substantiated by facts. it is utterly devoid of conjecture or unwarranted assumption. as had been said before. these questionnaires were sent to 5.057 smalltown weekly. semiweekly. and daily newspaper publishers. as of may 10 when this tabulation was made we had received 1.900 replies. or a rate of return of 38 percent which is without precedent in this association and many. many times higher than the normal rate of return. these questionnaires asked. among other things. the amount. in dollars per week. the proposed increase would cost the publisher for mailing his newspaper under second class. in order to insure against error. we requested him to go to his post office and have the appropriate clerk figure what his rates would be. as compared to what he is now paying. if and when the new schedule went into effect. when we determined the information sought in the first questionnaire would not be sufficient to measure the true extent of the dollar impact. we circulated a second questionnaire to the same list. on this one we sought to learn: 1. does the publisher addressed favor or not favor elimination of the freeincounty privilege? 2. how much of an increase will the proposed new rates make in the publishers weekly postage bill for second class mail? 3. how much of the increase will be represented by elimination of freeincounty? the 1.900 replies from both questionnaires were placed in the hands of a professional data processing concern in washington and the results were put on ibm punchcards and the data tabulated. the results are available for the study of any member of this committee. or of the congress. who may be interested. primarily. however. we ask you to remember that these returns are not from a handpicked group of newspapers. they are from newspapers in 49 of the 50 states and in numbers amply large enough to qualify as a sample that is \"unquestionably representative.\" the first questionnaire brought returns from 601 newspaperswith no separation of weeklies from dailes. it showed that the average dollar increase per newspaper would be $30.46 per week or $1.583.92 a year. this amounted to an average increase of 350 percent. the second questionnaire is based on replies from 1.299 newspapers of which 1.203 are weeklies and 96 are dailies. it showed that the average dollar increase per newspaper for secondclass postage would be $39.86 per week or $2.072.72 a year. this amounted to an average increase of 244 percent. somewhat higher you must agree than the \"about 40 percent\" estimated by the post office department. a4562 incidentally. the information also revealed that the average dollar increase for hometown dailies would be $68.45 a week or $3.559.40 a yearup 145 percent. for weekly newspapers the average increase would be $37.57 a week. or $1.953.64 a year. or an increase of 252 percent. the second questionnaire also produced some very interesting information about the freeincounty newspaper mailing privilege. it showed. for example. that 65 percent of the increased costs for newspapers that would result from the new schedule. would be caused by elimination of freeincounty. the remaining 35 percent would result from the proposed new per copy rates. this survey also settled beyond a doubt the opinions of newspapers on the question of whether or not the freeincounty mailing privilege should be continued. for the benefit of the post office department we can report this opinion as emphatically in the affirmative by the overwhelming margin of 8 to 1. of all newspapers queried. 86.6 percent favor retention of freeincounty and only 10.7 percent are willing to lose it. of the weeklies. 87 percent are for retention. 10.2 percent are against it. among dailies the percentage is 81.3 percent favoring retention -and 16.7 percent against. reference has already been made at this hearing to a poll indicated as having been taken by the national editorial association which included a question designed to reflect an opinion on retention or abolition of the freeincounty mailing privilege. the use of the word \"poll\" to describe this activity. in an article in the national publisher magazine for october 1958 was an unfortunate choice of words even though it was qualified by the adjective \"informal.\" a misunderstanding of our intentions could quite easily result. and apparently did. from this terminology. we considered this more in the light of a restricted inquiry which went to a small percentage of members. it was really a limited sampling of opinion on various probable legislative trends to provide guidance in establishing a policy to be followed by the legislative committee. of which i was then chairman. such sampling of opinion among key people is not uncommon prior to the opening of a session of the congress. the results in this particular case turned out to be so inconclusive they were of no use whatsoever. i might explain that this same sampling also include questions designed to bring out information we thought might be of value to our committee. these. likewise. elicited a very unsatisfactory response. so. as far as my personal knowledge is concerned. the national editorial association has not.- at least within the last quarter of a century. been a party to an industrywide poll of any significance on the freeincounty mailing privilege. certainly none to compare in scope and response to the one just concluded. the results of which are made a part of this testimony we regret that a contrary impression may have been created. you have also heard testimony. i am told. to the effect that a state press association passed a resolution directed to the congress requesting that the freeincounty mailing privilege be abolished. the state in question was wisconsin and this action was taken by the associations board of directors in february 1958. it should be emphasized that this resolution was a board action and not an association action. which is quite a different matter. this may account for the revealing replies from publishers in the state of wisconsin in answer to the nea questionnaire. now. and we have the records to show it. 75 percent of that states newspapers are against giving up freeincounty mailing privilege. mr. chairman and members of the committee. i would not wish you to infer. from the lengthy testimony that you have been considerate enough to listen to so far this morning. that the smalltown newspapers for whom i speak. disclaim interest in or willingness to use the material so gratuitously offered by government at all levels. millions and millions of dollars worth of free space is donated every week by our newspaper members of the national editorial association and those who are not members. for every conceivable type. variety. kind. and degree of public service. it is our devout wish that we be allowed to continue to do so. but. we cannot help but wonder. as we contemplate this public service contribution which has been going on for as long as there have been newspapers. just how these messages. this information. this educational material. this patriotic utilization of newspaper space. considered to be so critically important to our various levels of government. can so efficiently and effectively be delivered to their intended audiences if newspapers are forced to go out of business by oppressively high costs. from whatever source they may come. including higher postal rates. in the foregoing. mr. chairman and gentlemen. we have tried to emphasize and explain the precarious and insecure economic condition the hometown press of america finds itself in today and the very damaging effects the exhorbitant postal rate increases will have on its future welfare as a whole. now may we take up some impressions in the mekinsey & co. study which we honestly believe to be erroneous and entirely unwarranted by the facts. let us examine two specific cases. those to be found on pages 221. 222. and 223 of the mckinsey & co. study. here we find an example of what purports to be a typical weekly newspaper of \"about 1.000 circulation.\" the report goes on to give the following breakdown of income and expenses: advertising revenue_ -------------- $15.000 subscription revenue -------------- 2. 940 newstand revenue ----------------- 1.145 total revenue --------------- 19. 085 printing costs ---------------------3.800 parttime help -------------------- 3.000 total ------------------------6.800 postage: first class ----------------------- 95 seconoi class --------------------- 130 total postage -----------------225 owners salary. charged to newspaper ----------------- --------- 9.000 then. the report concluded. \"as these figures show. the cost of postageat either present or proposed levelsis not a major factor in the economics of this business.\" with this naive conclusion i would like to very vigorously dissent. may i. as a weekly newspaper publisher for more than 30 years. tell you that no operation of which i have knowledge keeps its records in such neat and limited categories. almost all smalltown publishers in all circulation brackets operate printing departments in connection with their newspaper. the result is a far more complicated and certainly a more comprehensive balance sheet than the abbreviated form we are asked to accept. this example would almost lead to the accusation that this case is an entirely fictitious one especially since we are asked to believe that \"parttime\" help costs an even $3.000. almost as much as an even $3.800 for printing costs. the examples given you from the 1959 cost study showed a publisher of a newspaper of about 1.000 circulation to have a total average income ofnot $19.935but only $14.417. a slight difference of $5.218. or 26 percent. next. this mythical newspaper divides its subscription revenue and newsstandl revenue into separate figures. this may be done in very rare cases but it certainly is neither common nor necessary. income from selling newspapers. no matter how they -are sold. all goes into one circulation revenue account. with no division for newsstands. newspaperboys or mail. this lumping of such income will be found to have been done by all newspapers reporting in the annual weekly newspaper cost study. also. the mckinsey report newspaper took in $4.085 for circulation. or more than 20 percent of its total revenue. whereas the average weekly newspaper in the annual cost study reveals subscription revenue to account for only 10 percent of its total revenue. this $4.085 income from subscriptions is also an interesting figure especially if we look at the $1.145 of newsstand revenue which goes with it. if this proportion is correct it means that this mythical publisher receives a net return to himself of 11 cents per week per copy for the 200 copies he sells at newsstands or through carrier boys. this indicates the odd retail price of 14 cents per week per copy of an eightpage newspaper if. as the report states. the vendors margin is 3 cents per copy. if there is a weekly newspaper in the united states that sells for this price or that receives this high percentage of gross income from this category of circulation. we believe it is an extremely execptional case. we next direct your attention to that nice. round figure of $3.800 for printing costs of producing 1.000 copies of an eightpage weekly newspaper. 52 weeks a year. this means an average cost per week of an amazingly low $73. even if you know nothing about printing. gentlemen. and i am sure many of you are quite familiar with it. you must certainly wonder what kind and size newspaper can be produced for this kind of money. i am sure every member of the national editorial association. even those who have wellequipped printing plants. would like very much to get this publishers secret or. better still. acquire his services. at the same rate. this same balance sheet. or profit and loss as it should be called. blandly ignores such essential items as depreciation. utilities. taxes and rent. repairs and upkeep of machinery. costs of automobile. reserve for the inevitable bad debts and many other costs that have to be paid every week by every publisher if he expects to remain in business. these costs add up to at least 25.2 percent among the newspapers in the 1.000 circulation class reporting to the annual cost study. all of which makes the mckinsey statement completely unbelievable. especially since. on top of everything else. the operator of such a small business can take for himself $9.000 a year. when it comes to postage costs the mckinsey study says their newspaper will be required to pay an extra $260 a year if the proposed rate schedule is adopted. however. a study of the answers to the nea survey reveals the average weekly newspaper. in all circulation brackets. will be called upon to pay $37.57 more each week or a total of $1.953.64 a year. we cannot see how the mckinsey paper can escape a similar increase. but. if he has a secret of such value. we hope he will share it with the rest of his fellow publishers who certainly can use it. i will not bore you further with an itemized analysis of the second typical weekly newspaper example given on page 222 of the mckinsey report. it is subject to the same oversimplification and miscalculation that is true of the one just analyzed. a4563 the most significant fact of this example is that it selects a mythical weekly newspaper of 2.200 circulatiqn. according to national editorial association calculations for dues purposes. this is the exact size of the average weekly newspaper in this country. on the basis of our proven returns. which we can substantiate by actual figures. the average paper of this size will be called upon to pay $1.953.64 a year and not the $400 assumed by mckinsey and company. we have no wish to be unfair or unjust in our analysis of these examples. apparently taken from the air. as compared to those for which we have documentation. however. we cannot escape the conclusion that. for $137.000 of the taxpayers money the postmaster general should have received more accurate figures. lest there be any thought that i. as the person selected to present the foregoing testimony. am an alarmist or have overstated the case. i would like. with your permission. to make some verbatim quotes from voluntary letters received in the national editorial association office on this very grave matter. some of these statements may be from publishers in your own state. district. county. or town. but they are typical and selected at random from the many hundreds we received. newspaper in upper marlboro. md.. the enquirergazette: \"needless to say. adoption of these increases. especially the removal of freeincounty privilege. would be disastrous to all and many small weeklies will be put out of business.\" newspaper in cortland. nebr.. the news: \"i am glad you are taking this matter up. because if this goes through hundreds of small town newspapers are going to quit business. being forced out by the government.\" newspaper in corydon. ind.. the corydon democrat: \"in spite of the claims that there is something wrong about delivery of mail to rural subscribers free. there are still valid claims for it. as intended by the legislators who originally enacted the law. carrying news of county business. community affairs. political announcements and other local educational service is a logical and important governmental function. \"in this county. as in many others. the number of postal employees and carriers would not be changed in any way if there were no local newspapers to handle.\" newspaper in ithaca. mich.. gratiot county herald: \"most weeklies feel that they have gone about as far as they can in advancing subscription and advertising rates to cover increasing costs including increasing postage rates. and small weekly papers are the ones which will be hardest hit by the proposals. unless it is the deliberate purpose of the post office department and the proponents of this bill to place small papers of the nation in jeopardy. we believe any plans for further advances in secondclass rates should be abandoned.\" newspaper in terra bella. calif.. the terra bella news: \"this would increase my costs to a point where i would seriously consider going out of business.\" newspaper in west branch. iowa. the west branch times: \"the proposed increase could easily put this newspaper out of business.\" newspaper in welsh. la.. the welsh citizen: \"this would crucify many of we smaller papers whose profit margin would virtually vanish. since our advertising and subscription rates are based on old mail rates this would be a foul blow.\" newspaper in wahoo. nebr.. the ludi printing co.: \"present mailing costs are $880 annually. under the proposed increase my costs would amount to more than $1.700 annually.\" newspaper in kansas: \"our newspaper is almost driven out of business now by high cost of labor and stock.\" newspaper in minnesota: \"if we understand correctly. will have to pay 2 cents each on all local copies delivered by letter carriers in the suburbs. most of ours run over 2 ounces 5.000 copies 2 cents equal $100 per week. now costs about $8 per week including some 165 copies at zone rate. adding $92 to our costs would boost subscription price at least $1.50 per year.\" in closing. mr. chairman. we would like to emphasize again that the services which the weekly newspaper industry. through its individual newspapers. renders to its communities and its governments. local. state and national will i am sure continue just so long as there are newspapers in existence. there is no threat of reprisal. real or implied. in these comments. the stark and simple facts are. however. that declining income and the evernarrowing margin between profit and loss that confronts all small town newspaper operations must force them to adopt new and more drastic economy measures to keep their businesses solvent and protect their own livelihood as well as the livelihood of those to whom they furnish gainful weekly employment. we must protest as naive and entirely unrealistic. the assertion that. because we have been able thus far to absorb or pass on larger increases in costs of doing business. we can just as easily continue to do so by accepting with good grace this drastic increase in postal rate costs that is far higher than its proponents would have the country believe. there is a limit to which our businesses. or any other business. can go in absorbing higher costs. and still remain in business. many of our papers have long since reached the point of no return. so to speak. in high subscription rates and high advertising rates. additional charges just cannot be made for the pure and simple reason that neither readers nor advertisers will pay them. and so. mr. chairman. and members of the committee. while we recognize and deeply appreciate the problems of finance with which the postmaster general is confronted and while we respect his earnestness in trying to resolve them. we. as smalltown newspaper publishers. have no wish nor do we have the financial resources to help to the disproportionate extent that this rate. schedule would insist that we do. we are flattered at the many insinuations that our small business enterprises are as profitable as has been inferred in the verbal evidence and in the mckinsey study placed before you. but we must insist. gentlemen. that adoption of this schedule will work a very serious hardship on us and on the people of the united states. at no time in the history of this great country of ours has there been a greater need for a free and unfettered press. we ask. gentlemen. that it be permitted to continue to serve the people and the countryand that this very damaging legislation be not approved by this committee. students. youre

have given studious consideration to the requests of ocdm. and. after careful search into the need for expenditures. have recommended the appropriation of sums which have been asked for. this agency has a new and vigorous leader. gov. leo a. hoegh. formerly governor of iowa. who has recently. through the president. promulgated an effective national plan for civil defense and defense mobilization so necessary for our survival in this nuclear and jet age. i have tried to outline in a little detailbut i hope not too much detailsomething which i think is fundamental in our national life with respect to civil defense. i used the analogy of the u.s. information agency. i do not know why it is that. in our current move. which should be one of awareness and sophistication. appropriations of $41 billion for military hardware. armed service pay. and research and development. are voted with very little question. there may be 2 or 3 or 4 days of debate in the senate on such an authorization or appropriation. as the case may be. or both. and the money is voted and spent. in round figures. such appropriations represent more than 50 percent of our budget. yet when it comes to the united states information agency. which is fighting the propaganda war. or the civil defense agency. which is designed to put us in some domestic posture of at least a modicum of confidence by reason of having an organized body of men and women who can give us a slight amount of help if the dreadful holocaust should strike. or when it comes to an appropiration of $700 million or $800 million for economic aid to the peoples of the free world whose hearts and minds it is absolutely essential for us to win for the cause of freedom if the free world is to survivewith respect to expenditures for such purposes. we are always crushed by the burden of taxation imposed on the people of the united states. we should all grow up. i am not speaking only to the distinguished senator who made the speech referred to. i believe the program is a good thing. let us test it out. let us find out what it is all about. let us scrutinize the program. i am convinced that if we dig into the civil defense problem thoroughly. the appropriation will not be less. but greater. there is a grave deficiency in our law. which concerns 4 million devoted people who. if they are injured or killed in line of duty. receive very little consideration from the u.s. government. notwithstanding the fact that they are serving a very essential function of the u.s. government. so the program may cost us more rather than less if we look into it carefully. i have devoted myself to this subject this afternoon in the spirit of discussing both sides of the question. and in the expectation that the country can do nothing but profit from the debate and investigation with respect to the subject which my friend and colleague took the initiative in bringing up. i think we must understand better that we are not only engaged in a total struggle for freedom. but also in a total defense with respect to freedom. whether it be civil defense. the u.s. information agency. economic aid. or any one of a dozen other programs. they are absolutely essential. in many respects appropriations for those purposes are just as essential as appropriations for troops and armament."},{"1":"1958","2":"FULBRIGHT","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. the west has been hypnotized by the assumption that the petroleum of the middle east is indispensable to its survival. observing this. it is not surprising that mr. khrushchev has told the world that \"middle east oil is the wests most vulnerable spot.\" if the oil of the arab states is the wests most vulnerable spot. then we may be sure that mr. khrushchev will do everything possible to exploit a dangerous and explosive situation. in this case. one upon which the wests survival would seem to depend. but if the oil of the arab states is indispensable to the westespcially to western europe. that is almost totally dependent for imported oil as its primary energy sourcethen it follows that the economic life of western europe is at the mercy of whoever controls the physical sources of oil in the arab states. as the oil freely flows in trade. western europe flourishes. as it is cut off. it withers and is doomed to death. hence. if all this be true. the imperatives of survival would compel western europe. at whatever risk to the peace of the world. to seize the arab oilflelds and operate them. before examining this question. let us take a historical case of economic determinism gone mad. in the late 1950s. powerful southern political leaders. contemplating the prospect of war with the north. made this calculation. englands largest single industrial interest. they said. was cotton manufacturing. no less than 4 million of her 21 million people depended for their livelihood upon it. this huge trade seemed at the mercy of the american south that supplied threefourths of englands cotton. britain had long sought an alternative cotton supply in india. but without success. from 1800 to 1860. her cotton demands rose by 1.000 percent. but indias cotton supply rose by only 10 percent. hence. southern leaders assumed that britains greatest industry. the support of millions of her people. the mainstay of her export trade. and the source of large profits for her businessmen. was at their mercy. the situation deeply disturbed the british and leaders of british opinion complained that the subsistence of millions in every manufacturing country of europe lay within the power of an oligarchy of planters. france was in a somewhat similar plight. her cotton manufacturing industry was second to that of great britain. and most of its supply came from the south. even hardheaded southern businessmen believed that because the south controlled most of the worlds cotton. withholding the supply would compel britain and france to side with the region in its war with the north. in charleston. as war began. a merchant pointed to cotton bales on the wharf and said to w. h. russell. war correspondent of the london times. \"look out there. theres the key that will open all our ports. and put us into john bulls strong box as well.\" king cotton diplomacy was a failure. the british textile industry and textile workers. as well as the french. suffered grievously during our civil war for lack of materials. but alternative sources of supply were found. and as the war went on. more and more cotton from new sources found its way into european markets. yet it is one of the \"ifs\" of history that our civil war might not have happened had not so many southern leaders become hypnotized by their belief that britain and france could not live without their cotton and so would be compelled to throw their weight to them in their war with the north. let me state just one more case of what happens when men believe that they can. through fancied sole possession of an essential raw material. bring about almost any end that they may desire. in the case that i shall now cite. the end sought was unconscionably high prices for the raw material. in the early 1920s. mr. herbert hoover then being our secretary of commerce. the british through limitation of rubber growing in malaya. diminished the available supply. the price rose from a few cents a pound to more than $2 a pound. the united states was then incomparably the worlds largest user of raw rubber. and mr. hoover on behalf of our government made vigorous--even bitterprotests to the british on this score. eventually. the market collapsed because as the price of rubber rose higher and higher. independent malayan. chinese. and dutch rubber planters who were not bound by british agreements. produced more and more rubber. the price eventually collapsed to a few cents a pound. with enormous harm to british investors and with the result that they were faced with more competition in rubber growing than they had ever been before. in the friendliest way then. i would suggest to our friends in the oilproducing arab states that they should not be deluded into a suicidal form of economic determinism based upon the assumption that their oil controls the fate of western europe. it is true that the west would like to buy the oil of the arab countries. and to this end it has invested billions in exploring for oil. in digging wells. dredging harbors. laying pipelines. building tankers. and organizing the markets so that oil might flow freely from their countries to men everywhere who might want to buy it. it is true that the oil of the arab countries is important to the prosperity of the west. but this is far from saying that without arab oil. the west would perish. it is equally far from saying that if the oil were withheld for any reason. the west ought to undertake the dangerous course of digging petroleum with rifles and putting it through bayonet pipelines. the west has alternatives. there nearly always are alternatives in human affairs. i repeat that the west would like always to be in good commercial. cultural. and diplomatic relations with the arab countries. the more they prosper. the more they raise the standard of living of their people. the more they build schools and hospitals and factories. and the more they use their oil income to make more fruitful the lives of their people. the west will be gladdened as another great sector of humanity raises itself higher upon the scald of material things. but it would be an evil. day for the arab countries if they should be misled by economic determinism into the delusion that the material life of the west absolutely depends. or must depend. upon their oil. the west is the only customer that the arab countries have for their oil. this year the west will pay iraq about $200 million for oil. it will pay kuwait $340 million. and it will pay saudi arabia $300 million. this is close to $1 billion. and the sum will increase every year. soviet russia cannot. and will not. take the oil because she does not need it and could not dispose of it elsewhere in the world. the only role that the soviet union could play here would be one utterly destructive to the freedom and welfare of the arab states. that is. to bring the arab states to commit suicide by denying their oil to the west or by submitting the supply to the constant and unbearable play of caprice. hence if the arabs want to eat their bread in freedom. if they want to get sound money to improve the condition of their wretchedly poor people. they need the west as a customer. just as the west needs them as a source of supply. if the west were deprived of all arab oil. it could turn to other sources. these would be very expensive and would cause extreme economic dislocation and even physical hardship. but these other sources do exist and they could be used. the west could get an additional 1 million barrels a day from iran. and here i would like to point out that in addition to the already vast proved oil reserves of iran. that country now has a new prodigious field of astronomical proportions at qum. western europe could get an additional shutin capacity of 2 million barrels a day in the united states. it could get 600.000 more barrels daily from venezuela and 200.000 from canada. we could step up production in sumatra and elsewhere. certainly we could get the 3.800.000 barrels daily to compensate for the loss of all arab oil. nor is this all. we have an almost inexhaustible coal supply in the united states. and we could increase our coal consumption here as well as shipping additional coal to the west. if. moreover. the suez should again be closed. tankers totaling at least 6 million deadweight tons are now laid up and could be quickly returned to service. and the west would have the knowledge that it gained through international collaboration in 195657. i would also like to point this out. we have another great source of energy in this country that we have barely touched. it is lignite. sometimes referred to as brown coal. the united nations economic commission for europe has recently said this: brown coal (lignite). for generations relegated to the role of an economic orphan in comparison with hard coal. has emerged as a cinderella among fuels in southeastern and eastern europe. the soviet- union is rich in oil. gas. and coal. butsays the united nations report-. it is actively mining lignite. the state of north dakota contains an estimated 350 billion tons- of lignite. of which about 10 billion tons may be mined with the greatest economy. in addition to inexhaustible supplies of coal and lignite. our gas reserves are estimated as sufficient for the next 20 or 25 years. and all these can be used more extensively to supplement our oil supplies. beyond this. there is a source of oil that could make the united statesand the westforever independent of foreign oil sources. this is oil shale. the oil content of a relatively small area of oil shale rock located in northwest colorado has recently been estimated by the united states geological survey to be about 1 /2 trillion barrels. this reserve of hydrocarbon energy is about 6 times as great as the known reserves of the world and is sufficient to supply the united states needs at the current rate of consumption for about 450 years. as men once lived in an age of faith. so we live in the age of energy. present and future energy demands reach almost incalculable proportions. nowadays the economic strength of a people depends largely upon its ability to discover and exploit energy sources or to be able to .trade its goods or money for imported sources of energy. we are just now coming into the widespread use of atomic energy. the west is proceeding in an orderly way to erect atomic energy installations for commercial purposes. but this program could be immensely accelerated. and no one can doubt that the program would be given enormous impetus if it should appear to western countries relying upon arab oil as a primary source of energy that these sources could be cut off for political reasons originating in. or imposed by an outsider upon. the arab countries. i think i may say for all americans. and for the people of the western world generally. that they view with the greatest sympathy the efforts now being made in the arab oil countries to rid themselves of poverty. fear. and disease. i think i may say too for americans and all western peoples that it is to their mutual benefit to extend year by year the boundaries of their commercial. cultural. and diplomatic relations. . certainly it would be to the benefit of all men if there should come about a renaissance in the arab states. if the peoples should again become a light of the cultural world as they were more than a thousand years ago. at a time indeed when most of europe lay in darkness and the western hemisphere was marked \"unknown land\" on the few scanty maps of the world that then existed. few things could better serve these peoples than continued selfrespecting trade between the arab states and the west. the one selling to the west the oil that it needs. and the other buying the goods and services that it needs. trade is the only true international exchange that men possess or ever have possessed. in its essence rational and fructifying. it blesses both the buyer and the seller. it adds to the welfare of both without subtracting anything from either. trade is not only a means whereby men endow one another with goods that neither possesses. but it is also perhaps the most meaningful and subtle means of communication that men possess. its essence. i repeat. is that it must be selfrespecting. that it must be good for both parties. that it must be based in equity and founded in good faith. on these assumptions. i believe that with continued good commercial relations between the arab states and the west. the west might prosper and the arab states might take their proper place in the world as wellfed. wellhoused. wellclothed people living without want. without fear. and without the curse of widespread disease."},{"1":"1957","2":"Unknown","3":"E","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"could have no corrupt affiliates nor could unethical practices exist within aflcio unions. for example. if all unions placed themselves into full compliance with the aflcio constitution and the four aflcio codes of ethical practices. aflcio ethical practices code. no. 3. declares that \"there is no room within the federation or any of its affiliated unions for any person in a position of leadership or responsibility who is a crook. racketeer. a communist. or a fascist.\" this declaration is then made considerably more than a pious wish in the following words: -\"it is the obligation of every union affiliated with the aficio to take appropriate steps to ensure that this principle is complied with. * * * it is the duty and responsibility of each national and international union affiliated with the federation to see to it that it is free of all corrupt. communist or fascist influences. consequently. a trade union need not wait upon a criminal conviction to bar from office corrupt. communist or fascist influences. the responsibility of each union to see to it that it is free of such influences is not a responsibility placed upon our unions by law. it is a responsibility which rests upon our unions by the aflcio constitution and by the moral principles that govern the tradeunion movement. eternal vigilance in this area is the price of an honest democratic tradeunion movement.\" but this aflcio ethical practices codeadopted slightly more than a month agodoesnt stop there. it carefully and specifically spells out a set of rules to govern aflcio affiliates. these rules state. in part: \"1. * * * no persons who constitute corrupt influences or practices or who represent or support communist. fascist or totalitarian agencies should hold office of any kind in trade unions. * * * \"2. no person should hold or retain office or appointed position in the aflcio or any of its affiliated national or international unions or subordinate bodies thereof who has been convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude offensive to trade union morality. \"3. no person should hold or retain office or appointed position in the aflcio or any of its affiliated national or international unions or subordinate bodies thereof who is commonly known to be a crook or racketeer preying on the labor movement and its good name for corrupt purposes. whether or not previously convicted for such nefarious activities.\" right there in the aflcios ethical practices code. no. 3backed by the constitutionis obviously the power and authority to purge the aflcio of corrupt affiliates and the means. also. for aflcio affiliates to cleanse themselves of corrupt elements. i have no indication that this authority will not be used to its fullest extent where justified. it had better be. because the future of the labor movement may well hinge on our swift and uncompromising eradiction of corruption and unethical practices wherever they are found to exist in labor unionism. as far as we know today. racketeering and corruption involve only a very small number of unions and a tiny percentage of union members. this is true even though one might gain the impression these days that theres one large union thats somehow been overlooked until now: the international union of procurers. threehorse parlay plungers. pinball professionais. political parasites. and bawdyhouse promoters. the problem of corruption may be. in itself. a relatively small one but the effects. the consequences of that problem are very far from small. the entire labor movemenj. in fact. is already being hurt by the disclosures of corruption. magnified and exaggerated though they may be. the new york times. it must be acknowledged. summed up the situation accurately in a headline which reads: \"senate inquiry is likely to hurt labor movement: all unions may suffer from the corrupt practices of some of the leaders.\" the labor movement is being hurt. actually. not on one front but on three. we are being huyt in terms of public prestige and reputation. we are being hurt in terms of legislation both in congress and in the statps. and we are being hurt by the ammunition which is being given to unionhating employers in their fight against organizing drives. the extent to which the labor movements prestige and reputation is being injured can only be guessed at. tragically. it comes just at a time when the labor movement had succeeded in winning a greater degree of public favor than at any time in the last quartercentury. a gallup poll disclosed just last month that 76 percent of the people now approve of labor unions as compared with 72 percent in 1936. we worked hard. awfully hard to achieve that improved reputation and we had reason to believe that the trend would continue. on the legislative front there is reason for genuine concern. first. there is no way of knowing what kind of legislative proposals may come out of the current hearings ok the select senate committee on improper activities in the labor or management field. the proposals could be for heavily restrictive legislation. this year or next could produce another upsurge of demands that industrywide and companywide bargaining be prohibited. that the union shop and the checkoff be outlawed or drastically curtailed. the national association of manufacturers. however. isnt going to wait for any moves in congress. last week. the nam announced the opening of a campaign for a sevenpoint program admittedly designed to weaken the bargaining power of labor. the nams program would. among other things. outlaw the union shop. prohibit picketing for organizational purposes. bar national and international unions from participating in contract negotiations. and stifle. political activity by unions. what the nam is really after was clearly implied by its president. e. g. swigert. when he told newspapermen that none of the wage a2197 raises in steel or auto since 1949 should have been granted. it goes almost without saying that the labor racketeering and corruption scandals have made absurd any idea of repealing or even modifying the tafthartley act in the present congress. the racketeering charges have made the picture in state legislatures equally dark. in new york state republican members of the legislature are pushing hard for a $150.000 investigation into the alleged domination of labor unions by hoodlums. racketeers. and gangsters. similar demands are cropping up in other state legislatures. all aimed at the enactment of restrictive legislation designed either to supplement or supersede federal antilabor laws. the floodgates have now been opened for a new deluge of state righttowork laws. encouraged in part by the fact that indigna last week became the first major industrial state to outlaw the union shop. indiana thus joined 17 other states13 in the south and 4 in the northwhich have enacted righttoscab statutes. employers have already started brainwashing unorganized employees with propaganda drawn from the senate committee hearings. but i dont think weve seen even a beginning of this management campaign yet. before long it will probably start coming in huge waves. particularly at unorganized plants in the south. as more and more ammunition is made available in the hearings. in our industry and in other industries employees in newly opened plants are being bombarded with propaganda that their dues payments will serve only to keep union leaders in sumptuous luxury and in such extravagances as racing stables. vacation trips abroad. and gambling expenses. the heat has been taken off big business and industry as organized labor has been placed on the defensive. a billiondollar electrical manufacturing corporation is involved in the employment of call girls to push appliance sales but that immoral spectacle is quickly overshadowed in the daily press by the involvement of a few union officials with bawdy houses. the immorality of 9.000 employer violations of the child labor law last year is swiftly forgotten as headlines report connections between unions and pinball machine rackets. the immoral spectacle of major manufacturers instigating and exploiting race hatred in the south as a means of blocking union organizing efforts is obscured by the supposedly more dramatic crime of union welfare funds mishandled. unethical profiteering persists in industry after industry. in your industry. for example. the price of newsprint has been hiked from $68 a ton in 1946 to $135 a ton 3 days ago. but thats made to appear trivial in comparison with the unethical behavior of a union leader who pads his expenses. . and so it goes. the publicity picture of big business and industry comes out one of relative purity and whiteness against a blackly evil picture of trade union abuses. we can find neither excuse nor consolation in the fact that present day racketeering and corruption in the labor movement started here in chicago in the early 1930s not with unions but with employers. when al capone. \"bugs\" moran. and other gangsters first moved into the labor union field after the repeal of prohibition it was at the invitation of employers in the cleaning and dyeing industry. the employers wanted strongarm men and gunsels to provide protection against what they termed \"unfair competition\" but what was actually the reluctance of a few companies to adhere to pricefixing conspiracies. once they obtained a foothold in that industry the racketeers moved quickly into other industries. organizing phony unions for the benefit of employers and collecting from both sidesdues from captive members and shakedown payments from the employer who soon found himself as much of a.. trapped victim as his employees. the labor movement cannot afford to let its moral and ethical standards fall to the level of big business and industry standards. we cannot let the false impression prevail that trade unionism is as susceptible to racketeering and corruption as big business. the ground we have lost we must regain. we must reestablish our hardwon reputation as a movement of dedication. high principles. idealism and brotherhood. to do this we must not tolerate for 1 minute longer than is necessary those elements that have brought disgrace and shame on the labor movement. either we drive the betrayers of unionism out of our movement quickly and forever or else we risk irreparable loss of integrity and even the possibility of ultimate defeat. this is a time for anger. this is a time more than ever before for indignation and outrage in the labor movement. this is a time for wrathful action against those who would despoil an ideal that thousands of men and women have devoted their lives to building. an ideal for which others have even sacrificed their lives. we will keep our faith with them. with both the dead and the ling. and not only with the men and women of the labor movement today but those who will inherit the labor movement from usour children and the generations to come. we will let nothingabsolutely nothingprevent us from leaving the american labor movement a finer and cleaner and more effective instrument for the brotherhood of man under god than we found it. the death of president ramon magsaysay speech

washington chapter of the american marketing association last october: first let me congratulate the washington chapter of the american marketing association for its enterprise in focusing public

cowinners of the associations top awardmr. henry wulff. of the department of commerce. and mr. d. m. shuffett. of the department of agriculture. for their outstanding contribu. tions to business and industry. and special acknowledgement is due also to the heads of these departmentswho are represented tonight by mr. carl oechsle. acting secretary of commerce and mr. 0. v. wells. administrator. agricultural marketing service of the department of agriculture. it is testimony to each of your abilities to bring inspirational leadership. to organize special talents. to produce the knowledge needed so vitally in todays changing world. i understand that one of the factors your awards committee feels important in evaluating government marketing contributions is the degree of cooperation with industry and others who have a direct interest in the marketing problem under study. this. i think. is excellent. professional marketing people like yourselves in government can provide technical knowhow and academic background while industry can provide a marketing laboratory with real marketing problems and the facilities for their solution. which cannot be obtained in any other way. the. combination certainly permits the most effective and valuable marketing research. in tonights recognitions i see a particular significance. in my mind. i see a word that goes to the very core of what this gathering is all about. the word is \"teamwork\"-enthusisatic cooperation between government and business to produce valuable information which can be translated into consumer benefits. the miracle of american knowhow and enterprise has been told many times over. but i wonder if the story of painstaking research and fact finding that is behind this wondrous acumen has been given the credit it deserves. without the good work of government departments and agencies which provide a steady flow of statistical information. would it have been possible for industry to reach its present heights? i can tell you from experience in my own company that government information stands side by side in importance with research and statistics developed within our organization. together they place at the hands of the cocacola management and divisional heads a fund of knowledge that has enabled us to create markets and increase sales throughout the world. there is always great concern about increased corporate taxes. the number of restrictive measures placed on business by government and the instances where government actually competes with private enterprise. but no one can say that the service agencies of this nation have not contributed gloriously to business and industry and brought aid and comfort to risk capital. we can applaud as well as deplore governm6nt actions and services. tonights gathering is an example of our appreciation of those in federal departments whose efforts provide fuel rather than obstacle to the free functioning of world trade. i feel especially honored to be invited to address this illustrious gathering and welcome the opportunity to be wlth men and women to whom this nation owes so muchexperts whose specializations contribute heavily to the dynamics which have made this country the greatest on earth. your skills have helped produce and speed the greatest flow of products and services in a1458 the history of mankind. because of

go forward to the transportation wonders of today. marvel at the promise peaceful atomic application holds for tomorrow. and you have the measure of human advancement. contemplate the wonders of huge cargo planes. highpowered trucks. modern railroads. gigantio freighters. and you have only a limited canvas of the workings of god and the embodiment of his power in the knowledge of man. we are today on the threshold of boundless accomplishment. if mankind could banish the selfish obstacles it has itself imposed. if selfseeking voices were silenced. if political and military curtains were lifted. if peaceful measures and scientific knowledge were given full sway. there could be no limit to achievement. you. my friends.- are important architects of this kind of better worldwhere dictator4spip would give way to the dictates of brotherhood and recognition of human dignity. perhaps such divinity is too much to hope for. and. if human frailty and lust for power can never permit it. then praise the almighty your kind of talents are at hand to fuel the forces that have made this nation invincible. new manufacturing skills. modern merchandising and distribution. productive media are enabling us to deliver more products to every corner of the earth. accel. erating this widespread trade is greater earning power among more people. as universal demand increases. so does the challenge to experts like yourselves. your resourcefulness in applying the science of marketing can give this increasing prosperity 7league boots. today. a powerful new medium is adding millions of new sales of every possible variety. i speak of television. radios $64 question has given way to tvs $64.000 question. fifteenminute broadcasting segments have been enlarged to hourandahalf spectaculars in color. television reproduces images that move and breathe. with nearly 36 million american families owning television sets today. with foreign nations increasing their output. it can be appreciated how much the demiand for products of all kinds will spread and how the problems of production and distribution will rise in direct ratio. and as we head into the future. the challenge to those engaged in marketing- and allied effort will increase. perhaps only 5 years from now. maybe sooner. the world may be spending billions of dollars on products that today have only the merest foothold in world markets. development of new forms of distribution. new techniques of warehousing. stocking. and display. new adiertising and sales approaches. new delivery methodsa whole new marketing outlook may be required. in the past. the cocacola co. has never been complacent with progress or smug in appraisal of its competition. certainly. its talents and facilities will be applied even more ambitiously in an everchanging future. because of todays competitive pressureseven with something so simple as a soft drinkwe are pursuing every approach to sales here and abroad. in a recent talk before the georgia state chamber of commerce. h. b. nicholson. board\" chairman of the cocacola co.. made some very significant statements about future prospects for our business. and in effect. they reflect a confidence expressed by many organizations whose products are deeprooted in american life. mr nicholson said. \"we look forward to the time when 50 million drinks a day.\" the present rate of coke consumption. \"will seem like a drop in the bucket. it was only 9 million a day in the depression years when we were told that. as a business. we had leveled off. \"like any business. we resented such predictions. especially since the product we sell answers such a basic human requirement as the need for refreshment. like most selling organizations. we have looked for greater growth in more distribution and better merchandising. \"this georgiaborn product has spanned this continent from one end to the other. it has crossed the oceans and conquered the barriers of foreign languages and customs to bring the pleasant pause that refreshes to some 89 different countries and geographical regions.\" continuous study of marketing conditions and testing new methods is as much a characteristic of the cocacola co. as hard work and manufacture of a prime and wholesome product. year after year. since the very beginning of business. searches have been made to find even better ways to make it convenient for people to enjoy cocacola. i am sure youve all seen the everimproving selfservice coin coolers- in stores. business establishments. and on roadsides across america. we have gone on to such innovations as coke in newsize bottles. larger fountain glasses. new takehome cartons. plastic and metal picnic coolers. and. recently. another stimulating merchandising developmentpremix. a method of distribution which enables the bottler to handle almost any selling situation imaginable. cocacola sirup and carbonated water are premixed at the bottling plant. delivered to the outletlin sealed tanks and dispensed at just the right temperature in a paper cup. as a business. cocacola is fortunate to be based on so common a denominator. everybody gets thirsty. every throat has a palate. every palate can judge the pleasure of good flavor. everybody has a dime or a nickel. and so everybody is a customer of cocacola. the universal appeal of good taste to a thirsty palateplus almost 70 years of foresighted marketing effortis back of the story of how cocacola is deployed across the vast expanse that is america. over the seas to foreign lands on every continent. retailers of cocacola are in every state of the union. over 140.000 soda fountains dispense it. over 1.500.000 retail outlets sell it. few products have had such dynamic effeet on the whole economy of a nation. nor greater recognition as a joy in the daily habits of people. perhaps a short anecdote will convey the impress cocacola has made. when life magazine sent a reporter to emporia. kans.. to interview william all~n white on the occasion of his 70th birthday. the famed editor of the gazette proposed that his photograph be taken beside the cocacola dispenser at the local soda fountain. \"it was a picture of my own choosing.\" he explained. \"cocacola is such a sublimated essence of all that america stands for. a decent thing honestly made. universally istributed. conscientiously improved through the years. that i thought it would be fitting and typical to have the word in the picture that portrayed the average american towntoo big for a hamlet. too small for a city. the breeding ground of the middle class.\" nowadays mr. white could enjoy \"the pause that refreshes\" from the rim of the arctic to the cape of good hope. it is an accepted custom. popular in north and south america. europe. africa. asia and the far. islands of the pacific. the cocacola co. and its subsidiaries have the distinction of dealing in more countries at one time and on a larger scale than any other single trademarked product in world history. yet everywhere you find coke. you find it is a local enterprise. with very few exceptions. the bottling plants are locally owned and locally operatedand then there is local management. the whole business structure is often compared to a pyramid. because the cocacola co. and its suppliers take a small share from the top. the bottlers and their suppliers take a larger middle share. and the dealers responsible for retailing our product take the largest share at the broad base of the business. undoubtedly. this working democracy. this business commonwealth wherever cocacola goes on sale. has contributed immeasurably to the acceptance of our product everywhere. economists struggle with the shifting boundaries of \"class markets\" and \"mass markets.\" but for coke there has always been just one marketpeople everywhere. for years. we have pointed out the fact in our ads: \"whoever you are. whatever you do. wherever you may be. when you think of refreshment. think of cocacolafor cocacola is everywhere.\" we have reiterated that theme in magazines. newspapers. highway signs. and pointofpurchase lithography. radio. and more recently television. as the means of communication for reaching more and more people have developed. we have made the appropriations necessary for telling more and more people about our product. people like coke. and we like getting it to themwithin arms reach. and wherever people are. my responsibilities. in the main. are concentrated in the wherever phasethe export end. as somewhat of a globetrotter in this function. i have been placed in. proximity to all manner of people. and in these countfies of varying degrees of civilization and culture. i have come face to face with the great glory of this nations ingenuity and its farreaching contribution to global progress. i believe one of the things that has given me the most gratification about my own product and what american enterprise can do has been in the provincial towns of the philippines. here one gets on a plane in the modern. uptodate city of manila and rides 400 or 50 miles to cebu or bacolod. or any 1 of 5 or 6 other provincial towns of some 200.000 filipinos. way back in these islands. the provincial cities consist mostly of nipa huts which are homes on stilts. constructed of bamboo and grass. living space in each hut is at a premium. the natives are shabbily dressed. the children mostly wear no clothes at all. the settlements usually have streets of miud and onestory shacks. but you turn a corner in all this poverty and suddenly you catch sight of a beautiful cocacola bottling plant. these plants to me are amazing. well built and freshly painted in sparkling white. they are equipped with the latest and most modern bottle fillers. bottle cleaners and water treating equipment and all the things that go to make up a modern cocacola manufacturing plant. at every plant there is a doctors office with a doctor and a nurse to meet any emergency. shower baths in our plants are mandatory for the employees. in the beginning it was hard to get workers because showers were required. but today. the natives come and inquire at this plant for work. giving as a reason the fact that they can take a shower. certainly these plants have raised the standard of living in each of these islands where they are located. a1459 here. i wish to ask you please forgive the frequent reference to the trademark i represent. i do this because. naturally. it is what i know most about. i am sure many other products have a similar influence on similar communities. but i do not know as much about them as i do my own product. getting back to my travelsin india. to the average mind. there are three major products which represent americamore than all the political talk of nehru or bulganin or even our own mr. dulles. to them america is represented primarily by american automobilesbuick. ford. chrysler. and general motors. by american oil companiespredominantly. i think. caltex. and by cocacola. which is on sale in some 10.000 or more outlets in bombay. delhi. and calcutta. about the time that the mau mau trouble was beginning in kenya. but while it was still comparatively safe to travel. i was in that part of the world. one of the boys i was traveling with took a trip from nairobi. 100 miles inland. to the treetop hut over the famous waterhole where nightly hundreds of wild animals come for water. this hut is well known because. the night that her father died. queen elizabeth and the duke of edinburgh were in that hut and it took many hours to locate them. to reach the treetop hut from nairobi my companion traveled over a corduroy dirt road in a cocacola panel truck for some 80 miles without seeing any kind of real civilization. there were no towns and no civilized settlements other than some native huts scattered along the road. suddenly he came upon a small trading post that looked like a secondrate general merchandise store at some crossroads in deep alabama. he was amazed to find there. some 80 miles from anywhere a cocacola cooler. and. as he stopped for a refreshing pause. he casually looked around the shelves of the trading post. he was particularly impressed by the sight of four american products on salethe coke he held in his hand. a large box of gillette razor blades. a dozen cans of heinz soup and. to his utter amazement. four boxes of toni. how heartening it is for a world traveler to see the widespread distribution of american products. it may be an international harvester combine at work in the wheatfields of argentina. it may be a gmc truck along the dikes of holland. or perhaps it is a singer sewing machine. humming busily away in a little italian tailor shop. maybe its a pack of luckies. jealously hoarded by a nile boatman at cairo. or a hershey bar held in the tight fist of a hungry little child in west germany. in brisbane. in calcutta. in rio. rome. or paris. american products are making friends for america. it is a wellknown fact that people understand things much better than they understand ideas. when we speak to a man in another country about democracy. he may or may not understand us. but when you give him a ride in your buick. ford. or chrysler. or offer him a chesterfield. lucky strike. camel. or old gold or a coke. he can easily judge for himself. this is democracy at work. this is america with its hard fist in the eye of greedy ideology. this is the lord. the image of man. spreading subsistence. comfort. and joy. to you men and women whose knowhow is responsible for such good works there can be no question that we must remain the greatest producing nation in the world. we must march down all avenues of freedom. bringing the good things of the earth. embracing all peoples. insuring free flow of ideas and trade. enhancing our prestige as a champion of peace and humanity. in such determination. in such enlightened action. lies the hope of the world. tariffs and trade policy"},{"1":"1955","2":"BYRD","3":"E","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. an audience of leading statesman. diplomats. and industrialists was in attendance at the silver quill award dinner in this city a week ago last saturday. one of the highlights of this occasion was the novel way in which various spokesmen presented information on their respective industries and governmental activities. this information was elicited through questions such as that asked of l. c. campbell. president of the national coal association. and vice president of eastern gas and fuel associates. some of whose mining operations are in my district. his response was in answer to this question: if coal is the sick industry that it is reported to be. will you as the man responsible for the coal development at eastern gas and fuel associates. as well as president of the national coal association. tell us what steps are being taken by producers to bolster the future security of your industry. which is of course tied to the security of the nation? under leave to extend my remarks. i am including his answer in the record. i should like also to associate myself with the views herein expressed in respect to prevailing conditions in many of our coalmining communities. i want to emphasize mr. campbells comment regarding the fact that a single plant which closes down sometimes takes the jobs of as many as 800 miners. on an average. the number of human beings thus directly affected is in the neighborhood of four or five thousand. yes. besides those 800 men are the women and children who are automatically deprived of many of the actual necessities of life once the breadwinners income is removed. it is true that. for a short time. unemployment benefit payments provide a part of the food and clothing which every normal family requires. but when those benefits are exhausted these persons must depend entirely upon surplus food commodities for subsistence. today if you should walk into many of the schools in the mining communities of west virginia. you would meet numerous children who left their homes this morning without an adequate breakfast. by this time. they will have participated in the free lunch program. but by nightfall they will again sit down to a meal that is sadly lacking in the nourishment necessary for proper growth. many of those children are improperly clothed. and there is little chance that they will obtain new coats or dresses or suits or shoes so long as current conditions persist. a830 mr. campbell stated very precisely that it is dangerous from a defense standpoint to take for granted that a crippled industry can respond to the demands that would come about in a national emergency. i believe that none among us could ignore coals place in the national security if only this statement from mr. campbells address were observed and considered: a ton of coal per ton of steela pound of coal per kilowatthour of electricitythere you have the lifeblood of americas industrial might today and tomorrow. mr. speaker. congress is empowered with the authority to alleviate at least a portion of the distress that has enveloped coal communities. it can return employment to many thousands of our miners and make it possible for the families of these men to again assume the godgiven right to adequate food and clothing if it will enact legislation to provide a 10percent quota limitation on foreign residual and crude oil shipped into this country. in the last paragraph of the campbell statement. he mentioned that most of his audience had never seen a coal miner. as a person who was brought up in a coalminers home. i would like to assure you that the story of poverty that has come to coal communities is not an exaggeration. i lived in a coalmining town when foreign residual oil began to trickle into the fuel markets of the east coast. as this inflow increased in intensity. mine after mine was forced to cut back production. and the \"no work tomorrow\" sign began to haunt more and more mining families. as the imports reached flood stage. jobs were wiped out completely. and today throughout west virginia there is ample evidence of the dire consequence of the policies which have permitted these imports to plague the coal industry. i believe that the present predicament of our mining families is the most compelling testimony for need of a quota restriction on oil imports. following is the text of mr. campbells statement:"},{"1":"1954","2":"GRANAHAN","3":"E","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. under leave to extend my remarks in the record. i wish to include the following address which i delivered last week before an outstanding group of our citizens in philadelphia. the 49th and market streets businessmens association of philadelphia. on national legislative issues of current interest: its a pleasure to meet with you tonight and discuss some of the national legislative issues which affect you and all businessmen in so very many different ways. its hard to think of anything we door consider doingin the congress (other than dodging bullets) which does not affect you businessmen right here at 40th and market streets. some of the issues may seem rather far fetchedfar removedfrom your point of view or from the standpoint of your business interests. but the thing we learn in the congress (and the longer we serve the better we learn it). is that our economy is a lot like the weather. the weather may seem like a local matter. it may put rain in the streets of philadelphia while camden is dry and sunny. but we all know that weather conditions in one part of the country do have an effect on the weather elsewhere. a cold wave doesnt just suddenly spring up in philadelphia: it marches down our way from the northwest. or the northeast. and it stays cold here until some good strong warm breezes get up our way from the southwest. its the same with our economic conditions. a big layoff at the philadelphia navy yard is more than a localized philadelphia problem. it spreads out to nearby new jersey and to upstate areas where a lot of the laidoff workers live. and the first thing you know the effects of that layoff are being felt for many miles around philadelphia. as people here begin to cut back on their purchases. then the detroit auto plants feel it in reduced orders for new cars. and then the pittsburgh steel mills feel it in the banking of blast furnaces and the furloughing of workers as steel sheet orders from detroit are cut way down. and then the pennsylvania railroad notices it in reduced ore or coal shipments or boxcar loadings. and it goes through the whole economy that way like a virus disease. you businessmen dont have to be told about this causeandeffect relationship and the close intertwining of our whole economy because in the past youve seen at first hand how economic developments supposedly far removed from philadelphia have their aftereffects here at 40th and market. and from what i hear. youre feeling some uncomfortable drafts of this present economic cold front which has been moving across the country. is this a depression? certainly not. with nearly 60 million americans at work. there is no depression. with average wages of those in manufacturing industriesand they make up a good part of the 60 millionat somewhere in the neighborhood of $70 a week. there is no depression. with the ford motor co. breaking records in january in the sale of cars and trucks. there is no depression. is there a recession? i think the answer to that is pretty clearly yes. i dont want to be a partisan speaker here tonight. and while you all know i am a democrat. i am not speaking here tonight as . democratic spokesman but as your congressman. regardless of your political party. i make that point because up to just a few days ago no one in the present national administration would acknowledge that what we had on our hands was an actual recession but insisted on calling it a \"rolling readjustment\" or an \"inventory contraction\" or some other economists phrase. but then the joint committee on the economic report (which includes such republican senators as planders. of vermont. a manufacturer. goldwater. of arizona. a merchant. carlson. of kansas. and watkins. of utah. and 4 very conservative republican members of the house. along with 3 democratic senators and 3 democratic congressmen) came right out the other week and said. \"yes.\" what we had on our hands was a recession. so at least we can use that word now without apologizing for being politically partisan. the truth of the matter is. of course. that republicans are just as anxious as democrats to avoid either recession or depression: were all in this thing together and we know that economic troubles do not respect party labels. between the political parties themselves there areand i hope always will bedifferences of opinion on how these economic problems should be handled. but i dont think we gain anything by calling each other names or implying that one party wants depression and the other wants national bankruptcy in deficit financing. we all want the same thing: a prosperous. expanding american economy in which people can get the good things of life and enjoy them and be happy. a country safe from aggression and secure against communist infiltration: a country where the youngsters growing up have all the opportunity in the world to be whatever they want to be. well. how do we go about that big task? how do we accomplish these objectives? what can we do to achieve these goals? lets put politics completely aside and look at it in familiar businesslike terms. what makes business good? isnt it people having money in their pockets and being able to spend it? how does the money get into their pockets? id say in two knajor ways. one is if the government itself. in a war situation. for instance. places orders for vast numbers of guns and ships and tanks an4 planes and other military equipment. and then the factories have to hire more people to turn out all of this material along with essential civilian needs. and those workers are paid and paid well. and start saving money for the big purchases they will make when automobiles and washing machines and houses and other things not produced in wartime are once again available to buy. after world war ii that pentup purchasing power. all those savings which had been socked away. were put to buying and we have a tremendous wave of prosperity. the same thing happened in 1950 and thereafter. when military orders and defense construction made for a shortage of workers. high wages. lots of overtime. and people again saved a lot of their incomes for delayed purchases. but what do we do when the government is not placing war and defense orders in such recordbreaking volume? how do we assure prosperity then? the answer. it seems to me. is to have an atmosphere in which the public will continue to spend its income for the things it wantsthe desirable things of lifeand the only way to have that is in a situation of full employment in which there is confidence on the part of the people that jobs are secure and paychecks are not suddenly going to be cut off. it is the national policy of our country. as declared by congress in law and as signed by the president in 1946. that the governmenriitself should promote and encourage this situation of full employment. this atmosphere in which people who have incomes feel secure in their work and are not frightened into saving a disproportionate part of their incomes and thus delaying or canceling orders for the things they want. our tax policy should be geared to that. also our housing policies. our agricultural policies. our resources policies. when the present administration began cutting back drastically on military and defense work more than a year ago. however. it initiated none of the steps which would have helped to fill the vacuum in the economy caused by taking away these billions of dollars worth of workof payrolls and plant equipment. and so on. the defense workers who lost their jobs discovered that new jobscivilian jobswerent opening up for them very quickly. when they went from $70 or $80 or $100 a week to $27 on unemployment compensation (if they were eligible for it at all. and government workers are not) they naturally reduced their standards of living accordingly and stopped buying as much in your stores or otherwise patronizing your businesses. they ran up debts in order to buy necessities. and those debts will keep them busy and broke for quite a while after they do get back on the job. but thats only part of the effect. everyone else in the same plant also began to cut his spending in anticipation of the next layoff. or the one after that. and this thing has spread out. meanwhile. the huge surpluses of food had caught the farmer in a squeeze between high production costs and lowered prices for the things he raised and sold. and so farmers cancelled orders for new equipment and this caused wholesale unemployment in places like moline. ill.. and other farm equipment centers: the people there bought fewer washing machines or irons or dishwashers or other products made around here. and so we have had a whole cycle and a circle of reduced orders. reduced business. reduced payrolls. reduced purchasing power. these are the things which have been happening. there is not much to be gained in arguing over whose fault it was. although in a political campaign its an inevitable question and will be a big issue. but more ima1950 portant questions are what can the government and what should the government do about it. i think anything which helps to get purchasing power into the hands of more people would be a step in the right direction. if this purchasing power is used. demand will increase. men will be rehired on their old production jobs. business will pick up and prosper. and an atmosphere of confidence will be restored so that those who have extra cash to spend for the better things of life will not have this hesitant feeling about buying. they will again buy homes or furniture or cars or other \"postponable\" things rather than put every possible extra cent away in bank accounts against a rainylets say. a rainierday. we dont want to discourage people from thrift. but we have to get them out of the idea that depression is around the corner. this idea that they better not buy anything now because the money theyd spend for a car or living room furniture or new clothes or some other desirable purchase might represent eating money in the near future. heres where we have the big disagreement in washington. the big question there is whether the cause of prosperity is best served by providing new incentives to business through changes in the tax laws. or whether we would do better by easing the tax burden to the tune of the same number of billions of dollars a year but easing the taxes in favor of the little fellow. the wage earner. the smallbusiness man. the medium income groups. i dont think youll find the washing machine manufacturers building new plants to produce more washing machines when they cant sell their output from existing plants. so a tax concession to big business to provide it with incentives to expansion may often go only into higher dividends to the stockholders rather than into expansion in plant or equipment. only a small percentage of the population owns stocks: so the benefits of that kind of a tax concession would go to a very few. and they. in many if not most cases. would be people in a position to save the whole amount of this added income and not spend it at all. so i dont think you get prosperity or keep it going that way. on the other hand. if the tax burden on the lower income groups were eased through higher exemptions. that would be $100 or more spending money for almost every family you know. and for most of your customers. so while the treasury might be losing the same number of billions in revenues by giving tax relief either of to business corporations or to individuals. the actual effect upon the economy of the two types of tax relief would be entirely different. the one would generate purchases which in turn would generate more sales. more business. more production. and thus a healthy economy. the other. intended to encourage expansion of industry. might just go into the pockets of the few and have no broad effect upon the whole economy. meanwhile. we have these billions of dollars piling up in the unemployment compensation funds of the various states. yet the present unemployment compensation payments are much too small to enable a wage earner who has lost his job to do any normal buying at all. we have these other even greater billions piling up in the social security account. but people on social security are in many cases practically destitutewhat can they buy with the few dollars they receive? we have a crying need for new schools. for new highways. for new recreation centers. for modernized shipping facilities. for flood control. river dredging. and a thousand other types of public works which should be going forward right now. both because they are so needed and also because of the surging impact this would. .have on employment and on the business situation. earlier i mentioned the report of the joint committee on the economic report. as far as it went. it was a good report. it recognized that business was off and production was down and payrolls had decreased and things were uncertain. but it was overly cautious in recommending remedial action. and therefore very disappointing to me. the democrats on the committee filed a supplemental report calling for not only better unemployment compensation and socialsecurity benefits. public works planning. continued aid to agriculture. and so on. but also significant tax redictions for individuals. and a sharp reduction in excise taxes. since then. the top republican on tax matters. chairman ree of the ways and means committee. has recommended such an excisetax cut. and speaker maartin is for it too. but the treasury has taken a different view. saying we cant afford the reduced revenues of an excisetax.cut. well. unless we do something about purchasing power in the hands of the great mass of the people. the treasury will lose billions and billions of revenues from a further lowering of business levels. and if that happened. the government would be so far in the red we would have to take the kind of steps none of us presently would want to contemplate. we dont want any more wpasbut we would have one if unemployment ever again got to the point it did a generation ago. in the congress these days. we are considering and discussing these matters every dayin the committees. in the cloakrooms. and on the floor of the house or senate chambers. but as of now we have not had before us any significant legislation intended to remedy these ills. we have talked about housing. but we so far have no housing bill to. consider and vote on. we have talked about better social security. but no bill is before us. we have talked about better unemployment compensation benefits. but we have no bill to work on. all these things are bottled up in committee. well have a tax bill before us soon. but the way that usually works. the members will have no choice but to take it or leave it in the form it comes from committee. individual amendments from the floor will not be permitted. however. we will have one single opportunity in connection with that bill. by use of the legislative technique of recommitting the bill to committee with instructions to amend it in one particular way and then send it back out again. to get into it this idea of raising exemptions by $100 or $200 per person from the present $600 exemption. and that is probably where the biggest fight of all will come. i intend to join with those supporting the higher exemptions. i think it would do more than any other single thing to get more purchasing power into the hands of people to spend in your businesses. and if they have that extra cash and spend it. the government will certainly benefit in higher tax collections all around. the point i want to leave with you tonight is that as of right now our economy is still comparatively healthy. but in danger. the recession virus must not be permitted to spread. strong leadership by the executive department and vigor by the leadership of the congress to get action on corrective legislation are absolutely necessary. we have not had much of that kind of leadership or vigor. the committees are often dawdling and pigeonholing important billseven those recommended by the presidentand so. as we get closer and closer to the july 31 adjournment. we so far have very little to show for the work of this congress. you people must join in the demand for actionnow. benefits for prisoners of war"},{"1":"1953","2":"SCUDDER","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. chairman. the people of the united states of america are not much different from peoples of .other countries. the difference is between the form of government under which they live. if you should rob the american people of their guaranty of independence and their constitutional protection. we would soon bankrupt our civilization. to me america is the vehicle of selfrespect. it is opportunity. it holds out incentive. and it awards those who by their ability and ingenuity rise to do a better job than is expected of them. it encourages groups of people to band themselves together to do collectively that which they could not do as individuals in the improvement of their country. for this incentive. there must be a reward. this is the basis for the forming of corporations and affords the opportunity for investment by our people. this is sometimes called the free enterprise system. they ask to be treated no differently than any individual and they pay their taxes to the local. state. and federal governments in support of our institutions. your committee on public works has reported to you h. r. 4351 an american enterprise bill. and believes that all the people of our country will benefit by the construction of the improvements and the development of hydroelectric power on the niagara river. if there is one policy that is in thorough agreement it is that all the people in a watershed have claim to its water. the waters of the niagara and st. lawrence originate in several states and provinces. is actually an international boundary and just happens to flow by the state of new york. therefore. i can see no reason why the state of new york or its political subdivisions have any priority for the development of the project. nor should the federal government embark on the project in competition with its constituent investors. this project is estimated to cost $337 million. if done by free enterprise in accordance with this legislation it will not cost the taxpayers one cent but. on the contrary. will broaden the tax base and make annualtax payments of approximately $23 million. in my opinion this is just good. sound. business sense. the niagara river is one of the most natural and ideal sites for the development of hydropower. the army engineers figure the benefittocost ratio to be 4 to 1 on this project. no big impounding dams are involved. it means simply diverting an agreed volume of water. the lowcost power developed by this project will be integrated with the power of the companies now supplying this northeastern area of the united states. the utilities commission of the state of new york has full control of power rates. and such rates are based on reasonable return on invested capital. therefore. the lowcost power developed by this project will be reflected in rates charged consumers of all the companies who participate in this development. the niagara development would serve no other purpose than the production of power. it does not involve flood control. reclamation. irrigation. sanitation. or the improvement of navigation. it was brought out conclusively in testimony at hearings on this subject extending over a period of 2 days that the industries. businessmen. and labor organizations in the niagara area were wholeheartedly in favor of private development. their reasons are simple and fundamentally sound in that under private development the project would be completed more quickly. it would yield tax revenue. it would prevent expenditure of public funds. and that private development is in accord with sound government. it is gratifying to note what the present secretary of -the interior said in a speech on april 13. and i quote: at no time should we. the government. put roadblocks in the way of private enterprise in attempting to serve customers by generating and distributing hydroelectric power. 0 * * the federal government just simply does not have the money. as we taxpayers know. to do all of the job of development of hydro power. the purpose of h. r. 4351 is to allow for private development of niagara power by companies already operating in the area. who are able to do the job without cost to the government. and who would do the job in a manner conforming to the desires of consumers in that and adjacent areas."},{"1":"1952","2":"RIBICOFF","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. chairman. let us face reality. it is not the last time congress will be asked to authorize large sums of money for foreign assistance. the passage of this bill will not eliminate communistic imperialism. neither will the passage of this bill allow us to withdraw from our worldwide responsibilities. as long as the united states remains the leader of the free world. and the soviet of the slave. we as a nation will be called upon to contribute heavily of our substance. no possible combination of nations without the united states can stop the kremlin from seeping through the weak dikes of the world and flooding our western civilization. it is important to have nations go along with us as willing allies. the american people have the courage. the intelligence. and the determination to face the facts. they will adopt and follow to a successful conclusion the course which these facts show must be taken. but they must know why they are being asked to act. from the inception of the foreign aid programs. the executive branch has pictured them as short range and crisis induced. the program was to end soon when the particular crisis was over. the particular act was a last push. this thesis accepted by congress. the reports and the debates continually fall into a pattern of justification either to repair wars devastation. stopping communism or making us militarily strong. we started foreign military assistance by giving military aid to greece and turkey. the law which inaugurated the marshall plan provided that it was to end june 30. 1952. the mutual security act provides that it is to end in 1954. the entire record consists of measures presented to congress on the basis that if this specific and limited action is taken. the situation will be normalized. such an approach is wrong. dangerous. and filled with illusions. crisis will continue to follow crisis in international affairs. troubles will be with us for many future and uncertain years. congress has collaborated with the executive rationale. maybe the road to large foreign grants have been smoothed thereby. such an approach. however. has been selfdefeating. no firm foundation has been laid for long range foreign policy. it has placed us in a position of being unable to take any one of a variety of courses of action unless they can be squeezed into military justifications. this nation should be wideeyed and clear as to what we are about. to get around time limits and economic assistance. we substitute the phrase \"defense support.\" next year it will be another \"gimmick.\" frustration and anger will atmosphere the legislation instead of understanding. the effectiveness of the aid programs is watered down. one of the consequences of the policy of basing each foreign assistance program on a current crisis has been that the people of nations receiving our help have been confused. there is no escaping the fact that many people in the world today regard the united states along with russia as threatening the peace of the world. the united states is feared and suspect inspite of this aid. communism remains strong in france and italy. our wisdom and aims are doubted by nations which should understand us and have confidence in us. the following of such a course is due to the feeling by many that the american people must be constantly reassured. they must be fed a verbal \"pap.\" however. once aware of the facts of international life. this nation will assume the burdens of leadership willingly even though unhappily. first. let every american understand that russia has under arms. and has had since the end of the war. 175 divisions. russia has 20.000 airplanes. of which 4.000 are jets. there are 500 submarines in the soviet navy. germany had only 60 submarines at the beginning of the last war. soviet forces are deployed in eastern germany and in the far east so that they can attack immediately. no calling up of reserves or bringing up of supplies is necessary. the fact that this military power has not yet been used does not mean that it will not be used. there is no escaping the fact that the soviets are hostile to the united states and that they are militarily strong. nevertheless. it must never be forgotten that the men in the kremlin prefer subversion. unrest. and revolution to war. they are the greatest masters in history of subversive techniques. wherever internal unrest. dissension. or weakness are present. the soviet has an organization and a wellworkedout plan in readiness where a minority. subject to its control. can take over the government. one of the greatest dangers confronting the united states today is that we may concentrate so intently on meeting soviet military aggression that we neglect the defense against subversion. a second fact which americans cannot shut their eyes to is the situation in those parts of the world where new nations have recently emerged from colonial status and where other races feel themselves for the first time free from control by europeans. peoples still under the control of foreign nations seek to follow the countries already independent. in many cases the soviet did not cause this unrest. they do fan the flames. it cannot be repressed or eliminated. the united states must accept the fact that the situation exists. the soviet is ever ready to turn this situation to its advantage. it has the organization and the technique for taking over any government which cannot cope with the problems which have to be faced. one of the principal challenges confronting the united states is whether or not we can prevent these people. largely in asia and africa. from falling under soviet domination. if these areas fall to the soviet we will be irreparably weaker and the power of the kremlin will be greater. the united states needs not only to spend money to maintain a program of sufficient range to help these people attain a status where they can support and defend themselves. but to supply constructive leadership and statesmanship as well. a third hard reality confronting the united states is that in important respects we have become a \"have not\" nation. our position of world leadership is due. in part at least. to the fact that throughout our history we have had within our own borders nearly all the resources which our industries required and the foodstuffs that our people consumed. to a greater extent than any other nation. we have been able to supply our own needs. modern technology. however. has altered this situation. there are a number of minerals today of small importance in terms of tonnage or of dollars but which are of vital importance for the productive capacity of our nation. the united states is dependent on foreign sources for 100 percent of our industrial diamonds. 100 percent of our tin. 99 percent of our nickel. 93 percent of our cobalt and our manganese. and 92 percent of our mercury. to name only a few. i am making no mention of atomicenergy materials. in addition to this. some of the most important materials which we have always obtained at home are becoming exhausted. today we import 42 percent of our copper and our steel industry is being relocated to permit the use of imported iron ore. these facts mean that if we permit ourselves to be cut off from the resources of the rest of the world. transportation and communication as we know it today. automatic and laborsaving machinery. much of the comfort in everyday living and certain of the things we regard as necessities cannot be continued. we must work with other nations to keep supplies of important materials available to us and to prevent them from falling under soviet domination. consideration should be given finally to the importance to the united states of expanding our markets overseas. our industrial capacity as a whole is now about double what it was in 1940. only a dozen years ago. what are we going to do if it becomes possible for us to curtail military production? we cannot let our factories close and our people remain unemployed. it will be vital to this country that export markets be available to us. the underdeveloped areas of the world deserve particular attention in this respect. a noteworthy aspect of the postwar boom has been the forward spurt of trade in item after item sold to some countries long characterized by low incomes. venezuela took $24.000.000 of dairy products in 1950. up from a little more than $1.000.000 in 1938. india took $30.000.000 of industrial machinery in 1950 as against $4.000.000 in 1938. the demand for the produce of american factories exists if the people of the world can be brought into our market. in this connection it should be emphasized that the united states normally exports several billion dollars more than it imports. since the war our exports have exceeded our imports by about $5.000.000.000 per year although this balance was as low as $1.500.000.000 in 1950 and as high as $9.500.000.000 in 1947. foreign nations cannot pay for our exports unless they have dollars. we discourage their earning dollars by shipping their products to us as indicated by our recent action in raising the tariff on cheese. is it more politically expedient for the united states to give aid to foreign nations so that they can buy our goods than to lower our import barriers so that they can earn the necessary dollars? if so. let us at least tell the american people they will continue paying a subsidy to our agriculture. mines and industry to make this trade possible and keep our friends afloat. nevertheless. if the united states is to remain an industrial nation with all it means to us in high productivity and a high standard of living. we must have a world market. we are geared to a world economy. if we have to readjust to a hemispheric economy or a continental economy we will all of us be poorer. the international adjustments necessary to remove world tensions are proceeding but progress is painfully and disappointingly slow. i think our assistance program might have been administered in a manner that might have given greater incentives to speed in cooperation and provided penalties for delay. nevertheless. we have to recognize that the political and organizational changes necessary will take many years to complete. governmental institutions will have to be established. national constitutions modified. industries uprooted and in some cases populations redistributed. there is no way that these things can be accomplished in months. until they have been accomplished. the united states will feel continuous tensicn and face a sucession of crises. all of these things mean that we should approve the legislation before us with our eyes open. it cannot be truthfully said that all we have to do is equip x number of foreign divisions and our problems will be over. we must recognize that that is not the whole story. arms are only part of the overall picture. it is impossible to separate a nations military requirements from its basic and essential civilian needs. they are all part of the same ball of wax. to force the aid program into military compartments only will get us into actual as well as intellectual difficulties. the constant talk of arms scares a warweary world and casts suspicion on our aims. it lets the soviet. who arm in silence and secrecy. sell its phony peace campafgns under the symbol of the white dove. the congress cannot legislate or appropriate the kremlin out of business. we cannot vote tranquillity for the people in asia and africa who believe they are on their way to better things. we cannot by law alter the technology of the electronic and the atomic age. every one of these situations presents us with complex and longrange problems of foreign policy. further. let us not kid ourselves that our problem is military and economic only and that it will end in 1954. we must also recognize that man is a spiritual. emotional. and moral being. he is not a scientific automaton whose actions can be predicted under any given circumstances. the burning concepts of our declaration of independence and bill of rights reborn for the world could impart more than dollars alone. it is to be regretted that those charged with the execution of foreign policy do such a poor job of presentation and explanation. however. congress. too. has a responsibility for policy and the national interest. congress cannot shirk its responsibility. we must stop looking for the simple and pat answers. we must realize that with international problems 2 plus 2 invariably equals 3 or 5 and not 4. when these programs are thus approached reality and substance will start filling out the bare bones of our foreign policy. maturity will give our leadership direction and strength free from frustration and fear. i would like to spend the remaining time allotted to me in discussing the argument of the gentleman from ohio. the gentleman from ohio deserves that particular attention and discussion. there has been no other member of the committee that has worked as hard and as diligently on this legislation. but i think the gentleman from ohio. too. will admit that there were many other members of this committee that were most critical during the entire conduct of these hearings. in truth. i think it can be safely said that never has there been a chairman of any committee so independent of the executive branch than our own chairman. the gentleman from south carolina . constantly he asked the $64 question. i think the gentleman from ohio. too. will admit that there was no member on the committee that gave our executive branch a harder time in the committee than i did. the gentleman talks about $18.098.000.000 available instead of the amount that we talk about in the bill of $6.901.000.000. he would lead the house to believe that we have this large reservoir of funds that have not been used and that should be used. as a matter of fact he fails to tell the house that when he talks about these $8.000.000.000 of unexpended funds these are obligated funds. the $8.000.000.000 do not represent money in the treasury to be used for any particular purpose. it represents goods in the pipelines. the $8.000.000.000 that he talks about being unexpended actually represent contracts that have been let. they represent 4.000 tanks at $2.900.000.000. they represent 3.000 jet fighters at $2.300.000.000. they represent mine sweepers at $600.000.000. they represent artillery pieces. they represent firecontrol equipment. they represent guns. and they represent military hardware. these items are in the pipeline. by law money must be available when contracts are signed. therefore. if we did not authorize the amount set out in the bill. after june 30 of this year the mutual security administrator would have to cut off all future contracts. we have to make up our minds whether we are or are not going ahead with this program. the gentleman from ohio is not correct when he says there are $8.000.000.000 available to the mutual security agency for expenditures. i think the house should understand just what a pipeline is. it should be stated that a pipeline is the time between obligation. or let us call it contract. and the expenditures which are made almost indentical with delivery. most goods that are represented in this pipeline take approximately 2 years to produce. so when the gentleman tells you that this $6.000.000.000 will not be spent until a year or more from now. he is absolutely correct. but why is he correct? the money you appropriated last year is being used to pay for the goods that are coming off the assembly lines this year. when it takes 2 years to deliver a tank and approximately 2 years to deliver a plane. in order to place those orders we make the authorizationsthe appropriations. thereafter when the goods are delivered payment is made from the funds which you are authorizing today. the gentleman is incorrect when he states that there is $8.000.000.000 left. as a matter of -fact. by july 1 there would be only about $405.000.000 left of unobligated funds."},{"1":"1951","2":"ELLIOTT","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. i shall vote for the conference report on the independent offices appropriation bill for. 1952. now before us. i will

public hous-. ing during this fiscal year which began on july 1. when this conference re. port on this bill was before us a few weeks ago it was recommitted by two votes on the questions raised by the jensen amendment and because it contained authority for the construction of 50.000 units of public housing. a satisfactory compromise has been reached on the employment problems embraced in the jensen amendment. so. the question now before the house of representatives is. will its members approve 50.000 units of public housing to be built this year? a vote for the motion to again recommit the bill to the conference committee is a vote against 50.000 units of public housing for this year. a vote against the motion to recommit is a vote for 50.000 units of this housing. i have been in this fight to provide an opportunity for better housing for the american people for the last 3 years now. i voted for the housing act of 1949. providing for public housing. slum clearance. rural nonfarm housing. research in housing. and rural housing. the latter provision of which said act was authorized by that true friend of the farmer and of farm home ownership. the gentleman from alabama . the first public housing project to be built in alabama under the housing act of 1949 was built in my home town of jasper. ala.. and is now completed and occupied. the second rural farm home loan made in alabama under the housing act of 1949 was made to mr. and mrs. william t. glass of franklin county. in the congressional district which i have the honor to represent here. i voted for the liberalization of gi and fha loan requirements in the housing act of 1950. and for the act providing direct gi loans to veterans living in rural areas where private financing is not available. which latter act expired on june 30 this year. i am the author of h. r. 3861 which passed the house on june 18. providing for an extension of direct gi loans for a period of 2 years. the identical language of my bill. h. r. 3861. has been incorporated in the bill which will be before us for debate immediately after we dispose of the conference report now before us. i mention all these things. mr. speaker. by way of illustrating to some degree. at least. the legislative history of housing over the period of the last 3 years. and to make the point that those of us who have been interested in better housing for the american people have had to fight for that principle all along the way. the housing act of 1949 authorized among other things the construction of 135.000 units of public housing per year for a period of 6 years. then came the korean war. and it was necessary that we cut all spending. except for defense. to the bone. drastic cuts were made in many fields. for instance. no new flood control or harbor projects are being started in the fiscal year 1952. this meat ax approach. though having the virtue of temporarily saving money. has the vice of deferring projects in many instances that are of vital concern and necessity to the american people. the people of kansas. missouri. and oklahoma who have just suffered the ravages of a billiondollar flood call on us to wield the meat ax a little more intelligently. the expenditure of $300.000.000 in harnessing the headwaters of the missouri river would have prevented the great catastrophe which they have suffered. we cut funds for building hospitals under the hillburton act. as amended in 1949. practically 50 percent. in the face of the fact that in the state of emergency that we now find ourselves in. our cities are subject to being erased by atom bombs delivered by enemy planes. the hillburton hospitals of the rural areas may be called on for a role of mercy in treating the injured of our cities that in the event of war. which god forbid. stagger the imagination. mr. speaker. i could mention many other cuts in our expenditures that have been made by congress in an effort to save money wherever possible. but in no case. i believe. have cuts been made as drastically as those already made in the field of public housing. if we adopt the conference report now before us. over which this controversy rages. we will have reduced the number of public housing units to be built this year from 135.000 to 50.000a reduction of 61 percent. if we adopt this report we will build less than 39 percent of the units originally scheduled for construction this year. as we go about doing those things that are absolutely necessary for the common defense of this country. such as providing some measure of controls of rents. wages. and prices. such as the construction of roads to and houses around military and defense installations. the spokesmen of reaction cry out that the democrats are attempting under the guise of the war effort to socialize the country. but now. i ask you. mr. speaker. whether or not. in reverse. some of our friends are not. under the impulse of the desire of all of us to save whatever and wherever we can. trying to stop dead in its tracks or perhaps even roll back every program in america that has for its purpose the providing of an opportunity for the ordinary. everyday citizen of the united states. some of us seem to forget that our country has made. relatively speaking. few internal improvements during the past 10 or 12 years. our highways are dreadfully loaded. and are daily taking their enormous toll of the lives and property of the american people. public buildings are generally badly overcrowded. there is a great shortage of hospital and health facilities throughout the country. our school buildings in many states are woefully overcrowded. we need more teachers. and those we have deserve better pay. our research effort against the dread diseases of cancer. polio. heart trouble. tuberculosis. and many others should be doubled or tripled. against the background of a greatly expanding population and a greatly expanding economy. it is apparent that our efforts to keep up. so to speak. in these and other fields are falling behind. we must practice economy. and we must use every effort to see that our government receives a dollars worth of goods or services for each dollar it expends. but we must not practice a false economy by rudely shunting aside those internal developments that would pay for themselves both in dollars and in increased strength for all america. this housing is desperately needed. surveys made by local groups where the housing is to be built attest that fact. the preliminary work. the planning. the acquiring of a site on which to build a project. the architectural drawings for the project in manj. many instances has already been done. to close these projects down. to abandon the work already done. will be a wasteful mistake. the planning and the preliminary work are expensive. i sometimes think too expensive. in these communities where it has been done. the only sensible thing to do is go ahead and complete the projects. there are several projects in this situation in the seventh congressional district of alabama. berry. reform. russellville. guin. winfield. hackleburg. brilliant. bear creek. vernon phil campbell. and oneonta are in this classification. who will live in these houses? lowincome groups as the law provides. veterans with low incomes. and particularly disabled vet3rans. will have preference. people with fixed incomes. incomes that are low. generally less than $150 per month. will live in these houses. the houses will be owned and operated by local public corporations. known as housing authorities. they will eventually become the outrigkt property of the towns and cities that build them. let us adopt this conference report. it has been too long delayed already."},{"1":"1950","2":"JAVITS","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. chairman. this bill is in a fair way to restore the bipartisan foreign policy which was such a powerful force in the postwar reconversion of our foreign policy. i hope it will be fully debated and will be the occasion for a . complete exploration and discussion of our foreign policy. only good can come from this. the leading architect of the bipartisan foreign policy in the other bodythe distinguished republican. the senior senator from michigan has once again clearly indicated the path to be followed. i offered an amendment in committee along the lines of his suggestion which i will again offer on the floor to establish a posterp economic policy committee with congressional participation. the eca represents the most enlightened policy any nation which has led the world has ever evidenced in recorded history. the basis of this program is the realization that to be richer we must help others out of poverty. to be safe. we must see that others do not despair. to be at peace. we must see that others do not become desperate. and to be free. we must see that others remain free. this is the meaning of our foreign policy. it is the heart of the eca idea. so great is this idea that i believe it will be found to be the complete answer to the totalitarian challenge of communism. our foreign policy now is based on the principle of the shield and the wrench. .through the atlantic pact and the mutual defenseassistance program. american military power shields the freedom of western europe. while the erp and similar programs propose to restore the power of western europe to secure itself. the eca has been successful. first. it has repelled the active menace of communism. particularly in france and italy where in 1947 and early 1948 communist parties were on the verge of taking over. second. it has given europeans a new selfrespect and a new confidencea reason for defending themselves against communism. these are the important points. the fact that industrial production of western europe has risen from 80 percent of its prewar average in 1947. to 120 percent in 1949. and that agricultural production has risen from 80 percent of its prewar normal to almost 100 percent in 1949. are only the basis for the even more important gains in the morale of the free european peoples which have been achieved. aside from the detailed problems of terms and amounts which we will be debating on the amendment stageand i was one of those who opposed the amendment of my distinguished colleague. the gentleman from ohio on amountthe one question we have to answer in the erp is. can we stop now? and the answer is a decisive \"no.\" let it be said at the outset that there is no commitment to continuethe congress made that perfectly clear. but that our own selfinterest demands continuance. it is the powerful alliance of the free world which is so overwhelming to the russians. and the best confirmation of that is the herculean efforts which they are making to sabotage the erp and also to absolutely shut off their own satellites from any part in it. knowing full well that this is the one way in which they would lose the satellites. an evidence of the significance of western europe as an active ally in the cold war is seen in the one estimate that if the united kingdom should. because of internal breakdown. be compelled to relinquish its international role. particularly in germany. and also in the far east and other parts of the world. the vacuum created would increase our budget. on this item alone. by not less than $4.000.000.000 a year. yet the amount for which great britain figures in this years erp is about $500.000.000. there has also been a good deal of illconsidered talk about how wc- off the europeans now are. nothing could be further from the facts. the 270.000.000 people of europe enjoyed a gross national product in 1949 estimated at $160.000.000.000. this compares with the gross national product of 150.000.000 americans of $260.000.000.000. no one contends for a moment that our job is to bring the europeans up to this parity. but it certainly indicates that recovery in europe even for very basic well being still has a long way to go. as a breakdown on this figure. it is significant that the average british worker earns $16.70 for a 45hour week against the earnings of his united states counterpart which average $55 for a 40hour week. i refer the members to the average british workers budget. which i have put in the record of hearings at page 139. and the following. this is a graphic picture of grim austerity. . i would like to deal specifically with two other sections of the billone is section 104 at page 13. and the other is title iii at page 15. section 104 represents a policy with respect to the far east as developed by the congress. it does not wait for the dust to settle. but advocates a joint organization of the free countries and the free peoples of the far east. in the interest of their own security and their own prosperity. these free peoples need each others strength to rely on and a consciousness of their common purpose. if they are to adequately defend against communism. in addition they can and should help each other and in doing so they better than anyone else can separate the wheat from the chaff and determine conflicting national claims as in the burma area. our experience with the oeec demonstrates that a joint organization on a regional basis is the essential initial step toward a concerted program of selfhelp and mutual cooperation and that this in turn is the best initial defense against the communist drive and the best basis for a counterdefensive. the secretary of state says that somehow or another this must be made to occur on the volition of the states affected. but secretary marshall showed how it could be done by his harvard speech in june 1947 which started the marshall plan. and the same can be done here with respect to the far east. the other subject to be considered is title iii. the act for international development. it is said that this title will face considerable opposition in the house. i do not believe there is another part of the bill which gives as much for as little as does this title. the export of technical skills from the united states is good business. good politics. and good public relations. title iii should not be made a target of opposition either because it is a point made by the president or because it was not first proposed by the congress. as a matter of fact all the president did was to blow up into a major statement of policy an activity which had been going along very successfully under the institute of interamerican affairs since 1942 and under the smithmundt act since 1947.. if blowing it up into such a major statement of policy could strike a telling blow against the communist drive. as indeed it will. i do not see why we here should want to vitiate it. that is certainly not the spirit of the bipartisan foreign policy. the projects to be assisted are primarily those where there is no inducement .for private enterprise to step in for development of underdeveloped areas. but which are nevertheless the very basis upon which private enterprise must ultimately enter. they include health and sanitation. education. agricultural conservation and reconstruction. road building. and port development. in short. the normal functions of government. where skill and money are availableand what we are going todo under this title is to supply the skill and a small part of the money. these are not untried fields but rather fields in which we have had great experience. for example: the institute of interamerican affairs is now cooperating with 16 of the latin american governments in a total of 25 programs of technical aid exactly like those in this bill. i shall insert material into the record detailing these programs and showing also that the cost to the united states is constantly decreasing and that the share of the local governments is constantly increasing. the ecas overseas development fund is another example and it is significant that under this fund $20.000.000 of american knowhow and technical equipment will be translated into $200.000.000 of projects. with the remainder coming from the affected governments and areas. these include such projects as research in nigeriabritish. on sleeping sickness. building of roads requiring roadbuilding equipment and technical training in the congobelgian. road building and port development in west and equatorial africa and in the cameroonsfrench. a livestock utilization plant in angolaportuguese. and technical assistance to aid small farms in surinamnetherlands. the house will hear from my colleague. dr. judd. of the great benefits of the comparable program for rural reconstruction in china. this program of exporting technical knowhow should attract especially those who are looking to cut budgets. for it is the cheapest investment in overseas wellbeing that we can make. stimulating other projects on a basis of at least $10 for every dollar invested and often as much as $100 for every dollar invested. if we do not launch such a program. we are likely in a few years to be up against a new emergency and to have to undertake another relief program or to increase our national defense establishment in a major wayin either case adding billions rather than some millions to our budget. there is no economy like shortsighted economyshould we strike out title iii. we would be completely missing the forest for the trees. the program of cooperative action by the united states with the other american republics has achieved a record of practical and beneficial accomplishment during the past 8 years stretching from the rio grande border of mexico to the andean republic of chile. the agency which represents the united states in this farreaching cooperative work in the institute of interamerican affairs. the institute is a government corporation operating under the policy direction of a board of directors appointed by the secretary of state. it is the successor of two corporations which were established by the wartime office of the coordinator of interamerican affairs in 1942 and 1943. its job is to collaborate directly with the latin american governments in action programs aimed at improving their basic economies and raising the standards of living for their people. these programs are carried on in the three fundamental fields of health and sanitation. agriculture. and education. altogether the institute is now cooperating with 16 of the latin american governments on a total of 25 such programs. fourteen of these are in the field of health and sanitation. seven in education. and four in agriculture. cooperative programs of all three types are going forward in only two countriesparaguay and peru. two types of programs are being carried on in five of the countriesbolivia. brazil. ecuador. guatemala. and haiti. each of the nine other countrieschile. colombia. costa rica. el salvador. honduras. mexico. panama. uruguay. and vehezuelahas one currently active cooperative program. no programs of this type are presently active in argentina. cuba. the dominican ropublic. or nicaragua. in all 25 of the active programs the work is actually planned and executed by a unique type of governmental agency known generally as a servicio. comparable to a bureau in one of our cabinet departments here in the united states. what makes the servicio unique is that it is jointly staffed and jointly financed by the united states and the cooperating latinamerican government. in all cases the servicio functions within the appropriate ministryof health. education. or agricultureof the host republic. yet it is headed ordinarily by the institutes chief of field party. who is a citizen of the united states. its staff typically is made up of a comparatively small contingent of united states specialists and a much larger complement of nationals of the other country. its operations are financed by joint contributions of the two countries. with the latinamerican government in most cases putting up by far the larger share. the cooperative programs in the field of health and sanitation are aimed at the basic objectives of creating more healthful environments in the diseaseridden areas of latin america and providing a more adequate kind of publichealth service with special emphasis on preventive medicine and sanitation. the work includes. first. publichealth activities carried out through health centers and other similar facilities such as clinics and mobile units. second. environmental sanitation through the construction or improvement of community watersupply and sewagedisposal systems. third. campaigns for the control of endemic diseases such as malaria. fourth. assistance in the construction and equipment of new hospitals or the improvement of existing ones. fifth. health education programs designed to inform the masses of the people of the basic facts about personal hygiene and nutrition. and sixth. the training of qualified nationals of the host country as specialists or administrators in the various phases of health and sanitation work. in the flield of education the c6perative programs are focused primarily on the improvement of elementary schools in the rural areas and on vocational training. the basic method of approach used by the servicio is through teacher training and the development of better teaching materials and methods. teacher training includes not only the normalschool type of activity. but also the systematic reorientation of teachers in service. in the rural elementary schools major emphasis is placed on the development of teaching techniques and of curricula that are closely tied in with the environmental needs and interests of the pupils. in vocational training the work is centered around the development of shop courses. vocationalteacher training. and similar activities that will provide future generations of latin americans with facilities for acquiring skills in carpentry. plumbing. mechanics. electricity. and other trades that are important in the basic economic growth of the country. cooperative programs in the field of food supply very considerably from country to country in accordance with peculiar local needs and problems. major emphasis. however. is placed on the development of new agricultural areas through techniques such as irrigation and on the intensification of crop and livestock production. the work includes. first. direct assistance to farmers through extensiontype offices established in key agricultural areas. second. training of nationals of the host country as agricultural technicians. third. operation of demonstration projects. fourth. basic studies and surveys of existing agricultural resources and potential areas for development. and. fifth. the provision of services and supplies. such as agriculturalmachinery pools. bullring services. properly balanced fertilizers. improved seeds. insecticides and fungicides. and hand implements. such services and supplies are made available to farmers on a fee or cost basis in areas where the needs cannot be adequately met from commercial sources. the work that has been going forward in these three fields of activity since 1942 is now scheduled for continuation until the middle of 1955. under the 1947 law which created the institute of interamerican affairs in its present form. the agency was authorized to carry on its work only until august of the present year. last spring and summer. however. congress reexamined the operations of this government corporation and decided that they should go forward for another 5 years beyond the previously scheduled termination date. in the same statutepublic law 283 of the eightyfirst congress. approved september 3. 1949congress also authorized an increase of 40 percent in the institutes annual rate of appropriations. since the passage of this law the institute has been busy planning for an extension and expansion of its operations along the lines authorized by the statute. all of the latinamerican governments have been officially advised by the american ambassadors of the enactment of the new law and have been invited to indicate their interest in the continuation of existing cooperative programs or the initiation of new ones in the coming 5year period. it now appears probable that the institute will be asked to carry forward all 25 of the programs now in operation and to launch more new ones than it can undertake with the appropriations that have been authorized. for the fiscal year which begins next july 1. the institute is contemplating a total of at least 32 programs in the three fields of activity and is asking congress for appropriations on this basis. this work. which was initiated originally under the stress of wartime exigencies. has amply proved its value as an instrument of american foreign policy within the western hemisphere in time of peace. while the cooperative programs have brought no sweeping revolutionary changes to latin america. they have struck effectively at some of the regions ageold problems and have laid a solid basis for future economic and social growth. comparative contributions by united states and other american republics to programs currently in operation by the

which produces the commodity in question. who can tell what the adverse effects under any trade agreement may be under these conditions? the distinguished minority leader. the gentleman from massachusetts . has referred to the painful situation in the watch industry at this time. please bear in mind. mr. chairman. that this industry has been certified by the military authorities as essential in terms of precision instruments in times of war. a few years ago there were over 20 firms in this country commanding about 55 percent of the domestic market. today there are only three firms commanding about 18 percent of that market. of the three. one. the waltham watch co.. is in the state of massachusetts. recently it closed its doors. and today it would be without hope were it

city where it is located. it is a tragic situation. others may follow. this country has been flooded with watches imported from switzerland. produced by underpaid labor. at prices with which we cannot compete. again and again in recent years this situation has been brought to the attention of the truman administration through the state department and tariff commission. nothing effective whatsoever has been done by the administration. why? largely. mr. chairman. because there has been no proper escape clause in the applicable agreement with the government of switzerland. a proper escape clause has been included in certain agreements from the outset. still others have been renegotiated for the purpose of including that clause. the amendment which will be offered will simply make it mandatory that every trade agreement hereafter shall include a proper escape clause. i am for international trade. mr. chairman. but i am also for the protection of the men and women in this country who labor

the escapeclause amendment when offered and for the approval of any other amendments which will safeguard the jobs of the rank and file of labor."},{"1":"1948","2":"MURRAY","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. the problem which we have before us today is not as complicated as might appear from the extended debate which has taken place with regard to it. this reorganization plan proposed by the president deals exclusively with the organizational location of the federal supervision of the state unemploymentcompensation programs and of the federal end of our public employment service system. since the reorganization plan deals exclusively with the location of the federal aspects of the unemployment compensation and the public employment service programs. it might be expected that the testimony presented to the committee would have been addressed primarily to that subjectto the relationships of the federal aspects of unemployment compensation and the employment service to each other. to the relationships of these two programs to other functions of the federal government. to the contrary. however. much of the testimony before the committee was directed not to these questions. but to the administration of unemploymentcompensation and employmentservice programs by the state. which is in no way affected by this reorganization plan. i feel obliged. therefore. to analyze some of the testimony presented. we are all aware of the fact that the federal unemployment tax act provides that states may. if they choose. reduce the unemploymentbenefit payrolltax rates for individual employers who. for one reason or another. are able to maintain relative stability of employment. this is known as merit rating. fortyseven states have chosen to introduce meritrating schemes and have thereby reduced the average payrolltax rates by 50 percent. there are some individuals who are of the opinion that merit rating is the sine qua non of state unemploymentcompensation programs. there are others who feel that merit rating is wholly unsound. but the point i wish to emphasize is that it makes no difference what ones attitude may be. toward merit rating. because merit rating is in no way. directly or indirectly. affected by either the adoption or the rejection of this reorganization plan. without reviewing the hearings. senators may find it difficult to understand why the question of payroll tax \"merit rating\" should figure so prominently in the discussions of the reorganization plan. the hearings patently revealed. however. that many of the witnesses had been. as have many of us. subjected to a vigorous fear campaign based upon gross misrepresentation. for example. some powerful organizations have been bombarding their members with allegations similar to the following: unless this plan is defeated both in the house and in the senate within 60 days from the introduction it will probably result in adding $13.000.000 a year to the tax bill of * * * employers [in this state] who now save that much through merit rating. mr. president. i repeat that merit rating is in no way. directly or indirectly. affected by the reorganization plan. it is not surprising. however. that in face of the flood of such misinformation many wellmeaning employers have been frightened into aggressively opposing this plan. another item that figured prominently in the testimony was \"suitable work.\" as we all know. an unemployed worker must accept a job. if a suitable one is available. or he may be disqualified from receiving unemployment - compensation benefits. the term \"suitable work\" is found only in state unemploymentcompensation laws. the determination of what constitutes \"suitable work\" is made by state officials in accordance with state laws. state precedents. and state court decisions. what constitutes \"suitable work\" is not subject to the review of any federal agency. and cannot be affected in any way by the reorganization plan. another allegation made repeatedly was that if the united states employment service is located in the united states department of labor employers will lose confidence in the service and will not use the local employment offices. witnesses expressing such fears had a very difficult time explaining their position. first of all. the operating centers of our federalstate employmentservice system are the local employment offices. these offices. where all the activities come to fruition. are supervised and staffed by local officials. who are appointed in accordance with state civilservice laws. these local officials are under the direction of state administrators. who themselves are appointed in accordance with state laws and regulations. if this were not sufficient refutation of the contention that employers will not use the offices. there is the remaining fact that the united states employment service is now. and has been for the 2/2 years since the war. located in the department of labor. and during the time the federal end of the service has been in the united states department of labor the local employment offices have been used more than ever by employers. the most groundless and dangerous of all allegations made by the opponents of the reorganization plan. however. is that the department of labor will be biased in its administration of the federal responsibility for these two programs. not a scintilla of evidence has been presented to support this allegation. the facts are that the administrative agencies responsible for the functions of these programs must. like all other administrative agencies of the federal government. carry out their responsibilities in accordance with the purposes and policies established by the congress. any deviation from this principle would constitute a malfeasance intolerable to our democratic form of government. i label this allegation of bias as dangerous because it strikes at the very foundation of our cabinet system of government. and such allegation is designed to engender a distrust in all government activities. let me now turn for a moment to the fundamental question of the relationship of unemployment compensation and employment service programs to other functions carried on by the federal government. are unemployment compensation activities closely related to other activities carried on in the federal security agency? claim has been made. for example. that there is a close tie between oldage and survivors insurance and the state unemployment compensation programs. oldage and survivors insurance provides a retirement pension for workers who have left the labor market because of old age. unemployment compensation. however. provides earned partial wages for temporarily unemployed workers who remain in the labor market. oldage and survivors insurance is a federal program. unemployment compensation programs are state programs. with federal supervision. the argument that unemployment compensation should remain in the federal security agency because of the possibility of the states enacting temporary disability benefit programs is a non sequitur. the federal government has made no provision for a program for the payment of temporary disability payments. the two states which pay temporary disability benefits have established these programs on their own. the contention that unemployment compensation activities are in some way related to the pure food and drug administration. office of education. eleemosynary institutions. the public health program. and other programs administered by the federal security agency. is too far fetched to merit comment. on the contrary. everyone agrees to the intimate relationship between unemployment compensation and the public employment service. both programs are in turn closely interrelated with other programs located in the united states department of labor. in that department. therefore. these two programs can draw upon the resources and facilities available in the department of labor. and at the same time contribute to the activities and programs of the other bureaus in that department. the activities of the bureau of apprenticeship. the bureau of labor standards. the womens bureau. and the bureau of labor statistics. all deal with related aspects of the problem of maximizing and stabilizing employment. we look in vain for any comparable relationship between the unemployment compensation and employment service programs to other activities carried on by the federal security agency."},{"1":"1947","2":"MUHLENBERG","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. continuing the discussion on the floodcontrol message of the president wednesday about which i spoke to the house briefly yesterday. i note in todays papers that benton stong. who is the selfappointed head of a committee to push for organization of an authoritythis time the missouri valley authorityhas criticized the presidents message on flood control because it assigned engineering details to the corps of engineers of the army. i am sure that in all sincerity he believes he is a better engineer than general wheeler. the present chief of engineers. and could probably conceive a series of dams for holding back floods that would occupy no ground space whatsoever. that he believes he is a better planner than any of the many who collaborated on the present large plan for control and use of the missouriohiomississippi waters. and that he thinks more in terms of national interest than does our president. everyone. in his conceit. is out of step and he alone knows the remedy. well. of course. in lifes problems there are always men of that type. so i advise those to whom guidance is entrusted to bear with him gently in his desire to burst into print. for after all he means well. as a matter of fact. the president has interjected into the discussion of this great problem of controlling and using the water resources of a watershed that drains onethird of the nation. a somewhat new but very constructive note first advocated by my distinguished colleague. representative engel. when he recommended simultaneous interest in both large problems of flood control and small problems of land and water use. i agree thoroughly with the president and the gentleman from michigan . when they say in effect that the single farmer who may have a 200acre farm or a single group which collectively may have 50 farms of that size must alsq be considered and guarded. there is no objection. but. on the other hand much merit in scattering a share of the blessings of public spending for control over local difficulties. if at the same time the overall problem of land and water use is being solved by courageous longrange planning and construction. there will always be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth on the proposed location of a dam. for it is obviously always bottom land and thus rich for cultivation. but this must be discounted in the public interest. and there will always be detractors and men who say they could do it better. preservation of our great resource of topsoil. which when washed away is lost forever. is too important to allow it to flow down the rivers unchecked because someone. sometime. may develop a better plan. let us proceed. backing the presidents plan. authorizing moneys as can be intelligently spent this year. confident that this plan. though by no means either perfect or perfected. is at

welfare."},{"1":"1946","2":"MURDOCK","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. several times while discussing this conference report the gentleman from pennsylvania has implied this money thus appropriated is a sheer waste. as if for unnecessary expenditures. or that such funds should not be spent now. as if the plan is to build immediately in order to create employment. now. i do not know about many of these items. but i do know about one in this list. i have been trying for years to get it done with fear in my heart lest we should not get the protection in time. this construction is not merely to furnish employment. nor is it expenditure of public funds porkbarrel fashion to gain votes. many of these items listed in this conference report must be like the one for arizonanecessary for protection and public safety. i am now referring to the eighth item down. on page 4 of the report. that is for flood protection on the little colorado river at holbrook. ariz. that is a dangerous stream at any place in its course but particularly dangerous at the city of holbrook in northern arizona. on two different occasions in recent years floods have done great damage there and caused loss of life. i called attention of the house to that situation a year ago and earlier. we regarded it a postwar project then only because materials and labor could not be had during the war. the danger was great during the war and is great today. if a flood should occur on the little colorado river at the 3ame time a flood occurs on a tributary entering the little colorado just above holbrook-. the combined floods would be more destructive than any of the others and might entirely destroy that countyseat town. there are other floodcontrol items in arizona which have been examined by the army engineers and reported on. which i hope soon to find in such a report as this. but i will not take time to discuss them here. \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" and a \"stitch in time may save nine\" in regard to the protection offered by this projected engineering work on the little colorado river and many other such streams. let us not delay but carry this work forward at once. its value cannot adequately be measured in money."},{"1":"1945","2":"OCONNOR","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. i have been very much surprised that the war mobilization directors order of last wednesday has not invoked a stronger protest from the agriculturalists of the country than it has. perhaps the multitude of orders and directives recently coming from mr. byrnes office has everyone a bit confused. nevertheless that directive ordering the induction of farm workers in the 1826 age group seems to me to bear close investigation and consideration. only last friday the president told his press conference. that the shipping of food to italy was soon to be materially stepped up with 15 to 29 more ships to be soon devoted to this purpose. and food for italy. of course. is only a drop in the bucket to the needs of our armed forces and the conquered countries and peoples we are feeding and will have to continue to feed. i understand that the proauction of food in europe and australia. whence a very large proportion of the subsistence supplies for the united states armed forces have come. is expected to be materially reduced due to severe floods in europethe worst in 100 years. and severe droughts in australia. wheat production in australia is expected to be less than half of last years crop. which is necessitating the slaughter of large numbers of sheep because of the shortage of fodder. now with no less an authority than paul s. willis. president of the grocery manufacturers of america. stating. as he did in an address in new york he 2d of the month. that the food outlook for 1945 \"is on the lean side\" with \"less meat. butter. .sugar. and certain processed foods\" available. i think it is an illtimed occasion to disrupt and disturb the american farmer who has been producing so well. even if not one single farm hand is taken. the fact that the statement has been made that they are going to be taken will. i think. have the effect of seriously retarding and delaying the planting of muchneeded crops. because no farmer is going to plant something that he might not have the help to harvest. it seems inconsistent to me that the whiskydistilling industry should be given a holiday from the production of war alcohol thereby diverting manpower. materials. and transportation facilities and thereby using up our grain stocks. and at the same time. by this recent directive. embarking on a program which can only further materially lessen those food stock piles. as long as we are determined to be the bread basket of the world. we should protect the source of our supply. the return to rationing of so many food items would suggest to the average layman that more and not less food was in order. if manpower is as seriously needed as mr. byrnes seems to think it is. i would suggest combing the gambling and liquor industries and the many hotel. restaurant. and bar employees. most of whom are ablebodied young men. for additonal manpower. and leave the farmers and livestock producers alone. a warring and working nation needs food. we cannot spare. in my section of the country. any farm help from production of farm and livestock commodities. our help in that regard has been drained white. many farms and livestock. ranches are today being operated and the work done by aged men and women. young children and girls. the aged persons are too old to continue this work. many farms will go idle and production will be decreased if there is any further call for farm help for industrial or army or navy help. the condition on the farms is more serious than anyone could imagine unless they have firsthand information. personally.i own and operate a ranch and small farm. and i have personal knowledge of the situation i am talking about. as well as having seen this condition herein outlined all over my district."},{"1":"1944","2":"ALLEN","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. chairman. one cannot long sit in the house of representatives without an appreciation that we are truly the greatest deliberative body in the democracy of the world. here we meet on common ground to give expression to the needs and will of our people. to adequately fulfill our duties we at times individually come into conflict one with tho other. because the problems of the people we represent so greatly differ. we have heard the gentleman from north dakota state today that the greatest problem confronting his people was lack of water. i come before you emphasizing the fact that the most vital problem immediately confronting the peopfe oi galena. ill.. which is my residence. is too much water at not infrequent times. galena. ill.. has been the scene of devastating floods for over a century. during the past hundred years rushing and uncontrolled waters have rushed down upon its citizens over 15 times. bringing consternation. destruction. and death. citizens have witnessed the business district in complete shambles. business houses which were built for the generations have been compelled to close their doors forever. manufacturing establishments which have given work to many. have had their stczks and machinery ruined. depriving employees of gainful employment for long periods of time. galena. one of illinois oldest cities possessing many historic shrines including general grants home. mecca of hundreds of thousands of tourists from throughout the world was until today uncertain of its future. i say today. because the flood bill now before us carries an authorization of $300.000 to remedy disastrous flood conditions in galena. it is needless for me to say that i am gratified with this degree of consideration because it at least recognizes a situation upon which i have worked untiringly for over 10 years. those of you who have flood problems in your district know the work involved it. order to obtain the necessary legislation. sincerely i express appreciation of the aid and assistance given me by the various members of the flood committee and the corps of engineers. only this morning the chairman of the committee permitted me to appear before his committee and the chief of engineers. regarding the amendment which i have just offered. during my many years in congress i have refrained from offering many amendments. i have held in most instances that the various committees after extensive hearings are in a better position to judge the facts. however. in this particularcase i sincerely believe that i am the better judge. i have lived in that locality practically my entire life. during all those years i have studied this problem which is so vital to the entire community. i know. as no one else here knows. the compelling needs. that is the reason for this amendment. in keeping with an act of congress. the army engineers made a final survey of the galena river for the purpose of submitting plans to remedy the situation. in 1940 the engineers reported several plans. they recommended plan a. which provides for the construction of a system of levees and flood walls with sewer drains and pumping plant. the removal of certain obstructive bridges. and the enlargement and improvement of the channel. the estimated cost to be $418.000. of which the city of galena should assume $118.000. that is the plan embraced in this bill. to me it is definitely insufficient. and that is the reason that i have offered this amendment. in addition to plan a the army engineers also submitted plan b. this b plan is without question the more efficacious. it provides for retention reservoirs at a cost of $2.623.500. of which the united states will pay $2.502.300 and local interests $121.200. i emphasize that this is the most satisfactory plan because. according to the engineers report under plan a. and i quote from the report: it will be noted that plan a does not protect the privately owned westwick foundry on the point of land at the junction of galena river and hughlett branch. or the plant of the galena manufacturing co.. on the east bank of the main stream. just below madison street. nor will it prevent the inundation during major floods of certain small residential areas along the east bank of the river and on the west bank below spring street. to me a job half done is not done at all. it requires a great deal of time and expense for the engineers to become lo.cated. when they are located is it not sensible they complete the job? to provide protection for part of the community and leave the rest unguarded seems impractical to me. and. i am sure. to you. the two factories which are given no protection under plan a are of paramount importance to the workers and to the community. they are the two largest factories in joe daviess county. the livelihood of many depends upon the noninterruption of work in these plants. for years these factories have borne the brunt of many floods. now that we have recognized the need for protection in the locality why not give to all the needed protection? why leave with some the everlasting fear of destruction? i ask you to vote for my amendment."},{"1":"1943","2":"GIBSON","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. chairman. the question before this house is one that goes far beyond the merit or lack of merit in the proposed food subsidy. it jars the foundation of our democracy. it is sowing the pasture for another dictatorial bureau and its many parasites to forage and grow fat upon. at the expense of an overburdened taxpaying public. i am deeply concerned over the concerted efforts that are being exercised toward useless regimentation of our people under the shadow of a purported necessity during this emergency. which has been and is being deliberately taken advantage of to fasten the yoke stronger on a helpless people. if one will only .analyze the abuse of power by the office of price administration it can well be seen why the people are demanding that the congress retake the reins of government. that the rights guaranteed by our constitution may be preserved for our posterity.. there was an actualnecessity for such an organization as the office of price administration. and with the powers given it by congress it had the opportunity to render a great service to our people. instead it has set up a reign of terror and despotism heretofore unknown to a free people. it gloats in the glory of confiscating private property. and running enterprising and honorable american businessmen out of business. all in the name of saving the people from themselves. i could quote many specific instances where their conduct has been such as to make a true patriot wonder to what shores the old ship of state is headed. and in what port she will anchor. time will not permit my going into more than one of these instances. i can give you proof where on an alleged violation of some edict a patriotic businessman. mr. m. m. monroe. of waycross. ga.. was sued for approximately $5.000 in a court 1.300 miles from his home and place of business and the place where the alleged infraction of regulations was committed. this party. knowing that.he had committed no wrong and that he did not .owe his government anything. prepared to defend himself in said action. one of the army of lawyers paid from the tax money of the people. mr. levenson. of boston. mass.. in conference with this defendant and his counsel advised the defendant if he defended himself in this case and did not settle it he was preparing to bring many more such actions against him in different sections of the country and would keep on until he broke him. all in the name of democracy. this party paid up and stated he was going out of business for the duration. his business was essential to our war effort. but he was literally run out of business by one mad with power and drunk with the desire to regiment. yes. hurdle. pen up. push around. and abuse people. the conduct of this bunch is enough to make the colors run from the flag that stands for justice and equality of mankind. they are running rampant over the country and have the people bewildered with orders. directives. rules. and regulations that they themselves do not understand. the country is working alive with their regimentators from border to border and from coast to coast. i wish the people of the nation. and especially of my district. could come to washington and look through the offices from end to end of long corridors and see the thousands upon thousands of employees of the office of price administration waxing fat off their tax moneys. who are responsible for the reign of terror that they have brought down on an already burdened populace. while on the question of food. let me say that if the thousands on top of thousands of their emissaries in the field work throughout the united states and the thousands on top of thousands on the public pay rolls here were put to work producing food. we would be faced with a surplus. my time will not permit going into statistics to argue the fallacy of this subsidy program. the subject is so elementary. however. that it requires only sober thought of a reasonably intelligent person to shoot any argument for a producer subsidy full of holes. it is no complicated question. it has been amazing to me to notice how the reds. radicals. and crackpots here who sponsor such programs attempt to accomplish their wild aims. they take a subject as simple and as unsupported by merit and fact as this subsidy question and first shroud it in a cloak of purity and then parade it in the shadows of deep mystery in the hope of confusing and bewildering the congress. if possible. to such degree that they will in hopeless despair support it. and if congress does not support it that they may so mesmerize the thinking public that -their confusion will cause them to condemn the congress for not accepting the yoke and bowing to the demands of these star gazers here in washington who are determined to chart and direct the course of the american people. i ask the membership of this house to come from under the haze of the smoke screen created by philip murray. the administration leadership. and the communist press who have formed and sponsored this damnable piece of legislation. it is unthinkable to know that this legislation has been sponsored by the radical element of this country who have been responsible for the exorbitant wages being paid industrial workers who are now drawing twelve and fifteen dollars\" per day. they demand higher wages one day and are granted it. as in the case of the coal miners. and the next day call on the taxpayers of america to pay their grocery bills. and yet we have members on the floor of this house who will use every means at their command to saddle that expense on a helpless. taxpaying public. you have not heard one cry from the millions of wage .earners who have not received any in.crease in -wages through all of this .spiral trend calling for subsidies. it comes from those who are responsible for the heavy taxes we are paying today. there is one reference i would like to make that is fundamentally sound in analyzing the merits and demerits of this legislation. it will be found in the holy writ that you can judge a tree by the fruit it bears. i call upon the membership of this house and the people of this nation to judge the office of price administration by the fruit it has borne. a few months ago. the great saviors of the american people put forth a rollback program. which they- were given the privilege to try. i could give -you many instances of its ill and destructive effects. but will only call attention to the fact that it has caused the slaughter of hundreds of herds of milk cows throughout the united states right at & time that we face a milk famine. it has prevented thousands upon thousands of beef cattle from being fed and thereby providing millions of pounds of extra beef for the consuming public. which also applies to hogs. i can cite you one instance where dennis adams. an enterprising. thrifty. and hardworking small farmer in my home county. bought on the livestock market in my home town of douglas. ga.. on august 17. 1943. six feeders of the total weight of 1.385 pounds for the sum of $173.17. on the 12th day of october 1943. after approximately 2 months of careful feeding. he sold the same six cows on the same market. and they weighed 1.665 pounds. a gain of 280 pounds. besides the fact that they were bought thin and sold fat. they brought him only $144.86. a net loss. besides the worth of his feed and time hauling and taking care of said cattle. of $28.31. it could safely be said that he lost at least $75 in his patriotic effort to help produce food. i ask some members of this house to tell me who got this money. to whom did this advantage go? how are you going to justify this kind of regimentation and confiscation of property? if any of you have the temerity to claim that anyone profited by this confiscation of this mans property except the middleman. you would have to say it was- some of john lewis or philip murrays legion who are shutting down war industries and living off the fat of the land while they walk in idleness about the streets of the communities in which they enjoy the freedom of a democracy being protected by the blood of the youth of this nation. the fact is that no one but the middleman profited. i have a family and it is necessary to make weekly purchases of their food and we have not enjoyed onetenth of 1 percent reduction in any meat prices. nor has anyone else. this in the face of the fact that millions of dollars of the taxpayers money has been used to set up another bureau with its many parasites to prey on the working people of this country. the sponsors of this measure are so inconsistent that it all but causes us to lose confidence in human beings and human reasoning. i had one sponsor of subsidies tell me that a plain example of the merits of the subsidy program is that we produce about 20 percent of our sugar. and by the use of subsidies that only our producers would benefit. but if we permitted an increase in consumer prices then the foreign countries who produce 80 percent would then profit likewise. i reminded him that \"this is your argument on this measure. in the next breath you will be calling on the congress to appropriate billions for lendlease from which you will send these very countries. that you do not want to enjoy the increase in prices.. millions of dollars of lendlease goods such as silk hose. lipstick. rouge. and other weapons of war of this nature. i ask you to remember who said: consistency. thou art a jewel.\" it is so childish. so ridiculous and so destructive to think of the real effect of this purported legislation that i am caused to tremble in fear of what lies ahead for this nation unless those in charge of its destiny revert to more sober thinking. we had the treasury department to call on us to saddle onto the taxpaying public an additional ten and onehalf billion dollars in taxes. based on the argument that there is so much surplus money that it is necessary to levy such an excessive tax to siphon off the surplus money in the consumers pockets to prevent inflation. in the next breath we are urged by the same source to vote millions of dollars that this same bunch may pay the grocery bills of the consuming public because prices are beyond their means to meet. it will take someone with a mind like a jigsaw puzzle to convince any soberminded human being of any consistency between the two positions. at this point i would like to ask when god in his infinite powers will bring sober thinking back to the directing powers in washington. the purpose seems to be to. by any means. get control of the entire income of the american public that it may be wasted. spent. and scrambled for any purposes that this wild bunch may conceive in their dreams and imagination of that realm of utopia in which they yet seem to think that the american people are going to live under their plan. the effect of their overall proposal would be to take in taxes from a man with a net income of. we will say. $5.000. an extra sum of approximately$1.000. and i know and you know that he would not be saved. under the most liberal construction of the result of the program. more than one or two hundred dollars in the course of a year on his purchases. this is about as consistent. however. as the general financing of the governments business has been over the past few years. i want to say to you members who brand yourselves as liberals that you with other powers at work in this country may break down the system of government we and our forefathers have enjoyed. you may destroy at home the very thing that the youth of this nation are dying on foreign battlefields to preserve. and in their absence. but let me take this opportunity to thank god almighty. from whom all wisdom and justice comes. that when it is done the pages of the procedure of the national congress will never show my name as being one who joined hands with the communists. radicals. and other crackpots of this country in its destruction. i accept as the greatest privilege that a kind providence has given me to know that in the pages of history yet to be written my children will never be able to point to the fact that their father helped to destroy the america that the patriots of old gave their property and lives to build. i sometimes wonder how you can face the fathers and mothers who have given from their bosom their first love to go abroad and fight for you and for me when you know that you are saddling onto them a national debt of destruction for them to try to pay by their labor when they return from the bloodstained and smokecolored battlefields of terror where they have left so many of their comrades to sleep through the years under a tomb resting on foreign soil and kissed at night by a foreign moon."},{"1":"1942","2":"RICH","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"i would love to yield to the gentleman. but i do not have the time. if you put this money for vocational education into your schools and teach these peoplethey have the facilities. and they can get highschool educationsyou will save every dollar. and you can eliminate the w. p. a. organization entirely. and that $35.000.000 can be extended to vocational education in the schools. and the money will be more wisely and more judiciously spent. it is very important that we eliminate a lot of these unnecessary expenses. if you want the people of this country to become wholeheartedly 100 percent for this war effort. and that is the great effort that confronts you and me. the american people are faced with the ordeal of fighting the axis at all corners of the earth. from here to australia it is 12.000 miles. and from here to japan. 9.000 miles. that is a terrible distance. and it is going to cost millions and billions of dollars. and we ought to conserve everything we can. we ought to take these people on the w. p. a. projects and put them back on the farms. where they can help the farmers who need labor today. and where their labor will count to the best advantage. then we will cut out this overhead. you know that 5 percent or more of this bill is for overhead. that can be eliminated. let those fellows who are looking after w. p. a. goout and earn an honest dollar by doing something wisely and judiciously. i take this occasion. mr. chairman. to call to the attention of the congress and the country two bills which are now before the house committee on the civil service. which. in my opinion. demonstrate how completely this administration is failing to put first things first in the winning of this war. i refer to h. r. 7144 and h. r. 7071. by the gentleman from georgia . the new democratic whip of the house. both of which are intended to provide juicy salary grabs for workers in the army of bureaucracy while the men who are fighting the battles of democracy all over the world are cheerfully giving their all that america may survive. mr. chairman. it is with the fervent hope that the house committee on the civil service. which recommended the illadvised bill to pension congressmen. will not again recommend preferential legislation for a favored few that i call attention to these grabbag bills at this time. h. r. 7071 provides for a fiat increase of $25 per month in the salaries of all civilian employees of the united states government for the duration of this war and for 6 months thereafter. h. r. 7144 provides for the payment of time and a half for all government civilian employees for the duration and for 6 months thereafter. provided their total annual income does not thereby exceed $3.800 per annum. both of these bills are unjustifiable and indefensible at a time when our nation is at war. when our ways and means committee cannot even find tax revenues to pay the colossal expenses of war. and when hundreds of thousands of small business men. salesmen. teachers. professional people. and ordinary taxpaying citizens are finding their incomes seriously reduced by the economic consequences of the war. mr. chairman. are we to set up an aristocracy of government in america? are we to create an entrenched army of bureaucracy which is to be safeguarded against all sacrifice and to be surfeited with favors while the soldiers and sailors of america and their fathers and mothers outside of government service are making sacrifice after sacrifice? by what logic or reason does the civil service committee of this house contend that those who work in safe and secure government positions. far. from scenes of danger. and frequently in aizconditioned offices here in washington. should be given juicy bonuses at this time when so many americans in private life are having their incomes severely reduced and their taxes sharply raised? if this congress is to secure and retain the confidence and respect of the people of america. we must resist the selfish pressure groups now flooding us with telegrams and letters asking us to vote these increased salaries and overtime payments to the bureaucrats. surely there is no easier way to start the spiral of inflation than for the government to set the pace by giving $300 per year salary increases to those who serve in safety and security and who are today undergoing neither the physical danger of battle. nor the economic hazards of a wartime economy. such a blanket increase in pay would stimulate labor unions to ask for additional benefits. and they could not be blamed for asking for themselves what the government would be giving to its selected servants. mr. chairman. the boys at bataan and the heroes of corregidor did not ask for time and a half while fighting to their last ounce of strength for uncle sam. millions of american men and boysare working far into the night..day after day. wearing the colors of american uniforms and fighting in this war of survival. hundreds of thousands of american businessmen are finding their inventories frozen and their shops and stores closed. millions of citizens are sacrificing and economizing to pay their rapidly increasing taxes. surely this is no time to vote away big sums of the taxpayers money to give pay increases to the vast army of civilian government employees who already are the envy of many americans who work much longer hours for much smaller rates of pay. the office of price administration has fixed the cost of living. rents are fixed. food prices are fixed. prices of clothing and transportation are fixed. by what logic then would those who now propose to reward these bureaucrats with rich war bonuses defend such salary increases? a far more appropriate type of legislation would be a bill to reduce the salaries of government favorites by 5 or 10 percent for the duration in order to help get the dollars needed to buy the bullets to whip the axis. definitely this is no time to vote salary increases to americas army of entrenched bureaucrats."},{"1":"1941","2":"MCCORMACK","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. i want to call to the attention of the house the stupendous construction program that we have imposed upon the war and navy departments to carry into operation. if this resolution is adopted. and i urge that it be adopted. i know these standing committees of the house named in the resolution will take into consideration the tremendous task these departments have had imposed upon them. i call attention to the fatt that during the world war. 1918 and 1919. the estimated cost of construction in the war department was $925.951.971. in the period from 1920 to 1927 relatively small appropriations were made for new construction work. during 1937 and 1938and the figures will be in the recordthe total amount was $191.750.738.93. period 1927 to 1938 1927 ----------------------- $8.010.000.00 1928 ------------------------ 6.029. 000. 0 1929 ------------------------ 14. 515.555.04 1930 ----------------------- 16. 407. 812.69 1931 ----------------------- 17. 852. 734.41 1932 ----------------------- 21.594.605. 72 1933 ----------------------- 10. 088. 325.74 1934 ---------------------52. 773.422.95 .1935 ----------------------2.756. 828.00 1936 ------------------------ 17.924.440.62 1937 ------------------------ 8.396. 537.05 1938 ------------------------ 15.407.476.71 during the period 1939 to 1941 the present estimated cost of the program now under way is $1.229.712.987. to this it is expected will shortly be added the sum of $900.000.000 to provide new plants. new storage. and additional facilities. the present construction program dwarfs that of the world war period of 191819 both in magnitude and speed of accomplishment. when the armistice was signed on november 11. 1918. 18 months after the united states entered the war. that construction program was not completed. in the united states only 66 projects were completed and 172 were discontinued when hostilities ceased. the present construction program lists at this time 256 projects with additional ones planned for the immediate future. only 6 months have passed since september. when large appropriations for construction first became available. of the 256 projects mentioned above. 32 have now been completed. 207 are under construction and on only 17 has actual field construction not started but plans for their construction are well under way. every soldier who was scheduled by the war department to be under arms today is housed more adequately than have been the soldiers of any army in history and. moreover. there are surplus accommodations now available for 285.000 more who will soon join the colors. the record of accomplishment during the 6 months that the present construction program has been in force is astounding in comparison with that of the 18 months of the world war period which has always been pointed to as bordering on the miraculous. public sentiment toward the necessity for national preparedness was not aroused until the present european war was several- months old and then public opinion changed virtually overnight. action was demanded immediately and a tremendous burden was suddenly thrust on the departments concerned with national defense. these departments. organized on a routine peacetime basis. had to suddenly expand and reorganize to undertake the largest preparedness program in the history of the nation. funds were made available in september of 1940. permitting little if any time for proper planning or organization for the work. a program for induction of trainees and for calling the national guard and the reserves to active duty was decided upon. the urgency with which these had to be put in training necessitated the prosecution of an emergency construction program to accommodate them. in effect many large camp cities housing from 10.000 to 60.000 people had to be constructed in the seemingly impossible period of a few months. speed was essential and at the start of the program had to be an important governing consideration. the enormous program which was suddenly thrust on the country required sudden expansion of forces handling construction. not only in the government departments. but also among civilian construction companies and firms supplying materials and equipment. this sudden expansion created a temporary shortage of qualified supervisory and other key personnel. adding to the difficulties of organization and expansion to meet the situation. many of the contractors for construction and engineering firms which had the necessary qualifications. equipment. experience. and assets to handle the large projects of the construction program were already engaged and had to expand to carry on additional work. few. if any. contractors in the nation had had experience in carrying on projects at the speed required. and in order to bring their organizations up to the required tempo there was considerable waste in both labor and materials before the organizations began operating in an easy and economical marner. there was a marked shortage of labor in the skilled crafts at certain locations throughout the country. this was particularly true of qualified carpenters. plumbers. steamfitters. sheetmetal workers and electricians. as a result of the unprecedented demand for lumber and lumber products for the construction program. all available materials were consumed and it became necessary at an early date to use lumber which was often not properly seasoned and in many cases might not have been considered as conforming to specifications. but which. due to the urgency of the situation. was accepted and used in structures. this great demand has been the cause of considerable delay in practically all projects. and if a supply of quality material had been available the resulted construction would have been better than that which has been obtained. the delivery of furnaces and other heating units required for the camp cantonments has resulted in a serious bottle neck which has caused many material delays. if it had been possible to have delivered these units to the project in small increments. in order that the mechanical trades could install them. rather than to have deliveries in a bunch right at the deadline. saving could have been made and many projects completed at an earlier date due to the inability to secure sufficient skilled craftsmen to install the units over a short period of time. the projects in the construction program were located at sites. the selection of which was governed by military requirements and necessity. in many cases these sites were isolated and at a distance from labor and material markets. transportation facilities were lacking and had to be constructed. virgin forests had to be cleared. water supply had to be developed. and. in short. wilderness areas with no facilities had to be developed into livable cities. with all essential facilities and many modern conveniences and comforts. large appropriations for the construction program were made available on september 24. 1940. in spite of the long hours of work and stupendous efforts to get the program under way as soon as money became available. it was humanly impossible to avoid the necessity of prosecuting a large proportion of the work throughout the winter months. this is. in general. the poorest season of the year for outside construction work. at many locations where large projects were in progress unusually bad weather was experienced during this last winter. heavy rains flooded some areas. completely stopping work. other areas were turned into seas of mud. making transportation about them virtually impossible. cold weather and snows at northern locations materially reduced the efficient prosecution of the work. so far as the navy department is concerned most of us are inclined to think of the united states navy in terms of ships and aircraft. but there has to be a large supporting shore establishment to make those ships and aircraft function with the maximum effectiveness in battle. any expansionand this information i have received from the navy department. i rely upon it and know it to be correct. and i agree with itany expansion in the fighting forces must be accompanied by a parallel expansion in the shore establishment needed to maintain and operate those forces and to recruit. train. and house the personnel who man them. all of the shore establishments are designed. built. and in many cases operated by the bureau of yards and docks of the navy department. the work of this bureau along with all other branches of the navy has expanded tremendously under the impulse of the nationaldefense program. to illustrate: during the period from june 1. 1940. to april 2. 1941. 10 months. they have awarded $520.000.000 worth of publicworks contracts. the magnitude of this load in comparison with past records can be seen from the fact that from july 1. 1916. to december 1. 1937. a period of 21 years. the total contract awards were only $362.000.000. and this included the period of the world war. in other words. the bureau contracted for $158.000.000 more in 10 months than during the whole 21year period. but awarding contracts is not an indication of whether the work is being accomplished. a measure of accomplishment is the rate at which the money is being expended for labor and material. let us examine into that phase. during june 1940. the cash disbursements of the bureau amounted to $7.452.000. these disbursements increased rapidly so that 6 months later. in january 1941. the expenditure was $37.000.000 and it is now estimated that the cash disbursements for the fiscal year 1941 will approach $400.000.000. the record of specific accomplishments is equally impressive. i am particularly pleased with the performance on the construction of the new air bases. last saturday. february 15. the new base at kaneohe bay. hawaii. was placed in commission. the contract was awarded in august 1939. and the work was scheduled for completion in august 1942. the station at corpus christi. tex.. which will cost $28.000.000 for the initial development. was commissioned on march 12. the contract was awarded in july of last year. and the time for construction estimated at 30 months. similar progress has been made at jacksonville. norfolk. quonset point. puerto rico. alaska. and a number of other bases. other activities of the bureau involve the provision of shipbuilding and shiprepair facilities. fleet facilities. storage structures. marine corps stations. ordnance depots. personnel structures. defense housing. hospitals. radio stations. power plants. and laboratories. progress comparable to that on the air bases has been made on all of these programs. the total of which for the current fiscal year amounts to $518.000.000. the accomplishments of the bureau of yards and docks can be attributed to a number of factors. as follows: (a) much of the work has been planned long in advance and standard designs are available. (b) highly trained nucleus personnel were on hand. (c) the use of outside engineers and architects has made available a great reservoir of engineering and architectural talent throughout the country. (d) the use of fixedfee contracts has enabled the navy to initiate the work rapidly and to prosecute it energetically. (e) by decentralizing the work and placing full responsibility on the officers in charge of local activities most of the red tape has been eliminated and delays avoided. (f) lastand most importanta spirit of loyalty. cooperation. enthusiasm. and pride in the work has been developed among the engineers. contractors. and government representatives. all of whom are working together as partners to accomplish a vital nationaldefense effort. the use of fixedfee contracts for this highspeed program has played an important part in the success to date. for the first three of these contracts. awarded in 1938 by the navy department. the law permitted the payment of a fee up to 10 percent. the bureau negotiated these contracts. amounting to $54.900.000. for a fee of 5.72 percent. or about onehalf of the maximum allowable. the work was located in the western pacific. alaska. and puerto rico. and was of the most difficult character. for the next group of contracts. the law permitted a maximum of 6 percent and the bureau has. to date. negotiated these contracts. amounting to $350.800.000. for 4.57 percent. or about twothirds of the maximum allowable. all fees are fixed. that is. regardless of how much the work actually costs. the contractor gets the same amount. so he is not tempted to increase the cost of the work. the bureau has not discontinued awarding contracts by competitive bidding. on the contrary. whenever increases in cost and time will not result. the bureau prefers the competitive bidding method. since july 1. 1940. the bureau has awarded 289 contracts amounting to over $28.000.000 by competitive bidding. recently. however. it has become increasingly difficult to obtain competitive bids on difficult and longterm work except at exorbitant prices. because of the uncertainties of the future. in some cases. no bids are received for work which would ordinarily be much sought after. the bureau is to be particularly commended for its work on the housing program. since october 1. 1940. the bureau has contracted for 17.055 housing units at an average cost for land. houses. and utilities of about $3.100. already about 2.000 of these units are occupied. and the entire program will be completed and the houses occupied by july of this year. the present resolution is intended in the spirit of collaboration with and for the purpose of constructive criticism and suggestions wherever warranted. you will note the resolution calls for study and investigation. this resolution has properly been drawn to express the spirit of the house to the committees named inthe resolution to collaborate with the power to investigate. when and where necessary. the word \"study\" is used before the word \"investigate.\" that is as it should be. that is as intended to show the spirit and intent of cooperation and collaboration. it is also wise that the standing committees of the house acquainted with the problems of these departments have been designated in the pending resolution. both chairmen are able. sincere. and courageous members of the house who have proven their worth through years of service and experience. the members of those committees. representing both parties in the house. are also gentlemen of ability. of sincerity. and of courage. the members of both committees are aware of the problems that confront both departments in the carrying out of the stupendous task imposed upon them. the members of the committees designated are also aware of the danger of having officers performing important nationaldefense duties subjected to continuous attendance before the committees. or subjected to fear of an investigation based. upon the theory that something must be developed of a sensational nature. and the reputation of someone smeared in order that the appetite of some may be satisfied. i know these committees will perform the task imposed upon them in the manner intended by the congress and will perform their duty always in the spirit of collaboration with these two departments to the end that the great nationaldefense program imposed upon these departments will be carried out in confidence and in trust. with the spirit of confidence and trust existing between the committees and the war and navy departments. with the departments cooperating with the committees. the important work of the departments will be more effectively carried out."},{"1":"1940","2":"Unknown","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"(reading) : \"all laborers and mechanics employed in the

the hearings on s. 4039 before the senate committee on irrigation and reclamation. i desire to obtain from you confirmation of the following interpretation of the statement you made to the committee. you stated that the san juan river is an important tributary of the colorado river and that the san juan is the only stream tributary to the colorado which can be used to advantage in the state of new mexico under the terms of the colorado river compact. you also stated that the san juan. through the proposed transmountain diversion in the chama. is the only source through which the deficiency in the water supply of the middle rio grande valley can be supplemented. you agreed that a portion of the flow of the san juan could be diverted for the relief of the rio grande valley and that another part of the flow of the san juan could be used beneficially by the landowners of san juan and adjacent counties in new mexico. including the navajo tribe of indians. you stated that. aside from the information compiled during the joint rio grande investigation. no intensive study of the san juanchama project had been made until an appropriation of $50.000 became recently available. you stated that the projects on the san juan river. being the only ones through which the state of new mexico could possibly. profit under the terms of the colorado river compact. would be given early priority and their investigation would be carried to completion as soon as the investigation fund accruing under section 2 (d) of s. 4039 became available to the reclamation service. i understand this statement to be a pledge by the commissioner of reclamation that. as soon as the abovementioned fund becomes available. he will allocate a sufficient sum. estimated to be not less i than $50.000. for the completion of the chamasan juan investigation and that additional sums will be immediately available for the initiation and completion of an investigation of a project for the storage and distribution of san juan floodwaters for the benefit i of the residents and landowners of san juan and adjacent counties.: including the navajo tribe of indians. i would appreciate the favor if you

philippine islands during the years 1937 and 1938. and the philippines and cuba during 1939 and 1940. in order to add to the quotas of the cane areas in continental united states. and especially in order to add to the florida quota. as i explained the existing situation in florida yesterday. we cannot proceed upon a historical basis for this reason: the everglades at one time were subject to flood. we finally drained the area by the combined effort of the federal government and local enterprise. and turned the everglades into one of the greatest caneproducing areas in the world. however. just about the time the plantations were getting in good shape the quota system went into effect. and 5.000 acres were taken out of cultivation. the largest single check issued for production restriction in continental united states went to the caneproducing people of this section. i understand the argument made today by those who do not want to disturb hawaii and puerto rico. so i have taken amounts from the philippines and from cuba in order that we may have a chance to produce in our own state. an infant industry is begging for the opportunity to expand. to expand economically. and to employ american labor with the payment of decent wages. the minimum wage is $2.70. plus housing. lights. and so forth. i am pleading today that this vast area. developed in part through federal

l"},{"1":"1936","2":"SISSON","3":"E","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. early this year. and even before that. i began to receive letters asking me if the canadian trade agreement would not ruin this country. particularly its dairy farmers. lately i have heard increasing rumors that it was sure to do that. naturally. being vitally concerned in the matter. i looked into it. the gist of the rumor is that canada now is being allowed to flood this country with fluid cream in almost unrestrained competition with our own american dairy farmers. that is very far from the truth. the persons originating this rumor are seeking opportunity again to betray our farmers and our milk producers on the altar of high tariff for their own favored industries. the same special interests that made a mockery of our domestic form of government in the hectic twenties. the total amount of cream which canada is allowed to ship into this country under the trade pact figures out to slightly more than onetenth of a gallon per capita. a little over onetenth of a gallon a year per consumer. and on each and every gallon canadian producers send here they must pay a tariff rate almost twice as high as the rate they paid until 1930. furthermore. the present quota permits them to sell us only about onethird as much fluid cream \"as they sold us each year between 1923 and 1928. the story behind these littleknown facts is simple. until 1909 there was not any such thing as a tariff on canadian cream. that year we established a 5cent duty on each gallon. two years later. though. that was rescinded. and from 1911 until 1921 canadian cream was shipped in duty free. in 1921 the 5cent tariff was reestablished. and a year later it was raised to 20 cents a gallon. in 1930. however. the cream tariff was jacked up to no less than fiftysix and a half cents a gallon. now. some of us thought that that would be a fine thing for the dairy farmers. a very fine thing. indeed. but subsequent developments proved quite the opposite. a cream tariff was needed. but 56 cents was too high. as it turned out. between 1922 and 1928 canadians shipped into this country an average of 4.400.000 gallons of cream each year. now. under the new trade pact. they must pay a tariff of 35 cents a gallon and their quota is only 1.500.000 gallons. on all cream over that figure they must pay the 56 -cent rate. this rate has proved to be virtually prohibitive. so the \"flood\" in the light of these facts dwindles down to a mere trickle. only enough to lubricate the vastly important machinery of canadaamerican trade. it so happens that canada is uncle sams very best customer. and usually buys more than she sells.. naturally when we hiked our tariffs. some of them by more than 100 percent. in 1930 our canadian trade immediately dropped to less than half of its previous volume. between 1922 and 1930 canadians bought about $5.000.000.000 worth of goods per year from america. when our high tariffs went into effect the canadians cut their buying from us sharply. the figure for 1932 was only a little more than a billion and a half. uncle sam was trying to charge his best customer admission to his store. naturally. coming almost simultaneously with the general depression. the huge reduction in canadian purchases from this country hurt each and every one of us more than we shall ever be able to realize. when the milliondollar orders stopped coming from our cousins to the north. american workmen were thrown out of jobs by the hundreds and thousands. grass could not grow in our streets because of the jobless men tramping up and down them in search of work. and as our unemployment lists mounted toward the twentymillion mark. our american dairy farmers found themselves able to dispose of less and less cream each week at lower and lower prices. it is all too obvious now that we were trying to eat our canadian cake and have it. too. to the surprise of some. we shortly began to realize that we could not do that. we had climbed up to the top of the tariff ladder and found that we were much too high to be able to reach the fruits of international trade. so. the reciprocal trade treaty policy was evolved as the most natural. if not the only practical. solution to our pressing problem. the figures show that less than a pint of cream per person is allowed to come in from canada under the 35cent tariff rate. to this rate add the additional transportation costs. and we find our own dairy farmers more than adequately protected from canadian imports. now let us seq about the matter of cheese. i have heard it rumored that canadian cheese is about to ruin our american cheese industry. as a matter of fact we eat almost no imported cheese. canadian or otherwise. and heres how the tariff situation on cheese stands under the new trade treaty: if canadian producers are willing to sell their cheese to us for 20 cents per pound or less. then they can ship it in but they must pay a 5cent tariff on each and every pound of it. if they want more than 20 cents. they must pay a higher tariff. this rate leaves little if any profit for the importer. so we can still expect almost no cheese from canada. the minimum cheese tariff of 5 cents represents a reduction of only 2 cents from the 7cent rate which was effective from 1930 through 1935. as i previously mentioned. our cheese imports are negligible. of all the cheese consumed in this country. only 2 percent is made elsewhere. and many years we export more than we import. so it becomes apparent that our cream producers--whether their cream is to be sold as such or made into cheesehave absolutely nothing to fear from the canadiais. and there can be no doubt as to the material benefits from the muchmaligned trade treaty. the figures on this matter are available to everyone. and are quite worthy of the attention of those interested in the welfare of the american dairy farmer. and these figures inescapably indicate that the canadian trade pact. with its 35cent tariff and its low cream quota. cannot fail to aid our dairymen as well as the nation as a whole."},{"1":"1935","2":"MANSFIELD","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. under the leave to extend my remarks in the record. i include the following address of hon. george h. dern. secretary of war. at the annual banquet of the national rivers and harbors congress. mayflower hotel. washington. d. c.. may 2. 1935: i have come to discuss our most vital national resourcewater. i have come to speak to a body of nonpartisan patriots. determined that our water resources shall be of maximum benefit to our country and contribute to the fullest extent to the wellbeing of its citizens. i have come as the sixtyninth head in lineal succession of one of the three original great government departments. and the one to which major waterway improvements have always been intrusted. to pledge the utmost in enlightened and energetic prosecution of waterway affairs. i have come to repeat publicly my pledge to the president that as my department has been first in war. so it is ready to be first in peacethe spearhead of his drive to eliminate unemployment through the improvement of those water resources which govern all life. and which. of necessity. must be the focal point around which other forms of improvement must be grouped. we have the plans for the work and the engineers to execute it. i have come as secretary of war and as an individual. to express my faith in waterway improvements. not merely as a means for relieving unemployment and for reviving the heavy industries. but as a sound addition to our capital equipment. to strengthen our economic structure and to promote social development. from the earliest ages. waterways have had a critical influence on the development of civilization and the spread of culture. economic expansion has followed them. from the time. in 1607. when the godspeed. the susan constant. and the discovery sailed up the james river with the dauntless and intrepid band of settlers who founded our country. from the time a few years later when the mayflower. with its cargo of inspired pioneers first spread its sails in massachusetts bay. our civilization has followed our waterways. even in the conquest of the western plains and mountains. prairie schooners set out only when navigation could be pushed no further inland. and our streams carried our prospectors into the heart of alaska. only with a highly developed and efficient transportation system can a powerful and reliable economic structure be erected and maintained. our waterways are arteries of such a system. through our ports come rubber. tin. textiles. spices. machinery. and inventions of other lands which go to make a fuller and better life. and out of them go those products. such as cotton. wheat. cattle. oil. and manufactured articles. on the production of which whole sections of our country depend. the great rivers with which we are blessed reach inland with their commerce. i sometimes wonder whether our great cities. with their present manifold activities. realize that the waterways have made them what they are. and recognize the important part in the c6ntinued growth of those cities which improved waterways have played. the truth of this statement with respect to the great eastern seaboard cities. and in regard to the large cities on the gulf and on the pacific coast. is perhaps apparent. but how much credit do the waterways receive for the development and continued prosperity of such inland cities as pittsburgh. chicago. st. louis. cincinnati. st. paul. duluth. detroit. memphis. sacramento. and many others? costly forms of transportation in the interior have placed that region at a disadvantage with the coast. and the scope of its economic effort has been curtailed. the farmer pays for the transportation of his products. and he has been paying for this interior disadvantage by the sweat of his brow. the manufacturer has been forced to the seaboard by high freight rates. thus retarding industrial development in the midst of our greatest agricultural area. i like to think of the great mississippi not as a dividing line between the east and the west. but as a broad artery of trade connecting the great lakes and the gulf. with arms in the ohio and tennessee reaching to the alleghenies. and in the missouri and arkansas tapping the fertile western plains and the slopes of the rockiesa real bond and link between east and west. north and south. rather than a barrier. within a few miles of the capitol are communities which are almost wholly dependent on waterways for their transportation. and for an outlet to their markets. to deprive our country of its water transportation would paralyze trade and would wholly change our commercial structure. to fail to forge ahead in their improvement or to keep pace with modern requirements would be a breach of public trust. our federal government is alone empowered to make a comprehensive development of our waterways. it recognizes its responsibilities to the people. let not selfish interests seek to undermine the edifice which has been erected in our waterway transportation system. as worms boring within the timbers of a ship eventually destroy it. our streams are important not alone as carriers of commerce. even the most hardened of us must drink water occasionally. the general excellence of our water supplies has made for a healthy country. and made possible the concentration of population we now have. our sanitary engineers are world leaders in their field. and the water works of this country. of which there are good examples here. are unsurpassed. water is a dynamic resource. our coal and oil may become exhaustedalready this is predictedbut the waters will flow forever. water power turned the grist mills which ground our fathers wheat and corn. water power developed the factories of new england. the textile industry of the south. hydroelectric development now permits a diversification of the benefits of stream flow far from the stream itself. and in some places is the solo reliance of a considerable population for light. heat. and power. our resources in hydro power are unexcelled and only partly developed. our use of these resources is abreast or ahead of world progress. in the far west are regions where the soil is richer. deeper. and more productive than almost anywhere else in the united states. but where nature has been niggardly in providing the lifegiving water to make things grow. where there is no water there is no life. such spots are a challenge to mans ingenuity in conducting water from afar. he has responded magnificently. and great valleys that were once deserts are now a countryside of smiling fields and orchards. with progressive american communities that form an important market for the products of eastern manufacturing centers. irrigation is a sound national policy. and is generally practiced where the people do not know the meaning of the words \"marginal \" or \" submaginal \" as applied to land. the development of larger areas may logically be expected. to meet the demands of an expanding or shifting population. nature. not always kind in furnishing water. sometimes provides it in too great abundance. in these localities. the fertility of the soil is such that venturesome man invades the regions despite the risk. and hence engineering works of the first magnitude have been required. to save for the nation those farm lands so necessary for our growing population. and those commercial centers so essential as a market for raw materials and manufactured products. and when there is the use of lakes and streams for recreational purposes. we are just beginning to learn that those who live the strenuous life must play a little now and then. to furnish the people recreational facilities is a public responsibility and function. by the same token. stream pollution likewise becomes a public problem. and it is one that wo ought to face right away. if proof is necessary. i have said enough to convince even a skeptic that water controls our civilization. what is to be the future of our waterways? in considering this. it should be profitable to review briefly some notable achievements of the past. no doubt. the chief of engineers and others who will address you will give details of the work of the war department which will be of intense interest to you. what i wish to do is merely to call attention. in broad outline. to some major accomplishments. when your organization was formed in 1901. at the dawn of this century. works for the improvement of our rivers and harbors had progressed from the first few modest undertakings designed to provide for the small carriers in use during the early history of the republic. to more ambitious and extensive projects in keeping with the requirements of modern shipping and the technical progress which had been made since the days of george washington and his potowmack and james canals. the work had been done progressively and as any prudent individual would conduct his own affairsaccording to reasonably prospective needs and the condition of his finances. where life and health were involved. especially. consideration was given to worthy projects. as ambitious as some of these projects were for their time. they seem small when viewed in retrospect. up to 1900. the war department had expended some $313.000.000 on waterway improvements. and the total appropriations available for expenditure by the department during that year did not reach $19.000.000. a sum less than now available to a single engineer district. with the improvement in our transportation system. some of the earlier projects were outmoded. whilst others were fast becoming more important. and the needs of navigation insistently. demanded their enlargement. let us glance for a moment at the record of the last 35 years on this. your thirtieth meeting and your thirtyfifth birthday. since your association was formed. the panama canal was begunand completed as an american undertakinga truly magnificent achievement that stirs the pride of every american. taken up where others had failed. the work was pushed brilliantly to completion. and has become a model of engineering organization and achievement which the whole world acclaims. the work on the atlantic harbors has been less spectacular because it is under water. but it is no less important. these great harbors and entrance channels have been deepened from about 25 feet to from 35 to 40 feet. the important interior link of waterways along the atlantic coast is now nearing completion. and is of outstanding significance. the south has developed rapidly. and with the oil fields in the southwest has added greatly to gulf commerce. necessitating farreaching improvements in gulf ports and connecting waterways. the improvement of the texas ports. and the vast commerce using them. has come largely since your congress first met. the pacific ports h ave shared in the general improvement. the columbia. improved by monumental breakwaters and other works. is substantially a development of the last s5 years. los angeles has attained the prominent place it holds as a port and city during this period. san francisco. with its magnificent inland harbor. has profited by interior channel improvements. the deepened connecting channels and the harbor improvements on the great lakes. together with technical industrial progress. have made possible the development of the greatest interior water commerce in the world. the mxiajor part of which has come since the turn of the century. this development points directly to the projected great lakesst. lawrence seaway. by means of which ocean commerce may be brought to the heart of the american continent and enormous hydroelectric power resources developed for mans use. how much longer this great. permanent natural resource will be left lying idle i do not know. but i do know that sometime the sister republics of canada and the united states will develop it as a joint undertaking for their mutual benefit. the interior rivers have not been neglected. but are now receiving preferential treatment. from a few disconnected stretches where improvements had been begun. the vast mississippi with its tributaries has been changed during the life of your organization into an integrated system. which will soon permit the operation of boats of uniform draft from the alleghenies and the lakes to the gulf. and even to kansas city and beyondthe most extensive system of river navigation in the world. the final stages of this improvement are at hand. the upper mississippi from st. paul to st. louis is being transformed by the construction of more than a score of dams into a chain of beautiful lakes. connected by locks and canals. to permit safe and dependable navigation from st. paul to the gulf. to say nothing of the recreational value of these bodies of water. the missouri river is being regulated from its mouth to sioux city. and the fort peck dam is being constructed to provide ample water for navigation throughout the season. barge operation between st. louis and kansas city will be inaugurated early next month. i am hopeful of securing an allotment of funds sufficient to push the upper mississippi and the missouri river projects to early completion. works for the control of floods on the lower mississippi. and on the sacramento. which were begun in a modest way. largely through local initiative and enterprise. have now been taken over by the federal government to a large extent. and have been increased enormously during the period we are considering. works for the development of power. and the improvement of water supplies. have been undertaken and completed throughout the entire country. irrigation has made great. strides under the efficient direction of the bureau of reclamation in the department of the interior. these are significant accomplishments. net abstract theories. the improvements have had. are having. and will have. a farreaching influence on our cultural. economic. and social lie. i call them to your attention to refresh your memory and to impress you with the increased tempo with which the work has been prosecuted during recent years. it has cost large sums of money. but the expenditures have been commensurate with the importance of the work. the increasing wealth of the country. and. very recently. with the social and economic requirements of the emergency. over $2.000.000.000 have now been spent or allotted to vital improvements undertaken by the war department. compare this figure with that of 1900. since that time about 85 percent of the work has been done. prior to the new relief appropriation of $4.800.00.000. the present administration has allotted about $515.000.000 to this work. this is nearly twice as much as was made available for similar work during the whole century preceding the birth of your organization. certainly the waterway new deal has been a square deal. let us look at the present situation. you are doubtless familiar with the scope and extent of the projects under way. the rapidity with which they were undertaken. the vigor with which work at fort peck. bonneville. the mississippi. the missouri. the muskingum. along the coast. on the lakes. and elsewhere. is being prosecuted. hundreds of millions were allotted. and the work was put under way with astonishing promptness and is being pushed to completion with gratifying speed. hundreds of thousands of idle men have been given employment and are now engaged on work of this character. human requirements have been kept in the foreground. not only those of the individuals have been given consideration. but the rights of contractors have been fairly protected. the department was the first government agency to draw contracts in which wages and proper living conditions of employees were safeguarded. river an tarbor improvements have such a high social value. can furnish prompt and widespread employment to so many men. and will so stimulate the durablegoods industries that i am sanguine of receiving generous allotments out of the new publicworks appropriation. both the intrinsic merit of waterways projects and their widespread benefits insure this. in the river and harbor bill just passed by the house of representatives there are 204 projects. 127 of which are new and 77 of which were included to give permanent status to work already completed or under way with emergency funds. i understand that still other projects are being considered by the senate committee which is handling this bill. but even the remarkable progress which has led up to the present situation does not represent the last word in the orderly"},{"1":"1934","2":"MACLEAY","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"executive vice president mississippi valley association. 511 locust street. st. louis. mo. dear mr. macleay: i am in receipt of your letter of january 25. enclosing copy of an article by george creel entitled. \" get out of the ditches \". and recently appearing in colliers. the copy you send is a reprint in the form of a folder. by permission of the publishers. and. as you say. is being distributed to passengers on the missouri pacific trains. i read the article when it appeared but considering it a story for pastime reading. and seeing no authentic information in it. i failed to file it for reference. i have now reread it. and find no reason to change my first impression. the writer criticizes waterways in general. but stresses the government bargeline operations. the missouri river improvements. and the st. lawrence treaty in particular. none of these measures can be said to be hobbies of mine or of the committee on rivers and harbors. of which i am now the chairman. the barge line is under the jurisdiction of the committee on interstate and foreign commerce. the st. lawrence treaty is entirely with the united states senate. i could not think of expressing a view in the face of that august body. for the information of mr. creel i will say that it has not yet been ratified. and the enormous expenditures he has in mind have not yet been authorized. as to the missouri river. the section below kansas city has been under improvement for 70 years or more. when the proposition was before congress to extend the project to sioux city. i opposed it and helped defeat it in the committee. when it was offered as an amendment on the floor of the house. i voted against it. at that time every railroad influence in and around congress joined with the friends of the missouri to have it put in the bill over the opposition of the rivers and harbors committee. their purpose was to load the bill down with what they considered objectionable matter. with a hope of eventually defeating the measure or of causing it to become unpopular. the missouri river is. therefore. the baby of the railroads. they should not now disown or disinherit their offspring. ] i have looked over some of mr. creeks figures. to which you call my attention. like the report of mark twains death. they are \" very much exaggerated.\" they remind me of some of the populist orators of 40 years ago. who dealt so lavishly in figures. he says: \"rivers and canals to date have cost the federal government around $1.000.000.000. and this is exclusive of the appropriations for flood control. seacoast harbors. and the great lakes.\" i havent the figures before me for the past year. but have a statement from the chief of engineers showing the expenditures from the beginning of our government to june 30. 1932. it is as follows: cost of river and harbor work to june 30.

this statement it will be seen that inland and intracoastal waterways combined have cost only $550.507.102.84 while ocean. gulf. and great lakes harbors and channels. including also those of hawaii. alaska. and puerto rico. have cost $805.370.198.47. it must be borne in mind that more than 90 percent of these expenditures for harbor improvements have been made at the urgent request of the railroads. who have been the greatest beneficiaries of such improvements. their viewpoint is. that the portion of these expenditures which is for the benefit of the railroads is not subsidy. but the portion for the benefit of others is subsidy. of the new york state canals. the article says: \"new york has poured an aggregate of $346.000.000 into its canal system.\" these figures are not borne out by any authentic statement. on may 26. 1932. the committee.on rivers and harbors passed a resolution for the engineers of the war department to review this subject. a distinguished bokrd was appointed for the purpose. consisting of cols. george m. hoffman. e. m. markham. and g. r. lukesh. and major eugene reybold. all of these gentlemen have international reputations for ability. thoroughness. and accuracy. this same colonel markham is now a major general and chief of engineers of the war department. on september 28. 1933. the board made its report to congress. which is embraced in document no. 20. seventysecond congress. second session. paragraph 17 of the report is in part as follows: \" 17. the state of new york had expended large sums upon the construction. maintenance. and operation of its canal system before it was decided. in 1903. to build the more modern and socalled barge system. but the amounts actually expended on the old erie and oswego canals cannot be reliably stated. from the best available sources it has been determined that the total cost of all branches of the existing barge canal system (erie. oswego. cayuga. and seneca and champlain canals). including court and legal costs. fees. and expenses of appraisers and consultants. damages. engineering. accounting. and superintendence. cost of real estate and water rights. reservoirs. power houses. bridges. terminals. and grain elevators was $230.881.000 up to june 30. 1932.\" this report. it will be observed. emanating from the highest authority we have upon the subject. places the cost of the new york canals about $120.000.000 under the figures given by mr. creel. as to the st. lawrence river. mr. creel says: \" it will cost between $999.000.000 and $1.350.000.000.\" evidently he broke the keyboard of his typewriter before finishing his array of figures. i will let this statement of mr. creel be answered by the president of the united states. in the documentary statements submitted by him to the senate on january 10. 1934. embraced in senate document no. 110. on page 3. appears the following language: \"the total united states share of the cost of completing this waterway to open the great lakes to oceangoing commerce under the treaty is estimated at $272.453.000. including the development of 1.100.000 horsepower on the united states side of the international rapids. of this it is proposed. under the terms of the joint resolution which has already passed the house of representatives. that $89.726.750 be assumed by the state of new york as representing the cost which may fairly be allocated to the power project. this would place the total net cost to the united states for the entire project under the treaty at $182.726.250.\" these were the estimates of cost agreed upon by the boards of engineers representing both canada and the united states. they were the result of perhaps the most thorough investigation ever made of any waterway. of the missouri river. mr. creel says: \"it was first figured that the comparatively small sum of $3.500.000 would make the missouri river permanently navigable between st. louis and kansas city.\" further on he says that $58.000.000 will now be required to do this same work. first estimated at $3.500.000. i have not run across these estimates he refers to. but he says they were the first estimates for the missouri. if so. they were made something like 70 years ago. at that time the elaborate system of dikes and revetments now being installed to prevent bank erosion. as well as for aid to navigation. were not even dreamed of. those early improvements only contemplated a depth of 21/2 to 3 feet for the little packet steamboats then in operation. carrying perhaps from 60 to 150 tons. the present improvements are for large steel barges in fleets of six and carrying from 6.000 to 10.000 tons. if mr. creel had gone to some reliable source for his information. he might have obtained these facts. you. of course. know full well the tremendous influence exerted by the railroads to defeat the appropriations necessary to carry out the missouri river improvements. this caused a very large proportion of the expenditures to go to waste. but for these influences the work could have been completed many years ago and at less than one half the cost. if you should desire any further information in regard to these matters. i will be glad to have them checked up and furnished you. i am. very truly yours."},{"1":"1933","2":"SMITH","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. as the amendment proposed by the senator from michigan is before us i want to enter my protest against the consideration and adoption of it. i know that the principle involved may be one that is humanitarian. but i want to ask my colleagues. particularly those who come from the section of the country which i in part represent. what they would visualize if this should become the law? every post would be flooded with young men between the ages specified. all sorts of affidavits and asseverations will be made that they are unemployed. even those who are employed or who could find employment. as a matter of course. would select and elect to go to where the government was furnishing them food and clothing and delightful training and recreation for a year. just visualize what effect that would have. not only in the south. where we have a very improvident race. but in every section of the country. it is an invitation to young men to accept by every conceivable device this proposal of the government. there is no limit to the number that may go. therefore none of us can say what would be the limit of the appropriations necessary under the provisions of the amendment in order to meet the condition which we ourselves create and which would practically bankrupt the treasury if we persisted in it. the calculations which have been made here as to what it would cost per capita are interesting. but the principal consideration is. what woiild be the number that we would have to feed and clothe? so far as the available labor supply in nearly every section of the country is concerned. it would be exhausted between the ages specified in the amendment. it is bad enough for us to have unemployment and to be making appropriations for those who have earnestly sought employment and could not find it. it is bad enough for us to have to meet that condition. we should meet it. but deliberately to introduce a measure that invites unemployment is beyond my comprehension. that is what the senators amendment proposes to do. the young men or boys must make affidavit that they have been unemployed for six months and we give them a year in which to do so. six months of which time they may idle around and then make application and the necessary affidavit. aside fromthat. the principle involved is disastrous to the youth of the country. no matter to what race they belong. in the very formative period of their character for us to invite them to take advantage of this proposal would be extremely disastrous."},{"1":"1932","2":"MCDUFFIE","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"i shall do that. mr. chairman. i may not be able now to occupy more than 10 minutes in order that other proponents of the bill may be heatd. of course. within the limited time. it is absolutely impossible to cover the many subjects included in our program. i can only make a few general observations about the economy program without undertaking to deal singly or item by item with the provisions of the bill. i doubt if any member of this house. other than those who were members of this committee. has the slightest idea of the task and the overwhelming burden this committee assumed when it undertook to carry out your instructions. i doubt if there is anything as nearly impossible or as difficult as the one thing of withdrawing the strong arm of the federal treasury. which has been extended within the last 10 or 12 years in so many directions. touching almost every business and. indeed. touching even the social life of the citizens. it is practically impossible of accomplishment by a political body. people have grown used. if you please. to the benefits. the blessings. if we may call them that. which uncle sam has extended within this time. the cost of government within the last 10 years has mounted $1.000.000.000. we are living now in times of great economic distress. day after day we read in the press where men and women are marching almost in mob formation upon courthouses. upon capitols of states. demanding. if you please. that the cost ofgovernment be brought down. realizing the necessity of economizing. if our nation is to stay of an even keel financially. your committee set about to do all it could in an intelligent way to present you certain proposals which might be immediately adopted and which will save the treasury. not for 1945 but for the year 1933. approximately $200.000.000 if adopted. we have not covered the entire field. we have merely scratched the surface. a committee several years ago under president hardings administration undertook this same or a similar problem. after two years of hearings. going into this and that department. with a view of doing away with overlapping. and consolidating similar work in one agency. or by joining many agencies. finally made a report to this house after laboring for two years. i mention that to give you an idea of the difficulties that we have had in the time the committee had to cover the entire field and bring to you a bill dealing with the entire consolidation of the government. we have brought you a bill which. of course. has. been condemned from one end of the country to the other by certain minority organizations and highpowered propagandists who have flooded you with telegrams. the committee itself is not satisfied with the bill as a whole. in other words. no one of us agreed to all of its provisions. this happens in practically all bills presented. but we recognized that in these provisions there are many things that should have the attention of congress. and we have brought them here in one bill for your consideration. it now becomes your responsibility. under the rule agreed upon by the house. let us hope we will not spend two weeks on the bill. let us hope that we will get through and do justice not only to the employees and the various agencies of the government but justice to the government and the taxpayers. let us hope that we may get along and settle this problem one way or the other in two days. i do not know what you will do with this bill. but your constituents will watch your vote on it. we have submitted the problem to you. and if you see fit to kick it out entirely. that is your responsibility. and you will then go home to answer your own constituents for your action on this floor. we do not say the bill is perfect. but it is the best we could do in the time allotted to us. there have been certain organizations that have complained bitterly. more especially as to the question of the reduction of salaries. labor organizations have even gone far enough to condemn certain persons of the committee. including myself. writing into our districts that we were hostile to labor by proposing a reduction of salaries. that we are setting an example or precedent on the part of the government that will be followed by private industry everywhere. and that there is a principle involved rather than mens pay. you can not make me believe that. i believe the federal employees are more interested in their pay than the preserving of a principle that makes the smallersalaried man bear greater burdens. some newspapers of the country. and especially- those in washington. have vigorously protested the reduction of salaries of government employees. and yet i dare say that every last one of them have reduced the salaries of their own employees. of course. they wish every dollar possible expended in washington. by the employees of the government. we are not legislating here for the benefit of any men or set of men. we are trying to speak for all the people. for the inarticulate masses of the country. some of whom have not got enough money today to send you a telegram. personally. i refuse to be dictated to or wear the collar of any man or set of men. i never have done it. and it is too late now to begin. remember. gentlemen. any man who has a job with uncle sam is fortunate indeed in these days of trial and stress. i recognize there are lower salaries involved in the bill. but the cost of living has gone down more than we propose to reduce any salaries. and we do not propose to go below the thousanddollar man. you say that that is a small salary. indeed it is. but it is a much bigger salary than it was three years ago. and a man who could live upon it three years ago can live on a little bit less at a time like this. at least for one year. i am glad to say that notwithstanding the many protests we have had. we have also received some wonderful letters from employees. patriotic men and women. if you please. who say that if the government needs a small part of their salary at a time like this they are perfectly willing to give it to the government. that is the proper kind of spirit to show. rather than seek condemnation of the committee for suggesting a small sacrifice in the hour of their countrys need. i am not here to legislate for minorities. my personal opinion is that the highly paid and highpowered propagandists. the organized minorities. the bureaucrats have almost destroyed representative government in this country. what are you going to do about it? if your business income is cut in two. what course should you follow? if in your own home you have many servants highly paid and your income is cut half in two. will you increase the servants and raise their salaries? no. the argument of some gentlemen here is that the way to prosperity is to engage more employees and pay them more. i can not follow that sort of reasoning. acting as one of the directors. as we all are. of a great business concern. the united states government. i feel differently. we must effect economies in government if we are to put our government on a sound financial basis."},{"1":"1931","2":"Unknown","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"we return to the discussion of the interpellations. m. margaine has the floor. in order to develop his interpellation. m. margaine. my colleagues will be kind enough to permit me. in the interests of clarity. to which i am particularly attached. to define in the most precise manner possible the position which i wish to take in this debate. i will not examine the basis of the proposal of mr. hoover. just as mr. hoover can do nothing without his congress. so the french government. since the young plan is the result of a law. can do nothing without parliament. i will. then. wait for the proposed legal bill in order to discuss the basis. what i should like to examine today is the entirely novel situation resulting from the abrupt intervention of mr. hoover. there are. to begin with. surrounding that intervention. particular circumstances. certain obscurities. which i hope the government in time will be so good as to undertake to elucidate. the ambassador of the united states called tuesday evening to state to the president of the council that there had been no discussion preliminary to the intervention of mr. hoover. if the heads of states have sometimes a language which is somewhat brutal. diplomats. on the other hand. have a language which is particularly flexible. for. indeed. there are certain facts which one can not do otherwise than to underline and which do not completely harmonize with such a declaration. mr. mellon disembarked in england on the 16th. the following morning he took care to make a declaration in which he stated that he was making a purely private journey. his only object being to pass some days with his son. a student at the university of cambridge. nevertheless. that same day the official newspaperi may well call it that--of the labor government. the daily herald. explained that the american minister had come to europe because mr. hoover was convinced that it was necessary to do something in regard to what concerned the war debts if one wished to avert a collapse disastrous for american financial interests. the paper added that mr. hoover had in mind the idea of a suspension for two years of all payments of reparations and war debts. as this subject had been abundantly treated at chequers between the english and the german ministers. it seems to me impossible that there had not been. between chequers and the departure of mr. mellon. negotiations. comunications. between the american government and the english government. the least that one could say is that the facts show that the newspaper. the daily herald. was particularly well informed. on the other side. mr. mills. assistant secretary of the treasury of the united states. saw the ambassador from england to the united states on the morning of june 20. it was after this visit that he returned to see mr. hoover and that the communication was made. i have difficulty in believing that the ambassador from england was summoned at that moment in order to be advised of a matter of which he knew not the first word. after the communications whose certitude i have just made manifest. consequently. for my part. until proof of the contraryand i will presently return to itthere were. in regard to the facts which have surprised us. conversations covering 20 days or so between the english and american governments. contrary to what evilintentioned characters have claimed. mr. hoover is far from being an impulsive person. he is a man whose character is well known. he studies much. he reflects much. all his past is the proof of it. if he has placed france before an accomplished fact. it is because he was told that it would be necessary for him so to act in order to succeed quickly and well. but mr. hoover has done much more than that. and he has certainly not done it lightly: he has broken with the traditional policy of the united states. permit me to emphasize the importance of such an attitude on the part of the president of the united states. the american. the man in the street. does not trouble himself with questions of external policy. for him europe is a small continent in which little nations. so numerous that one can not remember all their names. engage in rivalry. are jealous of one another. and fight. instead of bringing themselves into agreement as the states of the great republic of the united states have done. the man in the street is satisfied. so far as external policy is concerned. to know that his government is remaining faithful to certain doctrines which i will summarily recall: the monroe doctrine. the doctrine of washington. the doctrine of john hay. quite recently the government of the united states. with a certain solemnity. on several occasions. declared that it would not concern itself in european affairs. permit me to recall some of the circumstances in which this affirmation has been made. when the europeans asked the government of the united states to have itself represented at the genoa conference. the american government officially replied that it did not wish to take cogni-. zance of the affairs of europe. in 1922. when lord balfour sent the wellknown note in which he proposed the annulment of war debts. the american government replied that the affairs of europe did not concern it. that the states of europe had. to america. certain debts of an exclusively commercial character and that it would discuss them with each of the countries separately. i can not admit that the executive power of a country which is attached to such an extent to traditiona! doctrines could have overturned all its traditions simply because mr. mellon. making a pleasure journey. had a conversation. by accident. with mr. macdonald. no. there islet us say it and let us know how to see itsomething quite different. besides the man in the street of whom i have been speaking. there are american business men who have dealings with europe and. above all. with germany. and who. since a very short time ago. have had serious reasons for disquietude. in the united states itself there have been some characteristic occurrences. with which the press has concerned itself and of which i shall permit myself to cite some examples showing that in that country there is an internal evolution which is not without a certain gravity. all these events. of which i shall cite some. have been set forth by the democratic press. recently in the pittsburgh basin at westland a thousand striking miners fought with mounted police. a policeman was beaten. his comrades fired. two miners were wounded. at ellsworth a veritable battle took place between the miners and the police of the coal companies. the women and children fought with particular fury. in kentucky. at evarts. miners and mine police had a pitched battle. there were killed on one side and on the other. in the state of west virginia 1.500 miners came to charles town and marched through the streets. demanding bread for their children. the democratic press has seized upon these facts. it denounces the activities of the magnates of the industry. and since his name is spread throughout its columns. i may well remark that at their head it inscribes mr. mellon. it was necessary for the united states that this situation should not grow worse. and it would have grown worse if in germany events had entered upon an acute phase. it is at bottom the german situation which is the origin of everything. i shall not return to the explanations given in this very place at the end of 1929. before the government left for the. hague. when we put it on its guard against the constitution of a germanamerican industrial bloc. which was beginning to take on a certain solidity. . germany. thanks to the formation of this bloc. made important appeals to american capital. the statistics show us that from 1926 to 1930 the public emissions of germany abroadalmost all in americaattained the sum of six milliards and a half of reichsmarks. and this sum does not include the direct investments of americans in german industry. i find. in the same statistics. that in 1928 the total of foreign capital invested in that manner in germany was four milliards two hundred and fifty millions of relchsmarks. in 1929 two milliards seven hundred and fifty millions. certain american financiers some months ago began to be alarmed by this constant outflow. their apprehensions are revealed in the fact that in 1930 the capital funds thus placed in germany barely attained the sum of half a milliard. on the other hand. germany has made a great deal of noise about her budgetary difficulties. one saw m. hilferding give way to m. moldenhauer. then m. moldenhauer give way to m. dietrich. always because of the impossibility of establishing a budget. all this in the space of eight months. in spite of all these changes the budget could not be established save by making use of article 48 of the constitution of weimar. there was a legal decree on the 1st of august. 1930. another on the 1st of december. 1930. and a third quite recently. all these facts have powerfully shaken the confidence of the americans. just at the moment in which mr. mellon arrived in england the reichsbank proceeded to enormous sales of gold and of exchanges. it sold in the first fortnight of june one milliard fifty millions of reichsmarks. keeping only one milliard six hundred millions. the legal reserve of the reichsbank was very close to being reached. during these same days in berlin panic reigned. in the banks one sold. not banknotes--they had no more of thembut promises of banknotes to be delivered in a fortnight. all this caused superficial observers to believe that germany was struggling in the midst of grave budgetary difficulties. i say \"superficial observers.\" for if the americans had given themselves the trouble to read over the reports of their compatriot. mr. parker gilbert. notably the last. which is of may. 1930. they would there have seen the affirmation. many times repeated. that the germans will put order into their budget when they wish. [very good! very good!] but they do not wish it yet. because in order to make an end of the payments of the war debts it is necessary that their budget should remain in disorder.

secure an additional authorization so the secretary of agriculture can make loans this year for the purchase of seed. fertilizers. feed. and so forth. the same as was done last year. many farmers in my section and throughout the south paid up their loans last year even though they had little or no money left for the use of themselves and their families. they have had very heavy rains again. and many are in as much need of financial help as ever. some of those in control of this legislation are urging that there is only slight need for these loans and that only $3.000.000 should be made available. this is not at all sufficient. at least $6.000.000 should be made available. and i feel that much more could be used advantageously. in fact. i have introduced a bill to make available the sum of $50.000.000 to be loaned for these purposes wherever and whenever the secretary of agriculture determines that an emergency exists. day before yesterday before the house committee on irrigation and reclamation where the land settlement bill is being considered. and also on yesterday when these emergency loans were being discussed at a conference of members and senators in the senate committee room on agriculture and forestry. i pointed out that last year the government got $43 out of the tobacco grown in the united states every time the farmer got $28 out of the sale price of his tobacco. in other words. by reason of the various taxes on manufactured tobacco. the government gets nearly twice as much as the farmer from a crop of tobacco. then it is suggested that the farmer is asking too much from his government. the united states department of agriculture. upon request. reports that last year the farmers of the united states received for the entire crop of tobacco the sum of $285.583.000 in round numbers and that the united states government received from the same crop in taxes on cigars. cigarettes. chewing tobacco. and so forth. the grand total of $434.444.543. in asking for a loan of $6.000.000 the farmers are in effect saying to their government. \"we want to borrow back only $1 out of every $72 that you made out of our last years crop. we are not asking for a gift. but only for a loan of this small amount to help the government make again this year more by nearly twice out of the farmer crop of tobacco than the farmer gets himself for all his labor and expenses.\" then the governmentoh. the shame of itsays to these farmers. \"no. the government can not afford to loan you $1 out of every $72 that we received out of your tobacco crop. but we may grudgingly loan you $1 out of every $144 that we received out of your tobacco crop last year.\" this same government says that it is helping the farmer solve his problems. and yet by the federal farm loan system it is selling the farmers land and turning him and his family out because he can not pay his interest. when the government is getting nearly twice as much as the farmer gets out of his crop of tobacco. then. again. it must be remembered that the amount that the farmer gets is gross and not net. ofttimes the farmer does not get actual expenses. so it is that the government gets anywhere from one to a thousand times as much as the farmer gets net out of the farmers crop. much is s.aid about the wonderful farm relief bill which was passed last spring to create a fund of $500.000.000 to loan to the farmers. and yet the government got out of the farmers tobacco crop last year nearly as much as was authorized in the farm loan act. this money. provided in the farm loan act. is not donated to the farmer but is to be loaned to him. and is to be repaid with interest. i am not unmindful of the fact that the purpose of the socalled farm relief act of last year is to stabilize prices. the thing that i have always feared. and now fear. is that the prices of tobacco and cotton will be stabilized so low. until the average price will be below the average price without the law. i have heard several men argue at great length that the farm relief act is a wonderful piece of legislation. there is no use arguing this to the farmers of the nation. the price he receives for his farm products will be all the argument- he will care for. no amount of statistics will convince him that a low and unfair price for his cotton is farm relief. you can not convince the farmer that the farm board is doing wonders for him when his tobacco is selling for less than it costs to produce it and the government is getting twice as much as he gets out of his tobacco. the farmer will know whether the farm act helps him or not. and no one need try to tell him. ordinarily. i do not quote statistics. because they are so dry. but i wish to quote just another item. in the year 1919 the farmers got out of their entire tobacco crop the sum of $570.858.000. and the government received in taxes only $206.003.002. in other words. 11 years ago the farmer got nearly three times as much as the government out of the tobacco crop. and last year the situation was changed and the government got nearly twice as much as the farmer out of the entire tobacco crop. i thought it might not be amiss to say this much in an humble effort to show that the government can well afford to make the small emergency loans now desired by these very farmers out of whose labor the government is making so much. frankly. is any headway being made with farm relief legislation? eleven years ago out of every four dollars received toy the farmer and the government the farmer got three and the government only one. now the government gets about two and a half every time the farmer gets less than a dollar and a half. this leaves out the consideration of the enormous and unconscionable profits of middlemen and the manufacturers of cigarettes. and so forth. but i shall not pursue the subject further at this time. i only wanted to submit this additional plea for the farmers of the nation. and especially for those of the southeastern states in the stormstricken and flooded sections."},{"1":"1929","2":"Unknown","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"without objection. it is so ordered. the extracts are as follows: that this investment is undervalued on the basis of present market prices. although it should be added. in fairness. that present market prices are probably not an adequate index of what could actually be realized out of this stock if a concern like du ponts should care to liquidate it. fifth. by taking the ratio of \"income from operations\" to \"investment devoted to chemical operations\" we find that the percentage earned on the capital devoted to chemical operations has increased from 9.01 per cent in 1922 to 18.6 per cent in 192?. sixth. by taking the ratio of \"total income \" to \"total investment.\" we find that the percentage earned on total investment increased from 4.26 per cent in 1922 to 16.14 per cent in 1928. seventh. one thousand dollars invested in du ponts common in 3.922 would bring. at the market prices prevailing september 12. 1929. $18.571.20. this means a net profit of 1.757 per cent on the original investment in addition to a very liberal cash dividend received throughout the entire period. while i have not made a detailed study of all of the many other corporations in the chemical industry. i call attention to the fact that the standard statistics co. made a study of 14 corporations in the chemical industry and found that in 1926 these 14 corporations earned an average of 12.34 per cent and in 1927. 12.68 per cent on their invested capital. this shows that the chemical industry in general is in a rather prosperous condition. (sloan in corporation profits. p. 142.) if. as has been contended by some senators. the purpose of the increased duties was to protect labor. and if. in pursuance of that argument. it is contended that labor is being underpaid in the chemical industries. it is certainly time to face the fact that the chemical industry is exacting great enough profits to permit it to pay its labor adequate wages. as i pointed out. in perhaps no pther industry in america is labor cost as relatively a small proportion of the total cost as it is in the chemical industry. it appears. moreover. that any increase in prices which this industry can exact from the other industries. notably the automobile industry. to which it sells many of its productswhich cost in turn will ultimately be reflected on the consumer. the increased prices will most likely result not in higher wages but in greater profits. if concerns which have increased their profits from 100 to 1.000 per cent during the period of the existing tariff are unable or unwilling to pay decent wages. it is evident that they will never do so and that their claims to an additional tariff for the purpose of compensating their labor is a fake and a sham. it has. of course. been contended by those who defend the outrageous rates contained in the chemical schedule that these rates were granted. not because a corporation as a whole or an industry as a whole was either prosperous or depressed but whether or not these concerns were getting an adequate price on particular products. hence it is argued that. although these chemical concerns are all extremely profitable as a whole. on particular products. such as ammonium carbonate and bicarbonate. and compounds of pyroxylin. they are not getting an adequate return. i do not know whether this argument has been made seriously or whether those making it have misspoken themselves. while this defense has been made of the schedules. i can not find in the record any proof which shows adequately on what particular product the chemical concerns like du pont and others are making exorbitant profits and on what products they are operating at a loss. many products are jointcost products and if concerns like du pont. allied chemical. and union carbide. who are to be the chief beneficiaries of the chemical schedule. are in need of additional protection on particular compounds. they have failed to presentand the committee which is responsible for these exorbitant rates has failed to demand that they present any detailed cost accounting study of their entire industry. i assume that the reason that such a study was not presented was because it wou!d be difficult to show how these companies could be losing money on all of the products on which the finance committee has increased the ratesand still end each year with enormous profits. by what sort of legerdemain is it possible to continue to lose money on one product after the other and yet continue to pay larger dividends year after year? it is quite obvious. therefore. both from these considerations and others advanced that the increased rates granted in the chemical schedule are not the result either of a depression in the chemical industries nor of a detailed study of the- individual commodities in that industry made by the finance committee or the ways and means committee. they will not isure adequate wages in the chemical industry. but will increase the already enormous profit to those people who own tile common stock of the leading chemical corporations. i would like particularly to call attention to the fact that all of the increased profits which will be made. if these increased rates are enacted into law. will go not to all of the investors in the industries but will merely inflate the already enormous earnings of the common stock. the rates paid on preferred stock. bonds. and debenture stocks are fixed. hence any increase in the total earnings increases the earnings on the conmon stock. i have demonstrated that these earnings \".re extremely large. considered from almost any point of view and using methods of analysis most favorable to the corporations in the chemical industries. there is little or no justification whatever for the increases in the chemical rates. mr. president. i have not attempted in this discussion to refer to more than the classification of sonle of the reductions which have been made by the finance committee and i have not listed the commodities which have been reduced. i propose to take up that subject when we come to discuss the bill paragraph by paragraph. what i have attempted to demonstrate this afternoon is. first. that the cheiical industry is dominated by three of the most powerful organizations in the financial worldthe allied chemical & dye corporation. the e. i. du pont de nemours co.. and the union carbide & carbon corporation. mr. president. if reference shall be made to the exhibit which i shall incorporate with my remarks. it will be found that there are a vast number of subsidiary corporations now owned by these giants in the industrial field. as i have pointed out. there are numbers of increases granted either by the ways and means committee. by the senate finance committee. or by presidential proclamation over the law of 1922 on chemicals which are manufactured by \" the big three \" of the chemical industry. it will not suffice to say that there appeared before the committee some manufacturer using obsolete methods or a highcost producer pleading for an increase upon these particular comodities. we must view these industrial schedules from the point of view of the dominating concerns which manufacture the bulk of the products and which fix the price. are senators ready to go home to their constituents and say that in response to the call for an extra session of congress to readjust tariff rates in the interest of the american farmer they have granted increased tariff rates to the enormously profitable corporations which benefit by the chemical schedule? if they are. mr. president. they must prepare to defend themselves. senators who stand upon the floor of the senate to defend these increases and who cast their votes in favor of these increases over the rates in the fordneymccumber law. which are to benefit these great industrial corporations will have to meet that issue in the next campaign. iii 1909 tariff revision resulted in a split in the republican party. i say to the sponsors of the pending bill that the farmers of the united states are in earnest. they are watching the action of this congress. they have a right to watch it. it was called to benefit agriculture. to readjust the tariff rates. and. in so far as that readjustment could do so. to accomplish the elevation of agriculture to a parity with industry. the representatives of intrenched industry in the east have defeated or have secured the defeat of every proposition proposed in the interest of agriculture. which attempted to make the tariff effective upon exportable farm products. they have not offered any alternative. they have said to the farmer. \"the job for you. my friend. is to lift yourself out of the hole that you are in by taking a good hold and pulling on your boot straps.\" the farmer has swallowed that suggestion for the last time. if the framers of this legislation proceed to put this tariff bill through in the form in which it is written. giving additional bounties to the manufacturing concerns of the east. i say to them. mr. president. that it will be an issue in the campaign of 1932 and it will be an issue in the campaign of 1934. the same complacent. selfrighteous attitude on the part of those who dominated the senate when the country was betrayed by the republican party in 1909 is taken by senators coming from those eastern states today. but i ask them. before they decide upon what shall be their final action on the pending bill. to turn back the pages of history and to remember what happened to the republican party that betrayed its pledge to reduce the tariff in 1909. as they are now setting out to betray the pledge made to the farmers in the campaign of 1928 and in the calling of the present extra session of congress."},{"1":"1928","2":"FREAR","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. chairman. i yield myself 40 minutes. mr. chairman. i am glad. indeed. that these statements have been made by my colleagues on the committee. you ought to know the situation down there during the mississippi flood. we are all familiar with it. we all have sympathy for those who were in the flood. those who are opposing the present bill in its present particulars are opposing it because of certain features of the bill. but we have not delayed action on this bill one hour since it was originally brought before the committee. it is a national problem. if it were not you could not get goverunient aid i aid you would not be entitled to it. that is the reason we all concede for it and we are all glad to give it. i have respect for every one of my colleagues who may disagree with me. and there has been no disposition on the part of any member. so far as i know. to feel differently with reference to mys.elf. i trust not personally. because i am about to consider the legislative aspect of the bill and discuss one provision particularly. i am only going to take up one phase of this proposition. later i expect i will be called upon to answer some of those who feel they should criticize or comment upon anything i may say. i trust i will have the opportunity at that time to reply to any questions and i want to do so. because whatever may be the intent. we all agree with the necessity of flood control. but do not agree to the commission or to that part which refuses local contribution. if i do not make out a case requiring local contribution you ought not to support it. that is for you to say. if i make any misstatements they ought to be pointed cut. and later on. if they can not be answered. then. of course. you will have a right to your own judgment. at the outset let me say no man would hire two extraofficial. irresponsible carpenters to help build a valuable cabinet. the government has the highest skilled engineers in the country familiar with the flood task. so to require the president to name a new commission is only to provide more jobs and delay the work. that is all i can here say about a proposed political floodcontrol commission. i say political simply because it will degenerate into that kind of a commission. in a few short years. that is the result of our experience. the lower mississippi river flood control bill now before the house covers a known cost of approximately $1.000.000.000. although both the senate and house bills afford evidence of easy legislative virtue by carrying on their face only $325.000.000. that fact will be considered later on. and i shall be glad to support the facts as given to me by the best authority i can find aind the best authority to which we have access. this last amount is less than onethird of the estimated cost. the facts made known to me after the bill had been reported to the house are set forth in recoan of april 4 with the niames of 1.000 owners of property. including large corporate interests whose land. under the bill. the government must acquire by condemnation or purchase. after senate bill s. 3740 was reported by the committee an estimate on the bill was requested from the army engineers under whom president coolidge bad asked for floodcontrol plans to place before congress at the beginning of the session. their statement. as set forth in my remarks of april 4. is as

today and that i expect to resume them at the session of the senate tomorrow. mr. president. the argument which has been made in behalf of the socalled swingjohnson bill by the senator whose name it bears has increased my great admiration for him as one of fhe ablest of advocates. i appeal to the members of this body. one and all. to withhold ally conclusion and to form no judgment as to the merits of this proposed legislation iutil the facts which condemn it can be made clear . so clear that \"lie who runs may read.\" there can be no question as to the facts. they are all set forth in reports of the federal or state governments. coming from engineers or officials whose ability and dependability can not be questioned. the greatest difficulty in the way of a perfect understanding of this measure by one not personally familiar with the region of country to which it is sought to apply it is that the region referred to is one of the most extraordinary and unusual il its physical characteristics to be found anywlre in the world. it is to that fact. i believe. that we may look for an explanation of the errors into whicll the senator who has spoken so forcefully in advocacy of the measure has fallen. i fully acquit the senator of any purpose to deceive. and my high personal regard for him is in no way affected by the unfortunate fact that he has been led into such grievous and unfortunate errors in his advocacy of this bill. it has been my good fortuneand i say that without any reference to this legislative controversyto have lived in that wonderful and marvelously interesting region for more than 40 years. the colorado river. its grand canyon. its immensity. its inspiration. its sudden and devastating floods. and every site where dams may be built to control those floods are as intimately known and as familiar to me as is the park surrounding this capitol to all of us. the whole of tile vast area we plan to irrigate in arizona with the regulated flow of that great river lies before me in a vision as i speak to you now. i can see it as it is todaya desert wasteand i can see it as it will be when it has been transformed by the touch of the lifegiving waters of the colorado river into a vast garden. beautifil beyond description. inspiring in its immensity. peopled by a multitude of happy citizens of tie united states of america. if it is not condemned by the passage of the swingjohnson bill to remain a desert waste foreverthe habitat of the horned toad. the coyote. cactus. and sand storms. one of the greatest difficulties confronting us in our efforts to secure a fair anrd unprejudiced consideration of this pending measure is that immense sums of money have been expended in a great nationwide propaganda in its behalf. the result of this propaganda has been that the real facts are unknown to the public or to editorial writers. and we face a most determined barrage of misrepresentation and error in the columns of the press. never before. in my recollection. has congress been so lashed with a whip of ignorant assumption without any basis of fact as in the case of this particular measure. i. for one. here and now. lay my protest before the senate against such methods as have been adopted in the pending case to browbeat congress by statements which have not the slightest justification in the light of known facts. that is all i wish to say on that subject at this time. i shall refer to it again. after i siall have fully laid the facts before this body as a basis for their determination of this most important problem. but because the indefensible methods to which i refer have been adopted. and so persisted in. i shall ask the senate to permit the facts to be brought before it in every instance as fully and comprehensively as may be necessary at least to enable this body to rest its determination on them instead of being misled by the innumerable misstatements that have been printed in the papers with the evident purpose of deceiving the public and improperly influencing the action of congress with reference to this legislation. the first question involved is flood protection. everybody wants flood protection for the imperial valley. and the imperial valley would have had complete and perfect flood protection long ago if they had not clung with implacable persistence to a measure in which flood protection is inseparably tied to so many other controversial questions that the friends of flood protection have found it impossible to lift that menace from the imperial valley. look at the things to which flood protection is tied in this bill: first. it is tied to a scheme to take from arizona the waters that will irrigate 3.000.000 acres of otherwise irreclaimable desert. and devote that water to the reclamation of any where from 1.000.000 to 2.000.000 acres below the line in mexico. second. it is tied to a scheme to reclaim approximately 500.000 acres of new and as yet unreclaimed lands in -the imperial valley at a time when. to say the least. the people of the east are set against the reclamation of any more land to increase the agricultural output of the united states of america. third. it is tied to a scheme to put the government into the power business. at least to the extent of building a great power dam and working out plans to get its money back by the sale of power. which is a nev function of the government. and one of the most controversial and bitterly contested questions before the country todayso much so that the muscle shoals project has been hopelessly bogged down in it for years. with no apparent prospect as yet that a satisfactory solution will be found. at least not for a long time yetand. notwithstanding that. we are belabored day after day because we do not rush to the rescue of a community which up till now has said to us: . we must have hell). but we refuse to accept it unless you will at the same time give the water of the colorado river to mexico to irrigate more than a million acres of land. and also reclaim 500.000 acres of new lands in the imperial valley. and also put the government into the power business. that is not all by any manner of means. congress is asked to override and trample underfoot the most sacred and deeply rooted rights of a sovereign state by creating an alliance of six states against one state in a permanent plan to force that one remaining state either to fight for its life singlehanded against the allied influences of the federal government. working hand in glove with the six other states. or to surrender to that combination of allied influences and permit its future to be destroyed by a ratification of the socalled santa fe sevenstate colorado river compact. which can not but utterly destroy the future of arizona. that is exactly what a ratification of that sevenstate compact will do to the state of arizona. it will destroy its future development. it will leave it within a generation a pile of ashes. a sandswept and irreclaimable desert. instead of one of the richest and most fertile and productive agricultural states of the union. i make that statement to the senate with all the earnestness that i possess. i make it seriously and advisedly. and when i reach that point in my discussion of this measure i shall prove every word of that general statement to the last detail. i refer to it now merely to emphasize the fact that instead of in reality wanting flood protection. what the proponents of this bill really want is to take from the state of arizona her birthright and the heritage of her people. to rob the children of the future for the benefit of other states and a group of american land speculators in mexico. as i have said to the senate before. arizona is fighting with her back to the wall. and she will continue to fight for her future life as a state as long as there is a breath left in her body. what else can sh. do? she faces ruin if she fails to win that battle. she will fight for justice in the halls of congress and in the courts until she escapes from this menace that has been hung over her by the proponents of the santa fecolorado river compact. is it not a most appalling condition of affairs when a statestands ready to go the limit to give protection to a \"neighbor across the way\" from the flood menace and is told that she will not be allowed to extend that help unless she will yield up her whole future hope of development and submit to be stripped of her most indispensable rights and inalienable property? i am not at this time proposing to lay before the senate the facts sustaining those general declarations. i shall do that later when the facts proving them have all been presented. in the meantime i appeal to you senators. to each and every one of you. to put yourselves in the place of my state of arizona. and see what you would think of it if your state were called a \"dog in the manger\" because you refused to submit to ruin in order that the imperial valley might have a particular method of flood protectiona method wholly unnecessary. because complete and absolute flood protection for the imperial valley may be had without asking arizona to surrender any of her rights as a sovereign state which are necessary to her future prosperity. we have not only been called a \"dog in the manger\". we have again and again had the lash cracked over us because we would not accept a scheme that would tear up by the roots the whole system of rights by appropriation and substitute for it an unworkable scheme of apportionment. launching an endless era of litigation. and making the irrigated homes of arizona in years of drought subject to a demand that they should supply a deficiency in mexico. with all the force and power i possess. i resent and repudiate and protest against that attitude toward arizona. but the most reprehensible thing about it is that we are charged with these heinous offenses for what reason? why. forsooth. because we say to our friends in the imperial valley: \"we want you to have flood protection. we will work with you with all our strength to secure it for you. we will work with you for it. not only as a matter of neighborly good will but also because communities in arizona are threatened by the same danger of flood devastation that hangs over you. we want flood protection for them. and we want it without delay. all we ask of you is that you separate your demand for flood protection from controversial schemes that make flood protection impossible if you tie it to them.\" is there anything unreasonable about that? can any justification be found for those who must have flood protection refusing to accept it unless arizona can be compelled to commit harikari. or strip herself of otherwise inalienable rights without which she faces eventual ruin as a state? i insist that there is no possible justification for such a proposition as that in which we have been placed by the proponents of the pending measure. mr. president. the first thing i am going to do is to show. beyond the shadow of a doubt. that the imperial valley and the yuma valley and the coachella valley and the palo verde valley and every other floodinenaced valley or acre in the lower basin of the colorado river can be protected from the danger of floods. protected more quickly. protected more effectively than it can by this boulder canyon project. by another plan that involves none of the controversial elements that have delayed this bill and would prevent flood protection under it. even though it were enacted. it is as certain as fate that if this bill were enacted at this session its only effect would be to launch us on a sea of litigation the end of which no human vision could see. it would defeat the very purpose which we are constantly told by newspapers which seem determined to force this bill through. right or wrong. is the reason why we should rush the bill through without proper consideration. i say \"without proper consideration \" because this bill involves the most complex problems of constitutional law. of interstate law. of the rights of states to the waters of the states. that have ever been involved. so far as my knowledge goes. in any bill pending before the congress of the united states. yet we have had no opportunity to present our side of the case to any committee having jurisdiction of those questions. this bill. whatever else may be done with it. should not be passed until it has been referred to and considered by the judiciary committees of both the senate and the house of representatives. in addition to that. as i shall make clear beyond question before i close my remarks. the bill raises innumerable questions of an international character. questions affecting our foreign relations so profoundly. questions affecting the national defense and the safety of the nation from foreign complications and aggression. questions involving every problem of asiatic competition. the enforcement of our immigration laws. and the maintenance of decent moral conditions along the border. that it can not properly be brought before the senate for passage until those questions have been considered by a committee having jurisdiction over them. and that committee is the committee on foreign relations. it seems to me. mr. president. that i have shown enough good and unanswerable reasons why the present bill. if its iewspaper advocates are sincer2 in their almost daily declarations that it must be passed \"willynilly \"-passed whether right or wrong. passed when there can not be time for its proper consideration at this session of congress by either the senate or the house of representatives. because the imperial valley must have flood protectionis nothing but a snare and a delusion when it comes to the question of flood protection. and that flood protection is. in fact. nothing but a peg on which to hang reclamation of vast areas in mexico. reclamation of another 500.000 acres in the imperial valley. water power development by the federal government. and the ratification of the santa fecolorado river compact. with all its unfair and unconstitutional provisions. it is time that some one took the bull by the horns and put before congress and before the country a definite. concrete. plain. simple. and genuine plan for flood control that can be put through at this session of congress. and thereby give flood protection to the imperial valley and all other floodmenaced sections of the lower basin of the colorado river. it is an indispensable prerequisite to such a plan. if it is to be possible of adoption by congress and to actually secure flood protection for these floodmenaced valleys and sections. that it shall be simplified. it must be separated from all the intricacies and complexities and controversies in which the pending bill has been involved by its original proponents and all who have since taken a hand at it and complicated it still more. the plan must be split away from reclamation in mexico. it must be split away from reclamation in the imperial valley. it must be split away from any scheme to involve it in the bitter controversy between the advocates of public and private power development. and last but not least it must be split away from every contact with a colorado river compact designed to give to land speculators in mexico and take from arizona water enough to irrigate 3.000.000 acres in arizona. and fasten around the neck of arizona forever an obligation to furnish a deficiency in mexico in seasons of drought and water shortage. the almost inconceivable and unbelievable thing in connection with this whole campaign under the banner of flood protection for the imperial valley is that such a simple plan had not been presented to congress years ago. instead of delaying flood protection while all these controverted questions were being fought to a finish by bitterly opposing interests. the plan i shall propose is in no sense a personal one. it is nothing more than the application to the needs of the present situation of some common sense in the selection of the things that must and can be done to give full and complete protection against floods to the imperial valley without complications causing endless delay. the first necessity of the imperial valley is for immediate levee protection. before flood protection can be accomplished by reservoir storage at boulder canyon or elsewhere a dam must be built that it will take several years to construct. why wait for that? congress has shown its willingness to provide levee protection on the colorado river. just as it does on the mississippi river. by more than one generous appropriation for levee construction. a great flood on the colorado river is said to be threatened this year. i believe there is not one senator in this body who would not gladly vote. before we adjourn for this session. an adequate appropriation as an emergency matter to save the imperial valley from the menace of the flood that is expected to reach that country this very year. therefore. i say. the first thing the imperial valley needs for flood protection is an emergency appropriation at this sessiofi of congress to protect it from the flood that is said to be already anticipated before the coming summer is over. the next thing is an adequate appropriation for a levee system that will protect the valley during the interval of time necessary for the building of a storage reservoir for flood protection. it does not matter where that storage reservoir is located. it will take so long to build it that the only safeguard available for the period of construction is a levee system. neither an emergency appropriation to meet the exigencies arising from the danger of a flood this coming summer. nor an appropriation to so perfect the levee system that it will afford complete and certain protection until storage dams can be built are involved in any of the complications that are delaying this pending bill. all the machinery for the expenditure of those appropriations and time doing of the work promptly and well now exists. let the people of the imperial valley ask for these appropriations. and there is small doubt that they would get them with a promptness that would surprise them. an appropriation asked for by me for the protection of my constituents under the yuma reclamation project in arizona from the floods of the colorado river was granted by the senate at this session most graciously and almost unanimously. .i can see no reason why the same spirit of helpfulness should not be extended to the imperial valley. if its people were to do what seems to me the only sensible thing they can do. and ask through their own representatives in congress for the same consideration that i have asked for in behalf of my constituents. if mr. swing. who represents the imperial valley in congress. fails. neglects. or refuses to ask for these necessary appropriations to meet this years emergency. apparently a very pressing one. or the necessary appropriations to insure safety for his people pending the construction of storage reservoirs for flood protection. i fail to see any reason why any rocks should be thrown at arizona or why she should be held responsible. or why congress should be held responsible for any disaster that may befall the imperial valley pending the construction of flood storage reservoirs for flood protection. which in the very nature of things can not be built with a rush. great engineering structures of that character can not be built in a hurry. it took well onto 10 years to build and completely finish the roosevelt dam. it therefore seems to me that we can hardly undertake to force levee protection on the imperial valley. the suggestion i have made has been very seriously made. but as yet i hardly feel that i ought to include emergency or temporary levee protection in a plan for flood protection which it will take several years to accomplish. but which still can be done sooner than the boulder canyon project. the first unit of the storage reservoir plan for the protection of the imperial and yuma valleys should be the building of a floodcontrol dam at sentinel. on the gila river. in arizona. that is a wellknown site and it has been approved for a floodcontrol dam by the reclamation service. some years ago an examination of the site was made for a storage reservoir for reclamation. but the engineers who made the examination did not approve it for such a reservoir. several years afterwards another examination was made of the same site for a floodstorage dam for flood protection only. and the site was approved for that purpose. in order to make my position so clear that there can be no possible misapprehension about it. i want to explain more fully the conditions on the gila. the gila river flows into the colorado a short distance above yuma and below the laguna dam. which is about 12 miles above yuma. it is one of the most erratic. treacherous. and dangerous flood rivers of the world. it drains an area of 56.500 square miles in arizona and new mexico. in united states geological survey water supply paper no. 395. issued in 1916. by e. j. la rue. on page 95. the gila river is described. the last paragraph of the description being as follows: the flow of the gila is very irregular and the daily. monthly. and annual flow is subject to large variations. during the last 12 years the total annual runoff of the gila at yuma. ariz.. has ranged from less than 100.000 acrefeet to more than 3.000.000 acrefeet. with that sort of a river to deal with. you never can tell what it may do in any year of the future. it has not yet at any time within the comparatively brief period covered by our records and knowledge of the river come out at flood when the colorado was also at flood. notwithstanding that. on more than one occasion a flood from the gila. coming out on top of the colorado when that river was not at flood. has caused the colorado below the mouth of the gila to rise to heights which are dangerous to the present levee system. the tables of discharge of the gila from january. 1904. to december. 1906. will be found .on page 113 of water supply paper 395. they show that in the period from january to september. 1904. the total runoff from the gila into the colorado river was only 187.000 secondfeet. of which 140.000 was in august of that year. in the period from october. 1904. to september. 1905. inclusive. the total runoff was 3.050.000 secondfeet. of which 3.010.710 secondfeet was in the months of january to september. 1905. in february. 1905. the runoff was 680.000 secondfeet. in march 1.020.000 secondfeet. and in april 768.000 secondfeet. in a country where the rainy season is so uncertain. variable. and erratic as in arizona there is no safe assurance that the gila will never come out at flood when the colorado river is at flood. but if the colorado were not in existence a levee system would have to be maintained to protect the imperial valley from floods coming entirely from the gila. unless that stream were controlled by reservoirs. in the course of time that may be done sufficiently to largely lessen the flood menace from the gila river. the coolidge dam will control the floods above san carlos. the dam now being built on the agua fria at frog tanks will control the agua fria up to a certain point. but that leaves an enormous area of the entire drainage basin uncontrolled. the greatest difficulty with reference to flood protection is that plans are made for flood control in all ordinary years. and even for extraordinary years. up to a certain point. but it seems almost impossible to get flood menaced communities to realize that it is the history of floods the world over that at long intervals great superfloods occur which go far beyond everything anticipated. and do enormous damage which might"},{"1":"1926","2":"HUDDLESTON","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"i do not yield to the

repudiating the commission on the report they sent in at the close of the last session?\\n690013642|i so interpret it. i do not know what other interpretation can be given. they propose to wipe out what the muscle shoals commission did and start all over again. now. i want to say this. electric energy is too valuable to be used for the production of power. i want gentlemen not familiar with the subject to consider that carefully. you can not afford to use electric energy to run street cars and to turn wheels. it is worth too much to industry to be used for such purposes. what use do they make of the electric energy -generated at niagara falls? what do they use it for? in buffalo. 30 miles away. practically all the power that is used is generated by coal hauled 200 miles from pennsylvania. electricity is too valuable at niagara falls to be used for lights and power by a city only 30 miles away. what is it used for? the biggest share of it is used by the aluminum company in smelting aluminum. the next biggest share is used by the union carbide co. in producing carbide. then there is the carborundum company and the concerns producing quick steel and steel alloys and various other things that require the electric furnace. they are the people who can use electricity to the best advantage. you can not afford to use it for power when you can use it in electric furnaces. why is that? in electric furnaces from 2.500 to 3.500 degrees of heat may be developed. you can not generate that much heat by combustion. except with greatest difficulty. somewhere from 1.200 degrees to 2.000 degrees of heat is about all that you can do with combustion. therefore. when you are dealing with products that require this intense heat you must use the electrid furnace. these are facts that i am stating to you. the electric energy generated at niagara falls is worth twice as much to the aluminum company and the carbide company and the carborundum company and the steelalloy concerns as it is to anybody for turning wheels or pulling street cars.\\n690013643|does the gentleman consider that the use of the word power in the resolution excludes uses about which he is speaking now?\\n690013644|absolutely. heat does not come from power. electric furnaces are not heated by power. electricity never becomes power until it takes a certain form which adapts it to the turning of wheels and the pulling of cars. you do not use power in an electric furnace. you use energy. you exclude the electric furnace by using the word power. i do not think that the committee really meant to exclude bidders who want to heat electric furnaces. i do not think they really meant to say. oh. no. you shall not use any of this for industry. i do not think they meant that. i think they did not know just what they were doing. i am trying to be as light on them as i can. they were just ignorant. i am sure i would never attribute to my good friend from alabama. mr. bankhead. whom i love and respect. any thought except of the very highest and most patriotic. particularly as regards his native state. he is one of our very ablest and best members. but i invite him to consider with all deliberation what i have said. of course. he has his conscience. and that is a serious thing. but he also has the people of alabama to answer to. if they know that there is a joker in this resolution. and believe that its purpose is to keep from bidding on muscle shoals those industrial interests that could use it to the best advantage. i do not think they will take it in very good spirit. the thing for those to do who are responsible for this resolution is to put it before this house in such shape so that it can be amended. you bring this resolution here and say. here is this lozenge. swallow it. darn you.. swallow it. have all the andy gumps come to congress? * are we so simple that we will take the pill whether we like it or not? you will never get this resolution through the senate in its present form. i suppose a good many will accept that as a justification for voting for it and say.  oh. well. it will not pass anyhow. if that is the congressional method. god spare the country from it! i do not favor government ownership and operation for muscle shoals. it is not an ideal situation for such operation. if the supply of water was constant and it was a 365dayayear proposition as it is at niagara falls. i should say that it would be a crime against the country to turn it over to private exploitation. but it is not. the primary power is available there only from six to nine months in the year. and there are times duriffg the year when there is only a very small amount of energy available because the water is so low. the ideal proposition for muscle shoals was the offer made by mr. ford. he could have operated muscle shoals at great advantage to himself and to the country. he would have used electric furnaces there to make the materials that he needs in his business. he would have operated the nitrate plant and instead of selling the power generally over the country and depending on that for the balance of his income. he would have gathered together a lot of workingmen and begun the production of aluminum and quick steel and other things that he needs for his automobiles.\\n690013645|the time of the gentleman from alabama has expired.\\n690013646|mr. speaker. i yield five minutes to the gentleman from new york .\\n690013647|mr. speaker. i have constantly opposed every measure that has been brought in looking toward giving muscle shoals to private operation. i make no bones about that. i believe this plant. after the government has spent over $140.000.000 upon it. should not be turned over to private operation. if i believed that this plant under private operation was going to provide cheaper fertilizer for the farmers of the country i might not oppose it. you are not going to get cheaper fertilizer. and the time is not distant when you will realize it. if all of the speeches in favor of private operation of muscle shoals made on the floor of this house could be converted into fertilizer we would have the richest soil on earth. i predict that the farmers of the country will derive no benefit. fertilizer produced by a private corporation operating for profits will cost as much as it does today. this resolution is only a conscience easer. they are bringing in one resolution after another so that they will finally justify themselves in turning over this plant to private operation. it is a sham. it is a mockery. do you not suppose the favored lessee has already been selected. and yet in the last days of the last congress we were told to vote for a resolution on a vive voce vote to appoint a commission to study the proposition. and when the commission finally decided that it is doubtful whether the plants can be profitably leased and the rights of the government protected. and that in all likelihood against their own will government operation is the only solution. you come in with a resolution immediately upon the publication of the report. and you are going to jam it tllrough the house. i know i have not a chance in the world to defeat this resolution. but for the purpose of the reco1d i now prophesy that the distinguished gentlemen from the state of alabama will be the first to see the folly of their attitude. it will not take long for the country to learn that the greatest power plant in the world belonging to all of the people has been given to some favorite corporation for private profits. and it will not be long before the farmers of the country realize that they have been bunkoed again. i have no quarrel with the republican side of the house. their lresident. the acknowledged leader of their party. recoiniends this measure. and you are going through with it. and you arc assuming the responsibility for it. he is not only the acknowledged leader of the republican party. he is also. by acquiescence and by the conduct of the minority in this house. the leader of the present democratic party in this country. you can not get away from it. gentlemen. you are jumping through the hoop. you gentlemen on the democratic side are more regular republicans than the most regular on the irpublican side of the house. why. if this conduct of the house continues. by which you acquiesce in everything that comes along in this bipartisan spirit. we should put a sign on the doors of this house reading.  stop thinking. ye who enter here. we are not supposed to think any more. recommendations and unanimous reports come out of committees. time is limited. we virtually go on our knees asking for five minutes time. it is given to us because they know we have not any chance at all. this morning that very important resolution of inquiry to the state department was passed in the same way. an d now you come along with the greatest project. the most valuable piece of property in the hands of the government. and with the pretense that you are going to provide cheaper fertilizer you are going to jam it through. oh. you are going to provide better dividends for some eastern investors!\\n690013648|mr. speaker. will the gentleman yield?\\n690013649|is that statement of yours absolutely true as to the allotment of time? did i not offer the gentleman five minutes? as fair as i was to you. do you say that?\\n690013650|i submit to the gentleman that five minutes is not sufficient to oppose a measure of this magnitude.\\n690013651|the time of the gentleinn from new york has expired.\\n690013652|mr. speaker. i yield five minutes to the gentlenman from south dakota .\\n690013653|the gentleman from south dakota is recognized for five minutes.\\n690013654|mr. speaker and gentlemen of the house. most of you people who are present today know my attitude as to muscle shoals and what i think ought to be done with it. there is one thing. however. that i think i shall be able to prove to the satisfaction of this house if i can get the time sometime in the future. regardless of what its attitude may be as to muscle shoals and its development. and that is that it can never be successfully operated as a fertilizer plant. the idea that we are going to get cheaper fertilizer as the result of the operation of muscle shoals or any lease that can be made is the sheerest kind of bunk. this cry of cheap fertilizer is a sham battle of the first order. it has not any basis of fact. and no facts can be established which would warrant anyone in believing that such can be secured by private or other operation. any man who knows anything about chemistry. or anything about electric power. or anything about the manufacture of fertilizer. or anything about the new processes practiced in europe. in germany and other places where fertilizer is made. knows that you can not manufacture nitrates at muscle shoals by means of electric power in competition either with the importations or the domestic manufacture by chemical means. it simply can not be done. in other words. the idea of holding muscle shoals as a great fertilizer proposition for the benefit of the american farmer to my mind is nothing more than a camouflage held out here to deceive us respecting the real purpose of this resolution. leasing the plant is not going to give us any cheaper fertilizer. and it is not going to give us any chance to get our money back. in order to get cheaper fertilizer at muscle shoals what do you propose to do? what (lid the ford proposition purport to do? you have got to pay to the operator of the nitrate plant an enormous subsidy in the way of free electric energy. and even then i doubt if it is possible to manufacture nitrates in competition with importers or with manufacturers using modern processes ill this country. muscle shoals can be operated by the government beyond any possible question for industrial and power purposes. and be made to return its entire cost. however extravagant that may be. in a period of less than 30 years. that can be conclusively proven to any man whose eyes are not blinded and whose ears are not estopped to see and hear the facts. what is the purpose of this resolution? certainly the purpose of it is to prevent any possibility of government:n operation. the gentleman from illilois. mr. mckenzie. stood before this house at the last session and defended the ford proposition. he was against tiny kind of governmental operation. but. mr. speaker. like any other student who has given his time and attention to the question aud honestly studied the facts. with a view to finding that solution which is the fairest and most just to the people. he was driven to the conclusion before he got through that the most feasible method after ill was governmental operation. at any rate. that is the way i read his conclusion as head of the muscle shoals inquiry commission. this plant can not be leased for the purposes designated in this resolution or for the purposes designated in the original act and be nmade a success. and if it operated as a fertilizer proposition it will prove to be a white elephant on our hands. if this resolution is adopted in its present form and the committee assigned to carry out its purpose brings in a recommendhtion in accordance with its terms. it is not going to release the stranglehold on the south so far as fertilizer is concerned. and what is more. it is going to find the clutches of the general electric co. and the alabama power co. gripping its throat with added tension. you are not going to have any reduction in rates. neither are you going to have very much additional power for industrial purposes. you are not going to have anything that will benefit the south to any great extent. you can not ship fertilizer more than 300 miles. the freight cost is too heavy. the only kind of a fertilizer plant that is successful anywhere is a local fertilizer plant that takes care of its own territory. you can not ship fertilizer across the continent. you can ship it only within comparatively short distances for local consumption. in addition to tlat. so far as that feature is concerned. i object to the plant being held out as a fertilizer proposition and the attempt to make the american farmer believe that it is going to benefit him by providing cheaper fertilizer when it ought to be known that this will not be the result.\\n690013655|mr. speaker. i yield three miutes to the gentleman from alabama .\\n690013656|if this resolution was susceptible of the interpretation which the gentleman from alabama. my colleague leston].. seems to think. no representative from any of the states adjacent to muscle shoals would favor its passage. the resolution. in my opinion. will confer on any special committee that may be appointed thereunder full authority to consider any lease of this property in line with the terms. conditions. and purposes proposed ill the offer subimitted by mr. ford. subject to two limitationsone that no part of the property is to be sold and the other that no lease shall extend for more than 50 years. the rules committee by the resolution emphasizes its desire and the desire of the house that any special committee appointed thereunder must give special consideration to offers in line with the ford proposal. this clearly appears from its reference to h. r. 518. sixtyeighth congress. first session. which bill embodied the ford proposal in full. the chairman and other memlers of the rules committee have stated this to be tleir interpretation of the resolution. and if it passes no committee appointed could question their authority to consider a lease along these broad lines. let me read a part of the resolution: the committee is authorized and directed to comiduct negoiiatiois for a lease of the nitrate and power properties of the united states at muscle shoals. ala.. including the quarry properties at waco. ala.. for the production of nitrales primarily and incidentally for power purposes. in order to serve national defense. agriculture. and industrial purposes.\\n690013657|the time of the gentleman from alabama has expired.\\n690013658|mr. speaker. i yield five minutes to the gentleman from maryland .\\n690013659|mr. speaker and gentlemen of the house. this matter is vital to the farmers of the nation as well as to national defense. on the 4th of march. 1924. the house took up the consideration of the rule under which the mckenzie bill was discussed. and the house spent weeks in a full discussion of h. r. 518. dealing with muscle shoals. and the amendments which were offered to it. h. it. 518 then went to the senate. the senate proposed an entirely new bill. based on an entirely different theory. and the bill. with the proposed amendments. did not pass. this concurrent resolution. providing for a joint committee. to be known as the muscle shoals committee. does not make any finl disposition of the muscle shoals question. but this proposed resolution does. we all hope. put the muscle shoals proposition into shape for final disposition. it ought to be settled. and this resolution is so broad in its terms that it ought to provide. and apparently does provide. an ultimate method for the solution of this question. tile joint committee proposed to be created by this resolution is not to have any final power. final power rests entirely with the house. but this joint committee is authorized to negotiate for a lease upon the general terms. so far as possible. for nationaldefense purposes and agricultural purposes that were set forth in h. r. 518. now. on march 4. 1924. on page 3561 of volume 65. part 4 of the rcord of the sixtyeighth congress. first session. i presented to the house an analysis of h. r. 518. which is as follows: itkenzih bill. 11. a. 518 1.

me a provision of the rules that says it must lay over for one day?\\n690013677|that is the custom.\\n690013678|will the gentleman show me any provision in the rules that provides that?\\n690013679|that has been the custom.\\n690013680|we are talking about the rules. not custom or practices.\\n690013681|i admit there is no such rule. but i can show you precedents where on one occasion mr. joe walsh. of massachusetts. raised the question. and where mr. mann. of illinois. raised the question. and where other members of this house have raised the same question. that such a bill must be printed and lay over for one day.\\n690013682|the gentleman did not answer my question. i want to know the provision he refers to in the rules. when you raise a point of order you must have some provision of the rules in mind to maintain your point.\\n690013683|there are customs in this house which are not written into the rules that come from the gentlemans committee on rules but which are nevertheless observed by the house. long custom here makes the precedents of the house. and where the question has been raised the chair in each case has decided that such bills must be printed. but i am willing. if the chair wants to do it. for the chair to decide now that the committee on appropriations has a right to bring in bills of 110 pages. such as this will contain. and seeking to appropriate $226.473.638 of the peoples money. such as this bill seeks to appropriate. without a single member knowing what all is in such a bill. i think the membership of this house ought to know what is in these supply bills. and i do not think the committee on appropriations ought to be permitted to bring in a bill here until it has laid over at least one day. so as to give us an opportunity to study and know what is in the bill. and -therefore i submit the point of order to the chair. and the chair understands that i only make it because the majority leader asks it be made. and we ought to have a ruliag so that we may know how to proceed in the future. he wants a decision of the chair. and he seems to anticipate what the decision of the chair will be. but i do not think he knows what the chair is going to decide.\\n690013684|mr. speaker. it is not my desire to discuss the point of order. the merits of which i have not investigated and which is not raised by the desire of the appropriations committee. i simply want to say that the appropriations committee regards itself as the servant of the house. and it appearing to be the unanimous desire of the house to proceed with the general debate today we have sought to call this bill up in order that members may have the opportunity. having given assurance that the actual consideration of the bill by paragraphs will not be attempted today. but to engage in general debate. the point of order has been raised and gentlemen here are prepared to discuss it. i simply want the attitude of the appropriations committee placed before the house.\\n690013685|mr. speaker. unfortunately we are not discussing the policy of doing this or whether we approve or not. the question is: has the committee the right to do it? section 56 of rule xi providesthe followingnamed committees shall have leave to report at any time on the matters herein stated. among other committees it says: the committees having jurisdiction of the general appropriation bills. it is the same provision under which the committee on rules has reported at any time. although there was a modification of it as far as the rules committee is concerned in the last congress. but as. far as i know there is no provision in the rules which has changed the provision of the rule with reference to the committee on appropriations reporting at any time. they have here reported the regular interior appropriation bill. it is a general bill. entirely within the meaning and understanding of the rule. and no one has pointed out or suggested any provision in the present rules that prohibit its being taken up immediately. certainly no point of order can lie against it. and the committee is entirely right in asking immediate consideration.\\n690013686|mr. speaker. i want to call attention to the fact that we have here only a copy of the committee print of the interior department appropriation bill. it has not been available to the members of the house until within the last hour. my own case is typical of the situation in which many of the members find themselves. the committee has made no provision for the maintenance of the belle fourche project in my district that has cost the government over $3.500.000. they are going to lay it aside. put it on the shelf. by withholding an appropriation. that is an illustration of what will continue to happen if bills are to be taken up without any opportunity to examine their provisions in advance. the belle fourche project is of great importance to my district and to the nation as a whole. i submit that it is unfair to press the bill for immediate consideration. it is unfair to the membership of the house to bring up a bill for consideration before the bill is available to members and before there is an opportunity to examine its provisions.\\n690013687|mr. speaker. i withdraw the point of order.\\n690013688|mr. speaker. i make the point of order.\\n690013689|too late to do it now.\\n690013690|oh. no. it is not.\\n690013691|i have reserved a point of order.\\n690013692|mr. speaker. i wish to call attention to a further provision in the manual: the right of reporting at any time gives the right to immediate consideration of the ilouse. that is a part of clause 7. rule xxiii in the manual.\\n690013693|mr. speaker. i think there can be no question as to the point of order. it is clearly in order to call up this bill now. i wish to call attention to some questions of fact raised. which i think ought not to go unchallenged. it was the gentleman from texas. i believe. who spoke of the.bill not being on the calendar. i heard this bill reported today and heard the announcement from the desk that it was referred to the committee of the whole house on the state of the union. therefore it went immediately to the calendar and is now on the calendar of the whole house on the state of the union. as to a copy of the bill being available. the gentleman from michigan stated this morning when he brought in the bill that there were copies of this bill already printed and available for the membership of the house. the only difference being that these copies of the bill do not contain the number of the bill. in other words. the bill had been printed just as later introduced. but. of course. the committee did not know the number of the bill in advance. the bill which has been printed is available as introduced. and nobody would be taken by surprise even if we now proceeded to consider the bill under the fiveminute rule. which there is no intention of doing.\\n690013694|does the gentleman say that copies of the bill are now available?\\n690013695|i hold in my hand a copy of the bill and also a copy of the report. both ofwhich are available to the membership of the house. so that there is no question of a surprise.\\n690013696|mr. speaker. the real situation is that requests for general debate would indicate that there is a very good prospect that there will be three days before consideration of the bill under the fiveminute rule is reached. in which time the membership will have plenty of time to familiarize themselves with the provisions of the bill.\\n690013697|mr. speaker. will the gentleman yield?\\n690013698|what is the number of the bill?\\n690013699|the clerk at the desk has the number. i have not the number at hand.\\n690013700|the chair is prepared to rule.\\n690013701|mr. speaker. i want to ask the gentleman from new york a question. does the gentleman think that it is good practice. that it is treat.ing the membership of the house with proper consideration. they being national legislators. to bring in a bill which appropriates over $100.000.000 and have them immediately begin its consideration without any opportunity for them to become acquainted with its provisions?\\n690013702|mr. speaker. in reply to the gentleman let imi say that i am not discussing whether i think it is right or not. i am discussing whether a committee has a right to do it under the rules of the house.\\n690013703|the gentleman will admit that there are very many things that are considered improper. even indecent. in good society that are not expressly prohibited by written law. mr. spehker. it strikes me that of all of the extraordinary attempts to work in pure machine politics this is one of the most remarkable illustrations i have yet seen in all my career in the house.\\n690013704|it has been on the bulletin board for three days that we expected to consider this bill this morning.\\n690013705|that has nothing to do with it. you are bringing in a bill for immediate consideration. and if you can bring this bill up for consideration in this way without any opportunity for the rest of us to examine it. the appropriations committee can bring in any other bill in the same way. it does not give the house a fair chance.\\n690013706|the chair is prepared to rule. the chair is quite prepared to concede that as a general rule it is better procedure in reporting a bill of grave importance like thisan appropriation billto permit it to lie over for one day. the chair is not called upon to rule on that question. however. if he were. on this particular occasion he would say that the most abundant fairness is given to every member of the house. in view of the statement of the gentleman from michigan . in charge of the bill. that there will be three days of general debate. but the chair is not called upon to decide that question. the only question before the chair is whether under the rules it is in order to bring up for consideration a privileged bill on the day on which the bill and the report are presented. there is no question in the chairs mind on that point at all. there is nothing in the rules that provides that a bill of this sort. a privileged bill. shall lie over for one day. even in the case of bills not privileged there is nothing in the rules which provides that while the report and the bill must be printed they can not be considered on the day they are reported. the chair does not think there is any possible doubt about the situation in this case. the chair. therefore. overrules the point of order.\\n690013707|mr. speaker. the requests for time in the discussion of the bill have been so numerous that i think it would not be safe to fix the limit for general debate at this time without a chance of doing injustice to some members who either desire to debate the bill or to study its provisions before it is taken up under the fiveminute rule. therefore at this time i siiply request that the general debate upon the bill be equally divided. onehalf to be under the control of the gentleman from oklahoma and onehalf by myself.\\n690013708|the gentleman from michigan asks unanimous consent that general debate upon the bill be divided equally. half to be under the control of the gentleman from oklahoma and half under the control of himself. is there objection?\\n690013709|mr. speaker. reserving the right to object. will the gentleman yield?\\n690013710|when does the gentleman expect to bring up the matter of fixing the time for debate? the first thing in the morning?\\n690013711|it is my idea that we would let the debate proceed until we have a fairly accurate idea as to the amount of time that will be necessary. it being the desire of the committee to give the fullest possible opportunity for debate on the bill. my reason for not fixing the time now is not that we might fix too long a time. but that we might fix too short a time.\\n690013712|i do not desire to object. if that is the case.\\n690013713|is there objection?\\n690013714|the question is on the motion of the gentleman from michigan that the house resolve itself into the committee of the whole house on the state of the union for the consideration of the interior department appropriation bill.\\n690013715|mr. chairman. i ask unanimous consent that the first reading of the bill be dispensed with.\\n690013716|the gentleman from michigan asks umanimous consent that the first reading of the bill be dispensed with. is there objection?\\n690013717|mr. speaker. reserving the right to object. i desire to ask a question for information. does the gentleman from michigan know whether or not this bill contains a little item of appropriation on behalf of the omaha indians?\\n690013718|is that an item that had some consideration in the last congress? lxvii97\\n690013719|and that failed of enactment?\\n690013720|that item is not in the budget and is not in this bill.\\n690013721|is there objection to the request of the gentleman from michigan?\\n690013722|mr. chairman. just a moment. i do not talk as rapidly as some of the others. and i might get down to a real objection pretty soonbut i guess i will not.\\n690013723|mr. chairman. reserving the right to object. the gentleman from michigan does not mean to tell the committee that there are no items in this bill which have not been approved by the budget?\\n690013724|no. i would not say that.\\n690013725|he has put some in this bill. and why did he not put in the gentlemans item?\\n690013726|the gentleman from nebraska asked me a question. and i answered him fully. but i did not think his question demanded of me that i give all of the reasons also.\\n690013727|i did not want the gentleman to intimate to the house that he was not putting anything in the bill except what the budget permitted.\\n690013728|mr. chairman. i demand the regular order.\\n690013729|the regular order is demanded. is there objection? the chair hears none and the first reading is dispensed with.\\n690013730|mr. chairman. i yield 20 minutes to the gentleman from pennsylvania .\\n690013731|mr. chairman. just before we adjourned for the holidays my colleague from pennsylvania placed in the record some 12 columns of observations upon important constitutional subjects. his speech has since been issued in pamphlet form. under the title constitutional innovations. and widely distributed. the gentleman from pennsylvania announces that the four constitutional amendments adopted in our own timesthose providing for the income tax. direct election of united states senators. prohibition. and woman suffrageare in violation of the spirit of the constitution of the united states. my colleague preaches a strange doctrine in a peoples government. he proves that burke was in error when he declared it impossible to indict an entire nation. in this speech not only the fundamental principles of the american republic are indicted. but the american people as well. the grave responsibility resting upon those who favor these amendments is expressed in this rather involved fashion: the legislator who does or the individual who would trespass upon or do violence to the spirit of the constitution is a greater menace to our representative form of government than he who breaks its letter. in other words. the member of congress who favors any or all of these constitutional enactments is doing a deadlier injury to the republic than the willful violator of the mandates of the constitution and the laws made in harmony therewith. certainly that doctrine may well be termed an innovation. surely it is a new and startling theory that the legislator or citizen who faithfully supports the constitution in its entirety. amendments and all. is perhaps unconsciously but none the less in reality assailing the spirit of our government and is guilty of worse than open crime. as could be expected. my colleague can identify the spirit of the constitution. he has isolated the life germ of that great charter. he can put his hand upon it. weigh it. and measure it as a substantial. material thing. he says: these four things embody the spirit of the constitution: the dual form. the independence of legislative. executive. and judicial departments. the republican form in sharp contrast to a democracy. and the limitations on the powers of majorities. even from such a premise the conclusions reached by the gentleman are not warranted. but i believe the premise to be wholly mistaken. these four things cited are no more the spirit of the constitution than the hands and feet are the spirit of man. these features are but mechanical contrivances to carry out the spirit of the constitutionthe wisest and best contrivances that could be invented when the constitution was adopted. conceivably every one of them could be profoundly modified in the light of new and changed conditions and yet the spirit of the constitution remain untouched. if the spirit of this great charter of free government can be defined in its own words. it will most reasonably be found in\\n690013732|will the gentleman yield for a question?\\n690013733|i would like to first finish with these indictments. but i will yield to the gentleman from illinois-.\\n690013734|the gentleman has referred to various indictments. and i would like to inquire in what court they are going to be tried.\\n690013735|right here in this assembly of the peoples representatives. this question involves the duties and obligations of members of congress. if i can help secure a verdict consistent with fundamental americanism. i shall be very glad. mr. chairman. the eleventh indictment is that it --the prohibition law- is used to condemn unjustly and create prejudice against the foreigners. certainly the aliens who come to the united states to benefit from the superior advantages and opportunities here should obey the laws of america. they owe a special loyalty to the laws believed by americans to be essential to the countrys welfare. when marshal foch. generalissimo of the allied armies in the world war. and general diaz. commander in chief of the italian armies. came to visit the united states as guests they announced on their arrival in new york that they proposed to scrupulously obey the prohibition law of the united states.. every newspaper in the united states carried that announcement in headlines. and the publications engaged strictly in temperance work lauded the action of these two great leaders in the most glowing terms. the same attitude is in evidence as to aliens within our gates. when they obey the laws they are praised. when they violate the laws they are condemned. the twelfth indictment iscertain acts have so long been recognized as crime that those who .commit them expect punishment. but when society outrages that innate sense of justice common to all men by imprisoning and placing the badge of criminality upon one who commits an act not recognized as a crime in the divine or moral law not only the one thus persecuted but his wife. his children. his brothers. his sisters. his neighbors. and his friends are thereby made resentful and become less dependable in case of political. industrial. or social crises. god pity the united states when the time of crisis comes and dependence must be placed in those who hold the constitution and the laws in contempt. the argument that only acts long recognized as crime should be punished is simply the declaration that everything old is sacred and everything new is dangerous. if it had been followed. not a forward step would ever have been made by mankind. when the first police department was suggested for the city of london it was bitterly opposed. every thug and thief opposed it. of course. but joined with them were some very respectable citizens. who declared that it was a new instrument in the hand of despotism to overthrow their most cherished liberties. acts are branded crime as conditions change and as the public conscience develops. adulterating and poisoning the food of the people was not regarded as a crime until the people awakened to its terrible danger. my colleague would argue that since food poisoners were not considered criminals in 1900 they should not be so considered in 1925. white slavery. sale of narcotics. swindling through fake stocks. and many other evils have been met by new laws to meet new conditions would my. colleague advocate their repeal because they are new and because. forsooth. those found guilty of their violation. with their wives. children. and other relatives. are thereby made resentful and become less dependable in time of crisis ? mr. chairman. these are the 12 specific indictments brought against the prohibition law. i submit that each and every one of them is based on a false conception of fundamental americanism. they are as fallacious as the enforcement policy laid down by my colleague in his speech. he says: inasmuch as the eighteenth amendment was presumably adopted in good faith by the several states and provided for concurrent power in enforcement it is the duty of the proper -officers of each state to cooperate in enforcing itwhy does my colleague not stop there with a straightout. clearcut statement of american principle? but he does not stop there. he robs it of that spirit through his qualification. he says: it is the duty of the proper officers of each state to cooperate in enforcing it in so far as it does not conflict with implied or guaranteed individual rights.\\n690013736|mr. chairman. will the gentleman yield?\\n690013737|i yield.\\n690013738|i did not want to interrupt the gentleman during his recital of the indictments. he refers to his colleagues seat. where is this colleague of his who fights when there is no fight on and who now in the presence of the gentlemans flashing blade is not here? is he present?\\n690013739|i will answer the question. but i hope my friend will let me proceed with my observations.\\n690013740|is he one of those who fights when the opposition is not present?\\n690013741|i informed my colleague that i intended to make a speech this afternoon in answer to his remarks. and i hope he is here.. as i said. mr. chairman. the gentleman has labored through many columns to prove that the prohibition amendment and the law does conflict with implied and guaranteed individual rights. if state officials accept his arguments. they can not. in all good conscience. help to enforce such provisions. is that to be the criterion of faithful official action? is the lawenforcement officer to decide the wisdom and justice of each law before he attempts to carry it out? nothing more absurd can be stated. but my colleague has a formula for proper national enforcement. as well as for state action. he says: the present duty of congress is clear and unmistakable. it should make liberal appropriations for enforcementwhy. oh why. does my colleague not stop there and announce a truly american policy? president coolidge did so when he called upon congress in his message for liberal appropriations for the enforcement of this salutary law. to which he pledged all the powers of the government. but it is my colleagues misfortune to use weasel qualifications which suck all the patriotic expression from his statement of proper policy. he says: congress should make liberal appropriations for enforcement if. but only if. the enforcement agencies will discharge all employees who have criminal proclivities * * * will respect the spirit of the entife constitution * * * and cooperate with no state or local official who violates the spirit of the constitution. mr. chairman. only the eye of the infinite can search out the criminal proclivities in the human heart. but no human being can come through that test entirely unscathed. in making that demand upon enforcement agencies my colleague has wiped out enforcement. but none the less surely has he annihilated any attempt at enforcement when he puts it on the basis of individual judgment as to the spirit of the constitution. holding the views he has expressed in this speech. he himself would not attempt to enforce the volstead act. for he is convinced it is in direct and dangerous violation of the spirit of the constitution. every court in the land. including the supreme court of the united states. has declared that the volstead law is constitutional and in harmony with the letter and the spirit of the constitution. the supreme court has said: that part of the prohibition amendment which embodies the prohibition is operative throughout the entire territorial limits of the united stltes. binds all legislative bodies. courts. public officers. and indiviiluals within those limits. binds all public officers! if the public officer is now to be constituted a sort of super supreme court to measure the law in relation to the spirit of the constitution. law and order disappears and chaos is come again. but the chaos thus occasioned would not be more profound than that which would come through following out the final principle of this truly remarkable speech. in. closing his constitutional observations my colleague says: a majority of either house of congress or the president. sustained in his veto by more than a third of the members of either house. may withhold appropriations at any time the enforcement agencies or the local authorities abuse their power and thus practically nullify the eighteenth amendment which is not selfenforceable. the majority thushas the whip hand which under certain circumstances it might become their patriotic duty to use. here at least is one place where my colleague might forget his inveterate hostility to majority rule. it might come to pass that a majority in congress would be justified in acting. but only for the nullification of the will of the majority of the american people as expressed in constitution and in law. that is a new definition of patriotic duty among the many new things advocated in this speech denouncing innovations. the constitution which every member of congress swears to support and defend contains the eighteenth amendment. with an imperative obligation upon congress to carry it into operation. a refusal to do so and thus to nullify the obligation is at least not a patriotic duty. justice story once said: it will be found that whenever a particular object is to be effected the language of the constitution is always imperative and can not be disregarded without violating the first principle of public duty. still more odious nullification than refusal to enact a law to carry out a constitutional provision would be refusal to provide the appropriations necessary to carry out the law. if such a procedure is followed. if a sacred constitutional mandate and the duly enacted law are nullified by the withholding of necessary appropriations our constitutional system. both in letter and in spirit. will be in greater danger than through steps toward democracy. mr. chairman. the speech of my colleague is interlarded with biblical quotations. there is one such quotation i commend to him and to every good american in this hour of divided counsels: a wise man built his house upon a rock. and the rain descended. and the floods came. and the winds blew. and beat upon that house. and it fell not. for it was founded upon a rock. in the midst of confusion and false logic and fears for time future there is one solid rock upon which the citizens of this generation may build. it is the constitution of the united states and the laws made under its authority. the citizen. whatever he believes as to prohibition. who will take the position that the constitution as our fathers framed it and as succeeding generations have amended it in orderly procedure. must and shall be obeyed. that the laws made under the authority of the constitution must and shall be respected and obeyed. that citizen is a loyal and true american. he may believe that the constitution needs further amendment and that existing laws should be amended or repealed. if he obeys them in the meantime. gives no encouragement to lawbreakers. and seeks changes through constitutional methodsand only through such methodshe is still a loyal and true american. here is the rock in the hour of doubt and discord. here is the house builded upon it. the constitution and the laws! the constitution is a greater structure than in 1789. it would not have endured so long if the house inherited from our fathers had not been built larger to meet new conditions in the struggle for life. liberty. and the pursuit of happiness. we would have proved unworthy descendants if we had not enlarged that house with the passing years had added our new conceptions of liberty. equality. and justice. the laws made in accordance with that constitution broaden with new generations. no man in all the land is

gentlemen of the house. when amadas and barlowe hove in sight of the north carolina coast in 1584 and took possession of the land in the right of the queen. to be delivered over to sir walter raleigh. then was the birthday and the birthplace of our great anglosaxon empire. it was the beginning of a new order of things in the world. another and hardier race was springing into existence which was to people the new world from the atlantic to the pacific and was to perpetuate and carry forward the torch of freedom and liberty and to found a government upon a lasting and permanent basis to be the greatest of all the world. upon the sacred soil of north carolina the first white child of america was born. around whose departed spirit was woven the beautiful indian legend that took the form of a beautiful white fawn of more than natural beauty. which at times could be seen lingering around the place of its birth. and at other times could be seen standing on the edge of the ocean gazing over the waters as longing to cross over to the home of its forefathers. and according to another indian legend was killed with an enchanted arrow by a young chief who loved virginia dare during her life. believing if he shot the fawn with the magic arrow the animal would be changed back into the lovely form of his lost virginia. notwithstanding the unsuccessful attempts of sir walter raleigh to colonize the territory which is now comprised within north carolina. the history of which attempts are so well known. the lure of its richness caused others to attempt its colonization. charles i of england first granted a charter to sir robert heath. of the southern part of virginia. latitude 31 degrees to 36 degrees. under the name and in honor of the king. as carolina. but heath did nothing under the charter. and a renewal was granted in 1663 to eight lords proprietors two years afterwards with an enlargement of the territory. the first permanent settlement being called the county of albemarle. the proprietory government under the eight proprietors lasted until 1728. when seven of them sold their interest to the crown. lord carteret. afterwards earl of granville. turned over the right of government to the crown. but retained his oneeighth interest in the land. and in 1774 he received a grant for about half of north carolina next to the virginia line. the history of the early settlers of north carolina is one of great dangers. sacrifices. and hardships. tl he cruel indian wars of 1711 and following. when so many of the early settlers were massacred. the horrible story of how john lawson. surveyor general. who was tortured by having his naked body filled with fine splinters and burned. are but some of the many things which can be related as illustrative of that period of time. these colonists were considered by some as being turbulent in charactdr. but their real grievances were the cause for such a reputation. they had wisdom to discern their rights and could take care of the attacks made upon them. our population took a most formal part in resisting the arbitrary aggressions of england. the first pitched battle of the revolution was at alamance on may 12. 1771. and at new bern on august 25. 1774. the legislature openly defied the royal governor. and on may 20. 1775. the patriots of mecklenburg met in convention and declared the independence of the colonies. and at moores creek bridge the tory highlanders were crushed in february. 1776. and on april 25. 1776. north carolina. first of all the colonies. empowered her delegates to the continental congress to vote for independence. the battles of kings mountain and guilford courthouse are written in emblazoned glory upon the pages of history. the part played by north carolina in the revolution was second to none of the original thirteen colonies. the steady increase and population of our state after the revolution was phenomenal. this remarkable growth was only arrested by the civil war. we were backward in adopting secession. but when we finally decided to enter the conflict our state. with a military population of 115.269. yet furnished 125.000 confederate soldiers. and the impartial historian has so written of our deeds in the great war that we can proudly boast that we were  first at bethel. farthest at gettysburg. and chickamauga. and last at appomattox. the ravages of the internecine conflict left our fair land despoiled and in gloom. the story of this terrible situation has so often been told that a repetition now would. serve no useful purpose. but phoonixllke. our state arose from the ashes of direful and dreadful desolation and with a cheerful courage began the rebuilding of the new north carolina. having to overthrow the reconstruction government forced upon her in order that she might in an unfettered and untrammeled manner take her place along with her sister states in the making of the new south. has she kept the pace? has she been laggard in the onward march of progress? i declare to you that she has not only kept the pace but she has rushed forward in leaps and bounds until today she stands at the forefront among the states of the union. north carolina from east to west is 500 miles. with an average breadth of 100 miles. with an area embracing 52.426 square miles. of which 48.740 is landand 3.686 is water. and with a population of 2.559.123 at the present time. it has its mountains. the equal of the alps of switzerland. its western boundary containing mountains constituting a part of the great appalachian chain which attains its greatest height. the highest peak east of the rocky mountains. with the towering mount )kitchell. the topography of our state may be pictured as a declivity sloping down from an altitude of nearly 7.000 feet from the smoky mountains to the piedmont plateau. to the coastal plain. and to the atlantic ocean. no better climate can be found anywhere. we are on the same parallel of latitude as the mediterranean. as has been said of our state. all the climates of italy from.the palermao to milan and venice are represented. the natural resources of north carolina compare favorably with any other state in the union. we have a soil so diversified and so composed in connection with such favorable climatic conditions as to offer the greatest agricultural possibilities. north carolina in 1923 retained. fourth rank in the united states in crop values. the total value of the principal national 22 crops being $375.710.000. and the total value of all the crops raised in north carolina for 1923 was $431.500.000. the rank of the states crops in 1909 as compared with other states was twentyfirst in crop value. and in 1922 and 1923 it ranked fourth in crop values as compared with other states of the principal national 22 crops. we find that in 1923 the average accrued value of crops in north carolina was $59 per acre. and that in 1922 it was $48.60 per here. in comparison with this showing we find the middle western states averaging in 1922 as follows. according to their national rank in the value of their 22 principal crops: texas. $27.50. illinois. $20.15. ohio. $23.60. missouri. $18.50. north carolina. $48.60. north carolina has the largest hosiery mills in the world. north carolina has the largest deniml mill in the united states. north carolina has the largest towel mill in the world at kannapolls. north carolina has tile largest damask mills in the united states. north carolina has the second largest aluminum plant in the world at badin. north carolina has the largest underwear factory il america. north carolina has the third largest pulp mill i the united states. north carolina has more mills that dye and finish their own products than any other southern state. north carolina leads the world in the mnufacture of tobacco. north carolina has a total of more than 6.000 factories. these factories give employment to 173.687 workers. whose total annual wages amount to more than $127.537.821. north carolina has $669.000.000 invested in manufacturing establishments. north carolina leads every southern state in the number of wage and salary earners. again she leads the southern states in values added to the raw materials after process of manufacture: north carolina. $435.761.957. texas. $331.740.283. virginia. $243.660.752. and gleorgia. $222.683.529. north carolina has the second largest hydroelectricpower development in the world. north carolina consumes onefourth of all the tobacco used in manufacture in the entire united states. north carolina pays onefourth of all the tobacco taxes of the union. in 1923 north carolina paid the government $118.370.325 tobacco tax. more than any other state in the union. new york. the next state. paid only $45.000.000. north carolina manufactures more cigarettes than any other state in the union. one north carolina city manufactures more tobacco than any other city in the world. north carolina leads the south in the number of furniture factories. in the capital invested. the number of operatives employed. the variety of products. and the value of the annual output. north carolina has more cotton mills than any state in the union. only one other city in the united states manufactures more furniture than does one of our north carolina cities. north carolina ranks fifth in the value of agricultural counties in the union. the north carolina tobacco was of more value last year than that of any other state. north carolina ranks third in the production of sorghum. peanuts. and sweet potatoes in the united states. north carolina has grown more corn to the acre than any other state in the union. north carolina leads the union in the number of debtfree homes. north carolina ranks first in the value and quantity of mica produced. mining 15 per cent of all mica mined in america. north carolina ranks first in the value and quality of millstones produced in the united states. the talc mined in north carolina demands the highest price per ton of any mined in the united states. western north. carolina is world famed as a tourist and health resort. our unequaled yeararound climate. our healthy balsamladen mountain air. our pure crystal water. the beauty and grandeur of our mountain peaks. help make this section foremost of any other in america as a playground for pleasure and healthseeking tourists. north carolina is a great place for sportsmen. such famous sportsmen as rex beach. irvin cobb. bud fisher. and others look upon eastern north carolina as the greatest hunting ground in america. eastern north carolina has famous seashore resorts. and the health resort and playgrounds at pinehurst and southern pines are known all over the country. the forests of north carolina are incomparable. nineteen million six hundred thousand acres and 43.000.000.000 feet of timber. there are more varieties of trees than in any other state in the union. the commercial value of the fisheries as estimated by the north carolina fisheries commission is something over $4.000.000 per year. of this amount. $677.775 was due to shellfish. such as oysters. clams. scallops. and so forth. when i speak of the mineral wealth of north carolina i feel sure very few appreciate it fully. it is not generally known that we have in north carolina 184 different varieties of native minerals. practically every known mineral in the united states and some not found elsewhere can be found in north carolina. our mineral production has amounted to many millions yearly. as far as can be ascertained there is at the present time waterpower development in north carolina of approximately 450.000 horsepower. of this amount 80.000 horsepower is transmitted for use outside the state. 113.000 horsepower is used chiefly by the producer locally. leaving approximately 257.000 horsepower available for general industrial and public use. this output of water power in north carolina has increased about 40 per cent from 1919 to 1922. there is probably an equal amount of power produced by steam plants. the demand for power is rapidly increasing and north carolina should furnish a considerable percentage of this future demand. and it can if the streams are investigated so as to determine the most efficient method of developing their power. and then develop it in accordance with this method. while several of the larger water powers in north carolina have already been developed there still remains large available undeveloped powers. the maximum potential water power of north carolina is estimated at 875.000 horsepower. and the maximum power with storage at 2.000.000 horsepower. .(this interesting data was furnished me by col. joseph hyde pratt. former state geologist of north carolina.) north carolina and south carolina have far outstripped all the other states of the southeastern group in the development of hydroelectric power. according to 1923 figures compiled for industry. in these two states the total development is 911.400north carolina 458.400 and south carolina 453.000. the total for the remaining eight states. including georgia. alabama. tennessee. virginia. kentucky. west virginia. florida. and mississippi. is 1.007.900. thus it is shown that the electricity developed by water power in the carolinas almost equals the combined output of the eight other states. conservative estimates give the potential horsepower of the two carolinas as 1.552.000north carolina 875.000 and south carolina 677.000. of the states east of the mississippi. north carolina is led only by new york in hydroelectric development. unprecedented industrial growth is largely responsible for this remarkable development and use of electric power in the two states. according to a statement by the north and south carolina public utility information bureau. expansion of industry has reached such proportions as to attract comment from authoritative sources throughout the united states. in a late issue the textile world says: the first impression the visitor gets en route from danville. va.. to atlanta. ga.. is that the south is on a constructive spree. particularly in north carolina is this evident. every hundred yards or so one sees a new mill or a new school or a new bridge. mr. thorndike saville. of the university of north carolina and hydraulic engineer of the north carolina geological and economic survey. in his review of the waterpower situation in the state. says: a sudden metamorphosis has occurred in north carolina within the past decade. by which the state has moved from twentythird to fifteenth place in the value of its industries and from nineteenth to shout fourth in the value of crops. as well as becoming the greatest industrial state in the south. accompanying this has come a tremendous demand for power to meet the needs of our growing waterpower business. even so. there is a dearth of power in the state today. and the hydroelectric industry is bound to be greatly extended within the next decade. mr. saville estimates that power demands for the year 1930 will be approximately 1.000.000 horsepower in north carolina alone. the american exchangepacific national bank. of new york. in their monthly letter of february 1. 1926. had the following to say about the water power in the south: in the southeast waterpower development has reached an advanced stage. many of the huge industries in tennessee. the carolinas. georgia. and alabama being driven by power developed on the mountain streams which tumble over the appalachians and the cumberlands. superpower is an old story in the south. for several years leading cities have drawn their light and power from systems which connect them all in a single chain. cheap power. ample resources. and an abundance of enterprise and muscular energy are the factors that are rejuvenating the south. bringing it back to the place of dominance which it once occupied.\\n690013750|mr. chairman. i yield 15 minutes to the gentleman from arkansas .\\n690013751|the gentleman from arkansas is recognized for 15 minutes.\\n690013752|mr. chairman. if i fail to conclude my remarks in the time allotted to me. i ask unanimous consent to revise and extend them.\\n690013753|is there objection to the request of the gentleman from arkansas?\\n690013754|mr. chairman. gentlewomen. and gentlemen of the house. the paramount issue before this congress is a square deal for the farmer. i have introduced two bills. just and equitable measures. whose purpose is to grant specific aid to the producers of food. to lighten the hearts and burdens of those engaged in agriculture. horticulture. and stock raising. agriculture is the basic industry. the farmer feeds the world. and if he struck for a few months the world would starve. our farming population represents about 38.000.000 people. they are entitled to fair treatment. and they have never had it. they are the best customers the manufacturers have. and they must be kept prosperous if profits are to be made by those engaged in any other productive industry. if you apply the average consumption per capita of steel alone of the country as a whole. which is about 800 pounds. to the farming population. you have a total requirement for the farmer of approximately 14.000.000 tons. or over 30 per cent of the total steel capacity of the united states. so far as the farmers need of steel is concerned. his per capita use exceeds that of the city dweller. he is a large user of tools. farm machinery. and supplies not needed by the city consumer. he is likewise a heavy purchaser of a wide variety of manufactured products. and if prosperity is to be general he must prosper. i am for good wages for labor. good prices for farm products. and this condition can not obtain unless there is a change in the situation as it now exists. the farmers dollar is a 30cent dollar compared with what it should be. the fordneymccumber tariff bill should be repealed or modified. the act has done infinite harm to the farmers. it has destroyed the foreign demand for farm products by shutting out foreign goods. the only medium that europe has to pay her debts to us or to buy our surplus. from 1920 to 1923. 200.000 people in europe were underfed. but able to work for food. while american agriculture drifted on the rocks. unable to market our surplus abroad because of the lack of suitable trade relations. - the farmer has lost billions and billions because of the present and past high tariff laws. everybody knows that the .farmer has never got any benefit from tariffs on corn. wheat. meats. lard. and their staple products generally. the home prices of which are fixed by world prices for their surplus. at the same time. under the present tariff law they have to pay three prices for most of the things they use and wear. they think the farmer has been fooled because agricultural implements are on the free list. but these implements are enormously high because iron and steel products used in making thein are protected by high tariffs.\\n690013755|mr. chairman. will the gentleman yield?\\n690013756|i will yield.\\n690013757|i think the gentleman from arkansas is as well prepared as anyone in the house to speak in behalf of the farmer. because he is a real friend of the farmer and knows their problems. and if the gentleman will permit me. i will say also that the people of the third district of arkansas are to be commended for keeping him here. he knows the farmer and the farmers needs. he has been an educator in his state. he has been a distin~gished judge on the circuit bench of his state. i would like to ask him this question: does he not think the time has come for us southern democrats\\n690013758|the chair will rule that a large part of the gentlemans statement is not a question.\\n690013759|the gentleman from arkansas yielded to me. the chair can not curtail what i said.\\n690013760|i can not admit all the good things that the gentleman has said about me. without doubt it behooves the friends of the manufacturers of all kinds of fabricated goods to give the farmer a square deal.\\n690013761|mr. chairman. will the gentleman yield?\\n690013762|i would like to ask the gentleman if he proposes that the tariff on wool and livestock and meats and other agricultural products. such as wheat. corn. rice. and nuts. be all repealed?\\n690013763|no. i do not. but the farmer gets little. if any. benefit from such tariffs.\\n690013764|mr. chairman. will the gentleman yield?\\n690013765|the farmer much more nearly has a square deal since we raised the tariff on all the things that were put in the last tariff bill than he had before that.\\n690013766|does the gentleman believe that the cotton farmer. or one who produces mleat or the producers of wheat or corn were benefited by the fordneymccuimber tariff bill?\\n690013767|i see that the price of wheat in minnesota is 22 cents more than it is at winnipeg.\\n690013768|the gentleman knows that these are ticker farmers.\\n690013769|the real farmer long since sold his wheat at little above the cost of production. now the wall street farmers and the agriculturists oin the chicago board of trade are merely putting wheat up and down for gambling purposes.\\n690013770|mr. chairman. will the gentleman yield?\\n690013771|i want to ask the gentleman if corn in iowa is protected by the tariff?\\n690013772|the corn in iowa would bring a pretty good price if you got the water out of it.\\n690013773|well. that is no answer at all. does the gentleman from the corn state of kansas actually believe in the stale myth that the tariff on corn raises the price of that staple when the price is fixed for our surplus corn in european markets?\\n690013774|mr. chairman. will the gentleman yield?\\n690013775|i would like to ask the gentleman from arkansas if we did not receive in southwestern missouri and arkansas and neighboring localities a better price for apples and small fruits and strawberries than we eyer before received in our lives?\\n690013776|we certainly did not. nor did your blessed fordneymccumber bill help us in the least with these crops. but injured yourpeople and mine because it compels them to pay exorbitant prices for everything they purchase in the way of highly protected articles. let me say. however. that it is not so easy as it looks to the man away from here to get legislation desired by farmers. it is difficult to tell what legislation will really help. many lembers come from manufacturing and city districts who want cheap farm products and vote against bills that seek to enhance the value of the things grown by farmers. the president and the party in power control legislation. and they oppose and can defeat these bills. and do so. during mr. wilsons term farm products brought a fair price and the farmers dollar had much greater purchasing power under the underwood tariff bill than under the fordneymccumber bill. those of us who have been here for some time andtihave voted for every measure or amendment that even promised to aid agriculture know the difficulties that confront the real friends of the farmer in getting through legislation. the farm organizations themselves differ widely as to what legislation will be of actual benefit. but this problem is easy of solution for a certain type of patriot. with pharisaical ostentation and much noise the country saver who is out of congress and without experience and wanting to get in. shallow but vocal. knows positively that if le is elected the farmers will at once get .all they want and more. witiout modesty lie so proclaims... thus he hopes todupe the people. the fresh candidate shakes his swollen head in disapproval of the record of the present members. just elect him and all will be well. he will be the congress. the other 434 members. 96 senators. and the white house will not have to be consulted. he deplores the dearth of leadership here. meaning. elect me and then note the arrival of a real reader. poor leaderless party. poor leaderless world. le pleads guilty to greatness. he concedes that henry clays overcoat did not contain enough cloth to make him a hat band. wide mouthed and abusive. with puffed and advertised pretentions he lards the lean earth with much rich sweat. shed in his rapid and clamorous stridings up and down the counties. criticizing the present membership and extolling his dvarfish talents. but they are not dwarfish to him. certainly not. he has been a member of the legislature or state senate. or prosecuting attorney. or has been a state officer. ie is a selfappointed fnd a selfannointed moses. with spiteful malevolence he hurls curses at the sixtyeighth congress for raising salaries and straight way strives mightily to be a beneficiary of the raise. he is prostrated over this outrage. and then fervently thanks god for the outrage. he admits that he is too cheap for the salary. but runs for it and covets it. he holds up a feeble right hand to heaven. mumbling maledictions against such  extravagance. and with his left hand behind him lie wiggles his itching fingers and wigwags the salary he condemns. to hasten homeward to him. this is calculated to  make the judicious grieve. and this journeyman country saver. engaged busily in grinning farmers out of votes. is either a  farmer  himself merely practicing law for recreation. or he is the only real living. breathing friend the farmer lhsd left. yet in all likelihood he has been riding the farm home owner to financial death or spurring him toward poverty and despair by extracting from his all but empty pocketbook socalled lawyer fees in special road districts that here and there have marked his official pathway with wreck and ruin. it is the stock argument of such a man that the member has done nothing. it is mighty easy to say that. and we hear it from the outs regardless of what the facts are.. [applause.1 i desire. while i am on my feet. to discuss another matter briefly. recently i spoke on this floor in defense of colonel mitchell. the speech was generously received by my colleagues. and the great dailies of america gave it frontpage prominence. that gratified me and was pleasing to the district that i have the honor to represent. many letters and telegrams have reached me commending the address. and below i print a few newspaper comments and an occasional letter: scathingly denouncing tile  cruel and heartless army courtmartial which meted drastic punishment to col. william mitchell  for telling the truth. representative joux n. tnilman. democrat. of arkansas. from the floor of the house appealed to .president coolidge to mitigate or quash the sentence. seething with indignation over this action by the army high command to  muzzle and humiliate mitchell. members of congress are pouring in a flood of bills and resolutions. if adopted. they would scrap the entire system of national defense and set up a unified air service. with equal status to other arms of the defense works. while tiliman was laying his barrage against the army high command for their attempt to  gag and disgrace  colonel mitchell  for arousing the country to the deplorable state of the nations air defenses. representative loing m. black. democrat. of new york. was issuing a scorching statement. rnovide for reforms both introduced resolutions denouncing the sentence and providing for reforms in any administration. - i call upon the president of this justiceloving nation to mitigate or quash this harsh sentence imposed on colonel mitchell. said tillman solemnly. as democrats applauded vigorously. while scattering applause came from republicans.  my belief is that fairminded men and women of america will not suffer the verdict of this arrogant courtmartial to stand. %  the court finds mitchell guilty of violating the ninetysixth article of war and penalizes him by retaining him in the army. but suspending him from rank. command. and duty. with forfeiture of all pay for five years. this court sought to affix a gag. in the newspapers this morning is a picture of colonel mitchell holding in his arms his infant daughter. in the name of the baby and for the sake of his family and himself i have introduced a resolution to cut the claws of these heartless courtmartial authorities. the resolution introducedby mr. tilmax fixes 30 days as the maxi-. muni perlnd for which ani army officercan be suspended without raul or pay by a courtmartial. (universal press service.)\\n690013777|324 north tielfth street. wao. tem. memphis. tenn.. december 20. 1925.\\n690013778|will the gentleman yield?\\n690013779|permit me to say that lieutenant tillman. the son of my friend from arkansas. was awarded the croix de guerre. the legion of honor. and the distinguished service cross for gallantry in action.\\n690013780|i prefer not to refer to those things. but i thank the gentleman for his kind words. i want to say to the gentleman himself that i saw him serving his country in europe. and while men may object to his views on a great many things. the fact is that he made a gallant officer and brought honor to himself and to his country by his service during the world war.\\n690013781|the time of the gentleman from arkansas has expired.\\n690013782|mr. chairman. i ask for five additional minutes.\\n690013783|mr. chairman. i yield the gentleman five additional minutes.\\n690013784|among the letters i received condemning my position on the mitchell trial was one from a gentleman in georgia. whose name i do not recall. he stated that if the congress had given the army. the navy. and the air service money enough there would not have been any dearth of planes. and that there would not have been anything to criticize. now. in my judgment. two of the most useful men who have served upon the republican side of the house have been the gentleman from illinois. mr. mann. who. i believe. taking everything into the count. was the most useful legislator i ever knew. and the gentleman from illinois is in the same class with mr. mann. i think i saw mr. madden quoted as saying that congress had been generous in pouring out money for air defense and for the army and navy. but that somebody had been extravagant and squandered the money. however. this i know. i served here during the war. i voted for every measure that was offered proposing to carry on the war successfully. and i know that but few. if any. liberty planes. for which we appropriated vast sums of money. were used on the fighting lines over in france. we had. as my son says. to rely largely upon secondhand and discarded planes that the french had sold to us or the english had sold to us. and they were so unsafe that they were branded as flaming coffins.\\n690013785|will the gentleman yield for one question?\\n690013786|i would like first to ask the gentleman from illinois if he is quoted correctly in saying thft large and generous sums have been voted from time to time for airplane and other army and navy defenses and whether he is not of opinion that that money was squandered?\\n690013787|if the gentleman will permit me to make a somewhat comprehensive reply. from 1917 until the close of the war there was placed at the disposal of the army and navy combined. an aggregate sum for aviation purposes alone of $1.977.000.000. $490.000.000 of which we took away from the army and $90.000.000 from the navy because they were not able to use it and had not produced anything from what they had used. since the war closed we have appropriated $433.000.000 or $86.676.000 per annum for aviation alone for the army and the navy. and this does not include $85.000.000 we have appropriated for the construction of two airplane carriers costing $96.000.000 combined. which would make a total of over $520.000.000 for five years. or over $100.000.000 a year. england is the next country which has appropriated the most. having appropriated $83.000.000 a year. france. $55.000.000 a year for military aviation and $10.000.000 for commercial aviation. and japan. $10.500.000 a year only. while we have appropriated over $100.000.000 a year ever since the war and we have not a thing to show for it.\\n690013788|the gentleman then is clearly of the opinion that this critic from georgia is not fair in his statement to he effect that we have not appropriated sufficient money to justify proper expenditures for aviation by the army and the navy?\\n690013789|he is not only not fair but he does not fell the truth.\\n690013790|will the gentleman yield for one question more?\\n690013791|is it not a fact that general mitchell was the first american during the world war to be decorated in france. that he was decorated by italy and by france and by great britain. and that he has the distinguishedservice cross and the distinguishedservice medal from his own country?\\n690013792|i know his breast is covered with medals that he won in actual fighting above the clouds [applause]. and not by sitting around with spurred heels on top of a mahogany desk. arthur brisbane. editor of the hearst dailies. whose salary approaches the $100.000 mark. says: mitchell was condemned by swivelchair soldiers. mitchell knew his subject. did not hesitate to look for a spade and call its by its proper name. he desired only to truthfully advise the people about actual army and navy mistakes. extravagances. and to point out the pitiable condition of national air defenses. his frankness. his blunt candor. and his fearlessness wrought his downfall. his only object was his countrys good. a military tribunal crucified him. but the world has often crucified its intending saviors and its actual saviors. columbus went to sea at 14. was a bold and skillful navigator. discovered a new world. and became a victim of jealousy and was assailed with unjust charges which cut him to the heart. he never rallied. and died broken in body and soul. servetus lived a model life. but was burned to death for his arianism by the orders of calvin. savonarola. great preacher. denounced abuses of all kinds. was excommunicated by alexander vi. tortured. and cremated. joan of arc. a country girl of 18. mounted a horse. headed the troops of the dauphin charles. defeated his foes. restored his fallen fortunes. and secured to him the crown of france. and was condemned to the flames as a heretic and sorceress. galileo adopted and proved the copernican system. invented the telescope. but the jesuits denounced him to the inquisition as a heretic. and pope paul v. under threat of throwing him on a burning log heap. made him promise to quit teaching that the earth moves. socrates was gallant in war. distinguished in statecraft. and great as a teacher of philosophy. but on charges faked up by lycon. meletus. and anytus they made him drink poison. and so. colonel mitchell. your fate is an old. old story. mitchell studied the intricate mechanism of the fighting plane. he selected this dangerous arm of the service. he went overseas. and went there to fight. i see him in his plane. high above the fertile fields of brave and beautiful france. hurtling through the air with martial whir and clang of wings like a flash of lightning to engage the enemy. his flight was the flight of the game bird of war. really. was this game war bird winged and brought to earth by swivelchair heroes? some say so. an eagle towering in her pride of place was by a mousing owl hawkd at and killed. briefly this is mitchells case. he fought splendidly. was decorated for bravery. his bosom blazing with medals won in the shock of actual battle. he merely sought to point out the errors of those high in the councils of the national defense. was anxious to improve that important line of defense. the air service. offered constructive criticism. explained his policies as to what should be done. and this criticism and information offered by him was. because of his manner of\\n690013793|mr. chairman. i yield 20 minutes to the resident commissi~ner from the philippine islands .\\n690013794|mr. chairman. i also yield 20 minutes to the gentleman.\\n690013795|mr. chairman. gentlewomen. and gentlemen of the committee. in the course of the political relationship between the united states of america and the philippine islands there is one event which has been a source of profound gratification to the filipinos. i refer to the visit of the congressional party and that of the individual members of this house and the senate to the philippines during last summer. the filipino people. setting aside their political differences and forgetting the difficulties resulting from the present anomalous situation prevailing in the islands. were unauinmous in the joy of greeting the representatives of the greatest country of the world. on whose good faith and sense of justice depends the final solution of the philippine problem. they were proud to have had the privilege of opening the doors of their homes to the distinguished visitors and showing once more their loyalty to. admiration. and esteem for the united 8states for her glorious accomplishments in the philippines during the last 27 years. furthermore. the visit was regarded by the filipino people as an opportunity for those members of congress to see right on the spot the actual conditions and facts upon which to base a just solution of the philippine problem. the visiting members of congress found that the filipino people. while holding no grievances against the united states. have attained a civic consciousness which compels them to struggle for what they believe to be their rights and privileges under the americal flag.\\n690013796|mr. chairman. i yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from rhode island .\\n690013797|mr. chairman and members of the committee. i am taking this opportunity to bring to the attention of the membership of this house a situation which has arisen by reason of the construction placed upon one of the provisions of the world war adjusted compensation act by the comptroller general of the united states. in many instances where the veteran has made application for adjusted compensation before his death. which application has been received in due course by the army or the navy department and by those departments transmitted to the veterans bureau. the comptroller general has decided that when that application was received after the death of the veteran. it was absolutely void and of no force and effect. and no compensation was granted. based upon such application. i understand there are hundreds of cases of this sort and i feel quite sure that when we passed the act in may. 1924. there was no intention on the part of this body that such a construction should be placed upon any provision of the act. you will recall that at the time of the passage of the act we had what amounted to a cloture rule. with only 20 minutes of debate allowed on each side. members were not even permitted at that time to extend their remarks in the record. although they had no opportunity to present their views on the floor. and it was several weeks after the passage of that act in this house before such permission was finally given. in a letter which i have received from the veterans bureau there is this paragraph which will describe the situation to which i allude: the comptroller general of the united states rendered a decision on september 2. 1.925. in the case of carl hunley. which held that an application for the benefits of the adjusted compensation act. in order to be valid. must have been filed with the war or navy department some time before the death of the veteran. when i examine that act i find nothing which either in fact or in law would warrant any such construction or any such interpretation as has been placed thereon by comptroller general mccarl.\\n690013798|will the gentleman yield for a question?\\n690013799|certainly.\\n690013800|is it not the fact that the war department in one or more instances has expressly ruled that the application was valid and have passed it on to the veterans bureau. and in one instance i happen to know of. certificate was issued thereon. which the comptroller general held was invalid because the application had not actually reached the war department before the death of the soldier and had not the stamp or file mark placed thereon.\\n690013801|there is no doubt that both the war and navy departments in such instances have recognized the fact that a valid application was made. they have then transmitted it to the veterans bureau for action and approval. the veterans bureau have then forwarded the papers to the comptroller general and he has gone beyond the terms of the certificate referred to in section 303 and noted in some instances that there was a file mark of the bureau which showed that the application. although executed during the lifetime of the veteran. was filed in the bureau after his denth. and on that ground ruled that the application was invalid. there is no doubt there are many such cases. i understand one member of this house has about 15 cases of that sort. and let me show you how drastic. how unfair. and how absurd such a ruling may be. a member of the veterans committee told me yesterday that he had a case where a service man made application through the post of the american legion to which he belonged. he filed the application four months before his death. it laid on the desk of the commander or one of the officers of the legion post. and later when the commander learned of this mans death he seat the application to the bureau. where it was rejected for the reason to which i have referred. every member of this house knows that by newspaper publications and notices in many periodicals in this country. the veterans were requested to act through the american legion and through the american red cross. they were designated as governmental agencies through which applications should be filed. and yet although in this case the veteran himself and although the dependents of the veteran. were guilty of no negligence or inches of any sort. the comptroller general refused to make payment.\\n690013802|will the gentleman yield?\\n690013803|i will.\\n690013804|in every such case where tie postmark on the envelope containing the application showed that it was received in the postoffice before the death of the veteran the comptroller has ruled adversely to.\\n690013805|he has ruled that it must b received and filemarked in the department before the death of the veteran. that is a condition that is not the case of an ordinary insurance policy. this was intended to be practically an insurance policy. you all know that where the insured attempts to change a beneficiary in an insurance policy and the application is transmitted to the insurance company and arrives after the death of the insured. the company never disputes the liability as to the principal sumthe only question there involved. which may be tried out by interpleader. is whether the old or original beneficiary or the newly designated one shall hold the proceeds of the policy. at the time of the passage of this act we had no opportunity to pass on the questions of phraseology. of construction or interpretation. no chance to amend the act. no chance to ask any questions. but it is not yet too late and i am confident that this mighty nation. the richest. most powerful. and most grateful in the world. is ready and willing to grant justice to the service men of this country and to their dependents. i am presenting this matter for the consideration of the house in the hope that the ways and means committee. which originally handled the bill. or the veterans committee. which i know is interested in seeing that the service men are given proper recognition. will take this matter up and consider it and give relief in this as well as in other respects.\\n690013806|will the gentleman yield?\\n690013807|i will.\\n690013808|does the gentleman mean to say they hold that you can not get the benefits of this bonus bill that we passed unless the soldier makes application in his lifetime?\\n690013809|that is the ruling. and without reading the act i will refer. so that members may read it themselves. to section 302 and 303. section 302 provides:\\n690013810|the time of the gentleman from rhode island has expired.\\n690013811|mr. chairman. i ask the gentleman to have one minute more. and i want to ask him a question.\\n690013812|i will yield to the gentleman one minute more.\\n690013813|if the veteran fails to make application before his death that does not deprive his dependents or the beneficiary from receiving the amount of insurance that he is entitled to at that particular time. which would be $625. but it does preclude the payment of the full value. which would be perhaps $1.500 at the end of 20 years. it does not cut him out of the present value of the insurance. which is about $625?\\n690013814|i do not think that is exactly accurate. it is partly correct. if the application is made by the soldier. and he should die after it has been received by the bureau during his lifetime. his dependents would receive the full value of it. if. however. he dies under conditions which i have described. then they would not get anything. either the basic amount or the principal sum of the policy. unless they were able to prove dependency. whereas they would not have to prove any dependency in case a man made application before his death and it was received and acted upon by the bureau before his death.\\n690013815|i agree with the gentleman. only i did not know that he would have to prove dependency.\\n690013816|the time of the gentleman from rhode island has expired.\\n690013817|mr. chairman. i yield 40 minutes to the gentleman front nebraska [mr. simlo.s].\\n690013818|mr. chairman. president coolidge in a special message to the sixtyeighth congress. april 21. 1924. said: many occupants of our reclamation projects in the west are in financial distress. they are unable to pay the charges assessed against them. in some instances settlers are living on irrigated lands that will ht return a livelihood for their families and at the same time pay the money due the government as it falls due. temporary extensions of time and suspension of these charges serve only to increase their debts and add to their hardships. a definite policy is imperative and permanent relief should be applied where indicated. the heretofore adopted repayment plan is erroneous in principle and in many cases impossible of accomplishment. it fixes an annual arbitrary amount that the farmers mvst pay on the construction costs of projects regardless of their production. in its place should he substituted a new policy providing that payments shall be assessed by the government in accordance with the cropproducing quality of the soil. the facts developed by the special advisory committee show that of the governments total investment. $18.81.146 will never berecovered. there will be a probable loss of an additional $8.830.000. these sums represent expenditures in the construction of reservoirs. canals. and other works for the irrigation of lands that have proven unproductive. i recommend that congress authorize the charging off of such sums shown to be impossible of collection. more than 30.000 water users are affected by the present serious conditlon. action is deemed imperative before the adjournment of congress that their welfare may be safeguarded. the probable loss and the temporary difficulties of some of the settles on projects does not mean that reclamation is a failure. the sum total of beneficial results has been large in the building up of towns and agricultural communities and is adding tremendously to the agricultural production wealth of the country. whatever legislation is necessary to the advancement of reclamation should be enacted without delay. this message was based upon the report of the fact finding commission and transmitted with that report to congress together with certain proposed and recommended legislation. under date of september 8. 1923. secretary of the interior work formed the fact finding commission  to make an intensive study of the policy. application. and operation of government methods of reclaiming arid lands by irrigation. the commission. as finally formed. consisted of thomas e. campbell. former governor of arizona. james r. garfield. former secretary of the interior. oscar e. bradfute. president of the american farm bureau federation. clyde c. dawson. irrigation lawyer of denver. colo.. elwood mead. professor of rural economics of the university of california. and an irrigation engineer. and john a. widtsoe. president of the college of agriculture of the state of utah. these men were all men who. as secretary work said. had national confidence. this commission met october 15. 1923. in washington. and were addressed by secretary work. who. among other things. said: the reclanatlon service. for which this department is responsible. apparently requires reorganization. annual reports on some projects indicate their insolvency and pending failure. out of the 28 projects only one has met its obligations as they fell due. long extensions of time for payments due are being urged individually and by projects. the original 20year period for payment is expiring on certain projects and an additional 20year extension is being asked. in one instance. such extension is to be preceded by a 5year moratorium. reclamation of arid lands by irrigation from government funds. as heretofore practiced. is failing on a majority of projects as a business procedure and must be promptly readjusted as to methods of reimbursement for funds appropriated and for the purpose of securing to the settler a permanent home. i desire now to speak about the work of that commission. their report. the legislation which they recommended. the legislation which congress passed. and the failure of the bureau of reclamation tinder the secretary of the interior. to carry out the intent and purpose of the recommendations of the fact finding commission and the president. and the law based thereon so far as existing projects are concerned. may it be said here that the fact finding commission began their work and carried it out in a thorough. complete. and careful nanner. bear in mind always that the purpose of this entire investigation and the moving force which brought it about was the distress on existing projects and the need of relief being granted to those existing projects. they made 66 specific recommendations. those which are important. so far as the present inquiry is concerned. are as follows: recommendation 6. (b) in the event the area of the lands for which storage or diversion works or main canals have been constructed shall be decreased by excluded lands found not suitable for irrigation. then the construction charges imposed upon such excluded lands should not be charged against the remaining lands. but should be held in suspense and shall be ultimately charged off. unless by subsequent agreement all or some portion of such suspended charges may be imposed upon lands restored to irrigation or other lands for which it is found suitable to supply water. recommendation 8. in fixing the construction cost upon lands under projects. the secretary of the interior should take into consideration the classes of land. determined in accordance with resolution no. 13. and may fix different construction costs upon different classes under the same project for the purpose of so equitably apportioning the total cost that the lands may bear the burden of cost more nearly in proportion to their productive value. . recommendation 13. the secretary of the interior should undertake at once a comprehensive and detailed survey of the physical and economic features of the federal reclamation projects to secure information upon which the project lands may be classified with respect to their power. under a proper agricultural program.. of supporting the farmer and his family and of repaying the construction costs of the project. this survey should be in sufficient detail to enable the grouping of the farm units under each project into divisions or zones. each of approximately equal productive power. all lands which at the time of the survey do not possess a productive power sufficient to support the farmers family and to repay construction costs should be grouped in one class and all lands which are just coming into agricultural production and not yet ready to begin repayments should be grouped in -1926\\n690013819|mr. chairman. will the gentleman yield?\\n690013820|does the gentleman know whether or not the department has consummated any contract under that 5 per cent provision?\\n690013821|that i do not know. they have received the offer of a contract from the north platte project. i understand that they have negotiated tentative contracts with some of the projects who already have joint liability. let us now consider the testimony before the house .cornmittee as to the intention of this section. with whom the option of its application rests. and what should be done by the bureau of reclamation under it. for the purpose of interpreting the legislative will resort may be had to the history of the statute. doctor mead appeared both as a member of the fact find. ing commission and as commissioner of reclamation. in his opening statement to the committee. he said (hereafter unless otherwise noted all references are by page to hearings eh. r. 88309611. before the committee on irrigation and reclamation. beginning monday. may 5. 1924) perhaps the most radical feature of these recommendations is the change in tie basis of the construction cost charges fror a certain percentage yearly of the cost of the works to a certain percentage of the crop income (p. 10). it was recognized by the fact finding commission and by congress that congress could not compel the water users to change their contracts. that is prohibited by the constitution of the united states. but congress did say that at the request of the water user the contract should be changed. doctor mead. in his opening statement. said (p. 16) legislation of that kind could not affect an existing contract if the parties to that contract do not desire it to become operative. they could continue under the existing plan if they so desired. but it would give those who felt the need of it the opportunity to accept the new plan. bearing in mind that section 7 of the proposed law later became subsection f. let us read the testimony on page 91:\\n690013822|now. see if i have a correct interpretation of the section.  hereafter. that means on all new projects. mr. hirn. new projects?\\n690013823|new or old.\\n690013824|let me finish. on all new projects you would adopt this plan and on all existing projects where there is a contract for a payment on a different basis the secretary is authorized upon request to amend the contract1\\n690013825|that would leave it within the discretion of the water users on any existing project to accept or reject the plan as it might appear to be in their interest? doctor mead. that is correct. and that is not understood. in some cases they think it would be mandatory upon an existing contract to accept this if it is passed. which is not the case. it rests with the people on the project. then. on page 17 i find this: mr. ra re. so that we may get a correct view of it at the beginning. i take it that the fact finding commission have come to the determination and conclusion that tie proposed legislation would not affect any of the existing projects of water users thereon legally? to which doctor mlead answered: so far its existing projects are concerned which have a contract witl the government. it could not abrogate that contract. it would be left entirely to their option. but with the exception of three. or at the most four. all of them will elect to take the change. it will be here noted that doctor mead repeatedly told the committee that the discretion rested with  those who felt the need of it -with  the water users on any existing project.\" it rests with the people on the project.- so f r as existing projects are concerned it would be left entirely to their option. under date of december 4. 1925. doctor mead wrote the north platte valley water users association  that this act vests in pne secretary the discretion to amend or to refuse to amend existing contracts. congress had passed the law which doctor mead has asked for and about which lie had testified. the water users on the north platte project had asked the secretary to amend their contracts as the law provided. had submitted a new contract in compliance with the act of december 5. 1924. their contract was rejected i tote by the commissioner of reclamation and in doing so lie executed the amazing reversal of his own interpretation of this law us just pointed out.\\n690013826|mr. chairman. will the gentleman yield?\\n690013827|probably the gentleman lad already quoted the language of the statute. but is it not a fact that the statute simply says that the secretary of the interior  shall have the authority but does not say that the secretary shall do so and so. is not that the fact?\\n690013828|no. sir.\\n690013829|if it is the fact. then of course it is clearly a matter of discretion. and no statement of anyone before a committee of congress could change the language of tile statute.\\n690013830|let me digress and say this: that the only place that there is any word except the word  shall used in the act is in one sentence. the statute says that the secretary shall change i he plan. and that he shall do other things. and then says that he is authorized to change the contract. that was put in because we knew. and doctor mead knew. and the secretary knew. altd the fact finding commission knew that congress could not compel the changing of a contract against the will of the water user. it was so understood. the thing i am referring to is this. that the responsible administrative officers of the reclamation bureau placed the interpretation on the contract that that provision was mandatory on tile secretary except in those cases where the settlers refused to take the.new contract. the government offers to change the contract. the water user accepts. the secretary must act. the gentleman is a lawyer and knows that when the substantive provision of a public law is mandatory that the ministerial authority to carry it out is also mandatory. no matter what the language.\\n690013831|and is it not also true that this entire bill was passed at the request of the commissioner and the secretary?\\n690013832|yes. sir. and the president.\\n690013833|and was it not accepted by the people on the projects in the west. so far as the gentleman knows. as having been offered by them in good faith?\\n690013834|with the idea tlat if it would be accepted by the people of the project the secretary and the commissioner charged with that duty would carry out the provisions?\\n690013835|yes. sir. i have repeated here testimony. several times. of doctor mead. of the fact finding commission. showing that exactly that was the interpretation which -they themselves put upon it. all we (lid was to take their word for it.\\n690013836|mr. chairman. will the :gentleman yield?\\n690013837|does this practice. or. i might say. conduct. of the department follow a precedent. or is it something new?\\n690013838|it is a new proposition. based on the act of december 5. 1924.\\n690013839|mr. chairman. will the gentleman yield?\\n690013840|i would like to get the matter clear in my own mind. the gentleman has just stated that certain officials interpreted this act as mandatory. is that correct?\\n690013841|who are the officials. doctor mead?\\n690013842|the one in particular is doctor mead.\\n690013843|under what circumstances? is that in his testimony before the committee?\\n690013844|before the committee on irrigation and reclamation doctor mead said that where the water user asked for a change of his contract. that option was with the water user as to whether or not he would receive or reject the benefits of the new law. now he says the option is with the secretary.\\n690013845|who were the other officials?\\n690013846|possibly i should have said just that one. with this exception. that i quote in the record the report of the fact fintdling commission on this same thing.\\n690013847|apart from them what reason do they now give for not putting the law into force?\\n690013848|one of the reasons that they now give is that the people on the north platte project refuse to guarantee the payment to the government of some two or three million dollars charges of their neighbors. covering not only their neighbors debt. but errors and mistakes of the reclamation service. and that i :am coming to later.\\n690013849|one question. for information. .if the gentleman will yield.\\n690013850|i recall. as the gentleman -was referring to the hearings before the house committee on irrigation-\\n690013851|yes. sir-\\n690013852|that the legislation now on the statute books was not a bill reported from that committee. but was inserted in an appropriation bill in the senate.\\n690013853|that is true.\\n690013854|call the gentleman tell me brieflyi do not want to interrupt him at lengthwhether the language in the bill that was. inserted in the senate as to the matter that the gentleman is discussing is identical with the 4ailguage as it stood in the proposed house bill?\\n690013855|yes. sir. the history of that legislation is this: the house held extensive hearings on the matter and made some amendments in the bill. as i point out. and reported the bill to the house. after that was done the senate committee took tile house bill and made one or two other changes in it and put it on in the senate. but the senate bill is essentially the house bill.\\n690013856|but in the matter that the gentleinan is now discussing there is no change?\\n690013857|there is no change. during the 13 months that this provision has been on the statute books the secretary of the interior has done nothing toward carrying out the 5 per cent provision of this law on the north platte project. he rested content. he did nothing on the interpretation of the law that the option was with the settler. when the settler .asked him to act. doctor mead reverses his testimony before the congress and rejects the request of the water user. if the option is with the secretary. why does not he do something toward the consummation of a contract under this law as congress ordered him to do? it becomes necessary now to consider pubsection g in connection with subsection f in order to review another amazing reversal of doctor meads interpretation of this act. subsection g follows:\\n690013858|before leaving that phase of it-\\n690013859|i am not leaving it. i am bringing some more of the bill into it-\\n690013860|perhaps this would be a good place to remark that the commissioner of reclamation testified before our committee a year ago concerning the kittitas. sun river. spanish springs. owyhee. and vale projects tiat under the 5 per cent arrangement. as i recall. it would be from 75 to 138 years before the money would be returned to this fund. and without interest. has there been .any calculation nmade by the reclamation service as to how long it would be. if the 5 per cent plan were applied. before the balance due on the north platte project would be returned?\\n690013861|yes. sir. there is a table concerning that in senate document no. 92.\\n690013862|it has been estimated at from 50 to 75 years for the north platte?\\n690013863|yes. sir. oin tile poorer lands. but the government has a reasonable chance of getting back that way some $2.000.000 that the report now in the interior department says may be lost.\\n690013864|mr. chairman. will the gentleman yield?\\n690013865|if the gentleman from michigan will give me more time when my time expires i will yield.\\n690013866|can the gentleman inform the comilittee as to whether or not the committee on irrigation and reclamation in the house changed the form of the bill after the representatives of the bureau of reclamation appeared before the committee?\\n690013867|the committee made radical change3 after hearing the testimony of the witnesses. did they not?\\n690013868|yes. sir. i have pointed out some of those changes.\\n690013869|and is it not a fact that some portions of the proposed bill now in the deficiency appropriation act were only in general terms the same as the bill as it was considered by the committee on irrigation in the house?\\n690013870|i would not say that.\\n690013871|were they not in exactly the sane language?\\n690013872|with certain exceptions that i will come to later on. that is so. in fact. i am right there now.\\n690013873|i will say to the gentleman that most of the provisions of the house bill were cut out and were not referred to in the deficiency bill.\\n690013874|certain parts of it. but not those that i refer to here. subsection g of the act provides conditions not mentioned in the act. it providesthat whenever twothirds of the irrigable area of any project. or division of a project. shall be covered by waterright contracts between the water users and the united states. said project shall be required. as a condition precedent to receiving the benefits of this section. to take over. through a legally organized waterusers association or irrigation district. the care. operation. and maintenance of all or any part of the project works. subject to such rules and regulations as the secretary may prescribe. and thereafter the united states. in its relation to said project. shall deal with a waterusers association or irrigation district. and when the water users assume control of a project the operation and maintenance charges for the year then current shall be covered into the construction account to be repaid as part of the construction repayments. this was not in the bill as originally proposed by the fact finding commission. it is the substance of resolution no. 19 hereinbefore set out. congress put it in the bill. let us see then what the fact finders said about itdoctor mead being one of them. referring again to senate document 92 i find the following on page 59: as a general prihciple. it would seem advisable to have the federal irrigation projects operated by the water users just as soon as feasible. if this be done. the 0. and m. charge will probably be reduced somewhat. the farmers. without a large overhead organization. will use more direct methods. and being themselves responsible for the work. will be content with a service which would not be acceptable from the reclamation service. the complaint is frequently made that the 0. and m. is higher than it would be if the project were in the hands of the farmers. the farmer should be urged to take over the work. so that such complaints could be met by their own body. this matter is further discussed in the section on waterusers association. then oil page 106 there is this further explanation of their intention and meaning: a fundamental principle of success in the handling of reclamation projects is to place the management of the project in the hands of the water users. just as soon as the project is in suitable condition for such transfer. all the disadvantages of paternalism are either removed or modified when the water users control the irrigation project. and the dangers of bureaucracy are likewise greatly lessened. the placing of the responsibility for the upkeep and the general maintenance of the project encourages individual and united effort. which is invariably beneficial. not a few of the ills which have beset the federal irrigation projects may be traced to the feeling that they are essentially governmental ventures for which the farmer has little or no responsibility. and that in any event the government will protect the farmer from serious consequences. even of his own neglect. the management of* all projects should be turned over to waterusers associations just as soon as twothirds of the units under the project. or division of a project. have been covered by water contracts with the federal government. then oil page 107 there is this statement: the waterusers association should be awakened. and should be required. where conditions are proper. under satisfactory contracts. to take over the management of the projects. and to carry the full responsibility for operation and maintenance. subsection g applies to the interstate division of the north platte project. last october the waterusers association. desiring to fully meet and carry out the will of congress. tendered to the secretary of the interior as a condition precedent to receiving the benefits  of the act of december 5. 1924. a tentative contract offering to take over the care. operation. and maintenance of the project works and requested that the law be carried out. this contract doctor mead rejected and has notified the people orn the north platte project that he will not put this law into operation nor give them its benefits unless and until the water users provide for the payment of all construction charges outstanding against all of the individual water users. bear in mind this. that on the north platte project there is no joint liability. each water user has his separate contract with the government requiring him to pay only the construction charge against his farm. doctor mead now announces that it has been stated by the department that one of the conditions to be insisted on in the execution of contracts under tile new law is that the wateruser contract not only to pay his obligation to the government. but in addition they ask that every landowner assure and guarantee the debt on his neighbors farm. in april of 1924 they said the farmer could not pay his debt to the government. in december. 1925. they ask that he pay not only his own debt. but guarantee his neighbors before this law .will be carried out. doctor mead. in his letter of december 4. 1925. admits that joint liability is not mentioned in the act. he admits that congress did not in the act require joint liability as a condition precedent to receiving the benefits of the act. the department of the interior is a creature of congress. it has no authority other than what congress gives it. it can exercise no power not delegated to it. it has no authority to nullify an act of congress or refuse to obey the orders of congress. and yet here they are taking a position. demanding conditions and obligations which are not mentioned in the act.\\n690013875|mr. chairman. will the gentleman yield there?\\n690013876|i do not wish to engage in a controversy. but it would seem fair to call attention to this fact. it seems to me: doctor mead. the commissioner of reclamation. appeared. as the gentleman states. before the house committee about may. 1924. i think. or about that time?\\n690013877|the legislation that the gentleman is discussing was inserted in the deficiency appropriation bill in the senate in june. 1924. it did not become a law until december. 1924. due to the filibuster in the closing days of the jlune session. in november. 1924. doctor mead. before our committee. discussing these matters. in response to our inquiries. stated that the legislation enacted in that deficiency bill. standing by itself and without further legislation. was insufficient and undesirable. i am not quoting him verbatim. but that was the substance of his remarks. and that it was not feasible to proceed under it. i only offer that to indicate that doctor mead has not so greatly altered his position as might bebemed to be the case. the legislation standing in that bill without further legislation. standing as enacted. was not desirable or feasible. lie stated in november. 1924.\\n690013878|yes. sir. but the gentleman knows that doctor mead was not objecting to carrying out the provisions of the present law. the provision that doctor mead was talking about was the refusal of congress to authorize the loaning of money from the reclamation fund to the farmer on his chattels to build buildings and operate on. doctor mead asked for authority to supervise these farms and in general establish a paternal system. congress refused. he complains about that and not about the passage of the present bill. congress did not go that far. that is what he was talking about:\\n690013879|mr. chairman. will the gentleman yield?\\n690013880|judging from the gentlemans colloquy with the gentleman from nebraska. i understand the gentleman to state that because doctor mead does not agree with what congress has done that he. as an administrative offcer. is not bound to carry out the law.\\n690013881|i had not intended to interrupt the gentleman from nebraska in any controversial way. but i am willing to answer the question of the gentleman from montana. and my answer is this: i understand doctor meads position to be that he will follow the law as he understands it. and as i understand the law there certainly is abundant ground for him to hold that the authority conferred is a discretionary authority in the secretary of the interior.\\n690013882|the secretary says the law provides for the formation of an irrigation association or district. true. but for what purpose? to assure joint- liability. additional construction costs. obligations. and burdens that the farmer now does not have? absolutely not. then for what purpose? the act says to care. operate. and maintain the project works. then why require joint liability? why. they say. it is good policy. who determines the policy of the reclamation? is it congress or is it some bureaucrat in the interior department? it is not the right of the bureau of reclamation to reject the reclamation policy as determined by congress and substitute a policy of their own. they are charged with carrying out the reclamation policy that the congress determines. when the intention of a law is ascertained the administrative officers are bound to obey it. no matter what may be their opinion as to its wisdom or policy. but let us see what the fact finding commission of which doctor mead was a member had to say about this provision. its purpose. and its policy.\\n690013883|will the gentleman yield?\\n690013884|i wanted that to come into the discussion before i raised a further question with the gentleman from michigan.\\n690013885|if the gentleman from montani pleases. i would rather he debate with the gentleman from michigan at some time later.\\n690013886|then let me ask the gentleman this question: is it the gentlemans opinion or not that the commissioner of reclamation is putting his own interpretation on the law and determining for himself whether or not he shall carry ont the act of congress in this connection?\\n690013887|the thing i am trying to get at. if the gentleman pleases. is this: that the commissioner of reclamation. a member of the fact finding commission. came before congress with the resolutions of the fact finding commission and a proposed law. he said that law would do certain things and placed his interpretation on it. but now we find him completely reversing his own interpretation of his own act.\\n690013888|will the gentleman yield to me just at that point?\\n690013889|is it not a fact that the committee on irrigation of the house filibustered for weeks at a time and that the bill which was before that committee never was reported out in anything like the form that was suggested by those who were in charge of administering reclamation matters?\\n690013890|if the gentleman pleases. there was one member of the committee on irrigation who filibustered for quite some time and the part of the bill which was not reported out is the part i have just pointed out to the gentleman from michigan in substance.\\n690013891|but eventually it was reported out. was it not?\\n690013892|&ns. that feature of it was not.\\n690013893|was it not eventually reported out?\\n690013894|no. at least that is my memory of it.\\n690013895|is it not a fact that the bill which was reported out was oting like the original bill which the committee commenced to consider?\\n690013896|no. sir. that is not a fact. the original bill which the committee began to consider is now printed in the committee hearings and in senate document no. 92. and. with certain exceptions. as i have.pointed out. the present law. so far as it goes. is exactly what came to us from the reclamation service.\\n690013897|is it not a fact that the gentleman who is now addressing the committee objected very seriously to many of the provisions of the socalled fact. finders bill which came to the committee?\\n690013898|yes. sir. and i had the privilege of writing one or two of the amendments which are now the law and which are in the law that the reclamation service refuses to carry out.\\n690013899|just one other question.\\n690013900|if the gentleman pleases. i have pretty nearly used my time.\\n690013901|i am quite sure the gentleman from michigan will yield the gentleman from nebraska more time. does the gentleman mean to say that the present law contains hny paragraph or any provision which he or any member of the irrigation committee in the house wrote or caused to be placed in the act?\\n690013902|yes. sir. and the gentleman gave valuable work on those amendments.\\n690013903|will the gentlemanb yield for one question?\\n690013904|did i understand the gentleman to say a moment ago that the law as it now stands upon the statute books is not being carried out?\\n690013905|that is the burden of my plea. yes.\\n690013906|that is not only the burden of it but it is a direct statement.\\n690013907|yes. sir. on page 107 of senate document 92 is the following: an irrigation district differs essentially from a waterusers association in that all the lands belonging to the district are jointly liable for the project debts and that the district may make its collections in the same manner as taxes are collected. it is generally held that in a waterusers association. properly organized under the laws of the respective states. resides the power to do any or all acts that wofmld lead to the carrying out of the terms of the contract of the association with the federal government. the farmer usually hesitates to agree to the forming of an irrigation district because of his fear that since the district assumes the district obligations he. personally. may become liable for payments overdue from his neighbors. in certain other cases old water rights furnish a complicated problem for district solution. and the waterusers association in such cases seems the simpler form of organization. there is not much real difference between the two organizations. as they would work out the problems of the federal irrigation projects. they said in their letter of transmittal. page 5. of the hearings: the extension act provides that the operation and maintenance of the project may be turned over to the water users. this should be done at the earliest possible date. whether the water users organize as an irrigation district or as an incorporated waterusers association is of little consequence. any benefits that may be devised for the aid of the water users should be contingent upon their willingness to take over the responsibility of operating and managing all but a few of the less settled projects. when this is done. a large proportion of federal reclamation difficulties will disappear. there then is the proof that the fact finding commission considered the question of joint liability and the farmers fear that since the district assumes the district obligations. he. personally. may become liable for payments overdue from his neighbors. they considered the fact that all lands belonging to a district are jointly liable for the project debts . they said that joint liability was the essential difference between a waterusers association and a district. then the fact finders held that joint liability was not material. for they say that there is not much real difference between the two organizations as they would work out the problem of the federal irrigation projects. the fact finding commission did not consider that  joint liability should be a condition precedent to the benefits of this act being granted to the water users. they dismissed it as immaterial and of liftle conseqnence to the working out of the problem of federal reclamation. they did not include it in their recommendation no. 19. and the present law is almost word for word that recommendation."},{"1":"1925","2":"HASTINGS","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. early in february. 1924. there was published and circulated a pamphlet. prepared by certain persons claiming to represent the indian rights association. and other organizations reflecting upon the courts of oklahoma. and charging that the estates of restricted indians in oklahoma were not properly conserved and protected. this report was of such a nature as to attract the attention of the members of the oklahoma delegation in congress. the oklahoma delegation immediately met and sponsored a resolution. introduced by congressman carter. providing for a full investigation of all matters pertaining to indian affairs which would include the courts and the administration of indian affairs in oklahoma. hearings were had upon this resolution before the house committee on indian affairs. and all the members of the oklahoma delegation appeared in favor of it. and while the commissioner of indian affairs did not oppose the passage of the resolution. and disavowed it and deplored the publicity given to the report hereinabove referred to. yet it was apparent to those who really knew the facts that the data was collected in collaboration with representatives of the indian bureau. and it was very clear that none of the cases referred to in the report were known to the representatives of the indian rights association except those brought to their attention by the representatives of the indian bureau. and the members of the oklahoma delegation knew. of course. that this was done for the purpose of discrediting the courts of oklahoma in an effort to secure favorable action upon legislation depriving the courts of oklahoma of jurisdiction in certain indian matters. and reconferring that jurisdiction upon the secretary of the interior. soon after publicity was given to the pamphlet a carbon copy of a bill. which afterwards became h. r. 6900. giving additional authority to the secretary of the interior in indian cases. was sent to the members of the oklahoma delegation asking that the same he introduced for the consideration of congress. it was thought that the charges set forth in the pamphlet above referred to would have the effect to stampede congress and result in the early enactment of this legislation. in the hearings upon the proposed legislation the same cases were presented and the same arguments made that are contained in the pamphlet of the indian rights association above referred to. in fact. in a large measure the very same language is used. so that no one is deceived as to who inspired the issuing of the pamphlet. and its purpose. and the purpose in publishing it at that particular time. notwithstanding the disavowal of the indian bureau and its several representatives of their responsibility for the attack upon the courts of oklahoma. the annual report of the comm issioner of indian affairs. page 25. recently published. admits their connection with the investigation of these matters in connection with the indian frights association and other organizations in the following language: based on numerous statements as to the manner in which the estates of indians were being handled by guardians and administrators under state jurisdiction. officials of the indian service and those connected with outside organizations nrade an investigation. taking up a large number of cases. and on the strength of these reports legislation was sought with a view of restoring to the federal government the complete administration of the estates of these indians. all of the members of the oklahoma delegation knew what the pamphlet was printed for and why it was printed just at that particular time. and knew of the connection of the representatives of the indian bureau in oklahoma with the investigations being made and later embodied in the pamphlet above referred to. the governor of the state of oklahoma tendered the services of the attorney general of the state to the indian bureau and stated that he would be directed to cooperate in every possible way with the representatives of the indian bureau in an effort to prosecute any person or official in the civil or criminal courts charged with any offense toward an indian or neglect of duty as an oflicial in the administration of the laws of the state of oklahoma. thereafter the subcommittee of the house committee on indian affairs went to oklahoma pursuant to the authority granted in a resolution which passed the house on june 4. 1924. reaching muskogee on november 11. 1924. and remained there for a number of days. representatives of the indian rights association and various officials representing the indian bureau in oklahoma were notified when the committee would reach oklahoma. the scope of its authority. and every opportunity was afforded them to present any proof in substantiation of the charges contained in the abovementioned pamphlet. or any other charges which they had to make reflecting upon the administration of probate matters or other indian matters in oklahoma. testimony was taken for several days. and there was no testimnony adduced reflecting upon the integrity of any judge. either of a county court or any other court in oklahoma. what criticism there was of indian matters was directed against procedure and the want of cooperation between the probate attorneys and the courts. it was stated in a few cases that an opportunity was not afforded for the probate attorneys to appear at all times when matters affecting restricted indians came up for consideration. in a few cases it was stated that this was true when conveyances of lands of fullblood heirs of deceased allottees were up for consideration. and that as a result an adequate price was not at all times received. and there was some criticism as to the appointment of guardians. but there was no charge of corruption against a single judge in oklahoma. the chairman of the committee. mr. snyder. voicing the sentiment of the committee. frankly stated during the time the committee remained in oklahoma. in open session. and in various speeches. that there had been no proof presented to the committee that reflected upon the courts of oklahoma. all of the probate attorneys in eastern oklahoma were called before the subcommittee and the superintendent for the five civilized tribes and his subordinate officials were given an opportunity to present any charges they had to make to the subcommittee. and while there were a few differences of opinion ais to whether or not this or that guardian should or should not have been appointed. and in a few cases that there was not full cooperation on the part of the county courts. but in no case was there any accusation to the effect that the courts in oklahoma were corrupt. the members of the subcomnnittee in informal conferences. appreciating that the judges of the county courts were honest and faithful. believed that the procedure might be amended by congress so tmat an opportunity might be afforded the representatives of the indian bureau in oklahoma. the superintendent of the five civilized tribes. the probate attorneys. the field clerks. or any other representatives. to appear before the various courts as a matter of right when matters affecting restricted indians were up for consideration. and that this would be helpful to the courts and to the indian. congress appropriates annually approximately $40.000 for the compensation of probate attorneys. and they are expected to appear on all proper occasions on behalf of restricted indians. of course. all courts welcome assistance in doing justice in all matters brought to the attention of the courts on behalf of everyone. whether indian or white. keeping in mind the informal conferences that were had by the members of the committee and the things it was thought should be corrected. i prepared and introduced a bill embodying the matters suggested by the various members of the committee. section 1 of the bill regulates procedure in the approval of conveyances of land by fullblood heirs of deceased allottees and requires the petition to be filed at least 10 days in advance. notice to the superintendent for the five civilized tribes. and gives the right to the probate attorneys to appear before the courts and see that a fair value is paid for the land. the proceedings are to be had upon certain days. the money paid in open court and in event the county court believes that there should be some supervision over any sum paid that it was to be disbursed under the order of the county court. surely no one can read this section but who will agree that it is legislation in the interest of restricted indians. section 2 provides for the approval of agricultural. grazing. and haycutting leases on restricted lands of indians for more than one year by the county court of the county where the land is located. there was much testimony submitted to the committee to the effect that the leasing of lands for agricultural purposes was greatly abused in that overlapping leases. particularly in the southern part of the state. were made in large numbers. and that titles were clouded. and this was one of the evils brought to the attention of the committee. this section seeks to remedy this evil. and should be considered in connection with section 4. which makes it unlawful to record. or cause to be recorded. any deed or lease not made and approved in accordance with the provisions of the act. this would make it a federal offense punishable by fine and imprisonment. and would stop the clouding of titles. surely everyone will agree that this is legislation in the. interest of the restricted indian. section 3 only requires that all orders of the county court shall be made in open court and shall be effective as judicial decisions. our courts now hold these orders to be ministerial acts. this section seeks to remedy that situation.. section 5 provides that when an application is made for the appointment of a guardian. notice shall be given to the superintendent for the five civilized tribes and the probate attorney or other federal representative who may appear on behalf of any restricted indian. minor or adult. with all the rights of any other attorney before said court. and no more. there was some criticism that as to adult indians an effort was made to have those of large estates adjudged incompetent. and in order -to avoid that criticism a provision was incorporated in section 5 permitting the sole question of whether or not the adult indian is incompetent under the oklahoma law to be removed to and decided by the federal court. this section was furiously assailed before the committee. and it was stated to the members of the committee that this took away a large part of the jurisdiction of the secretary of the interior. and that the secretary disputed the right of the local courts in oklahoma to appoint guardians. of course. every lawyer in oklahoma knows that this is not true and they know that the local courts have the authority to appoint guardians. both for minor restricted indians and incompetent adult restricted indians. many members of the committee. however. are not familiar with the laws of oklahoma and have been misled by misrepresentations of this kind. on february 3. 1925. the supreme court of oklahoma. in the case of lytle et al. v. fulotka et al.. held as follows: the probate courts of the state of oklahoma have jurisdiction to sell the inherited lands of incompetent adult fullblood indians of the five civilized tribes. it is contended that section 6 of the act of may 27. 1908. grants jurisdiction to the probate courts of the state of oklahoma only in the case of minor allottees. said section is limited by its terms to minors and minor allottees. but the probate courts of this state and former indian territory . have habitually exercised probate jurisdiction not only over the estates of minor allottees. but of minor heirs as well. (yarhola v. strough. 64 okla. 195. 166 pac. .729.) section 6 of such act is not the source of jurisdiction of the probate court of the state of oklahoma over the estates of indian minors. it is merely declaratory of the law as it had existed since the passage of the act of april28. 1904. if not before. by that act it was provided : \"and full and complete jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the district courts in said territory in the settlement of all estates of decedents. the guardianships of minors and incompetents. whether indian. freedman. or otherwise.\" thus. full probate jurisdiction was granted to the district courts of indian territory over the estates of decedents. minors. and incompetents. \" whether indian. freedman. or otherwise.\" (morrison v. burnett. 154 fed. (c. c. a.) 617. jennings v. wood. 192 fed. (c. c. a.) 507. robinson v. long gas co.. 221 fed. (c. c. a.) 398. cowles v. lee. 35 okla. 159. 128 pac. 688. wellsvllle oil co. v. miller. 44. okla. 493. 145 pac. 844.) upon the admission of the state into the union this jurisdiction was. by virtue of the constitution an enabling act. conferred upon the probate courts of -the state. congress recognized the jurisdiction of the probate courts over the estates of incompetents by section 2 of the act of may 27. 1908. when. in providing for the leasing of restricted\" lands for oil and gas. it added this proviso : \"and provided further. that the jurisdiction of the probate courts of the state of oklahoma over lands of minors and incompetents shall be subject to the foregoing provisions.\" section 5. of course. conferred no additional jurisdiction upon the courts of oklahoma. but enabled the probate attorneys to be present and represent restricted indians. section 6 authorizes the probate attorneys to be present when all matters affecting restricted indians come up in the courts. including the allowance of claims of fees of attorneys. guardians. or administrators. and gives them the right to introduce testimony. crossexamine witnesses. and take appeals the same as any other attorney. if the courts are honest. as declared by the chairman of the committee on a number of occasions and found by the full committee in its final report. and if the probate attorneys are efficient and zealous. and if given the opportunity. as this section would give it to them. to appear in all cases on behalf of restricted indians. they could be of great assistance in seeing that their rights are protected. generally speaking. the provisions of the bill only regulate procedure and give the representatives of the superintendent for the five civilized tribes. or the indian bureau. the right to be present and to have matters affecting restricted indians heard in open court. and gives them the right of appeal. but gives them no more rights than any other attorneys in the courts. this is all they axe entitled to. and this is all any reputable attorney wants or should have. this is all that any court would permit. and this is all that any court having any selfrespect should permit. the court should welcome all assistance. and as long as the courts of oklahoma are treated with respect. and as long as the representatives of the government appear in a respectful manner. and not in a disrespectful. manner. cooperation may be secured. permit -a personal reference. if i may: i was for years national attorney for the cherokees and had frequent occasion! to appear in a number of the courts of eastern oklahoma. i was given no more rights than any other attorney. and i never felt that i was discriminated against on a single. occasion. it is as incumbent upon the representatives of the federal government to demean themselves respectfully toward the courts of oklahoma as it is for the courts to recognize and treat with. courtesy and respect the representatives of the federal government. abuse of the courts and threats of.superior power of the federal government are not conducive to a better feeling between the courts and the probate attorneys. there are a very large number of splendid men and women. employed in the indian service in oklahoma and throughout the nation. many of them i have known for years. i can not too highly commend them personally or their. work. they have with an unselfish zeal greatly contributed to the indian service at a remuneration much smaller than in other branches of the government service. the courts of our country are entitled to the confidence and respect of the entire citizenship. while the courts extend courtesy to the members of the bar. it should always be remembered that those in the government service are not entitled to and should not expect any greater consideration than any other reputable attorney before the court. when this is understood and thoroughly made known to some employees of the government a better spirit of cooperation will prevail and they will appreciate the necessity of making every effort to cooperate with the courts of the state. the county courts of eastern oklahoma serve the people of that part of the state. there were 101.506 enrolled members of the five civilized tribes. 85 per cent of them are unrestricted and many of the courts have been presided over by members of the tribe since statehood. and other members of the tribe oc-. cupy places on the district bench and the supreme court commission of oklahoma. these courts serve the unrestricted members of the tribes. if they can be trusted to administer the probate affairs of the two and onehalf millions of people of oklahoma. including 85 per cent of the indians in eastern oklahoma. surely no one can doubt but what they should administer the affairs of the very few restricted indians who live and vote in that state. under existing law all restrictions will be removed on april 26. 1931. we must not enact legisi lation that will create a prejudice against them and destroy them. the department of the interior is making a determined effort to secure the enactment of legislation that would give the secretary of the interior practically all of the power now exercised by the probate courts of oklahoma. the people of oklahoma may rest assured that as long as i am in part their rtepresentative i shall oppose such legislation and they may rest assured that no additional authority will be conferred upon the secretary of the interior over members of the five civilized tribes with my vote. the people of oklahoma and of every other state. both now and for all time heretofore. have always detested longdistance government. it is always abused. it leads to all kinds of suspicion that certain persons claiming to have \"influence\" can secure certain favors in the matter of the approval of contracts or claims or other matters coming up for consideration. the atmosphere in washington and in oklahoma is now surcharged with charges and countercharges that a certain favored few claim to have \"influence\" sufficient to secure favorable action upon matters pending before the indian bureau. the testimony recently taken before the investigating committee shows that enormous fees. not for services performed but for \"influence.\" have been ifaid. and this testimony further shows that everyone having a claim of any consequence is intercepted with the suggestion that if favorable action is to be hoped for. it would be well that the services of certain persons be availed of. the people of oklahoma will not stand for this and neither will the people of any other state when the facts are made known. the sooner this is recognized the better. there is no place in the scheme of our government for arbitrary power. we instinctively rebel against it. if the people make a mistake and elect either an incompetent or an unworthy county judge public attention will soon be focused upon him and the mistake corrected at the next election. but this is not true of heads of bureaus or employees occupying responsible positions under them. our government is so large and we have so many different bureaus and so many different employees. that it is next to impossible to secure the removal of these officials and the people therefore must suffer from the arbitrary acts and injustices done by them until there is a change of administration. the rumor is current that it is the hope of certain persons in oklahoma. who advocate reconferring additional authority upon the secretary of the interior. to have a policy adopted of appointing trustees for adult fullblood indians to supervise and manage their estates under the department instead of guardians under the supervision of the local courts. i do not agree with such a policy. these trustees would not be under the civil service but would be partisan and scandals would in the end necessarily grow out of it. there should be no partisanship in the indian service. it must be remembered that the five civilized tribes have a century of civilization behind them. during this time they had their own governments. enacted and administered their own laws. appropriated and disbursed their own funds. and managed their own affairs. tribal and individual. and in considering legislation affecting them they should not be classed as reservation indians. the first agreements looking to the winding up of their affairs were made in 1897. nearly 28 years ago. with the coal and asphalt deposits sold and their claims against the government adjudicated. as is provided for in the jurisdictional bills enacted during the present congress. their affairs could and should be speedily wound up and all of their funds distributed. i favor this at the earliest possible date and to their best advantage. no additional legislation is needed. it is a question of administration and this should be expedited. the coal and asphalt \"deposits should be offered for sale at an early date. i yield to no man in my earnest desire to be of service to the indian. i have tried to be constructively helpful on all indian legislation. and this congress has enacted more beneficial legislation than any other congress in the history of the nation. the record is most commendable. a great many bills have been passed and enacted into law. including jurisdictional bills for each of the five civilized tribest lie delawares. the poncas. the kaws. and the wichita and affiliated bands. i have endeavored in the bill (11. r. 11852) to have these matters tried out in the local courts and in open court. where the light of publicity may be focused upon every transaction. and where there can be no concealment of any detail and where the newspapers may publish every constructive criticism of every act of all officials. whether employee of the government or state official. no one need fear honest criticism. the bill affected only the restricted indians and the restricted property of restricted indians. and was clearly in their interest. i challenge any real friend of the indian to point out a provision not in his interest. during the closing days of congress the calendar is always congested and consideration of bills can only be secured as to those measures unanimously reported. in view of the fact that there has been more or less wide publicity given to this bill and the report i am appending hereto a copy of the bill and the report of the interior department. which does not discuss the terms of the bill.

chairman and gentlemen. the other day i received a certain magazine. and on the back page there was a very elaborate advertisement of southern pine. urging its more extensive purchase and use in building. it mentioned that there were 260.000.000.000 feet of timber in tills tract. and assuming the consumption to be in the neighborhood of 12.000.000.000 feet a year. they said very naively that their forest tract will last for at least 20 years. a wonderful assurance. indeed. but i am thinking what will become oe that country when that entire forest tract is destroyed. coming from the city of new york. i can have only a more or less academic interest in this proposition. for in studying history i have had the thought that ancient nations distinguished for their progress and civilization must have been built up in a fertile land. with forests and streams and plains and meadows. what is the condition of those lands today? they are deserts with nothing to mark them but the crumbling monuments of their ancient civilization. and if we have no forethought of the future we will face not only deforestation but the elimination of our streams and the destruction of our entire civilization. i want to read into the record. with your permission. an extract from a poem which seems to be relevant and pertinent to this occasion: the forest shade that dulled the suns fierce ray and tempered winds that blew from icechilled lands. whose gnarled and tangled roots upheld the soil and stayed the angry rivers ruthless flood. whose verdure drew the welcome rain and made the earth to smile in beanly and abundance. ungrateful man. unmindful of the past. has burned in willful waste. or lewed for greed to till the gaping jaws of industry. oh. man improvident! insensible that fate

babylon!"},{"1":"1923","2":"KNOX","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"and his colleague. as i have said already. were both distinguished and could. i think. be described without exaggeration as remarkable men. but the career of senator penrose was entirely different from that of senator knox and his chief activities were in other fields. although a lawyer by profession and a member of the bar. he went at a very early age into politics. and to politics. after he had once entered upon them. he gave his life work. having held some important state offices. he entered the senate on the 4th of march. 1897. and there he continued during the rest of his life. a continuous service of 25 years. he was a man of unusual and very real native ability. he stood at the head of his class at harvard and had an amount of knowledge upon many subjects with which. as he never made any parade of it. he never was sufficiently credited. when he devoted himself to the work in the senate. which he did more and more in the later years of his service in that body. he showed very marked ability in dealing with all public questions and especially those committed to his care. for by his long service he rose to one of the highest positions in the senatethe chairmanship of the finance committee. he had a mastery of financial questions. especially those connected with the work of that committee. and during the war with germany. when party lines were effaced. he rendered most admirable service in all the difficult work which came to the committee on finance in connection with the revenue and bond legislation. but senator penrose had an especial talent and capacity for political organization. and to the great republican organization of pennsylvania. of which he was for so long the head. he gave his time and strength to a degree which inter. fered with the continuity of his work in the senate. the leader of the pennsylvania republicans. he naturally entered at a comparatively early date the national field and very soon becine a national figureone of the most powerful men. backed as he was by his own great state. in all national conventions where the fate of the party was to be determined. he was a man of unusual force and. when aroused. of equal energy. very early in his career we became friends. and our friendship continued unbroken during all the 25 years of service in the senate. we were both graduates of the same university and. although his graduation was 10 years later than mine. this always constituted a bond between us. his power as a political leader and his capacity as a senator are. of course. known to all who have any familiarity with the political history of the country during the past 25 years. but i have sometimes thought that very few people realized some of the other sides of senator penroses character. for he was naturally both silent and reticent. although always frank. it may be said of all men. and they are not very many. who under our system of government have risen to large political authority as leaders of the party organization in one of the greater states. that one of their conspicuous qualities always is and always must be party fidelity. as well as personal loyalty to friends and supporters. this was very characteristic of senator penrose. a man who had supported him faithfully. no matter how humble his place might be in the politics of the state or the nation. could always rely on senator penroses sympathy and kindly help whenever he called upon him. in one word. senator penrose was a loyal friend. and i say that not only out of my own experience but because i knew a good deal of his relations to others. as i have noted. he was a man who had been distinguished in the studies of his youth and of his college days. and therefore had a wider knowledge of many things unconnected with politics than was usually suspected. and to those who were aware of the fact this quality made him a very agreeable companion. for he could talk of many things not included in politics or public questions. i never could be sure how generally his wit and power of repartee were appreciated. he was by nature and by habit rather taciturn than talkative. but he had the keenest possible sense of humor and he gave utterance to it whenever the spirit moved him. his humor was apt to be sardonic. but it was always genuine. and the things he said were wont to be decorated by odd and unusual words not used by most people. but which were always fitting and expressive and gave both color and point to even the most casual remarks. two years before his death illness came upon him. so severe and so filled with suffering that he was not expected to recover. but. thanks largely to his will power. he rallied and returned to the senate and took up his work in the finance committee. which at that time was exceptionally heavy and laborious. always sustaining much discomfort. frequently much pain. he went steadily on with an uncomplaining and very complete courage to the end. which came at last quickly and unexpected. he was a gallant figure as. crippled and broken. he faced his future and did his duty with a spirit unconquered by physical suffering. he was a brave man. his death was to me a very serious loss. which could not fail to be the case after a close personal association stretching over 25 years. but a man of such ability and power as he possessed could not be otherwise than a loss also to the senate. where lie served so long. and to the state. which trusted him and followed him for so many years."},{"1":"1922","2":"STERLING","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. i desire to speak very briefly upon this question. it is a question which affects very materially certain interests in my own state. and i am primarily led to speak oil the question because of those interests. i wish to say. mr. president. that while i am a protectionist and a thorough believer in the principle of protection. as i think my votes on the various items of the pending tariff bill will show. it is because i believe in protection that i am in favor of the aiendment proposed by tile senator from nevada . i think it may happen sometimes. in order that the full measure of protection may be afforded to certain indlstries in this country. that certain other articles should be oil the free list. i regard cyanide as one of those articles. i think it is proper for us to consider tile most important uses of cyanide in order to determine whether or not the putting of cyanide o the free list will in itself be a protection to certain other vital and important industries. i have before me. mr. president. the summary of tariff information relative to tie pending bill. and i an interested in learning what the tariff commission has to say in regard to the uses of cyanide of potassium and sodium cyanide. \" description and uses\" is the title of the paragraph which is found oil page 1.416 of the summary. and which reads: description and uses: potassium cyanide is a white crystalline solid. readily soluble in water. and extremely poisonous. sodium cyanide. much cheaper fnd having a higher percentage of cyanide. has practically replaced potassium cyanide. which is made either by fusing polassillli ferrocyanide with potassium carbonate and carblon or by fusing cyanamide with potassium chloride and carbon. now. as to its uses: its principal use is for the extraction of gold and silver from their ores. also for fumigation (notably that of citrus fruits). as a solvent for electroplating baths. and as a flux in assaying and metallurgy. air. president. the tariff commission has in substance repeated this description of the uses of cyanide in two other panlphlets. here is the special pampillet entitled \"tariff information survey \" on the articles in paragraph 64 of the tariff act of 1913. in which there is a brief reference to potassium cyanide at page 33. as follows: uses: its principal use is for the extraction of gold and silver from their ores. potassium cyanide is also used extensively for fumigating. especially in the cultureof citrus fruits. i turn to a more complete statement of the tariff commissions surveys. and i find on page 47 of the pamphlet i now hold in my hand the following: the two biggest uses for sodium cyanide are the \" cyanide process of extracting precious metals from their ores and fumigation. lthose atre the two great uses of sodium cyanide. my position. mr. president. is that by having cyanide on the free list we shall protect tile great industries here mentioned which are the principal users of cyanide. i think we all recognize something of the difficulties under which the goldmining industry has la)ored from 1.915 down to the present hour. and why it is that the gold production of this country has fallen off more than onehalf. i do not think it should be the policy of congress to put any additional burde1s upon that industry. but that: it should. indeed. instead of putting an additional burden. adopt a policy of relieving the industry from some of its present burdens. it is estimated that one mine in my state. the homestake mining co.. wilt. nder this bill. have to pay $8.000 because of the proposed tariff duty of 10 per cent upon cyanide. tills industry. mr. president. in the black hills section of south dakota ias leretofore produced nearly $7.500.000 of gold and silverprincipally goldeach and every year for a long period of years. and which employed at one time. i think. prior to 1915. about 3.500 men: has employed during the last three or four years aboult 1.600 len. that is some indication of the decline of the gold industry the country over and theunemployilent of labor arising therefrom. and that it is all due to the great cost- of producing gold during the last five or six years. mr. president. the gold producer is not like any other producer. he is not like the manufacturer who can pass the tariff upon the raw material on to the consumer to whom lie sells. the price of gold is fixed. and there is no chance to pass a tax or a tariff of any kind on to any consumer or to any user of gold. what is always the vital and important consideration in fixing of a tariff designed to protect an industry? the one great consideration always emphasized. to which we always revert. is not how to protect those who own and operate the industry. but how shall we protect those who labor in the industry. and by our system of wages provide for that higher standard of living to which we think the american workignman is entitled. that is the great question. take that into account. and then weigh the benefits. so far as labor is concerned. of a tariff upon cyanide and the benefits that will accrue from having cyanide on the free list. iow many men are engaged in this one cyanide plant in the united states. that of roessler & hassiacher co. in new jersey? it is reported. i think. that they number 250 men: at any rate. that statement appears in the hearings two or three times."},{"1":"1921","2":"REED","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. i have not been able to be in my seat- during a considerable part of the deliberations on the bill. having been kept from the senate by work on committee. i do not rise to oppose the enactment of the amendment in the nature of a substitute reported from the committee by the senator from oregon . it seems to be the consensus of opinion that something must be tried in the way of an experiment. as the bill is now amended it probably has removed from it many of the dangers that characterized the original bill. and it probably will not result in any great loss to the government. but i can not refrain from saying that in my judgment this apple of sodom will turn to ashes upon the expectant lips of the farmers of the country. i hope it will not. i hope it will prove of great benefit. but the. bill belongs to that class of legislation which undertakes to cure by statute an economic c6ndi4633 tion. every attempt of that kind of which i know anything has ended in failure. a few weeks ago. under whip and spur. we passed an emergency tariff bill the proponents of which informed us would bring immediate relief to all farmers of the united states. one of the most distinguished of the advocates of that measure told us that if we put a tariff of 35 cents a bushel on wheat it would send the price of wheat back fo where it had been a year prior. if that had resulted. the price would have gone up $1.05. and we would have been presented with the miracle of a tariff of 35 cents a bushel raising the price $1.05 a bushel. of course it would have followed that if the american price had gone up $1.05 a bushel the foreign producer of wheat could have shipped it to the american market and made 70 cents more than his former price after he had paid the tariff. the inevitable result would have been that all the wheat of canada and all the wheat of the world would have started toward the american ports the next day after the price was raised and our markets would have been flooded and our prices would have gone to nothing. but we did put upon the statute books the emergency tariff billwith what result? i have not with me. because i had not expected to say a word here today. the figures as to all of the products named in that bill. but wheat went down 31 cents a bushel in 30 days. i do not know what it has been doing since. it is the old attempt to seek to control prices by statute. they can be controlled by statute to a degree when the goods must be imported into the united states. and particularly when there is a domestic quasi or total monopoly. but the law does not raise the price. the law simply enables some monopoly or some producer to raise the price. so the. operation of the law is to deprive a free people of the right of a free market. but no statute has ever been passed that has created a dollar of wealth. every honest dollar ther6 is in the world is the product of honest toil. for all the real wealth of the world somebodys back has bent in labor. somebodys brow has poured out the sweat of exertion. the bill. in my judgment. will do but little. if any. good. because the great question of prices. after all. is controlled by economic conditions of the world. i am speaking now of prices that are not artificially interfered with. we may get a little additional market for a few days or a few weeks in europe through financing operations. but in the long run it will be found that people unable to buy can not buy and that people able to buy will buy without any attempt at artificial stimulus. we can not control the price levels of this great world. there are some who believe that america is possessed of a kind of supernatural power. an attribute that can be ascribed to divinity itself. the teeming millions of the world must feed themselves. must clothe themselves. and they must produce the money with which to pay for what they consume. so. hoping that the bill may do all that its proponents dream or think it will accomplish. i predict that. after all. the world must finance itself. if we could induce the world to return to honest dealing. to honest money. to honest production. if they would quit fighting and go to working. the problem that confronts the united states and confronts the world would be the more speedily solved."},{"1":"1920","2":"FESS","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. chairman. i have listened to this debate with more than ordinary interest and have noted that the bill lias been assailed from very many angles. i have had a good deal of sympathy with much of the opposition that has been uttered. however. it strikes me as i have listened to the arguments. pro and (.oi. that there is an emergency and that the emergency ought. if possible. to be met in some way. i do not believe. of course. that this is a scientific effort at tariff legislation. no one would even intimate such a thing. there are but 16 items covered by this emergency bill. and as i recall the last tariff measure covered something like 657 items. this simply l)icks out the items of production on the farm that have suffered from conditions produced under the stress of war. if there is any justification for the passage of the bill at all. it must be upon the basis upon which the committee has placed it. i appreciate the situation that has been portrayed here. war has been over for two years. up to the time of the closing of the war all of the world was enlisted in production to mneet war needs. we were straining every nerve. not only in america bilt in every country. to produce to the maximum. the cry went out thift we must have the food and the materials in order to win the war. and there was scarcely an idle person anywhere in any nation on the globe. when the war ended. ours was the only country that had ready money. warridden europe was without money and credit. and other countries in europe that were not belligerent and even some countries that were belligerents. like new zealand and australia. began bending their energies.to produce for the war demands. but when the war ended they found themselves stocked up with such a supply as they had never had before. and for two years we have witnessed the inability of wartorn europe to buy the worlds production. and yet the price was on a war basis and ours the only country able to pay cash. the result was that all the world made america a dumping ground ror the sake of getting our money. australia flooded our markets with the excess products that she could not sell in europe. idt could sell in america. for our ready cash. the game thing was true of south america and in all of the countries of the old world not belligerent. the result was inevitable that quantities of rice and quantities of wool and quantities of corn and of wheat and of potatoes and of cattle and of other agricultural products. especially those included in the classes. named in this bill. something like 16 in number. came to our country unhindered. what is the situation? we have got them here at prices below the cost of our own production. they have come from europe. japan. australia. new zealand. and south america. and they have received war prices for them and the result is that american production is today without a marketglutted. i realize as much as any member on either side of the aisle that this glutting of the market and the falling of prices are inevitable. i know as you know that industry everywhere is slowing down. production on a war scale can not continue. liquidation of war conditions must come. prices iust come down even though at great loss to the producer. the farmer. the basic producer. suffered more poignantly than anybody else. and this legislation is designed to give him som relief. if we do not lay an embargoand i do not think people would want to do thatthen let us put the barrier of an import duty up against further floods of importation. higher than it now isand many of these articles are on the free listand then if europe. selling to america. competes with american producers. let her pay a duty to help run the expenses of the government. that is the philosophy of this bill. as a scientific measure. i repeat. it has absolutely no defense. it is not an embargo. for still the markets are open. but as t remedial legislation to protect further our products from im- c portations from europe at cheap labor cost. it is a measure that will win my support as a temporary relief until a tariff measure can be brought in. i would not support it as legislation of a permanent character. as it has no scientific basis. notwith- i standing its temporary character. i do not object to thecom.i mittee refusing to admit these proposed amendments. for if you did in one article you would have to do it in every other article. f the committee has selected the articles which have depreciated 50 iter cent in value. and as temporary relief. as an emergency i measure. i am voting for it. but. mr. chairman. my vote on a"},{"1":"1919","2":"MCFADDEN","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. chairman. i have read carefully the hearings before the ways and means committee. before which committee the secretary of the treasury and other experts from the treasury department appeared and gave expression to their views in regard to this bill. authorizing the issuance of $7.000.000.000 worth of shortterm government securities and $2.000.000.000 treasury certificates now. expenditures in november. december. and january. exclusive of transactions in the principal of the public debt. amounted to $5.958.576.114.24. practically $2.000.000.000 a month. the amount of treasury certificates of indebtedness outstanding on january 31 was $4.798.064.800. of which $3.225.099.500 were issued in anticipation of the victory liberty loan. expenditures for the first seven months of the fiscal year ending june 30. 1919. exclusive of the principal of the public debt. amounted to $12.594.498.537.96. secretary mcadoo before he retired expressed the hope that the expenditures for the whole fiscal year would be in the neighborhood of only $18.000.000.000. the new secretary now says $19.000.000.000. how much it will be by the end of june no one can tell now. commitments. army contracts. requirements for military expenditures abroad. shipping board. naval program. guaranties. food administration. and so forth. complete to date nearly $5.000.000.000. increasing at the rate of $1.400.000.000 a month. amount of bonds authorized and unissued under existing acts are slightly in excess of $5.000.000.000. authorizations under the first bond act have been $2.000.000.000. and under the second. third. and fourth acts. $20.000.000.000. and approximately $17.000.000.000 of bonds have been sold under the four acts. to this you add the treasury certificates of indebtedness outstanding january 31. 1919. of $4.798.064.800. together with the original debt of about $1.000.000.000 at the beginning of the war. and you have a total debt of $22.798.064.800. or nearly $23.000.000.000. and added to this is the undisclosed debt which the present secretary of the treasury estimated before the ways and means committee at $5.000.000.000. if the secretarys guess is correct. one can readily see and understand that the debt of this government at the end of this year will be $30.000.000.000 or more. probably more. this bill provides. among other things. for an authorization of $7.000.000.000 of shorttime notes at what the secretary terms a. victory loan at popular rates of interest. and i realize that to float this large loan in a situation like the present that the great burden is going to fall upon the federal reserve and other banks. i have great misgivings in regard to this. as i am fearful that this course will mean that the banks liquid funds will be used up and that rediscounts and the issuance of federal reserve notes will have to be resorted to to an alarming extent. i believe it would be much better to raise the rate of interest and issue longtime bonds and sell them to investors rather than to the banks. the american people are more interested in a successful quick flotation of this next issue than they are in the rate of interest. i realize that grave responsibilities rest upon the treasury department in floating the next loan. the public will not enthuse over it as they did over previous bond campaigns. furthermore. conditions have changed since then. for during those campaigns three jobs were seeking every man. whereas now many men are seeking jobs. and again. labor then was more highly rewarded than it will be during the next campaign. in order to impress on you the danger of permitting our debt to remain unfunded. i refer to no less an authority than the bankers magazine of london. where. in an issue during the year 1913. it editorially called attention to the pall on the money markets of london. paris. and berlin. which the unfunding of the $300.000.000 balkan war debt had caused. if the failure to fund that small debt at that time should produce the effect attributed to it in the money market whose peoples had enjoyed peace and a wonderful industrial and commercial activity for more than a generation. what may we now expect on the worlds money markets if we permit this vast war debt to drag along and remain unfunded for any considerable period of time? business will never recover its equilibrium until that war debt is funded and the money markets made free for our business enterprises to enter and finance their necessary demands. i heartily favor the principle of raising a sinking fund for the retirement of these bonds at maturity. the bill proposes to raise a sinking fund yearly of 2i per cent. so as to retire them in 25 years. if the sinkingfund rate be 1 per cent. they would be retired at the end of 41 years. on the assumption that there will be eighteen billion of bonds. this wound mean a difference between $450.000.000 and $180.000.000. or $270.000.000. yearly we would have to raise in taxes to provide for the sinking fund. but before we get through financing this war we will have a debt nearly thirty billion. and if we plan to retire it on a 2j per cent basis it will mean the raising of $750.000.000 taxes yearly to meet such demand. whereas if we retire it in 41 years on a 1 per cent basis we would have to raise but $300.000.000 for such purpose. this shows the difference in the operation of compound interest over a short and long period. if the interest be compounded annually. then at the end of the first year there is no difference between simple and compound interest. whereas taken for a long period the difference according to the length of the period. for instance. the calculation was made by a british actuary once to ascertain the difference between an investment of a british penny. equal to 2 cents. at 5 per cent from the birth of christ to the year 1900. and he declared that at simple interest the investment would amount to $1.92. whereas at compound interest it would equal a globe of pure gold 58.000.000.000 times the size of the earth. another reason why we should not retire our bonded debt in the short period of 25 y~ars is to prevent inflation. suppose we were to retire that vast amount of indebtedness in one year. does not anyone know it would result in inflation? for the public would have so much idle money that they would resort to all sorts of extravagances and overconsumption. and that would cause the same disturbance of values we have at present. and that is bound to produce unrest among the masses. that debt should be retired over a considerable period of timenot less than 16 years. if it could be retired at the rate of one billion yearly it would be most helpful to the next generation. because that amount of fresh capital being brought into the market every year from this source alone would become a powerful stimulant to business of every kind and would not produce inflation. neither would it disturb other permanent investments. i therefore propose an amendment that the sinking fund be at the rate of 1 per cent instead of 2 per cent. as provided in the bill. it is unnecessary for me to remind the members who served in the last congress of my hostility to everything paternalistic. but as the new members do not know my views on this question i trust it will not be considered an intrusion on your valuable time for me to make mention of my position on this question. this bill contains some paternalistic features which i would have opposed five years ago to the best of my ability and energy. for i could not then conceive that at this time we would be confronted with the condition which exists throughout the civilized world. and especially in countries which were the best customers for the products of our farms. factories. and mines. it is now nearly five years since the cataclysm broke loose in europe which destroyed more wealth than existed in the entire world at the beginning of the nineteenth century. only a few frenchmen. and but one englishman (kitchener). realized from the start what it meant and the effort required to preserve the freedom of civilization. but when the englishmen did finally awake to the real importance of the event they. rallied to the support of their government to a man. they. freely submitted to their government commandeering every. pound of their wealth. and every ablebodied man of the realm went to thetraining camp. many of whom. the flower of british manhood. lie buried beneath french soil today. the same is true respecting our other allies. france and italy. but to a worse degree. for their territories were invaded by the hun. who removed the machinery of their factories to their own country and laid waste everything of value they could not carry. away. abnormal conditions justify abnormal remedies. if it were a sound financial policy for the governments of those countries to commandeer those factories and convert them into munition plants. then it is equally sound for them to aid in their rehabilitation. because the government is the only body which can equitably apportion the damage done to all interests served in dismantling those factories and other institutions engaged in the arts of peace. it would require generations for private capital to reestablish those industries. for it is timid and lacks the initiative to take hold with boldness. if private capital should make such an attempt it would become discredited among the credit institutions of the country. so the individual who attempted such philanthropic work would destroy his own usefulness by losing his wealth or power to do good. the very basis of credit is character. experience.. honesty. and energy. but the former heads of many of those enterprises are dead. killed in battle. and the new heads have unestablished character. doubtless many of those new heads are far better business men than the former heads. for they are young men who have grown up in the business and therefore better able to do that business than the former heads. but they lack reputation or the establishment of character as a basis of credit. mark the prediction: some of the young business men in those countries. and our ow.n as well. will astound the world. for they have done more thinking and had more experience during the past five years than their fathers did and had in a generation. in this connection i desire to quote an excerpt from an editorial which appeared in sundays new york times. entitled \"good times ahead.\" it said: it is true that the world never witnessed such destruction of capital. but it is also true that it never witnessed such increased capacity of production. that is more important. the destruction is temporary and has stopped. while the increase of production is as permanent as we choose to make it under the stimulus of world wants and american capacity to supply them. the world lacks food and clothes and materials to supply every want to a total of uncounted billions.. here only is plenty in goods and capacity of quick production. every consideration of neighborly duty and selfinterest constrains us to remove the obstacles in the way of bringing foreign buyers and our sellers together. we are just as dependent on those countries as purchasers of our surplus products as they are on us. for if we fail to dispose of our surplus products then prices will go to smash and we will be in the throes of a panic. if all at once you reduce the wheat farmers product to $1 per bushel and the cotton farmers products to 10 cents per pound you destroy their ability to patronize the steel mills and cotton factories and to buy the bonds of the industrial and transportation concerns of the country. that will bring about unemployment of labor in the industrial centers aud a panic will ensue. -the only way we can prevent such a catastrophe is to make loans to those foreign governments by floating the shorttime notes and bonds of our own government. for they can not float their own government securities in this country as our people are not habituated to the purchase of such securities. previous to the breaking out of the european war our foreign trade balance was about $400.000.000 yearly. at that time europe owned about $5.000.000.000 of our investments. from which they realized an annual income of. some $200.000.000. our tourists who went abroad spent about $150.000.000 every year. the difference they made up in shipping charges. insurance. and a few minor things. but since then we have ceased to be a foreign debtor and become a foreign creditor to the same extent that we were their debtor. and we will become their creditor to a much greater amount during the next five years if we exercise the same sound business judgment to which we are accredited. we must rehabilitate britain and france. for in so doing we will not only enrich them as they enrich themselves in lending us the five billions to which we were indebted to them at the beginning of the war. but we will enrich ourselves twofoldfirst. by furnishing markets for our surplus products. and. second. by teaching our people the savings and investment habit and causing them to become the owners of sound securities. i believe that our government should make direct loans to those foreign governments and not use the war finance corporation to do it. the latter is owned by our government. all of whose capital was advanced by our government and is fully controlled by government officials. then why have two such loan agencies? the older agency. the treasury department. is the one we should employ. the public will not have the same confidence in the securities of the war finance corporation that they have in similar securities issued by the government. for the simple reason the public is not familiar with it. then there is not the same opportunity for deals to be made out of the securities issued by the government that there will be of those issued -by that corporation. and then the final deal will be in closing up the affairs of that corporation in which some pets are sure to make big sums at the expense of the government."},{"1":"1918","2":"RAINEY","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"after referring to the delusions

year inder the underwood bill. until the war :interrupted its procedure. we got $225.000:000 a year. a tariff bill can be arranged by imalosing -maxn*um rates upon all schedules which will yield $400.000.000 -and that will not mean protection. it will mnean that certain s(hedules must be lowered. it will not mean free trade. but will mean certain schedules must be higher. -but as compared to

circumstances not only justify the act but in fact demand it or some similar legislation. my criticisni is ndt against the bill. but i do desire to condemn the ptiblicity campaign. carried on at

itwounld not have -been proposed nor would it have an advocate in this chamber if it were not for the extraordinary conditions of the hour. its provisions are so revolutionary that its proponents seem to have feared its *reception by the nation. and doubtless for that reason a press agent has been busy for many weeks. notonly flooding the ilails with foolish and fulsome articles regarding \" the miracle man\" who is to administer it but with predictions as to its purposes and probable accomplishments that inmany instances amount to absolute misstatement. as a result of this campaign every congressman has received hundreds of letters from those who are distressed by the high cost of food products appealing to them to support this measure as the means of relief from the present almost intolerable economic .conditions in america. i can ilagaine r.othing more cruel than the raising of such false hopes. on the other land. the farlner has been taught to believe that the bill is designed to stilulate production by offering hin greater rewards for the fruits of his toil. many nebraska farmers have written .m urging ha: te in tile enactment of this bill as calculated to benefit them. in iny judgment tis legislation is to prove. the greatest disappointment of this session. not because it will not accon-. pllish the purpose of its enactment. but because it will :lcom.plish the purpose of its enactment and because that iul)ourse is -exactly the reverse of what the nation has been educated to expect.. t1is bill is not- designed to benefit the american producer nor the american consumer. it will quite likely cause sacrifice on the part of both. it is designed with the. single purpose of relieving the food shortage amnong the allied powers as- an absolute military necessity. and any other operative effect will be merely incidental to the main object. . it is amazing to me how the press bureau of this food administration has been able to convince the farmer that lie is to get a higher price for his products as. a result of this legislation and at the salne time convince the laboring iman that lie is to buy tiese same products for less money. i am unable to comprehend the mental operations of men who contend tlat the billwill at once stimulate pl:oduction and reduce prices. my observation of human nature prevents me from believing that you can stimulate production by reducing the price to the producer. i have never entertained great faith in the ability of a legislative body to recreate humanity. nor to repeal natural law. the laws which control this universe are founded in the eternal equities -and are in harmony with every fact every incident. every other law of existdnce. the circumstance has never been nor never will it be upon which the operation of natural law vill disturb the equilibrium. this bill not only seeks to.interfere with the due operation of the fundamentallaw of supply and demand as:a factor in prices. but it substitutes in its stead a law of our own iaking. ithe law of supply and demand furnishes a great condulit through which products will flow from the producer to the consumer if not interfered with. if one througl avarice or other unworthy. motive seeks to retard the flow by obstruction and thereby corner the market. i favor the most drastic legislation not. only to remove the obstruction. but to: punish him

bill. i have always heretofore favored this bill. aid i ihope that this time. if the president vetoes it. it will be passed in spite of that fact. and iam one man who stands ready to so vote. it may be that the literacy test will not accomplish all that some of its friends claim for it. but it will do something. i think that this is a critical time in the history of this country. when the war in europe closes there will be greater necessity. in my judgment. than ever before for the restriction of immigration. this bill will. in some degree atjleast. help to protect our country. and especially will it help to maintain the standard of wages and the standard of living that we have in america. of course. i think it of vital importance that this legislation be supplemented by tariff legislation to protect american labor. unrestricted immigration is little worse for the laboring classes of this country than unrestricted importation. to bring foreign cheap labor into this country is not more destructive to our wage system and to the standard of living of the american workingman than is the unrestricted admission into this country of the products of foreign cheap labor. i do not believe the american people will be satisfied until we have accompanied this legislation with a protectivetariff measure. unless we do this. as soon as the great conflict in europe closes this country will be flooded with foreignmade goods as it has never been before. it is unnecessary to argue to any reasonable mind that if we buy goods from abroad that it means that much work and that much wages taken frond the wage earner at home. i regret that this bill was not amended so as to compel all aliens coming into the united states by water to enter at a seaport of the united states. and especially would i like to have seen the amendment which i offered adopted that provided that no alien should be admitted to the united states who has entered canada by a pacific coast seaport. except at a seaport of the united states. when this amendment was offered it was argued that other provisions in the bill took care of this situation. i am satisfied that this is a mistake. it is true that the department has the power to prescribe the ports of entry. and especially for the chinese. but while they possess this power it has been impossible to get them to exercise it. for several years. in spite of all protests. our government has been in partnership with the canadian pacific railroad. the railroad has furnished offices for the immigration inspectors of this country. i look upon such arrangements as distinctly discreditable to this nation. of course. in doing this the canadian pacific rail. road expects to get its reward. and it does. as a result. it receives the chinese traffic. i am not especially representing any railroad interest. but. as i have heretofore stated. i do not hesitate to favor an american railroad as against a foreign railroad. but the chinese question is not the largest one involved in this proposition. when the war in europe closes there will probably be a heavy immigration to the pacific coast through the panama canal. under present conditions these immigrants to the pacific northwest will be landed at vancouver. british columbia. all the money expended in relation to their examination and detention will be spent in vancouver instead of in an american city. all advantages will be given to the canadian pacific railroad instead of to an american railroad. the canadian land agent and promoter will be given the first opportunity to meet these immigrants. they will have the chance to get the cream of this immigration. and those that they can not persuade to remain in canada and those they do not want will then come into our country. why this discrimination? why should not this country favor its own people. as canada always does? why should not these foreign steamship companies be compelled to land these immigrants at some port on puget sound instead of going to vancouver? why is it that this government must constantly discriminate against its own steamship lines. its own railroad lines. and its own working classes in favor of those in canada? i submit that i have watched with a great deal of impatience legislation forthe past five years with reference to the pacific northwest. for i have seen practically every act that has gone upon our statute books discriminate not in favor of the united states but in favor of canada. while it may be that the department has power to stop this discrimination. they have shown no desire to do so. and for this reason i think that it was a mistake that the committee refused to adopt my amendment that would have compelled -them to take such action. now. another thing that is radically wrong. the vancouver office is under the control of the montreal office. there is no justification for such action. it is all part of the canadian pacific influence that causes this to be done. there can be no good reason why vancouver should be under the control of the montreal office. more than 3.000 miles away. instead of under the seattle office. only a hundred miles away. this situation has become so aggravated and is so unjustified that were it not for. the fact that the department is now investigating the question i would introduce a resolution at once calling for an investigation as to why this situation is permitted to continue. unless the department by the next session of congress take some steps to make this change. i shall proceed to ask for an investigation. to see if the truth can not be ascertained as to why this is done. i am satisfied that this situation is largely. because of the attitude of the commissioner of immigration at montreal. mr. clark. i very much fear that mr. clark is more favorable to the interests of the canadian pacific railroad. than to the interests of his own country. as a result of the conditions which i have described. a great many chinese have been coming into the state of washington from british columbia that ought not to come. that state has been flooded recently by labor from british columbia and once in washington. they have not been permitted to return. i have already called the committees attention to an order that was issued in council by the government at ottawa on the 30th of september. 1915. which contained a provision to the effect that labor. skilled or unskilled. was prohibited from entering british columbia. i brought to the attention of the committee a case where a young man from seattle had been working for the ford motor co. in british columbia for several months. he was a skilled workman. he visited his home in seattle. and when ie attempted to return was. under this order to which i have referred. excluded. and the british columbia officer stated that if he had not gone home he would have been deported. i am glad to say that upon the presentation of these facts the committee accepted my amendment. which read as follows: that whenever any foreign country contiguous to the united states shall by statute. executive order. or otherwise. exclude from its terrl tory any class or classes of citizens of the united states upon grounds different from the grounds. for excluding aliens from the united states herein specified. the same class or classes of aliens residing in such contiguous country shall be excluded from the united states so long as such exclusion of united states citizens continues. this will do a great deal to protect the state of washington from this labor coming in from british columbia. i am pleased that at last the american congress has had the courage and the good judgment to resent this constant discrimination that british columbia makes against this country. i consider this one of the most important features of the bill. so far as my state is concerned. for the past tw6 years it has been reported that a large percentage of the unemployed in our state came in from british columbia. and that more than half of those who applied for public aid in the city of seattle came from this province. the department does not have sufficient assistance to enforce the law in the state of washington. they ought to have a larger number of inspectors. the department ought also to have a vessel for the purpose of patroling puget sound. i am sorry that the committee did not accept my amendment upon this proposition. although i recognize that this is hardly the proper bill for legislation of that character. the statements that i have made above have been largely suggested by a letter written by mr. e. p. marsh. president of the washington state federation of labor. to hon. william b. wilson. secretary of labor. under date of november 5. 1915. this letter is the best presentation of the situation. so far as my state is concerned. that i have seen. it shows that mi. marsh has given the question a great deal of careful and conscientious consideration. his statement of the case also commends itself strongly for the spirit of fairness and conservatism with which he treats the problem. it is of sufficient importance until i think that. notwithstanding the fact that it is somewhat lengthy. it should be printed in full in the record. i will insert it at this point. as it is worthy of a careful reading by the members of this house. as i am going to insert this letter. ishall not take up further time in discussing any. of the details. as they are covered more fully and in better shape in this letter than i could do it."},{"1":"1915","2":"POWERS","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. chairman. a few days ago when the immigration bill wias before this house. an attempt was made to pass it over the veto of the president. during the discussion of that measure the gentleman from minnesota in the course of his remarks made this statement: there is not a laboring man in the united states who will not agree with me that the trouble with labor is not in the number of competitors. but in the selfish greed of big business that takes from him the fruits of his toll. he made other statements along that line. and i asked him this question: what laws would the gentleman suggest that would bring this opportunity. this panacea. to the laboring man? we would like something specific on that score. in reply mr. manahan said: that is a very simple proposition. and i am surprised that the gentleman from kentucky would ask a question so elementary. yet i ought not to say that iam surprised when i consider that he comes from a constituency where somcthing in the neighborhood of 30 per cent of the people are illiterate. after mr. manahan had concluded his remarks i stated\" to him that later in the day i would. when an opportunity presented itself. answer the charge of illiteracy which he had made against my constituency. i did that. i pointed out thf t the statement was unfounded in truth and in fact. that instead of having an illiteracy of 30 per cent it was less than 20 per cent. mr. manaian was prcrent and made a brief reply to my statement and i thought that the incident had closed. the congressional record of the following day contained mr. maahans speech in full. together with the little colloquy that he and i had had. and i was sure it was over. in a day or two following that my attention was called to the fact that another remarks on the part of mr. manahan. in which he made a vicious assault upon the constituents i have the hoaor to represent. among other things. he said this: it will be conceded. i think. that the gentlemans district is in bad shape intellectually. and as it is a part of the united states geographicallyimplying thereby that it was not a part of it

vicious assault. either upon the gentleman from minnesota or his constituents. i shall do it upon the floor of this house. and if possible in the presence of the gentleman and not under leave to print. i notified him that on this afternoon i expected to make a reply to his extension of remarks in the record. what i say i would like to say in his presence. i shall not pursue what i was about to say was a cowardly course and attack the gentleman or his constituents under a leave to print. but i will not use the word cowardly as applied to his conduct because i do not desire to be unparlimentary and that would be unparlianmentary. . i have never at any time in a speech here attacked the motives of any member of this house in any position he has taken on any question before this body. or upon any vote he has seen fit to cast. the man who indulges in it. in my judgment. is indulging in a little business. it sometimes happens here. and some of it has been going on recently in another body at the other end of this building. i deplore it. it comes in bad grace. in the private walks of life if one gentleman attacks the motives of another without justification his conduct justly is characterized as that of a coward. i submit that the proprieties. the amenities. the courtesies. the dignity of this body. demand of its members the practice of at least as many of the ordinary virtues and civilities in their conduct one toward another as are practiced by the average citizen in the ordinary walks of life. if we hear a street urchin or some one from the underworld pouring forth his billingsgate and applying opprobrious epithets to some one who has displeased him. his outgivings throw no light upon the character of the man whom he assails. but they do throw a flood of light upon the individual making the assertions. that is as certainly true in this body as it is elsewhere. nor have i ever assailed any section of this great country by reason of its illiteracy or for any other of its shortcomings. i hope i never may. as an american citizen i would despise myself if i should pursue that sort of conduct. i would hate myself if i were to take pride in parading before the public gaze the shortcomings of the people of the state of minnesota or the people of any other section of this great country. the gentleman says that i ought to print in the form of a public document the alphabet. the first reader. and the multiplication table and send them down to my illiterate constituents under my frank. the advice of a man who exhibits such poor taste and judgment. as the gentleman from minnesota has exhibited in characterizing my constituents as being illiterate. could not be safely followed by any decent. selfrespecting american. and i want to say to him. and i want him to know. that there are men down in my district who. though they can not read a word or write a line in any language or dialect. if sent as representatives here would father safer and saner legislation than any that has emanated. or ever will emanate. from the diseased and disordered brain of the windy gentleman hailing from the blizzards and snowdrifts of minnesota. the gentleman casts the obloquy of illiteracy upon my district. and intimates that but for that i would not be here as a member. there is at least one important difference between the gentlemans constituents and mine. and that is this: mine know enough to elect me to office. his know too much to elect him. in the recent primary down in my district i beat my republican opponent nearly 10.000 majority. i carried 14 out of the 15 counties. i beat him nearly 5 to 1. i won by about 10.000 majority in the final election and carried all the counties. i am informed that in a primary election held not long since out in the state of minnesota the gentleman was a candidate for the republican nomination for attorney general out in that state and was beaten by a majority of nearly 2 to 1. his

not object to the fact that the managers of the \" congress\" have \" collected money for their propaganda.\". ie charged that they used solicitors for this purpose and paid these solicitors onehalf ofthe money thus collected from innocents who thought they were giving up their cash for legitimate constructive waterway promotion. and could not have known that half of it stayed with the seductive gentlemen who took it away from them. how would you like to handa persuasive gentleman $10 \" for rivers and harbors\" promotion. knowing that he was going to keep $5 for his own drinks. cigars. and

and when we asked them why they called it that they said. because it had increased the yield of crops all over that county. now. to show you the effect of this work. i will take that county where we have been at work the longest time. it is a county up in the mountains. where apple trees do very well. the farmers have had apple orchards there ever since they have been there. but they had never taken any special care of those orchards. they had never done any spraying. they knew nothing about pruning. and they knew nothing about packing. sorting. or marketing the apples . they would simply take everything off the trees they could getgood. bad. and indifferent.and put the apples in barrels aud sell to the local buyers. three years ago he interested a few men in pruning and spraying their orchards. that fall lie got them to form a little organization. and built a packing shed alongside the railroad. he helped them grade their apples. and that fall those men shipped out three carloads of especially line apples. they got t net price of 85 cents a bushel for them. while those who sold locally got from 25 cents to 50 cents. now. the next year more farmers came into this organization. and they shipped 42 carloads of apples last year from that one county. the year before was the first time a carload had ever been shipped by the farmers. but for this year i have not had a report. i do not know how many carloads were shipped this year. but i am sure more than *last year. the farnimanagement work proper was first provided for in the appropriation bill of 1904. at the same time the knapp work in the south was commenced. as a matter of fact. but little was done in the northern states for many years outside of investigation. dr. spillman. of the department of agriculture. now at the head of the farm management bureau. had charge of all the investigation. dr. knapp had charge of the cooperative demonstration work in the south. large appropriations were made to exterminate the boll weevil. but it was found out that there was no way to head off the ravages of this insect. and. as a matter of fact. the appropriations which were made presumably to exterminate the boll weevil have been used very largely in teaching the poorer class of farmers in the south.the elementsof agriculture. they have been taught the benefits of diversification of industry. crop rotation. soil fertility. and so forth. i commend to the members of the house the statement made by dr. knapp on page 41 of the hearings. the statement of dr. knapp is as follows: now. what we do nith this money is to put county demonstration agents at work. who take up with the farmers the problem of how to produce cotton under bollweevil conditions. and at the same time show them how they can grow their own meat. grow their own forage. and grow their own corn. and. as they say in the south. live at home. where we strike a territory in the south. as you gentlemen from the south know. in which cotton has been raised for years and yearg under old conditions. it has been the custom of every renter. every tenant. and practically every farmer. even where he owned his own farm. to go to his merchant or to his banker and get his advance for the next year. the entire cotton crop was raised on credit. when the boll weevil came along cite bankers lost faith in the ability of the people to prodice cotton . they got frightened and withdrew credit from the farmers: the merchants withdrew credit. and they could not get credit from their bankers. or from the commission men in new orleans. atlanta. or other central places. and when credit goes down. as happened in mississippi. labor. when it can not get an advance. simply gives up and leaves the country. and it comes back very sloiy in fact. a good deal of that labor will never come back to the territory it left. the result being abandoned houses. abandoned farms. fields lying idle. distress. aid everything of that sort. now. under those circumstances we must teach those people to grow their own stuff so they will not have to have that amount of credit. and that we can do if we have rctn teaching them how to raise corn. forage. peanuts. and other things. by doing that work we save farms from icing abandoned. because we put them on their feet and teach them how to farm successfully. and those who follow the directions of the government in raising cotton continue to raise cotton year in and year out successfully. even with the boll weevil there. for example. it is quite clear that as a result of the work of this single bureau. the corn crop of the sunny south has been increased almost 200.000.000 bushels in a single year. so it has come about that the southland has come to be one of the great cornproducing sections of the country. in regions where. before this work was commenced. practically no corn was raised. when this work commenced the farmers of the south were dependent almost entirely upon their single crop of cotton. they bought their meat. and their flour. and substantially everything they used. when the cotton crop failed they were completely broken financially. the object of the knapp work has been to teach them the great advantage of tile diversification of industry. and. as is well known. the work has been marvelously successful. all this time but comparatively little has been done in the north. as i undertook to show in my remarks when the agricultural appropriation bill of 1912 and the lever extension bill were pending in the house. but in recent years a great impetus has been given to the farmmanagement work. the object of this work is to study the farm as a whole. it is not merely a scientific investigation of this crop or that crop. but the idea of the work is that a man shall go from the department directly to the farmer. study the farm as a unit. find out whether the farm is paying. and. if not. why not. the experts sent out by the department help the farmer in solving his practical problems. there is no bureau in the government that is doing more for the betterment of the people than the fari management bureau. they are helping in the solution of the problem of the high cost of living. in my judgment the solution they are proposing. viz. greater and more economical production. is the only one possible. their appropriation two years ago was $1.50.000. as the result of the contest in the house and the liberality of the senate the appropriation last year was increased to $300.000. the work that is being accomplished with this money is wonderful. sixty counties in the united states already have county. menthat is to say. a man is assigned to the county. ie is given $1.200 by the department. the rest of his expenses. office rent. and so forth. are provided for by the county. in most cases the county furnishes this officer with a little runabout. so that he can reach all parts of the county readily. the idea is eventually to have a \"soil doctor.\" or agricultural doctor. so called. in every county. this officer is sort of a councilor. wlo may be consulted by any farmer at will. sixty counties already have the work fully organized and the men at their posts. 23 more counties have their arrangements all made and are awaiting the detail of the men. 250 more counties have made application for detail of men. so that it can be seen that the idea is spreading over the country like wildfire."},{"1":"1912","2":"PERCY","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. after the illuminating speech on this subject by the senator from vermont and the forceful presentation of the question by the senator from new york [mr. root]. i have no hope of adding anything of interest to the discussion. but i do desire to briefly submit the reasons which influence me in supporting the bill as framed and opposing the committee amendment which seeks to strike from that bill the literacy test. for a period of years preceding 1907 the tide of immigration into this country had grown steadily with every year. until in that year more than a million and a quarter of immigrants came to our shores. all over the country. from ocean to ocean. our people had become apprehensive over this growing flood of immigration. they wondered what it meant to the wages of the american workingman. what it meant to the perpetuity of american institutions. yet whenever there was an attempt to restrict this immigration by national legislation that attempt was met by the claim of the great employers of labor that they needed this unrestricted flood of immigration to draw on for labor to properly conduct their business and that any curtailment of it meant a check in the prosperity of our people. there were no sufficient accurate data upon which the question could be intelligently discussed and legislated in reference to. although a bill containing the literacy test has passed one or the other houses of congress nine times. such a bill passed both houses in 1.897 and was vetoed by president cleveland. in 1907 a bill containing substantially this provision passed the senate of the united states. but when it reached the other house. either for the purpose of retarding legislation restricting immigration or for the purpose of securing information so that such legislation could be more intelligently considered. the other house substituted for the literacy test a provision creating the immigration commission. the bill creating the commission provided that the commission should investigate the immigration question and report its conclusions and its recommendations as to legislation on the subject. a wor( about the composition of that commission. it was composed of nine members. three senators named by the president of the senate. three members of the house of representatives aamed by the speaker of the house. and three persons. not members of congress. selected by the president of the united states because of their familiarity with the immigration question. this commission represented every shade of opinion upon the question of immigration. some of its members favored no restrictionin immigration. some of them favored no immigration. under the power conferred upon them they first investigated conditions in those countries from which the heaviest immigration was coming. they investigated the economic conditions of the laborers there. what wages they received. what drove them to our shores. what kind of citizens they made in those countries. and what kind of citizens it might be expected they would make when they came to our country. returning to this country. the commission followed these aliens into the various pursuits in which they had embarked. to show the nature and the scope of this investigation. the commission considered more than 3.000.000 individual cases. following them into the occupations in which that number of aliens were then engaged. the result of their work is comprised in 42 volumes. containing much valuable information to the student of this subject. the commission ascertained two pregnant facts in connection with this question: one. that in the past 25 years there has been a total change in the character of the immigration coming to our country. prior to 1882. 95 per cent of the immigration came from northern europethe british isles. germany. belgium. switzerland. and scandinavia. these immigrants were holne seekers and were readily assiinilated by our people. they desired to become citizens. and they helped in the development of that great northwestern empire of ours. but within the past 15 -years more than s0 per cent of the immigration comes from southern and southeastern europe. and those immigrants are not as a rule home seekers. they are not readily assimilated by our people. they do not desire to become afmerican citizens. but each year they either ship or they carry back to the shores from which they came millions of dollars of american money. the commission found. too. that there was a greater supply of unskilled labor tian the business of our country demanded. and that this surplus supply of unskilled labor was used by the great employers of labor as a weapon with which they forced down the wages of american workingmen below a fair wage. according to our standard. and below a fair share of the profits of the business in which those men were employed. the commission. as the result of their investigation. unanimously recommended that there should be legislation substantially restricting immigration. and. with the exception of one member. mr. bennet. of new york. they unanimously recommended among the various methods of restricting immigration i the adoption of the literacy test. to strike this test from the bill rejects the conclusion reached by that commission. it emasculates the bill and leaves it nothing but a codification of existing immigration laws. it bitterly disappoints the american people. whose sole interest in the immigration legislation is that there shall be some substantial reduction in the flood of immigration. the reason given by the committee for striking out that section of the bill is that the retention of it might jeopardize the passage of the bill. i do not believe that to be the case. i think that is the most important part of the bill. and should be retained in it. there is one other consideration that influences me to reach this conclusion. there has never been a time in the history of our country when restriction in immigration would work as little injury to the business interests of our country as today. there are no great enterprises being rapidly pushed to completion requiring as an indispensable adjunct to their development an unlimited supply of cheap labor. there has never been a time in the history of our country when its political welfare has imperatively demanded a substantial reduction in immigration as today. we are living in a shifting era. the burden of government. according to the tendency of political thought. is being placed more directly upon the shoulders of the people. and whether one rejoices in that or whether one deplores it is absolutely immaterial. the fact remains. it is likewise. mr. president. immaterial whether we belong to that school of cheerful political optimists who believe that by the direct primary. the initiative. the referendum. and the recall a change is going to be wrought in the character of our people. a change more wondrous than a sea change and more miraculous than the alchemists drckim of converting common dross into pure gold. the change of the derelict citizen into the sage statesman. the change that will make the citizen. who today through indifference or ignorance fails to discharge the burdens of citizenship. discharge with intelligence and with zeal those added burdens which will be imposed upon him. or whether we belong to the school of politicians who believe that these changes unchecked portend the end of representative government. and who believe that representative government. as it has existed in the united states by virtue of what it has stood for. by virtue of what it has achieved for mankind. is deserving of commendation and perpetuation and not of repudiation and destructionto whichever school we may belong. we all must realize that we stand on the threshold of an era in which the capacity of the american people for selfgovernment will be tested as it has never heretofore been tested . and in meeting the great govermnental questions which confront them they have a right to be protected from the injection into the body politic of millions of aliens. uneducated and incapable within any limited time of becoming intelligent american citzens. they have a right to make this demand. and that is their demand today. e%-ery consideration. mr. president. seems to me to make imperative a substantial reduction in immigration. and there is no question that the literacy test is the best single means of reducing immigration. reaching. as it does. that class of inmigrants which is most undesirable. for these reasons i shall support the bill as submitted to the committee and shall oppose the committee amendment."},{"1":"1911","2":"FRANCIS","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"in order to be informed on this question of skirted wool. on may 15. 1911. 1 wrote charles r. skinner. assistant appraiser of wool in the appraisers warehouse. new york city. asking him about this character of wool and as to the meaning of skirted wool as received at that port. and received from him the following reply: dear sir: i have yours of the 15th instant. making inquiry as to the meaning of skirted wool under the present tariff. in reply i inclose a drawing of a skirted wool. with explanations. these wools do not come freethey are very generally classed as wool. class 1. unwashed. duty 11 cents per pound. the duty of 11 cents applies to all parts of the skirted skin. very truly. charles r. skinner. our imports show that almost all of this wool comes in at 11 cents a pound in the grease. which will not shrink over 25 to 30 per cent. or washed at 12 cents per pound. which shrinks less. the foregoing illustration shows -that by hoodwinking the american people in this way wool hagbeen imported under this specific duty and favored schedule at a very low rate. it is shown also by the imports that the other large importations of wool are brought in as wool known as no. 3 at the very low rate of 3 and 4 cents duty per pound. these wools are used principally in the manufacturing of carpets. but they also compete to a great extent with our domestic clips. where used in our worsted mills for the coarser clothing. i again wrote mr. skinner on may 18. 1911. and on may 19 i received the following reply: dear sir: under paragraph 369 wools of the second class. whether wshed or unwashed. being of the english blood. are returned for duty at 12 cents per pound. wools of the english blood. as a rule. come to this port washed.very truly. yours. chailes r. skinner. so that it is very apparent that this is the kind of wool which has been largely imported into our country. and the bill under consideration totally puts to rout this shameful discrimination. being framed on an ad valorem basis. in 1910 there was imported into this country in all $47.6s7.293 worth of raw wool. of this amount there was imported ofclass 1. at a duty of 11 cents per pound. 107.996.167 pounds. valucd at ---------------------------------- $25. 147. 142 class 2. at a duty of 12 cents per pound. 26.687.672 pounds. valued at ---------------------------------- 6. 824. 079 class 3. at a duty of 3 and 4 cents per pound. 84.692.274 pounds. valued at -----------------------------------9. 309.s23 total ---------------------------------------- 41. 280. 744 now. it is seen that nearly all of our importations of wool are brought into the country at 11 and 12 cents under this favored skirting clause. but. in fact. they come in at no greater rate of duty than the carpet woolsthat is. 3 and 4 cents per poundwhen compared with our domestic wools. now. let us take the history of schedule k. when this skirting clause was written into it in 1867. and mark the effect on the wool market. in 1866 wool was 70 cents. in 186s. imediately after. it dropped to 46 cents per pound. on a gold basis in 1866. z0 cents per pound. down to 34 cents per pound in 186s. so it is very apparent that this was the thing that caused the slump in wool prices at that time. but our manufacturers and sheep raisers had adjusted their business to this schedule until the wilson freewool schedule of 1894 was enacted. when it is seen that wool in 1893 ranged in price from 29 to 33 cents per pound. but in 1895 fell. and ranged in price from 161 to 20 cents per pound. will anyone contend for a moment that this did not cause disaster to our business interests? if the members of this house have forgotten the effect of this wool schedule upon the country. it will be well to refer to some statistics to refresh their memories. immediately before the adoption of the wilson bill there were 47.000.000 sheep in the united states. valued at $2.66 per head. immediately after. in the year 185. the average price of our sheep was $1.5s. not quite the price of a goodsized shanghai chicken today. and in 1896 our sheep numbered 36.800.000. and had fallen off in two years 10.000.000 in number. they had gone to the slaughterhouse. and the business of the sheep raiser was ruined. let us now see the effect on importation of wool under the tariff of 18941. in that year there was imported 55.000.000 pounds of wool. this low amount might have been phrtly on account of the anticipation of a freewool schedule. but in the year 1895 there was imported 200.000.000 pounds. and in the year 1s97 it had increased to the enormous sum of 350.000.000 pounds. and during the same period the imports of manufactured goods. in 1894. was $19.500.000. while in :1896 the importation had increased to $53.500.000. both of which causes entirely crushed our woolgrowing industry in this country. the importation of 350.000.000 pounds of raw wool into the country in 1897 was more wool than was raised in the united states in that year. in the year 1910 our entire product was 321.000.000 pounds. and there was imported by way of manufactured cloth as much. if not more. than that of raw wool. so that it will be seen that under the wilson bill there came into this country twice as much wool in a single year as was raised in the united states in the year 1910. this proposed bill embodies a lower duty than did the wilson bill. which let wool come in free and made goods dutiable at 50 per cent. this bill makes wool dutiable at 20 per cent and cloth at 40 per cent. when you deduct the ad valorem from the cloth required to compensate for a 20 per cent duty upon wool. which the foreign manufacturer has free. which would be 12 to 13 per cent. it brings the net duty on a freewool basis to 27 to 28*per cent. or just a little over half of the wilson bill. and is a price against which our industries can not compete. in canada they have free wool. but the duty on manufactured articles against great britain is 30 per cent and 35 per cent against other countries. half of the woolen machinery that was operated in canada 10 years ago is now idle. considerable of the machinery has been broken up and made into scrap. and not over half of the remaining mills are in operation. they have a lower operating expense than we have and skilled workmen. and it is fair to conclude that if this bill goes into effect this great dual industry of wool manufacturing and wool producing will be crushed. as it was in 1s94. a great deal is said about the price at which an english tailormade. allwool suit of clothes can be obtained in great britain as compared with the same suit and material in this country. great stress is put upon the fact of the wide difference in prices. in support of the claim that the whole trouble is in the tariff duties between the two countries. when in truth and in fact that enters very little into the matter. and almost the entire difference is in the price of labor bestowed upon the making of the goods in america as compared with the cheap labor of europe. take. for instance. an englishmade suit of clothes. the prices entering into such a suit are as follows: cloth. 3j yards ---------------------------------- $2. 50 labor for making a sack coat ------------------------- 1.75 labor for making a vest -------------------------------------.50 labor for making trousers ---------------------------------.37 trimmings necessary for the suit. complete ------------------- 1. 25 labor for cutting --------------------------------------------.50 total. for making the suit complete and furnishing all materials ----------------------------------------- 6. 87 this suit will sell in england for $15. we will now take an american suit of american goods of the same class: 3s yards of cloth ------------------------------------------ $8. 50 labor for making sack coat ------------------------------. -8.25 labor for making trousers ----------------------------------- 2. 50 labor for making vest --------------------------------------2. 00 good average trimmings. complete ---------------------------- 4.00 labor for cutting -------------------------------------------2. 00 total. for suit complete ------------------------------ 27. 25 this suit will be sold by the american merchant tailor at $40. i simply draw this parallel. having obtained it from one who has worked just recently in both countries and is able to give the figures. so as to show that the great discrepancy in these prices is caused by the difference of labor in the two countries. and this will hold good as to the importation of foreign readymade goods\" when brought in competition with our readymade goods. it will be noticed that the english cloth in this computation costs $2.50 as against the americanmade cloth at $8.50. this is due to two reasons: first. our trust methods in inflating and putting up the price to the american consumer. as i have already shown. but the principal difference is caused by reason of the comparative cost of labor in this country and in england. this bears the same relation to the manufacture of the cloth as it does to the making of the two suits of clothes. as demonstrated in the foregoing illustration. a great many persons are laboring under the impression that the high cost of a suit of clothes in this country is directly enhanced by the high tariff on raw wool that is imported into this country to be used in our factories. when you analyze this proposition it is plain to anyone that the duty on this raw washed wool at 12 cents per poundthere being about 3 pounds of wool in an allwool suit of clothes and which is scarcely found among the american makes upon the shelves of our merchant tailorsthat this duty of 12 cents a pound on the wool would not make. in the aggregate. to exceed 50 or 60 cents added to that suit of clothes. but under schedule k the woolen imports of cloth were placed at a prohibitive rate. and from this it can plainly be seen that the american wool trust has had the grand opportunity of making prices to suit itself to fleece the people. it is plain to be seen that under schedule k of the paynealdrich bill it has been so framed that it produces very little revenue on the importation of wool. and. being prohibitive of the importation of manufactured woolen cloth. that there is very little revenue derived from that source. hence. the american woolen trust has the matter of fixing prices in its own hands. now. if this tariff would have the effect to drive our sheep to the shambles. then it should not be enacted. or if its operations will be such as to close down our woolen and worsted mills. again i say it should not be enacted. it places a duty of 20 per cent ad valorem on raw wool. nell. top. waste. and so forth. and of course this dispenses with the necessity of classifying the different kinds of wool as nos. 1. 2. and 3. on combed wool. tops. roving or roping. and so forth. 25 per cent ad valorem. on yarns. and so forth. 30 per cent ad valorem. on manufactured woolens an average of about 421 per cent ad valorem. ranging from 25 per cent to 50 per cent ad valorem. making the principal articles which are shipped into our ports at about 40 per cent ad valoreni. our ways and means committee have made comparisons for the purpose of this bill with the wilsongorman bill. the springer bill of 1892. and the mills bill of 1888. these last two bills never became law. but were simply the production of a committee. and why they or either of them should be given any consideration in framing the present bill i am at great loss to know. the practical workings of neither of said proposed bills were ever tested. either in the interest of the people or as revenue producers. there is. in fact. nothing to be gained from a comparison with them. except it be to demonstrate two democratic failures along freetrade lines. which culminated finally in the free trade wilson bill. which accomplished the ruin that the other two bills would have done had they become laws. the advocates of this bill claim it is a revenue producer. and they demonstrate how it shall be obtained by showing how its operations will flood our country by both foreignmade goods and foreigngrown wools. there is no industry which so nearly concerns all the people of the united states as the woolen industry. it affects every state in the union in the production of wool and mutton. every wearer of woolen goods. every one of the vast number employed in the 1.213 great woolen plants of our country. which turn out an annual product of manufactured woolens of $381.000.000. this great woolgrowing industry surprises us when we consider that there are 58.000.000 sheep in the united states. representing a valuation of $235.000.000. permeating every state in this union. and every state of the union has over 100.000 sheep. excepting eight states. sheep and woo[-number and farm. value of sheep on farms in the united

211.736.000 192.632.000 233.664.000 you will notice the falling off in the number. value per head. and farm value of sheep immnediately after this skirting clause. which i have explained was enacted in 1807. and also notice the same falling off under the freewool wilson bill in 1894. our last census has alarmed the government at the exodus of our population from the farms to city life. until it has become the cry of the nation. \"back to the farm! \" but the farmer who raises hay. corn. oats. potatoes. and wheat has extracted from these farms their vitalityuntil they will respond no more. he has taken everything from the soil without replenishing its fertility. and hence they are abandoning them. let the farmer go back to the farm with his sheep. which enriches the land as they develop and grow. let the order of husbandry be reversed and the lands be rejuvenated by the rearing of sheep. and this national alarm will be dispelled. now. can our american woolgrowers compete with foreign wool under these schedules? can the manufacturers of woolen goods compete with foreign importers under these schedules? these are the two great questions to be solved. and these are the questions which a million american producers and workmen are waiting to hear answered in the affirmative. our ways and means committee evidently either has been misinformed as to the number of sheep in the united states or has made a miscalculation. the number given in its table represents the number of sheep of shearing age. and makes no account of lambs and mutton sheep which are marketed each year. the true number and value in january. 1910. is just what i have quoted. but according to the unpublished reports this number has increased in the last year about 10 per cent. and our sheep today will number close to 65.000.000 head. the number and kinds of sheep in the five counties comprising the sixteenth district of ohio. as taken from the latest figures obtainable. is as follows: number of sheep on forms april 15. 1910five counties. county. total lambs. ewes. ramhs and belmont ........................... 93.987 11.340 45.870 36.777 carroll ............................. 73.940 7.216 37.

total ......................... 1 398. 345 1 49.645 193.370 154.84 i have not the time to take up item by item in this bill. while i heartily agree that our committee has placed the schedule on an ad valorem duty as the only proper way to collect this revenue. but i am morally certain that this tariff is not sufficiently high to produce the required revenue on either the manufactured goods or on the raw wool and at the same time to do justice to our industries and producers. under section 3 of the proposed act the committeehas compiled a statement showing the amount of combed wool or tops. roving. etc.. manufactured. etc.. at a duty which shall be 25 per cent. and what was imported and the duty thereon for the last year. and showing that they estimate that there will be about 700 times as much imported under section 3 of this act as was imported under the paynealdrich act. and that the revenue will be increased about 150 times as much. this does not sound good to those who are interested in the production of wool and woolens in this country. this boldly asserts that this vast sum represents just so much foreign labor. withdrawn from and taken away from american industries. their summary proposes to receive annually under this bill about $20.000.000 worth of wool more than under the former act. but the worst feature of the whole matter is that this bill proposes to let in to our ports forty and a half million dollars more annually of woolens than did the former act. that by reason of this low tariff. almost to a freetrade basis. they propose to flood our country with wool and woolens.. this was demonstrated under the walker tariff law of 1846. i read from the american tariff controversies in the nineteenth century. volume 2. page 92: it is not too much to say that the new tariff practically ruined the woolen industry which had revived and become fairly flourishing under the protection it received under the act of 1842. the ambitious manufacturers of that time began the production of fine broadcloths. which in quality equaled any that were made in the world. but the act of 1846 put an end to the industry. when that tariff went into operation there were 1.800 looms. chiefly in new england. weaving broadcloth. within a few years every one of them had stopped or had been diverted to the production of an inferior grade of goods. the blanket manufacture also was destroyed. the rate of duty on the coarse wool used in making blankets. which was imported and not produced in the country. was 30 per cent. but the duty on blankets was only 20 per cent. the law therefore operated as a prohibition upon the manufacture. \"the only branches of wool manufacture which continued with any great activity were those which. like flannels. were supplied by the common wool of the country. so superior in its spinning qualities as in itself to afford an advantage over the foreign manufacture. there was no longer a demand for any but the common wools. and the saxony wool industry. which had recently made great progress among the new england farmers. disappeared with the manufacture of fine cloths. which had brought it into existence.\" all writers agree that the period was one of extreme depression. of disappointment. and disaster. the im ortations of foreign fabrics of wool increased greatly as the domestic indtry declined. the value of woolen manufactures imported in 1846 was $10.000.000. in 1855 it was $22.000.000. i read again from the same work. at page 308. as to the operation of the wilson bill. this is evidently compiled with some care and may have a little coloring from a republican pen. but the facts and statistics remain unchanged. inasmuch as the great feature of the then existing tariff was free wool he made much of the disastrous result of the experiment. the importation of wool in 1896 was three times as much as in 1893. and the quantity of woolen manufactures imported was twice as great. yet the revenue from the articles named in the wool schedule was diminished almost onehalfthe receipts having been only $23.000.000. a loss of $21.000.000. \" in other words.\" he said. \"by placing wool on the free list and reducing the duties on the manufactures of wool the treasury lost $21.000.000 of revenue. our farmers lost a market for the 80.000.000 pounds of wool which they raised in 1892 in excess of what they raised in 189798. as well as nearly 10 cents a pound in price. involving a loss to them of nearly $30.000.000 per annum on this one farm product. and our manufacturers and their workingmen lost a market not only for the goods which foreign imports had supplanted. but also a market for the goods which the farmers and masses of the people were able to purchase in 1893. but which they could not buy in 1896 ecause of a loss of employment and purchasing power.\" at the same time. he remarked. it had been demonstrated that free wool did not effect an increase of an exportation of woolen manufactures. but that it had been followed by an increase in the importation of shoddy. not to discuss the question whether all the evils mentioned were a direct consequence of the wool and woolen schedule in the act of 1894. it seems to be beyond question that some of them were. at all events. it is a fact that during the continuance of that act both wool growing and wool manufacturing suffered more severely than did most industries from the depression of the time."},{"1":"1910","2":"ADAMSON","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. i never knew francis w. cushman until he was elected to congress in 1898. he sprang suddenly into fame. a national character. distinguished as the man who defeated james hamilton lewis. lewis was a great deal more conspicuous than the democracy of the state of washington. and as for that matter. more conspicuous than the democracy of some other states. the public was ready to believe that the man who could defeat james hamilton lewis after his brilliant career of one term in congress could do anything. and fran is w. cushman. by his performances. wellnigh made good that expression of confidence. he served several terms on the great committee on interstate and foreign commerce. and during my service with him on that committee i enjoyed an opportunity to estimate his character and capacity. prolonged acquaintance only increased my admiration for his wonderful gifts. while he was a man of unbounded humor. his wit was not of the vitriolic kind. which left wounds and bitterness. but of that milder. kinder type. which all could enjoy. and which pleased even its victims. neither did his wit and humor doom him to the common fate of humorists. generally men who indulge in wit and jokes lose their influence with their fellowmen. are never expected to be serious. and if they make a sensible speech or do a sensible thing. receive no credit for it. but. on the other hand. usually suffer from actual resentment for disappointing the expectation of a joke. when frank cusiiman told a joke it always pointed a moral and most admirably adorned a tale. there was a good reason for every joke. and a good reason in every one he used. and every one was effective. they did not even appear to be chestnuts. if they were old. they were so well timed and so well applied that they appeared fresh and new. he was one of the most effective and telling speakers in the house. could always command attention. and always illumined the subject under discussion. his industry was indefatigable. he could do as much work as any man i ever saw and it did not require as much exertion for him to do things as it would require in a duller and more plodding individual to accomplish the same results. there is such a thing as what people call a knack for turning out words . something like the person described in scripture which declares that \"whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.\" his efforts seemed to be so well directed that with little difficulty he accomplished what other men toiled long and arduously to do. his mind was quick and comprehensive. his insight into important matters penetrating. his grasp upon measures was far reaching. and his judgment of men was unerring. therefore almost unvarying success in his undertakings was easy. little wonder then that as a result of his labors in congress improvements material and lasting sprang up spontaneously. as if by magic. all over the part of our country represented by him. the impress of his genius and industry is not only left upon matters and interests in our country. but the results of his laborz are manifest in alaska and our island possessions. it was a sad dispensation of providence that one so strong. so young. so brilliant. so well equipped for usefulness. and so full of promise to his jamily. his friends. and his country should be cut off in the flower of his young manhood without possibility of transferring to others the experience and wisdom which by toil and study he had acquired. but he has not lived in vain. his works verily do follow him. his example stands as a model and incentive to young america to emulate his virtues. to strive to acquire and cultivate his good qualities. and live. as he did. for the good of his country and leave their impress upon the institutions of our land. the most lovely and interesting feature of his life is presented by his domestic relations. there are others better prepared from long acquaintance to speak of them than i am. but it was my good fortune to enjoy some acquaintance with his good wife and mother. and it was an inspiration to me to observe their affection for him and their pride in his .success. after knowing them i do not wonder that in the light of their smiles. fostered by their encouragement. he should have become a good and a great man. good women not only have pride. but they love and enjoy their pride. they are happy in their pride when aroused by worthy objects. they. the best and noblest creatures beneath the stars. have a right to expect and demand that the man they love and trust shall excel other men. the most miserable creature on earth is a woman. chained by malign fortune to a vagabond. a known failure. a recognized wreckof manhood. e converso. the happiest creature beneath the sun. is the fond wife or mother swelling with pride in the conscious joy that her husband or son excels other men in those attributes which make men conspicuous among their fellows. francis w. cushman realized the truth of that scripture which says. \"whoso findeth a good wife findeth a good thing.\" verily she was a joy unto her husband. and her pride and satisfaction in contemplating his nobility was the crowning glory of his life. what is to be said of his superb mother contributing to his greatness and the reward which he conferred upon her in the noble life that lie led? there was a pagan mother who was the daughter of the great general germanicus. she thought she was proud in being the sister of an emperor. she afterwards imagined she was happy. in being the wife of another emperor. but she never felt the full flood tide of unbounded satisfaction until her pride was gratified by seeing her son ascend the throne as an emperor. we read of a good woman spoken of by solon in his celebrated dialogue with crmsus. no other means of transportation being available her two sons yoked themselves to her chariot and drew her to the temple. they were glorified in life. deified in death. and she. proud and happy as the mother of such glorious sons. has been celebrated through the ages as the exalted object of their reverence and devotion. but there was another great woman whose example is more to the point. she was the daughter of a great general. who. after many others had failed in leading the armies of rome. had conquered the greatest military genius the world had produced up to that time and destroyed his city and empire. she was the widow of a great man. renowned throughout the earth. twice consul and honored with two triumphs. she had carefully nurtured twelve children. her watchword to stimulate them to noble deeds was this: my children. must i be always known merely as the daughter of scipio afrlcanus? why should i rather not be known to an admiring world as the mother of the gracchi? she realized her wish. she saw all of her twelve children buried. she saw two of the twelve. the celebrated two gracchi. blaze into splendor and bless their country with their greatness and usefulness. and when all were dead and when mourning the loss of her children her friends commiserated her supposed unhappiness. she protested: / call me not unfortunate. i shall never cease to think myself a happy woman who have been the mother of the gracchi. weeping. devoted widow. bereaved. queenly mother. wipe away your tears. you have more of glory than of sorrow in your cup of life. you have lost. one a husband and the other a son. but you enjoyed for a long time the consolation and society of a husband and a son unexcelled in manly courage. manly virtue. gentlemanly courtesy. and widespread usefulness among the sons of men. like saul he towered physically above the heads of his comrades. but mentally and morally he was equally conspicuous. rejoice that providence spared him to you so long and blessed you and your country with his illustrious life."},{"1":"1909","2":"GALLINGER","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. if the senator from west virginia will permit me. i have some knowledge on this subject. americans are

waste as is contemplated by this plan. to lay forever waste that beautiful valley. in order that the water may be carried out of it for irrigation of a distant valley. let me tell you what they did last year. now that we are on this very important subject. the government of the united states has something like 150.000 or 200.000 acres of agricultural land in that valley. the reclamation 2ervice has made two reports upon irrigation projects. in the first one there was a very elaborate report upon the condition of the soil and the opportunities for irrigation. which stated that there were about 80.000 acres of firstclass land and about 70.000 acres of secondclass ]and. it being secondclass in the sense that it would require a little more effort to level the surface. the government of the united states had the first appropriation on the waters of that stream taken up by mr. lippincott in the interest of and in the name of the united states that it might use it for the reclamation and fertilization of that valley. two plans were examined for a project. one was estinated to cost $20 per acre. including a large reservoir that would impound the winter floods. the other was estimated to cost from $5 to $6 an acre. i say there has not been another such favorable project for irrigation proposed anywhere in tie united states. and the records of the reclamation service will

better and cheaper here than anywhere else. germany has not in any proper sense a protective tariff at all. except upon the products of her artisans on certain special articles of her industries. now. mr. chairman. i have but a few moments left me. a good deal of my time has been taken up in that which has amounted to a deflection from the line i had chosen to speak upon. i challenge democrats on this floor not to go abroad for suggestions that they can not prove and .hurl them across this house without anything to back them up. we are not legislating for germany or for england. take our own country and tell me why it is that whenever the democratic party is in power the balance of trade runs against us and the gold flees from us. if you want to account for this. let me ask you another question. you say that the gold that was discovered in the klondike and in south africa came and flooded this country. answer me another question. do not get up and answer it now. answer it when you have thought. because it is a troublesome one. how much of the gold. now amounting to over $1.000.000.000. or whatever it is. how much of it do you believe. my democratic friends. would you have had if you had had the administration. of this country during the past ten years? how much of the gold of california stayed here? i have shown you how much. i have shown you $750.000.000 of it fled. what was that thing that drove that gold out of the united states. that would not have driven the gold that has accumulated during the past ten years out of this country? you would have made the silver dollar the standard of this country how can you say that there would have been a dollar of money in circulation of this money that was worth two of your silver dollars? how much more would there be in circulation in this country than the amount today circtlating in mexico? some little gold is going into mexico because of the change of system of mexico very recently made. would not the gold of this country have fled as the gold of china has fled. until within the last few months there was not a gold dollar. nor a gold pound. nor a gold sovereign. or anything else gold circulating in the chinese empire? why not? because there was a standard of money that was far below the standard gold dollar in value. the answer to it all is met in the fact the balance of trade is not in our favor in this country when you have a low tariff. i have only a few minutes. perhaps. to speak. let us see how it has operated. between 1848 and 1860. inclusive. the production of gold in the united states amounted to $651.000.000. and of this $651.000.000. $650.000.000 was from california. as to the amount of gold in the united states in 1848. to which was added $651.000.000. there are no satisfactory or reliable statistics. but it is enough for my purpose to say that in 1873. when reliable statis-. tics appear. we had about $135.000.000. all told. of gold in the united states. all the rest had been driven away by the proc. ess which i have already stated. it appears that on the 1st of july. 1860. there was $235.1000.000 of all kinds of specie money. this included the money in the treasury and the money in circulation. but no one can tell what the proportion of gold was. so it is probably a fair statement to say that. as i have already stated. on the 1st of july. 1860. the supply of money. which ought to have been $950.000.000. had fallen to $200.000.000. the treasury statement for june 1. 1906. shows that the gold in the united states. including in this term gold coin in circulation and coin and bullion in the treasury. amounted to $1.466.921.374. and the general stock of money in the united states of all kinds as $3.057.901.107. now. let us take the gold prockction of the world from 1888 to 1904. and let ussee how much there is to bolster up the waning fortunes of democratic politicians upon this topic: 1888 -------------------------------------------- $110. 196. 900 1889

-------------------------------------------- 346. 892. 200 thus it will be seen that the increase was not in such a rapid ratio would justify the claim that the production of gold revolutionized the business conditions of the united states. all. the gold of california could not prevent or halt the awful conditions of 1857. the rapidity of their oncoming was lessened. but the storm swept over us and left wrecks of business never to be repaired and swept away private fortunes never to be replaced. to again advert to this matter of balance of trade. how is it maintained. how is this vast sum of gold retained in the treasury? that is a most important factor and one well worthy of our most careful consideration. divide the population of this country into three great classesfirst. the farmer. second. the manufacturer. and third. the laborer. for the purposes of my argument this division is sufficient. and covers substantially the whole population. who eats the production of the american farmer? you may say the farmer himself and his family and laborers. that is true. but who eats the surplus. who buys it? men who do not produce the article. who are they? all the people who are not working on the farm. and in the exact ratio of their purchasing activity is the prosperity of the farmer. the farmer can live--that is. he will not starveif nobody comes near to buy his surplus. but he must have a market for his surplus or he can not improve his farm. be can not educate his children. and he can not keep up with the march ofdevelopment of his own country. so he must look to the nonproducer to be the buyer. and that nonproducer is the laborer. the capitalist. and the manufacturer. in order that these nonproducing people can have money to buy the product of the farmer. they must have employment. and they get it by the employment of labor in manufacturing industries. where does the manufacturer get his money to pay the laborer who works for him? all i have said about the farmer applies to the manufacturer. he must have money and he must get it from the men who do not manufacture like articles with himself. and it follows if the money of the american consumer of manufactured articles is sent to europe and invested in the products of european labor. there will be by that amount so much less money in the united states to be expended for manufactured articles and farm products. so the money that is sent abroad lessens the amount of money expended in this country. and by that same process the wageearners are cut down to that extent. and every dollar of foreign trade balances being adjusted and paid in gold. it follows necessarily that the gold of the country is drained to the foreign market. while the production of labor gluts our own market here and hard times ensue. there is no difficulty to work this problem out. it is as easy and as safe and as certain as any problem in mathematics can be. every time you reduce the grand aggregate of money paid out in this country for labor and products and send it abroad you lessen the amount of gold in the united statesgold. which is the underlying basis of our trade operations. is lessened in quantity and sent abroad to pay the balance of trade against us. avd in that way you will soon work out the problem that i havw stated as fundamental. that you can not have a low tariff. a tariff for revenue only. and maintain the gold standard in this country. that might as well be abandoned one time as another. it has operated exactly in proof of my assumption from the foundation of the government. and it will go on as long as inevitable figures operate as a demonstration. i add a most valuable article which was published in 1904 in the philadelphia north american: [north american.

be proper \"for birds and bats to hunt their holes while eagles are in the air.\" mr. chairman. the people of the cotton belt are confronted with a most serious problem. within the past ninety days the price of their only great staple has declined to such an extent that they are threatened with bankruptcy. and how to extricate themselves from the impending thralldom is a question being discussed in every home. on every exchange. and in every business mart of that fair section. the anxious. patriotic people of every avocationthe -lawyer. the merchant. the banker. and the hardpressed farmerhave met in common council to deliberate upon the almost insolvable problem. i when the great convention that met at new orleans a few days ago solemnly declared in favor of curtailing the cotton acreage 25 per cent in order that all classes dependent upon the farmer might prosper. it expressed a sentiment of condemnation of the dominant policy of this government that should sink deep into and long linger about the heart of every protectionist in this house. there are many who believe that the threatened condition of the south is but theculmination of the evils following in .the wake of the protective policy. not only do they believe that this pet policy of the republican party has enslaved the agricultural masses of the south to the trusts. forcing them to pay from 20 to 40 per cent more than they should for the necessaries of life. but they also believe that it has isolated them by a veritable chinese wall from the naked and hungry millions of other countries. who are begging for their product now rotting in the fields. to rob the weak in order to enrich the strong is. indeed. indefensible in any government. but there are still greater wrongs. a government that boasts of the most magnificent civilization that the world has ever known. that is contented to \"stand pat\" by a policy that threatens to dwarf the energies of onefourth of its citizens by compelling them to labor not to the full measure of their capacity. to consign onefourth of their fertile acres to the growth of thistles and weeds. to force them to discharge onefourth of their laborers who daily eat bread in the sweat of their faces. and to reduce to a state of miserable poverty 6.000.000 of that simple race whose god never inspired them with a capacity above toiling in the sunny cotton fieldthis i declare. mr. chairman. to be a deeper wrong than robbery. for idleness and penury sap every virtue from racial and national manhood. much could be done by wise statesmanship toward the expansion of the american cotton market. there are in china. south america. and oceania nearly 700.000.000 people. who are anxiously awaiting an opportunity to consume our great surplus. and were our statesmen liberal enough to negotiate reciprocal treaties removing all tariff obstructions between these people and our cotton fields. never again would we hear of overproduction. and. too. this condition could be greatly improved if our statesmen were to go one step further and grant every american citizen desiring to send his products to these faraway people the right to hoist the american flag over his ship. purchased in any quarter of the globe for this purpose. how could such a concession as this. fraught with so much good to the southern people. injure any legitimate american industry? it could not possibly hurt any of the pet industries of the republican party. the steel trust. the harvester trust. tin trust. or any other trust. could not possibly encounter any opposition among these semisavage people. who still use the most antiquated industrial implements known to man. if no harm can come from such a concession. why has this government not made an effort to secure this wonderful market for the greatest industry of the country? loyalty to his government is the duty of every citizen. but it is likewise the duty of the government to guarantee to each and every citizen an equal chance with his fellows in the pursuit of happinessto grant him the right to labor to the full measure of his mental and physical capacity. and to assure him as far as possible a compensating reward for such labor. but is this the reward of the cotton producer of the south? or can it be true under the dominant policy of the government which isolates him from the markets of the world and compels him to forego the culture of his fair fields in order that he may not be ruined by a flood of overproduction? i dare say there is not a member of this house who does not know that any policy that closes any market to the cotton grower impairs his wellbeing and progress. unlike any other american industry. twothirds of the cotton crop. if sold at all. must be to foreigners. and hence. above all things. he needs an unfettered market with all the world. his right to thrive is dependent on his privilege to displace the fig leaf in all the ends of the earth by the cotton shirt. in 1903 the south produced 10.674.000 bales of cotton. of which only 3.924.000 bales were consumed at home. the balance. 6.751.000 bales. hadto find a foreign market. or. in other words. we consumed 37 per cent and exported 63 per cent. on the other hand. in 1903 we produced more than 2.000.000.000 bushels of corn. but exported only 3.04 per cent. in the same year we produced 670.000.000 bushels of wheat. and only exported 30 per cent thereof. the same is true with all of the industrial manufactures of this country. so then. in the light of these facts. we must conclude that all this boastful assumption about protection building up a home market for the agriculturist falls flat upon the ear of the cotton producer. who well knows that he is far more deeply interested in a foreign market than in the congested market at home. conditions over which he has no control have fixed his industrial status and have marked him as a certain victim of protection. for the want of a market i have seen the fruits of his toil rot in the field. his children reared in poverty. his home plastered with mortgages. and his once manly pride crushed under the burden of impending hardships. though as patriotic as any citizen. though his courage has inspired every field of american valor. though the blood of his blood nerved our heroes at- san juan. santiago. and faraway manila. yet not one effectual plea for the betterment of his industrial condition has been heard by the powers that be. in response to his appeals the shylocks of protection have cried out: lay on. macduff. and damnd be him that first

section of ohio. i will not again inflict the letter upon the house. he said. in concluding this letter: if you do not do something soon there will be soup houses in this valley. this was addressed to the \"creator and preserver of prosperity \"-the leader of the republican party in ohioand was prompted undoubtedly by a speech delivered by senator hanna at piqua. ohio. on october 13. 1903. in which he said: i want to go on record on this proposition. if by your votes next month you serve notice upon the country that you favor casting aside the safe business principles that have brought the present prosperous conditions. by and by. and it will not be very long. you will be eating at the soup houses again. i now wish to call the attention of the house to the fact that although but four weeks have elapsed. yet. according to the cincinnati timesstar (owned in part. as i am informed. by governor taft. the new secretary of war) of january 5. soup houses have already been established in that citythe second largest dity in ohio. that the situation among the unemployed in cincinnati is heartrending is evidenced in the headlines which the timesstar uses. that paper used billboard type across the whole width of the page to announce the fact. it says: hundreds on the river front drivenby the pangs of hunger to steal bread and meat by wholesale to save their livestestimony heartrending to the last word wits given by a veteran police officer in court in pleading for the men he had been compelled to arrest. and the judge and prosecutor alike were moved to pity. we were told upon this floor only a few weeks ago that there is labor in every part of this country for every man who wants a place to work. and there is a compensating wage for everyone who is willing to perform a days labor. and yet. according to the cincinnati timesstar. which has been copied into many of the papers of the country. the judge of the police court there allows criminals to escape because they are starving. and he will not sentence them for stealing bread. as though this were not distressing enough. the timesstar two days later printed on its front page four pictures of what they describe as\" pitiful scenes among the destitute.\" these pictures are labeled: \"interior of the silver moon.\" \"at the mullen soup house.\" \"at the hammond street station.\" \"one of the worst cases.\" it then says: the old cry for \"bread\" that has been heard in many places. but rarely in cincinnati umtil this present winter. is no iongor sounding out in its weird and distressing pathos along the river front. there was bread enough and some to spare on wednesday after several hundred applicants had been relieved. and the work of distribution was continued on thursday under conditions that made the casehardened police officers turn their heads away. the applicants were confined to no particular class or kind there were women and children. strong men and weak men. and the story they nearly all told was monotonous in its dire want. mark what the timesstar says: the applicants were confined to no particular class. we may rest assured. though. that one class was not represented among these applicants for breadthe monopolistic class. occasionally the police officers asked the applicants why they did not save up so as to have something for a rainy day. and in nearly every instance they got a reply that left them speechless for want of further logical argument. the average colored roustabout can earn about $5.50 a week by working hard. with the present

questioi. is this the prosperity that exists in the state of ohio. and city of cincinnati? the report goes on to state that one of the leading politicians of cincinnati. michael mullen. a councilman. one of the supporters of george b. cox. upon whom the latter relies to see that the requisite number of votes are \"found\" in his ward. whether they are there or not. has opened a soup house. just think. in the republican city of cincinnati. a councilman. because of stress of conditions. feels compelled to open a soup house. the demsocratic candidate was not elected governor of ohio last year. mores the pity. we were told before the election that if the republicans were successful prosperity would continue. but soup houses would be our portion if democrats were victoriousif that great democrat. tom l. johnson. was elected governor of that state. one report says: councilman michael mullen. of the eighth ward wednesday morning established a free soup houseat 435 eastfrotstreet. t was instantly crowded by povertystricken people with bnskets. brokenspout coffee pots. bottles. and tin cans to carry away solid provisions. soup. and coffee. prosperity! prosperity where men will come with broken soup bowls and broken coffee pots to get a little food because they are starving! and what does the judge say? a man was arrested for stealing a loaf of bread. the policeman who had arrested this man was called. and. in addressing the judge. said. according to the timesstar: judge. there re rnearly 200 people down there who are starving. starving in the great city of cincinnati. where prosperity should exist if anywhere in this countryl this is a republican official. because everyone knows there is not a democratic official in that whole city of cincinnati. unless he is a personal henchman of george b. cox and therefore more dangerous to real democracy than if he were a republican. this official says: this man jones is a workingman and not a thief. he was going to share what he stole with the others. he was going to share this loaf of bread. which prosperity compelled him to steal. with others who were also ready to steal food in order to keep their bodies and souls together. the policeman says: we must arrest these people. a loin of pork was stolen monday morning and the grocer told us not to look for it. \"lord knows they need it.\"he told us. this in spite of this boasted universal prosperityl what is the judges reply to this policemans plea for mercy? the stealing of bread under such circumstances is no offensesaid the judge. charles stevens. a

every morning at 1 or 2 oclock policemen on their heats find the men picking potatopeelings out of ash barrels. why. gentlemen. even i would not hesitate to fracture one of the ten commandments if placed in this position. remember this is taking place in ohio. in that state which the specialprivilege corporations flooded with money with which to defeat a democratic democrat. tom l. johnson. the voters of ohio were assured by the leader of the republican party there that prosperity would continue if they would but bury johnson politically. but somehow tom l. johnson does not scem to know when he is defeated. like banquos ghost. he will not down. for i read in todays johnstown democrat that \"tom l. wins battle for lower fares.\" it says: the cleveland city council has passed the following ordinances making the rate of fare within the city limits on the cleveland electric railway companys lines 3 cents. beyond the city line the fare is to be 5 cents. the 3cent fare does not include a transfer. 5 cents does. granting the woodland avenue and central avenue franchises to the forest city street railway company. a 3cent line. these franchises. according to the city authorities. expire in september and march. 1904 and 1905. the cleveland electric railway company controls the citys car lines now in o eration. it is expected that the cfeveland electric railway company will test the legality of tonights ordinances before they can be put into effect. of course the cleveland electric railway company will fight. who ever heard of a monopolistic corporation submitting to the will of the people from whom it obtains its monopolistic privileges? certainly the gentleman who is the largest stockholder. the dominating force of the cleveland electric railway company. the senior senator from the state of ohio. is not going to submit to this \"outrage.\" he has publicly declared that \"his business is his politics.\" if this means anything. it means that he is in politics to advance his business interests. and how successful he has been anyone who has watched ohio politics and national politics during the past eight years must know. perhaps as clear an illustration of his methods and of his entire success in making \"his business his politics\" was shown when. upon tom l. johnson being elected mayor of the city of cleveland and appointing officials to investigate what. if any. disparity existed in the assessment of property there. and these officials having discovered that the homes of 3.000 of the toilers of that city were worth in the aggregate $10.000.000 and were on the tax duplicate at an average of 60 per cent. or $6.000.000. while the street railroad which the senior senator from ohio then in large part owned was also worth $10.000.000. in fact somewhat more. but they found that the assessing authorities in cleveland had kindly permitted this $10.000.000 worth of streetrailway property to be put upon the tax duplicate not at60 per cent of its value. nor 30 per cent. nor even 10 per cent. but at $600.0006 per cent of its value. as tom l. johnson is an unfaltering supporter of democratic principles in government. having for years. when it was even more unpopular than it is now to do so. boldly asserted that the jeffersonian principle of \"equal rights to all and special privileges to none\" should be carried out in governmental affairs in city. state. and nation. naturally enough. officials appointed by him. being in harmony with that principle. did their duty. placing the $10t000.000 streetrailway property upon the tax duplicate at the same ratio of value as that of the 3.000 small home owners. many of whom were employed by this very railroad company. what happened? did the cleveland street railway company. through its officers or through its then president. the senior senator from ohio. express contrition for having represented their $10.000.000 worth of property as only worth $600.000? did they offer to recompense the city of cleveland for the taxes which they had so long evaded? did they do anything which honorable men would.do under such circumstances? did they make any effort to do anything to even up their past failure to pay their proportion of taxes to the city of cleveland? oh. no that would not be making your business your politics. only men having the common. ordinary conception of their duty to their fellowmen would be guilty of such foolishness as that. the \"creator and preserver of prosperity\" acted upon the theory that \"charity begins at home.\" so he rushed down to columbus. has a law passed legislating out of office the officials who had been so rude as to assess his streetrailroad property at $5.800.000 (less. you will note. than the average on the small home owners). and secures the enactment of a law creating a state board of appraisement. made up. as i remember. of the governor. the secretary of state. and the state auditor. upon whom was conferred the power to appoint for the city of cleveland officials to take the place of those legislated out of office. almost the first act of this newly created board (made up of men who could not have been elected to any office by the votes of the people of cleveland) was to change the assessment levied against the streetrailroad property. reducing it. as i remember. to $1.000.000. in graciously consenting to this increase of assessment from $600.000 to $1.000.000 upon a $10.000.000 property. was not the senator violating his maxim of making \"his business his politics?\" surely had his \"business\" interests occupied the first place in his mind he would have directed his appointees. these men who owed their official positions to him. and who were appointed to do his will. he would. i say. have directed them to restore the original assessment-$600.000. i. e.. 6 per cent. so much has been said from time to time about tom l. johnsons administration of municipal affairs as mayor of cleveland. comparisons having been drawn between the cost of government there as against that of cincinnati. and having some personal knowledge of the condition of the streets in the business sections of the two cities. and. in order to show the falsity of the claim that the cost of municipal government is less in cincinnati than in clevelandalthough i admit the direct tax levy is loweri will insert in the appendix. as a portion of my remarks. an open letter of a public accountant. well known in ohio. analyzing the expenditures in the two cities. which proves that the per capita expenditures f6r municipal purposes in cincinnati are 50 per cent greater than in cleveland."},{"1":"1903","2":"FOSTER","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. the bill under consideration may wellbe termed an enabling act. the object and purpose of which is to carry into effect the treaty which was ratified by the senate on the 11th day of december. 1902. it is almost vain and useless to enter into any discussion of the merits of this measure. because i presume that every senator has practically made up his mind how he shall vote. and nothing that may be said could change that determination. but there are those who believe it to be their duty to their constituencies and their states. as well as their duty to their country. to register their dissent to this measure and to record their opposition. the discussion of the pending bill necessarily involves the discussion of the treaty. and i shall briefly call the attention of the senate to that document. the first article of the treaty between this government and the republic of cuba provides thatduring the term of this convention all articles of merchandise being the product of the soil or industry of the united states which are now imported io the republic of cuba free of duty and all articles of merchandise being the product of the soil or industry of the republic of cuba which are now imported into the united states free of duty shall continue to be so admitted by the respective countries free of duty. article h provides that all articles of merchandise not included in the article which i have read imported from cuba into this country shall be admitted at 20 per cent reduction of the present tariff laws of this country. or any tariff laws which may hereafter be passed by congress. i call special attention to the fact that this article provides for the admission of all articles the product of the soil or industry of cuba at the reduction mentioned during the continuance of the treaty. the third article provides that during the term of the convention all articles of merchandise being the product of the soil or industry of the united states shall be admitted into cuba at a reduction of 20 per cent of the rates thereon. as now provided or as may hereafter be provided in the customs tariff of said republic. the fourth article provides that during the term of this convention the articles of merchandise. as enumerated and described therein. being the product of the soil or industry of the united states. imported into cuba shall be admitted at a reduction of 25. 30. and 40 per cent of the tariff now existing or as may hereafter be provided by that republic. it is perfectly evident from a reading of the treaty and the provisions in these articles. that a trained diplomat of our government has secured a decided advantage over our young and inexperienced sister so far as a cold bargain is concerned. as we have obtained a much larger reduction on the products of our soil and industry going into cuba than she has secured for her own. mr. president. there are three reasons assigned for the passage of this bill by those who favor it: first. it is alleged that from a humane and benevolent consideration to cuba this government should give this relief to her. second. that there is some kind of a moral obligation on the partof this government to accord these reciprocal relations to that young republic. and. third. that it is in the interest of the manufacturing industries of this country that a new market shall be opened for their surplus products. if it can be shown or demonstrated by indisputable evidence that none of these alleged reasons are founded on facts. and there are no humane nor moral obligations incumbent on the people of this country to enact into a law this or any other commercial convention of a similar character. and that the business interests do not demand this legislation. nor are our manufacturing interests in need of it. nor will they be materially benefited thereby. but. on the contrary. great and irreparable injury will result from this legislation to the large and vital agricultural interests of our country. then the treaty ought not to be put into operation. i admit that the first two reasons. the one of humanity and the one of moral obligation. always appeal to the bighearted. nobleminded. generous american people. if cuba is in need. if her people are in distress. then no stronger appeal could be made to the american people than the appeal of charity. wherever that appeal comes from. mr. president. it never falls upon deaf ears in this country. disaster or calamity may overtake the people of any part of this world. and our people are always eager and anxious to relieve their suffering and want. i distinctly remember in my own state some years ago. when we were stricken with pestilence and the ravages of the flood. the pockets of the rich and the poor in every section of this country emptied their dollars and dimes into that stricken state. and though at that period sectional feeling ran high there was no city in the american union which responded more generously and liberally than did the city of boston. so. mr. president. this appeal to the charity and benevolence of our people. if founded in truth and fact. would and ought to receive a ready response. mr. president. the war with spain was a war largely in the interest of humanity. the sufferings of cuba and the wrongs endured by that people appealed so strongly to the american public that our government readily took up arms to relieve them of the tyrannies and oppressions of spain. immediately after the restoration of peace. when the flag of spain had left that island. there went from this country a number of longsighted. clearheaded american speculators. they saw a rich field for adventure and for riches. they bought large tracts of idle. vacant land. they purchased extensive sugar plantations. they invested in magnificent banana and fruit estates. while wealthy american corporations projected a splendid railway system across the island. these americans. quick to understand that any reciprocal treaty this government might make with cuba would not only enhance their own investments but at the same time offer inducements for other investors. thereby advancing their own interests. appealed to the same sentiment in this country that lay behind the war. general wood was at that time the military governor of cuba. his services were enlisted and he became an earnest coadjutor in this movement to appeal to the sympathies and to the sentiments of the american people on account of the alleged needs and distresses in cuba. i doubt if the history of this country will ever show a more systematic and organized effort to deceive and dupe the american people and play upon their sympathies and charities than this movement on the part of these americans. aided and assisted by the representatives of this government in that island. every hamlet. every city and municipality gathered together its citizens and sent appeals to the american people for aid. letters and telegrams were forwarded all over the country. and the american press. ever responsive to the noble calls of humanity. wherever found. readily espoused the cause of what was thought to be suffering cuba. the services of the pulpit were enlisted. and the ministers of the gospel throughout the length and breadth of this land thundered forth their eloquent appeal to the american people to come to the help and rescue of the cuban people. whom they actually believed to be in sore distress and actual suffering and want. every agency was industriously employed to build up a sentiment in this country for the relief and aid of the economic conditions of that island. the president of the united states in his message to congress declared: elsewhere i have discussed the question of reciprocity. in the case of cuba. however. there are weighty reasons of morality and of national interest why the policy should e held to have a peculiar application. and i most earnestly ask your attention to the wisdom. indeed to the vital need. of providing for a substantial reduction in the tariff duties on cuban imports into the united states. cuba has in her constitution affirmed what we desired. that she should stand. in international matters. in closer and more friendly relations with us than with any other power. and we are bound by every consideration of honor and expediency to pass commercial measures in the interests of her material wellbeing. then. again. in his special message to the senate of june 13. 1902. he states: yesterday. june 12. i received by cable from the american minister in cuba a mos earnest aeal from president palma for \"legislative relief before it is too late and [his] country financially ruined.\" so when congress assembled the work had been well done. the press and the pulpit and all the agencies that work up public sentiment had been successful in impressing upon the american people the need of this legislation. there appeared before the committee on ways and means of the house delegations of representative cubans and spaniards. planters and merchants. and representative americans. both from cuba and this country. who related the most thrilling and heartrending stories of cubas pitiable and distressful condition. not only were its financial and economic conditions pictured in the darkest colors. but the people of the island were represented as not oflly in absolute want and need. but on the borders of actual starvation. .it was boldly and unblushingly proclaimed both by the spanish planter and the american adventurer that unless relief was furnished. and without delay.turmoil and strife and bloodshed would be the inevitable result. before that committee appeared the now famous mr. thurber. who with pharisaical hypocrisy pleaded the cause of \"suffering cuba.\" while at the same time his pockets were comfortably filled with some twentyfive hundred dollars of the sugar trusts money. and over $8.000 from the coffers of the cuban treasury. illegally taken therefrom by general wood. the military governor of the island. but. mr. president. the relief was not furnished. the house of representatives passed its measure. it came to the senate. and died in the committee on foreign relations. . that bill reflected the will of the lower house of congress. after full and mature consideration that bill came from the other house as a reflection of the wishes and of the will of that great body. i wish to call the attention of the senate to some of the very radical and substantial differences in the requirements of that bill and the provisions of the present treaty. that bill provided. first. that after the enactment by the government of cuba of immigration. exclusion. and contractlabor laws similar and equally as restrictive as the laws of the united states on those subjects. the president of the united states would be authorized to negotiate with the government of cuba a commercial agreement. wherein reciprocal and equivalent concessions would be secured to each of the contracting parties in favor of the products and manufactures of the two countries upon a reduction of the rate of duties equivalent to 20 per cent ad valorem upon the tariff duties of the governments of the two contracting parties. and this commercial agreement was limited in its operation to the 1st day of december. 1903. it was further provided in that bill that the differential on refined sugar should be abolished. mark you. sir. this bill carried with it the will of the majority of the house. the only body known to the constitution of our country as having the right to originate revenue measures. it declared in unmistakable and unequivocal terms that no reciprocal relations or commercial union should be entered into between this government and the republic of cuba until the latter government had adopted such immigration and contractlabor laws as would prevent either the cheap labor of europe or the serf labor of the orient from coning in competition with the agricultural labor of this country. this was not only a wise and safe but it was a patriotic provision. again. this house bill proposed an abolition of the differential on refined sugar. the manifest object of this provision was twofoldfirst. to cheapen the commercial article of sugar to the consumer. and. secondly. to strike a blow at the american sugar trust. which an overwhelming majority of the members of congress believed was the real force and agent behind this bill. not for any benevolent or patriotic object. but rather for the selfish purpose of securing such legislation as would enable it to buy the raw sugar cheaper and at the same time maintain the present price of its own finished product. but. as i stated. this house measure went to sleep and died in the committee on foreign relations."},{"1":"1902","2":"SIMMONS","3":"S","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. president. contemporaneously with the declaration of war against spain congress passed what has come to be known as the \"teller resolution.\" the fourth section of the resolution. which refers exclusively to cuba. is in the following words: that the united states hereby disclaims any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty. jurisdiction. or control over said island except for the pacification thereof. and asserts its determination. when that is accomplished. to leave the government and control of the island to its people. later and contemporaneously with the ratification of the treaty of peace known as the \"treaty of paris.\" by which we acquired title to the philippine islands. the senate passed what has come to be kmown as the \"mcenery resolution.\" this resolution is in the following words: that by the ratification of the treaty of peace with spain it is not intended to incorporate the inhabitants of the philippine islands into citizenship of the united states. nor is it intended to permanently annex said islands as an integral part of the territory of the united states. hut it is the intention of the united states to establish on said islands a government suitable to the wants and conditions of the inhabitants of said islands to prepare them for local selfgoverment.. and in due time to make such disposition of said islands as will best promote the interests of the citizens of the united states and the inhabitants of said islands. the teller resolution. i have no doubt. expressed the purpose of congress and the country as to cuba. there has been no change of our purpose as expressed in this resolution toward that island. and we are informed by the press of the country that in a very short time our army of occupation is to be withdrawn and the island turned over to the government of its own people. although it has been doubted. i assume that at the time of its passage by the senate the mcenery resolution in like manner expressed the purpose. not only of the senate. but of the people of this country toward the phillippines. on the 24th day of february. in this year. when the bill temporarily to provide revenue for the philippine islands. and for other purposes. was before the senate. the junior senator from missouri offered as an amendment to that bill the mcenery resolution. and upon a yeaandnay vote that amendment was defeated by a vote of 24 to 43. the division of the senate upon the amendment was upon party lines. the republicans. with the exception of the senator from maryland . voting against the amendment and the democrats voting for it. on the same day the senior senator from colorado offered as an amendment to the philippine tariff bill a certain amendment. of which i read one section: that itis not intniided by the government of the united states to permanently annex the philippine islands as an integral part of the united states. but it is the deternination of the united states to establish. with the consent and assistance of the inhabitants thereof. a government or governments suitable to their vants and condition. and that shall give to the inhabitants the control aud administration of their local affairs. such as the raising of revenue and thie disposition thereof. the maintenance of peace and order in the several eommunitie of said islands that have been or that may be organized by the people thereof. and eventually to give them their indepiendence. upon a yeaandnay vote this amendment was defeated by a vote of 20 to 44. the democrats voting for and the republicans against the amendment. the position of the republican party in the last presidential campaign upon the subject of filipino independence. the discussion of the subject by the representatives of that party on the hustings and in the press. the general course and policy of the administration since the election. and the debate which preceded these votes of the senate. all indicated a change of purpose. as that purpose was expressed in the mcenery resolution. on the part of the dominant party toward these islands. before these votes there might have been some possible grounds for doubt as to the ultimate purpose of the dominant party in regard to the philippines. now. there is no longer room for doubt. the vote of the republican party upon these amendments is capable of but one interpretation. and that is that it has become the fixed purpose of that party. as far as it can control the matter. to hold these islands for all time as a possession of this country. i have no disposition. mr. president. to discuss the motives or reasons which have led the dominant party to settle upon one line of policy toward cuba and a wholly different line of policy toward the philippines. that would. i apprehend. be unprofitable. but i do wish to say that there is. in my judgment. no justification for this differentiation. either in morals. public policy. or national obligation. nor yet in the physical or political conditions of these two countries or of their people. at the close of the war with spain both of these countries were absolutely in our power. we chose to give independence to one. to deny it to the other. upon what grounds can we defend this discrimination? it can not be excused or defended upon the ground that the filipino is less capable. or less prepared. or less ready for selfgovernment than the cuban. i have not been able to give this feature of the subject close study. but from the study i have been able to give it i am satisfied that the filipino is just as well prepared and just as ready for selfgovernment as the cuban. the native uneducated filipino is just as intelligent. just as bright. xxxv298 as the native uneducated cuban. there is an educated class in both islands. but if there is any difference between them it is very slight and not material. there is also a foreign element in both the islands. but with reference to this foreign element there is this important distinctionthat it is in closer touch and sympathy with the native filipino than it is with the native cuban. neither can this distinction in treatment be justified upon the ground that we promised independence to the people of one of these countries and did not promise it to the other. or to any difference in aspiration of these people in this regard. both of these people. when we interfered in their affairs. were similarly situated with reference to spain. both of them were in insurrection against her authority. both of them were fighting for independence. and neither of them was considering any terms of surrender. or settlement. or reconciliation short of independence. the insurrectionary armies of both of these countries joined with our forces in overthrowing the power of spain.. and in both instances with the understanding. either expressed or implied. that if success attended our joint efforts they were to have independence. i am glad we have kept faith with cuba. i am glad that in her case we have been strong enough to resist the thirst of empire and the lust of power. i had hoped that we would pursue the same course with reference to the filipinos. and after helping them to establish a stable government we would turn that goverinent over to the people of the islands and safeguard it as we have done in the capse of cuba against the encroachments of any predatory nation. there are many things involved in the filipino situation about which i have had doubts and about which i still have doubts. but there is one proposition in connection with it about which there is not now and neverhas been any doubt in mymind. that proposition is this: that considering our own interest. present as well as future. this government ought to relinquish possession of these islands and withdraw from the archipelago just as soon as it can do so consistently with honor and our national obligations to those people. this far i feel certain. .beyond this. i confess i have doubts. i know it is the settled purpose of the republican party. as now constituted. to permanently retain these islands. but i am not so sure that such is the purpose of a majority of thepeople of this country. i do not believe they have yet passed upon that question. i do not believe the result of the last election meant that. that question was discussed in the campaign which preceded that election. it is true. and it may have had something to do with the result. but the people of this country were not then in possession of sufficient information about the question to enable them to properly render a judicial and final decision upon the issue raised. we know more about the filipino situation now than we did then. but even now we know but little. and much of the information that we have is admittedly unsatisfactory and unreliable. and much of it contradictory. no question of such momentous importance. involving the welfare of 70.000.000 people here and 10.000.000 there. can be safely decided upon such meager and unreliable information as we then had. or even as we now have. with reference to these people. their character. theft capacity. their aspirations. and their disposition toward us. but if it is the fixed and settled policy of this government. or if it shall hereafter become the fixed and settled policy of this government. to permanently retain these islands. and ve are confronted with the question as to how we shall govern them. whether as dependencies or under the constitution. whatever may be the views of others. as between these two alternatives. i confess i should. if compelled to choose. make the choice with grave misgivings. we can not govern them as colonies without trampling under foot there the fundamental principles of our constitution. and we can not sanction an outrage upon these principles there without endangering them at home. we can not with safety link freedom in government with absolutism. on the other hand. we can not admit these people. many of them only half civilized and only a part of them with any just comprehension of the principles of selfgovernment. as citizens of the republic without degrading the citizenship of the nation and inviting countless dangers. i do not doubt that these people are capable of establishing. and. with our assistance. that they would establish. a government satisfactory to themselves and suitable to their condition. but i am satisfied that at present they are. with very slight exceptions. utterly incapable of understanding or applying the principles of free republican government according to american standard and ideal. more than that. i am satisfied that they are by heredity incapable of understanding or applying these principles. it has taken ages to develop from the best possible material a people entirely fit for constitutional freedom. many enlightened nations are still unequal to that condition. it is the high privilege of america to incuilcate the doctrine of mans capability for selfgovernment. but we recognize the limitations and conditions that could render it expedient to establish a republican form of government among people not prepared for it. mr. president. we have had some experience in this country in trying to train by education an inferior race. a race which has never shown any initiative in selfgovernment. in the practices and principles of our constitutional system. for thirty years the negro has been not only a member of a selfgoverning community. but a participant in that government. during that time millions of dollars have been spent to educate him and to fit him for the duties and responsibilities of american citizenship. those who are most familiar with the result know that he is today but little better prepared for an intelligent and responsible discharge of those duties than he was in the beginning. if he has made any improvement or progress in that regard it has been exceedingly slight. the duties of suffrage and of citizenship under our constitutional system seem to be a thing beyond the capacity of his understanding. the defect in his case is not to be overcome. as the experience of the last thirty years shows. by education or by training. and the reason is obvious. it is a defect of heredity. the system of laws which the taft commission has promulgated and is attempting to enforce in the christian and pacified provinces of the philippine archipelago was framed in recognition of the present incapacity of those people and. of their inherent lack of those qualities and virtues without which successful selfgovernment is not possible. governor taft and the commission frankly admit this. their hope and theory is that these defects may be overcome by training and practical education through object lessons in civil government. in my judgment there is nothing to justify this hope. either in our own experience or in history. and the result will be disappointment and failure. i do not desire to enter into an) harsh criticism of the commission or of the government that they have established there. but i do want to say. with reference to the government that they have established there. the unamerican. the unrepublican. the despotic. the arbitrary. the tyrannical system of government that they have established there. and which i assume they have established not from choice but because. from their knowledge of that country and its people. they were satisfied they could not be governed with safety except by arbitrary methods. is strong evidence. and to my mind conclusive evidence. that those are not a people to be taken into the body of our citizenship. it is somewhat of a digression from my purpose. but i want to say in this connectionbecause it seems to be the fit place in which to say itthat i have no disposition and have not had any disposition to criticise our army of occupation in the philippines. i have wanted to believe well of our army. i have wanted to believe that they were conducting the war there according to the usages and laws of civilized warfare. early in this session. when i heard these charges of cruelty. of barbarity. of devastation. and of inhumanity against our army there. i confess frankly i was not disposed to believe them. and in private conversation i rereatedly expressed the opinion that. the american people would not believe such charges against our army unless they were es-. tablished by the most indubitable proof. i even felt resentful. but. mr. president. the developments of the last few months have dispelled any doubts about this matter and constrained and coerced me to believe those charges. at first there was a disposition to deny the horrible practice known as the water cure. now nobody any longer denies that it was practiced. not sporadically and in individual instances. but systematically and by authority. there is not now any disposition to deny the charge of unnecessary burning of villages and towns. there is no denial of the charge of reconcentration of helpless women and children. probably not quite as bad as the reconeentrado of the bloody and cruel weyler. but still in a most cruel and objectionable form. but. mr. president. if there were any doubts about these charges of cruelty. and barbarity. and inhumanity on the part of our army they have all been dispelled by an order issued by one in authority. by one who. until recently. has stood high ill the army and in the estimation of the country. by one who had a right to issue orders. by one who had a right to demand obedience to his orders. and obedience to whose orders has been held a sufficient justification for murder by an american cofirtmartial. that order. mr. president. was a military order. a military command. to go into the island of samar and there murder and killfor it can not be called by any other name--every person capable of bearing arms. beginning almost at the cradle. at the age of 10. and going almost to the grave. there is no other order recorded. mr. president. in all history which parallels this order. except that of herod the king. when he directed that all the children who were in bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from 2 years and under should be slain. in order that he might compass the death of him of whom it was said he came to be king of the jews. the christ and saviour of mankind. mr. president. we have not long been in the colonial business. but we have made very rapid progress during the short time that we have been in it. i challenge senators on the other side to cite a single instance in the annals of englislh or spanish colonialism whose details are more horrible and shocking than that of this order to our army in samar. in the presence of these cruelties and barbarities. this uncivilized and unchristian warfare. one who loves his country feels that the only thing he can do is to bow his head in shame. there it but one other thing. mr. president. i feel like doing. and that is to appeal to the brave. honorable. and humane man who now occupies the white house to probe these things to the bottom. and bring the men. however high in office and position. who have perpetrated them or are responsible for their perpetration. to condign punishment. we can at least by fitting the punishment. if there be any law adequate to that. to the crime. make the offense odious. but. mr. president. i have digressed from the subject. i was discussing the government the taft commission had promulgated for the archipelago. i have examined with considerable care the civil codes promnulgated by the commission. considered as simple rules for the regulation of the conduct of the citizens. most of these laws seem to be just and fair. in fact. many of them are almost identical with the laws which obtain in this country for the government of our towns. cities. and counties. but. in order to adjust them to the prejudices. the traditions. and nature of these oriental people. there is interwoven in them. as their dominant element. the principle of spanish absolutism. the body of these codes is american. but the great animating principles of american government are omitted. mr. president. in corroboration of this statement. i think it will be profitable to enumerate some of the more striking and essential features of the american constitutional system which the commission has. from necessity. i assume. omitted from these codes. under the american system. and under every system entitled to be called republican. the right of the people to select their governors and lawmakers is fundamental. under the taft code the people of the archipelago are permitted to do neither. under certain limitations and restrictions they may pass certain town ordinances. provincial regulations. and elect certain minor officers. but in the exercise of all these functions they are subject to the supervision and control of the central power which owes its life and authority. not to the people of the island. but to the president of the united states under the laws of congress. the commission is the supreme power in the island. it appoints all the chief provincial officers. both judicial and executive. and they are subject to removal at its will. it is a fundamental principle of jurisprudence in this country that the legislative. judicial. and executive departments shall be forever kept separate and distinct. there is hardly a state in the union whose constitution does not contain this express provision. under the system which we have established in the philippines the commission is at once the legislative and the executive department of the government. it makes the laws and executes them. or appoints agents to execute them. which is the same thing. indeed. a part of the salary of the commission is paid to them for the performance of their legislative duties and a part for the performance of their executive duties. they not only make the laws and enforce the laws. but appoint the judges who are to interpret and expound them. in this country and in every government entitled to be called free it is a fundamental principle that there shall be no taxation without representation. under the system which we have established in these islands the people have no voice in levying the general tax for the support of the government or in disbursing the proceeds when collected. in every free government trial by jury is regarded as the palladium of the liberty of the citizen. indispensable to the protection of life. liberty. and property. under the system of government we have established in the philippines trial by jury is unknown. the judges both find the facts and determine the law. in every free government the right of petition to redress grievances and the freedom of the press and of individual speech is regarded as sacred. and is either safeguarded in the constitution or in customs having the force of constitutional authority. under our control in these islands it is a crime to petition and to remonstrate. two newspaper editorsboth friendly to american occupationhave recently been arrested there by order of the taft commission and incarcerated for presuming to publish. with approving comments. an article criticising the commission which had already appeared in an american journal. when the editor of freedom. one of these papers. was arraigned for trial the other day in manila a very remarkable scene occurred. in this country we demand that the judiciary shall be free and independent and shall take orders from no one. being our national obligations. neither can we give up the moro provamenable only to conscience and the law of the land. when inces without violating our national

mr. president. we do not need any more territory. we have no need for more lands. we have enough already. england may have needed more. for she is but a pentup utica. so. in a less degree. with france. germany. and the other colonizing nations of europe. but we have a domain. the most magnificent in area that the sun ever shone upon. stretching from ocean to ocean and from the lakes to the gulf. much of its forests and minerals undeveloped. especially is this true of the section from which i come. that great empire stretching southward from the potomac. with its rich and boundless ores. forests. coal measures. and oil fields scarcely touched. and much of its land yet in its virgin condition. it alone can furnish homes for hundreds of millions of people and give profitable employment to many billions of capital. in that section of our common country alone there are undeveloped resources sufficient to afford profitable investment for all of our unemployed capital for generations to come. its development has only fairly begun. the south was. until recent years. distinctively an agricultural country. and yet. after all these years. its agriculture is still in its youth. but little more than half of its agricultural lands have been cleared. by reason of its sparse population. not more than twothirds of that which has been cleared is cultivated. and because of its inefficient system of labor and lack of capital. that which is cultivated does not yield much more than a half of what it is capable of producing. and yet. even under these adverse conditions. its agricultural products during the last twenty years have enormously increased. the cotton crop of the south for the year 1880 was 5.000.000 bales. in 1890. 7.000.000 bales. in 1899. 11.275.000 bales. it is difficult to estimate the extent of the tobacco land of the south. only a part of the land adapted to the growth of tobacco is cultivted in that way. in my own state in the last fifteen years the tobacco area has been more than doubled. the same thing may be said of the truck industry and of various other agricultural products. manufacturing and mining in the south are in their infancy. they are capable of indefinite development. the record of the last twenty years is a history of marvelous growth. and yet it is only an earnest of what can be accomplished and will be accomplished in the future whenever the needed capital shall be employed in securing development. let me give a few of the figures showing what has already been done in manufacturing in this section that was formerly so exclusively agricultural. in 1880 the number of manufacturing establishments in the south wasi only give round numbers43.000. in 1800. 53.000. in 1900. 92.000. capital invested in manufacturing in the south in 1880 amounted to $251.000.000. in 1890. $630.000.000. in 1900. $1.111.000.000. value of products of southern factories in 1880. $455.000.000. in 1890. $878.000.000. in 1900. $1.419.000.000. lumber and timber products in 1880. $39.930.000. in 1890. $90.738.000. in 1900. $188.144.000. manufacture of sugar for louisiana in 1880. $l.480.000. in 1890. $12.603.000. in 1900. $47.891.000. in north carolina. my own state. the number of manufacturing establishments in 1890 were 3.667. in 1900. 7.226. an increase of 92 per cent. capital invested in manufacturing in north carolina in 1890. $32.745.000. in 1900. $76.503.000. an increase of 133 per cent. value of property employed in manufacturing in 1890. $43.375.000. in 1900. $144.919.000. an increase in ten years of 135 per cent. as wonderful as this record is. the growth of manufacturing at the south. as i said before. has been retarded by the want of capital. the increase of these twenty years is but a fraction of what will be the increase of the next twenty years if the capital which we expect will find investment there is not unfortunately diverted from us for the purposes of exploitation in distant parts of the world. certainly no other part of the world today offers more profitable investment than the south. what is true of the south is also relatively true of a large area in the western part of our country. if the money which we have spent in the philippines since the close of the spanish war had been invested in the reclamation of the arid lands of the west millions of acres of valuable land would today be open to settlers. and in the next generation would have yielded a trade more profitable than any we can hope to get from the philippines for generations to come. i assert with entire confidence. mr. president. that the same amount of money expended in the south and in certain sections of the west in the development of our resources there would create many times the trade. many times the demand for the products of our mines and factories. that the same amount of money expended in the philippines would create. mr. president. every consideration should leadus to build up our country and trade here at home before seeking doubtful and hazardous enterprises abroad. in considering the value to us of the philippines for the purpose of trade. we must also consider the cost of subduing them and governing them while we are creating this trade. we have already spent $330.000.000 in attempting to subdue these islands. and our army there is now costing us not less than $73.000.000 a year. it will be necessary for us to maintain an army there of from 20.000 to 30.000 soldiers for an indefinite period of time. in view of the statements of the military officers in the islands i think i can safely make this statement. many of the provinces are said to have been pacified. but everybody knows that they are pacified only in the sense that they have been subjugated. withdraw the army and there will be widespread insurrection throughout the islands in less than a week. if we are to control them we must keep a large army there for at least a generation to come. we can not hope to reduce the cost of our. naval and military establishments there below thirty or forty million dollars a year. counting the millions we have spent there up to this time as lost. the annual profits on our trade. even under best conditions. will not in generations equal our annual expenditures. in order to earn an annual profit equal to our expenditures in maintaining our control of the country. we must create a trade at least ten times that which those islands have ever had. even should we control the whole of it instead of only a fraction of it. when will we accomplish that? perhaps the answer can. in part. be found in spains experiences with these islands. did spain find them profitable? of what advantage have they been to her in the past. and what possible hope of advantage do they promise us in the future? considered in this connection. a distinction is to be noted between colonial dependencies. where people are enlightenedlike the colonies of great britain. in canada and australiaand foreign possessions. where the inhabitants are less intelligent and less advanced in civilization. australia exported to the united kingdom in 1899 $355.000.000 and imported from the united kingdom over $300.000.000 of goods. but the original inhabitants of australia contributed nothing to this trade. it was created by european colonists carrying into a virgin region their enterprise and intelligence. the 10.000.000 people who inhabit the philippines never brought to spain any trade commensurate with the expense of governing them. and merely by substituting our flag for that of spain we can not alter the conditions inherent in their situation and convert those people into a thriving. busy. productive community. the leopards spots do not thus change. in a speech delivered by my colleague in this chamber on february 22. in this year. in his efforts to show that the philippines have already become an important market for the products of the south. especially the products of the cotton nills of that section. and that their purchases of southern products during the past fiscal year give promise of great extension in our trade there in the near future. he said: for the first time since the american occupation of the philippines the united states in the month of may last headed the list of nations sending merchandise to the philippines. the exports into manila during the month of may were valued at .450.421. while i nave not had an opportunity to examine the report with the view of ascertaining the character of the exports which we sent to that country. i am satisfied that a majority of the items represent southern products. manifestly. the statement made in this speech to the effect that the united states exported to manila during may. 1901. products valued at $2.460.431 is a clerical mistake. for our total exports to the islands for the eleven months ending may 30. 1901. including gold and silver. were only $2.752.045. but. mr. president. we did export to manila during the month of may. 1901. products to the value of $560.432. and it is true that that was more than any other nation exported to that country during that month. great britain was the next largest exporter in that month. the amount exported by her being $451.471. but the exports of great britain to the philippines during the eleven months ending with may. 1901. more than doubled ours. our exports to the philippines for the month of may were evidently abnormal. and are accounted for by the needs at that time of our army. as one of the itemsnore than onethird of the whole amountwas $178.000 of gold coin. if my colleague had examined the abstracts of exports for the month following. he would have seen that our exports to the islands during the month of may did not sustain his argument. and that the proportions to which they attained in that month were abnormal. for our exports for the month of june only amounted to $282.610. being less than onehalf of those for the month of may. while those of great britain increased. if lie had followed up the abstract of our exports for may. he would have found that no considerable part of them came from the south. he would also have found that in that month the united states only exported to the philippines $6.107 worth of raw cotton. not as much as some farmers in north carolina annually produce. he would have found that the whole united states exported there during that month only $8.918 worth of manufactures of cotton. not enough to keep many of the small cotton factories in north carolina running a month. - he would also have found that the whole united states exported to these islands during the eleven months ending may 30. 1901. only $27.000 worth of raw cotton and $03.147 worth of the manufactures of cotton. and he would have found that a large part of our exports to these islands. both for may and the fiscal year 1901. cobsisted of liquors. beeran american. and not a philippine beverage. when the fact that during this time we had quartered in manila an army of over 50.000 american soldiers. spending something like $5.000.000 per month. is considered and that the entire amount of american cotton goods exported was less than $100.000. it really seems astonishing that anyone co uld conclude that the amount of our exports during this period furnished evidence of a gratifying growth of trade between the south or between this country and the philippines. for myself. i find in it anything except cause of satisfaction. my colleague. in another part of his speech which i have just read. comments upon the importance to our southern cotton manufacturers of the markets of china. and attributes the growth in our trade with this country to republican policies. in other parts of this speech he lays stress upon the effect of our ownership of the philippines upon this trade. my colleague. in the conclusions he draws in this behalf. deceives himself. this argument is frequently heard in the south. where it is addressed especially to the cotton manufacturers. they are told that the extension of our territory in the acquisition of the philippines has unlocked the ports of china to us and given us that ancient empire as a market for our cotton manufactures. these statements are misleading. the chinesejapanese war. though it resulted in her defeat. was in many respects a blessing to china. it was a great object lesson to her. it paved the way for the introduction of western ideas and methods and appliances. it led to the construction of railroads and factories. and these in their turn have made china something more of a foreign trader and purchaser of foreign goods. the boxer movement was in some degree a protest of the more conservative element against this innovation. the result has been a great increase in her trade with the outside world. and the united states has come in for a share of this increase. not a full share. but a share. the spanish war has had nothing to do with the development and growth in this trade. it began long before that war and its increase is the result of changed conditions in china. and neither its origin nor development has been influenced by that war. in 1895 we exported to china $3.603.840 worth of merchandise. in 1896 we exported there $6.921.933. in 1897. $11.924.433. in 1899. $14.493.440. and in 1900. $15.258.748. the ratio of increase before the spanish war was. therefore. greater than it has been since. the same is true with reference to our trade with japan. in 1895 our exports to japan were $4.634.717. in 1896. $7.689.685. in 1897. $13.255.478. in 1898. $20.385.544. in 1899. $17.264.680. in 1900. $29.087r642. the spanish war certainly does not account for our increased trade with japan. nor yetwith europe. and yet the growth of our exports to these countries is much more remarkable than its growth in china. our exports to europe in 1896 were $773.000.000 in round numbers. in 1897. $813.000.000. in 1898. $973.000.000. and in 1900. $1.040.000.000. these facts. this remarkable development of our trade with europe. show that territorial expansion is not necessary for extensive trade relations. i rejoice at any growth in the trade of our manufactured cotton goods. considering the vast quantity of our cotton productions. our exports in this branch of american industry is surprisingly small. it is to be hoped that our trade in cotton cloth will grow and expand not only in china. but elsewhere. it will grow and expand there and elsewhere with improved transportation and when our mill owners have learned to prepare their products to suit the taste and fancy of their oriental customers. but its growth can not be made to depend upon territorial expansion. the agricultural possibilities of these islands are. i have no doubt. capable of great development. the lands are generally fertile. some of their valleys are annually inundated and. as in the case of the nile. these floods leave a rich deposit. even thelands not thus enriched do not for many years after being cleared require artificial fertilization. they are adapted to the growth of tobacco. rice. sugar. and. i have reason to believe. to the growth of cotton. these are all staple crops of the south. it is true the archipelago does not now raise enough rice to supply the home demand. but before spain\" began its policy of discouraging this crop in the interest of tobacco. in which the government had up to 1882 a monopoly. the philippines exported a considerable quantity of rice. they now export considerable quantities of sugar. hon. saaluel m. robertson. of louisiana. member of the ways and means committee of the house. speaking of the sugar production of these islands. said. in a speech delivered in the house of represe.utatives december 17. 1901: in 1532. in addition to the amount of sugar consumed in the philippine islands. they eaported 53000.00 pounds. there are no statistics as to the amount of sugar consumed. but it maybe estimated that a large quantity of it was ued to supplythe demands of the people in the islands. from these figures it can casily e seen that under the most adverse circumstances surrounding the production of sugarwith crude instruments and the crudest machinerythe philippine islands produced more sugar in that year than was produced by the hawaiian~ islands in 1.800 under free trade with the united states and most improved machinery and appalances. think. then. of the won derf l possibilities of prodction there even under unfavorable circumstances. in 1200 there was exported into this country for consumption 4.018.080.530 pounds of sugar. the domestic production was .500.040.450 pounds. from cane and beet. making the total consumed in the united states in 1900 4.518.132.9i0 pounds. these figures are taken from the statistical abstract. 28d number. 1900. again. mjr. president. even uder the present unfavorable conditions the islands are exporters of tobacco. i can not say with confidence to what extent cotton would be grown in the archipelago. but i am satisfied that all the natural conditions for its successful cultre exist there. a reliable young gentleman of my state. a graduate of the university of the state. iwho spent two years in the philippines in the army. who was born and reared in one of the largest cottongrowing counties in the state. a cotton expert. and who has recently. i have been told. been appointed to a position as cotton expert in the philippmnes. in a conversation a few weeks ago expressed to me the unqualified opinion thaat the undulating and hill lands of the whole island of luzon vere especially adapted to the growth of cotton. for many years long staple cotton has been successfully grown in the island of flocos. and there are some small factories in this island. m r. foreman. in his work on the philippines. on page 861. says: the cotton tree (gossip inm tehebceass) is found growin g in an uncultivated state in many islands of thle archipelgo. long staple cotton was formerly extensively cultivated in the province of flees norte. whence many years ago large quantities of good cotton stuffs were exported. this industry still exists. the culliration of this staple was. however. discouraged by the local governors in order to urgo the planting of tobacco for the government supplies it has since become difficult to revive the cotton production. although an essay. in pamphlet form (for which a prize was awarded in madrid). was gratuitously distributed over the coteny in li88 with that object. neovertheless. cotton spinning and weaving is still carried on a reduced scale in the 0cs provinces (luzon. west coast). wild cotton is practically useless for spinning. as the staple is extremely short. but perhaps by hybridization and careful attention its cultre might become valuable to the colony. the pod is elliptical. and the cotton which bursts from it at maturity is snowwhite. it is used for stuffing pillows and mattresses. it is a common thing to see (wild) cotton trees planted along the high road to serve as telegraph pests. by the time the seed is fully ripe every lea f lies falien. and nothing hut the hussting pods remain hanging t he branches. now. mr. president. wherever the cotton tree grows indigenously it may be safely assumed longstaple cotton can be grown. have no doubt this great southern product can be grown not only in ilocos. but in many other parts of the islands. whatever crops can be grown in these islands can be grown abundantly and cheaply. the fact that these islands are not today exporting sugar. rice. and tobacco in quantities sufficiently large to affect the price of these articles in the markets of the world is due to the conditions of agriculture there. to meager clearings. to inefficient labor. to the crudity of the tools and machinery used. and to the political disturbances and disorders which have for years prevailed there. under our occupation most of these adverse conditions may disappear. again. if we retain the islands. whether we retain them as dependencies or as domestic territory. the tariff barriers. which ha te in a measure closed our marikets to these products. will be. if not removed. at least greatly relaxed. and the effect upon production will be the sam e her as it has been in the hawaiian islands. \"in less than ten years.\" says mr. roiheoto in the speech from which i have quoted. \"after the adoption of the reciprocity treaties with these islands (hawaiian) the amount of sugar imported into this country from them had increased 1.300 per cent. the government reports show that in 1875. the year before the treaty. the hawaiian islands imported to this contry only 25.000.000 pounds of sugar. valued at $1.210.000 in round numbers. in 1899 they imported to this country .545.370.587 pounds. valued at $21..898.000. if the effect of american thrift and enterprise and the relaxation of tariff restrictions shall have the same effect in stimulating the production and exportation of the staple agricultural crops of the philippines as it has ad on the growth and exportation of sugar in the hawaiian islands. will not the producers of rice. sugar. and tobacco. and perhaps cotton. in this country find in these islands a dangerous competitor? our sugar and tobacco planters are alarmed over competition of cuban sugar and tobacco. and are vigorously protesting against the proposition of a 20 per cent cut on the duty of sugar from this island. the philippines are many times larger than cuba. and can produce sugar and tobacco cheaper than cuba can produce thlm. these staple products can not only be raised in abundance in the philippines. but they will be raised more cheaply than they can be raised in america. not only because of cheaper manual labor. but cheaper beast. mr. foreman. in . his valuable work on the philippines. from which i have before quoted. tells us that the native laborer of the philippines can live in luxury upon 20 cents a day. in america farm labor costs from 50 to 75 cents a day. the farm animal of the philippines is the water buffalo. ho costs never more than $30. and generally only from $15 to $20. while the farm mule and farm horse in this country costs from $100 to $200. it is said that the islands can never be developed with philippine labor because it is lazy and thriftless. perhaps that is true. it certainly is true unless. under the stimulus of american thrift and the influence of an opportunity to labor for better wages. the filipino shall become a more effective farm hand. but that these islands will be agriculturally developed if we retain them. i have no doubt. if not developed by the employment of native labor. then with what sort of labor? certainly we can not develop them with caucasian labor. for the white man can not work under that tropical sun. if we can not develop them with native or caucasian labor. i ask again with what labor will we develop them? without hesitation i answer. chinese labor. already a considerable proportion of the best population of luzon is said to be of chinese extraction. i know it is said by some that we will exclude the chinaman from the archipelago. as we have excluded him from this country. i do not believe that. that law we have recently passed to that effect will not be permanent. i know there is a prejudice in this country against the chinaman as a laborer in our mines and on our railroads and in our factories just as there is a prejudice against the negro laborer in these industries. but i do not believe that prejudices exist against the chinaman as a farm laborer in this country any more than it does against the negro as a farm laborer. however that may be. if we keep the islands we may be absolutely certain of one thingthey will be exploited. and by whom? they will be exploited by those great syndicates and land corporations that are already organized and being organized for that purpose. and in whose interest much of the pending bill is manifestly framed. it contains about 100 pages. and at least 60 of them are devoted to devising and putting into statute law a scheme by which the land. and the timber. and the coal. and the oil. and the minerals in those islands may fall into the hands of these corporations and syndicates at a nominal price. there is one most significant provision in the bill. it is with reference to leasing the land. it says that an individual may acquire 160 acres. but a corporation may acquire as much as 5.000 acres. it is perfectly manifest that the bill was prepared and is to be passed here in the interest of these very syndicates and land grabbers that are now organizing and that stand like hungry wolves upon the border ready to enter and to take these lands and to exploit them. we asked the committee to tell us what they ultimately proposed with regard to these islands and these people. they decline to answer. but. mr. president. we are going forward as rapidly as we can to seize and appropriate everything upon the islands that is valuable. it reminds me of the case of a man who has acquired title to a tract of land that may be technically good. like our title to the lands of those islands. but that has no foundation in morals or in justice. when he is asked to surrender his legal title because of its lack of morality he says. \"wait. after a while i will give you an answer.\" and he proceeds to cut the timber. and to mine the ore and the coal and the oil. and when lie has stripped it of timber and ore and oil and everything that is valuable says. i am ready now to surrender you back your title.\" mr. president. i can not contemplate without some feeling of alarm the prospect of building up in the archipelago this powerful competition. based upon chinese labor or cheap native labor. to the great staple products of the south. if we retain these islands and develop them. our manufacturers may. in the course of time. find there a market for some of their products. but they will not realize their full expectation even in this regard. for when the american goes there he will carry his machinery with himhis refinery. his looms. and his spindles. he will find much. if not all. of his raw material there. with the possible exception of cotton. and even that may be raised on the ground. but if not. lie can get it from nearby india. and with cheap and imitative native or chinese labor. pelnuanently establish his hold on the oriental markets we expect to gain. and even invade others we now have. it will be remembered that japan. whose industries are the wonderful creation of a single generation. is now competing with america in the sale of cotton goods. japan exported to china and other asiatic countries in 1899 $1.6.551.250 of cotton manufactures. while america exported only $10.600.000 to these countries in that year. but. mr. president. if no factories are established there. if a^ new japan shall not arise there to interfere with our trade ill cotton goods. if the archipelago shall continue a purely agricultural country and is developed to the fullost and becomes a valuable market for the sale of our manufactures. it will be dearly purchased trade if the farmers of this country find the markets they already have abridged for the sale of their surplus products or find those markets less profitable by reason of increased supply resulting from filipino overproduction. mr. president. we hear much these days about the increase in our foreign trade and the new markets we have found abroad for our products. especially for our manufactures. for there has been but little increase in our agricultural exports. it is true the growth in recent years of our foreign trade in manufactures has been so phenomenal as to have attracted the attention of the world. but to what are we indebted for these new markets? through what agency have they been secured? i answer. we got them because we had to have them. because we needed them and sought them with the intelligence and zeal which the american trader always displays under the spur of necessity. for a long time our industrial expansion had been rapid. but there was a ready market at home for all that our mills and factories could make. no other market was sought. not only because there was a ready customer at hand. but because. by the exclusion of outside competition. he was a more profitable customer than could be found anywhere else. new factories continued to spring up and multiply. until -in the course of time home production grew more rapidly than home consumption and finally greatly exceeded it. in these circumstances. our manufacturers were suddenly confronted with the always troublesome problem of a surplus. the question was what should they do with the surplus. what could they do about it. there were two alternatives. they had either to find outside markets or stop building new factories and curtail the production of those already built. in this exigency the decision was what might have been expected of american pluck. energy. and resource. it was in favor of trade expansion. in pursuance of that decision. other markets were sought. the means necessary to secure them were employed and they were found. as they might have been and would have been found years before if they had been sought with the same degree of intelligence and determination. that our manufacturers have found themselves in a position to successfully compete in the markets of the world with the manufacturers of other nations is a subject for patriotic rejoicing. i do not myself altogether sympathize with the criticism now current against some of our manufacturers who are selling their products in foreign markets at from 25 to 35 per cent less than they are selling them to our home people. although i condemn their extortion against their home patrons. and i condemn the methods and devices to which they resort for the purposes of stifling home competition-"},{"1":"1901","2":"SOUTHARD","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"it has nothing whatever to do with establishing the metric system of or any other system of weights and measures. the bill provides that one of the functions of the bureau shall be \"the construction. when necessary. of standards. their multiples. and subdivisions.\" it in nowise adopts a standard for the government or anybody else. at present. we are told. there is no reliable photometric standard in this country. if a reliable photometric standard should be constructed by this institution when established. it would be a matter for sincere congratulation. but this bill would not compel anyone to adopt it or use it. this bill proposes the standardizing of the instruments we possess for the general government. for the states and municipalities. and for anyone else who may see fit to employ its services. it has nothing whatever to do with the metric system. i made that statement in the start. i wish to read just a paragraph from the statement of dr. c. b. dudley. chemist for the pennsylvania railroad company. you are doubtless quite well aware that where it is essential to have standard apparatus at the present time we are compelled to send abroad for it. there is no reason in the world why this work can not equally well be done in this country. and i am sure i voice the sentiment of everyone who is at all conversant with the facts in the case. and especially those who. like myself. have had endless disputes and conflicts during the years which have passed. some of which would have been avoided if we had had in this country a means of having the apparatus which we use in this country standardized. the importance of this bureau in scientific investigation i leave to others. confining myself to the actual practical daily use of apparatus in commercial work. i have been connected with the pennsylvania railroad company. i may say. for nearly twentyfive years. and the value of material alone which has been examined in our laboratory during that time can safely be said to be not less than $50.000.000. i most sincerely hope that your committee will see their way clear to make a favorable recommendation in regard to the establishment of this bureau. and that satisfactory legislation will follow that recommendation. captain sigsbee. united states navy. made a very interesting and valuable contribution to the information of the committee. i wish i could read all of it. but for want of time i shall read but a small part of what he says: it seems to me very important that the navy. when inviting bids. should be able to say that the standards offered should be those of a national bureau of standards. doubtless bids would then be made by a greater number of competitors. and this would be very advantageous to the navy. the bureau of equipment uses delicate instruments. at the observatory. which comes under that bureau. they make magnetic and astronomical observations. which requires instruments of precision. surveying and navigation come largely under that bureau. and also meteorological observations at sea. the hydrographie office under that bureau has between 1.500 and 2.000 voluntary observers of the weather at sea. all of whom use delicate instruments. which must be compared with standards for which again there ought to be an ultimate standard. . the bureau of equipment also. i might say. is charged by the navy with matters pertaining to electricity. and makes many observations accordingly. the bureau of steam engineering gave me yesterday a list occupying a whole page of foolscap naming tests and observations required in that bureau. all of which had some relation to the necessity for ultimate standards. the bureau of construction makes tests in many directions which require ultimate standards. the bureau of ordnance. as we all know. deals with questions of ballistics. and of measurements in the manufacture of guns. shells. and powder. and in many other ways the bureau of ordnance is interested in the establishment of ultimate standards. in order to draw a parallel to what we desire to effect. i might invite attention to the fact that our national observatory gives daily the standard of time for a vast region of country. we set our watches by the standard observatory time. whereby we know that they are correct with respect to each other. this. in brief. in respect to all measurements. is what we want. 1 do not see any way of attaining authorized standards for ultimate application except by means of a national bureau. therefore i favor such an establishment. the present state of the art of steel manufacture in this country is largely due to the high standard of tests persistently demanded by the navy at the outset and against all opposition. a similar improvement may be expected in other arts from the maintenance of exalted standards. a bureau of standards under government control would give universal encouragement to this end. the bill has been enthusiastically indorsed by all the heads of departments of the general government having scientific bureaus. as well as by all the chiefs of such bureaus. as furnishing an illustration of the necessity and value of this proposed bureau to the general government. i will quote from the statement of the secretary of agriculture: i have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of april 24. and beg to assure you that the establishment of a national standardizing bureau. having the function outlined by you. will be of the highest value and importance. not only to the scientific bureaus. offices. and divisions of this department. but to the country at large. its influence will be felt wherever the quality and value of substances are fixed by chemical and physical tests. whether this be in connection with scientific investigations. in connection with manufacturing and other industrial processes. or in connection with commercial transactions. speaking for this department alone. i wish to say that it has been our policy to patronize the american manufacturers of scientific apparatus whenever practicable without hampering our investigators by compelling them to use apparatus of an inferior grade. the art of the construction of scientific apparatus has been brought to such a high degree of perfection under the fostering care of european governments--notably germanythat we have been compelled to send abroad a large proportion of our orders. either directly or indirectly. through imorters. the greatest disadvantage resulting from this state of affairs is not the de ay. inconvenience. and expense connected with making purchases abroad. nor is it to be found in the danger of injury to delicate and expensive apparatus during transportation across the sea. it is the necessity of importing the certificate of a foreign government whenever an official certificate of accuracy is desired with apparatus. in germany an order can be issued for apparatus with the specification that the goods delivered must be of the quality and accuracy recognized by the regulations established by the standardizing bureaus of the imperial government. apparatus made in accordance with these regulations are regular commodities. and are described in the catalogues of all the apparatus makers and dealers. when the goods are received the purchaser is able to send a proper proportion of the shipment to the government standardizing bureaus and base his acceptance or refusal of the goods upon the results of the official tests. for the accommodation of customers who need certified apparatus for immediate use most of the dealers keep in stock apparatus bearing the official stamp. the disadvantage under which american scientific workersnotably chemisislabor is evidenced by a recent experience of the division of chemistry of this department. the confusion of standards and carelessness which has characterized the manufacture of graduated chemical glassware in the past is notorious. some months ago the division of chemistry issued to an american dealer and importer an order for graduated glassware. to be made in accordance with the regulations of the german imperial testing commission (kaiserliche normal aichungs kommission). while all of this apparatus was to fulfill the requirements in point of construction and limits of error in graduation of the regulations named. certain pieces were to bear the official stamp of the imperial commission. at the special request of the american dealer to whom the order was sent permission was granted to import only the pieces of apparatus requiring the official stamp and to suppy for the remainder of the order apparatus of american manufacture. but ma e in accordance with the regulations named. after considerable delay the goods were delivered. the certified pieces were eminently satisfactory. the uncertified ones were quite the opposite. they were unsatisfactory both in the form of construction and in regard to accuracy. as an example of the degree of inaccuracy. it maybe stated that a flask marked to contain 100 cubic centimeters was found to contain 100.3 cubic centimeters. i do not believe that this experience was due to unworthy motives on the part of either the manufacturer or dealer. this experience is simply the result of the absence in this country of any wellestablished and authoritative standards governing the forms of construction. the system of graduation. and the allowable limits of error for apparatus of this kind. the mere adoption of regulations relative to the character of apparatus admissible for stamping by a national standardizing bureau will cause a revolution in the apparatus manufactured and give to it that highly important quality. uniformity. as a further illustration of the great desirability of such an establishment i may call your attention to the contention which has arisen in the courts in the united states in the last few years concerning the regulations prescribed by the treasury department governing the polarization of imported sugars. these regulations were prepared by a joint commission consisting of the chemist of the department of agriculture as chairman. a representative of the coast and geodetic survey. office of weights and measures. and the chemist of the bureau of internal revenue. the regulations were based upon the most careful scientific determinations and the apparatus and utensils employed by the customshouse officers standardized by the office of weights and measures of the coast and geodetic survey. nevertheless. the accuracy of these officials has been called into question by the importers. and the question is now the subject of expensive and tedious litigation. the existence of such an office of your department as you propose to establish would have avoided all such trouble by the weight of its authority. this is only one of the many instances where the utility of such a bureau would prove of practical advantage to official operations. the above examples merely serve to illustrate the numerous ways in which the establishment of a national standardizing bureau will directly facilitate and increase the value of the scientific work of this department. while it is a proper part of every scientific workers training to be able to assure himself of the accuracy of his instrments and of their suitability for the work in hand. in these days of the division of labor the testing of apparatus has very properly become a welldefined specialty. requiring a special training. in order that the various operations connected with it may be performed with rapidity. with the greatest economy of time and apparatus. and with the highest degree of skill. our investigations need. first of all. clearly defined authoritative standards for many forms of apparatus. including volumetric apparatus. thermometers. etc.. second. they need the assistance of a readily accessible and properly equipped bureau charged with testing and official certification of apparatus. third. they need from time to time the cooperation of just such an institution as you descitbe in aiding them in devising and perfecting new apparatus for special purposes. as the progress of discovery in various branches of agricultural science makes them possible and useful. i am sure that the close of this century of most brilliant scientific discoveries can not be given a more enduring monument in this country than the establishment of just such an institution as you describe under the head of a national standardizing bureau. it would take much more time than we have at our disposal to refer even briefly to the many splendid indorsements received in support of the pending bill. the hearings had before the committee on coinage. weights. and measures. and also those had before the subcommittee of the committee on commerce in the senate. have been printed. those in the senate as a senate document. no one can read these hearings without wondering why this country has waited so long to take the first step toward the establishment of a national bureau of standards. we sincerely hope that the bureau of standards. when established. as it certainly must be. will become an aid to scientific and industrial progress in this country. such as the reichsantalt has been in germany. germany for several years has been rapidly advancing toward industrial supremacy in europe. one of the potent factors in this notable advance is the perfected alliance between science and commerce existing there. and the reichsanstalt is universally regarded as the crowning glory of her scientific advancement. professor carhart. of ann arbor university. in a paper presented at the one hundred and fortysixth meeting of the american institute of electrical engineers in new york city. in september last. refers to the necessity of an institution in this country similar to the reichsanstalt in the following language: if germany has found it to her scientific and industrial advantage to maintain the reichsanstalt and is proud of what it accomplishes. and if great britain is so impressed with the success of the institution that she has decided to imitate it. it is surely the part of wisdom for the united states to move in the same direction. it is therefore very gratifying that at the suggestion of secretary gage a bill was introduced in the last congress to establish a national standardizing bureau. and that the committee on coinage. weights. and measures reported unanimously and strongly in favor of its passage. so great is the importance of this movement from the point of view of science. of national pride. and of the higher interests of industrial pursuits that the effort. so hap pity begun. to secure suitable legislation should he repsated with redoubled force and enthusiasm. some of the reasons for making this effort one does not need to go far to seek. iin the first place. the scientific interests lo be served are certainly as great as iany other country in the world. science is cultivated here with increasing assiduity and success. wve are no longer content to follow in the footsteps of european savants and modestly repeat their investigations. original work of a high order is now done in many american universities. but the difficulties under which university instructors prosecute research are even greater hers than in germany. and wvs are still compelled to go to europe for most of our standrds. as a result. inventions of an almost purely scientific character originating hers have been carried to perfection in the resehianstalt. and germany gets the larger part of the credit. i need only instance the weston standard cell. which has been so fully investigated at the reichianstat. and the altoy \"manganin.\" which the same institution employs for its standard resistances after a searching inquiry into its properties. both of these arc the invention of :mr. edward weston. one of the past presidents of this institute. so long as there is no authoritative bureau in the united states under federal control and presided over by men commanding respect and confidence. we must continue \"to utilize the far anupecrier standardizing facilities of other governments.\" it is true that science knows no nationality. but the scientific workers of any nation can serve their own country better if they are not compelled to obtain their standards and their best instruments from distant parts of the globe. america has the cultivation in physical science. the ability on the part of her investigators. and the inventive faculty to do wvork in a national institution that we shall not be ashamed to place by the side of germanys best products. the establishment of a national institution for physical and technical purposes can not fail to foster a vigorous and healthy growth in science. to which we already owe so much of our national prosperity end renown. in the manufacture of optical and scientific instruments germany is leading the world. and we can not expect to compete with her in this line of manufacture unless we offer our own people equal facilities for standardization and calibration. if we have been successful in impressing the house with the real value and importance of the measure. we have doe fear that it will not receive favorable consideration. some objection has been made to the salaries carried in the bill. in the bill as reported by the committee the salary of the director was fixed at $6.000 per annum. in the judgment of the committee this is not too large. but to meet all possible objection in the amended bill the salary is fixed at $5.000. with the hope that congress may see fit to increase it at some future time. the officers of the bureau of standards will be called upon to determine the most important as well as the most difficult problems. these decisions must be such as to command the respect of the world. the salaries proposed for the director and others in the scientific class are no higher than the corresponding positions in our leading educational institutions. and it should be kept in mind that the latter positions are to be preferred on account of the general impression which prevails that government positions are subject to political changes. and the fact that the scientific men of educational institutions receive from three to four months vacation annually. in which they may travel or study. iwhen men of the ability required for this position are willing to give up the many advantages they possess at educational institutions. there is open to them the position of scientific expert in the large industrial corporattonspositions which frequently pay as much as $10.000 per year. m~oreover. a physicist or chemist of repute who holds a responsible position\" in an educational institution or industrial corporation in one of the large cities is frequently consulted and called upon for expert testimony. thus providing him with a source of income not available to the scientific men of the proposed bureau. some have thought the amount authorized for the building too large. the building must be solidly built. it must be very solidly built. with heavy walls and floors. many of the walls must be double. on account of temperature changes. the material in the building would be at least 50 per cent more than in an ordinary building of the same size. the heating of the building is much more complicated and expensive than in ordinary cases. the heating plant must he of the most improved form. and capable of perfect regulation. it will cost twice as much as the usual heating plant. in addition to the gas and water pipes of an ordinary building every room in the building must be provided with water and gas for laboratory purposes. there is also a system of compressed air and vacuum pipes which extend throughout the building. the plumbing and piping of a laboratory is a very considerable item of its entire cost. in addition to the usual electriclight wires there are several systems of wires and switchboards used in the distribution of electricity for experimental purposes to the various rooms. this item would be four or five times that in an ordinary building. the windows are to be provided with lightproof shutters or blinds. in order that the rooms may be absolutely dark or flooded with light. as the work may require. many of the windows should be double. the heating plant. engines. dynamos. motors. pumps. and heavy machines or apparatus would be placed in a small building. detached from the laboratory proper. which must be free from vibration or disturbances of all kinds. the instrument shops would also be in the small building. it will be understood that owing to the requirements of such a building. the appropriation. rather the authorization. is not too large. the building should be built in an isolated place. it should be far enough from the city to insure freedom from the disturbances caused by traffic or electric streetcar lines. but not too far from the departments and shipping facilities. the site should be large enough to prevent the construction of buildings. streetcar lines. or streets near the laboratory. mr. speaker. as i said in the beginning. the bill should pass without a dissenting vote. a summary of the whole situation could not be made in better terms than those used by the honorable secretary of the treasury in his statement before the subcommittee in the senate. he there said: in a most general way i may state that it is open to our observation that a new country is raw in its methods. it does not work by close rule. there is often a large margin for waste. the technical and scientific side of affairs comes later on. when by the development of society the relation of things will become more complex. the law of competition becomes more closely applied. and we learn by slow and painful steps that accuracy and closeness and scientific skill are required to supplement what went on in a tolerably skillful way before. this country has advanced now to a point where in all the great things of life it is in competition with the older and more thoroughly established nations of the world. and by more thoroughly i mean in the experience of trade. in the scientific application of ideas. and in all the economies which save waste and aid efficiency. in this particular of standardizing weights and measures and testing apparatus of every kind the older countries are far ahead of us. in fact. it may be said that there is no comparison between us. we are dependent utterly upon germany. perhaps france to some extent. and england for our measurements and those standards which we are obliged to resort to in testing and comparing when we enter into competitive work against them. the application of a standardizing bureau. if established. will be very wide. it touches the manufacturinq arts and commerce and all scientific efforts. and it will be most important in the general work of education. we have come to a period where guesswork will not do and. to use an old familiar phrase. \"pretty near\" does not count. exactness and absolute conformity to standards and uniformity are the essentials. there is another side to that which occurs to me. it may appear to many to have a more sentimental than practical value. but it gives the proposition. to my mind. great force. and that is what might be called the moral aspect of this question. the recognition by the government of an absolute standard. to which fidelity in all the relations of life affected by that standard is required. we are the victim of looseness in our methods. of too much looseness in our ideas. of too much of that sort of spirit. born out of our rapid development. perhaps. of a disregard or a lack of comprehension of the binding sanction of accuracy in every relation of life. now. the establishment of a burea.u like this. where the government is the custodian and the originator of these standards of weights and measures as applied to all the higher scientific aspects of life which we are so rapidly developing in. hs. to my mind. a value far and above the mere physical considerations which affect it. although those physical considerations are fundamental and most important. nothing ca dignity this government more than to be the patron of. and the establisher of. absolutely correct scientific standards and such legislation as will hold our people to faithfully regard and absolutely obey the requirements of law in adhesion to those true and correct standards. mr. speaker. i ask for a vote."},{"1":"1900","2":"BAILEY","3":"H","4":"Yes","5":"Yes","6":"mr. speaker. during the early days of this session of congress house bill 3717. now known as the grout bill. was introduced. and was referred to the committee on agriculture. ard by the chairman of that committee was referred to a subcommittee of five. immediately the mail of this subcommittee was flooded with petitions for the passage of the bill and with protests against its passage. the petitions for the passage came from those who were immediately interested in the dairy business. and were nearly all exactly alike. printed upon postal cards. with the address of the different members of the committee printed upon the cards. these cards and petitions were printed in chicago. at the headquarters of the national dairy union. and were sent to the farmers and dairymen all over the country. with the request that they sign the same and forward to congress. the protests came from the stock raisers and stock feeders of the country. from the live stock associations. and from the stock exchanges. almost the entire cotton belt of our country united in protesting against the passing of the bill in the form that it was introduced. the labor organizations from all over the country also sent in their protests against the bill on the ground that it was putting a tax upon a product that to them bad become a staple article of food and one of the necessaries of life. each one of these great interests also demanded that an opportunity be given them to appear before the committee and give their reasons why they were for or against the bill. in accordance with this request. the subcommittee arranged to give all who were interested a hearing. the first hearing was accorded to the representatives of the national dairymens union. exgovernor hoard. of wisconsin. president. and c. y. knight. secretary. with other gentlemen. testified before our committee. representing this association. and advocated the passage of the grout bill. mr. speaker. the reason given by the friends of the grout bill for the support of this measure. on its face. is to suppress the fraudulent sale of oleomargarine as butter. it is claimed by the friends of the bill that a very large per cent of oleomargarine that is sold is palmed off upon an unsuspecting public as pure butter. indeed. the gentleman from vermont . in his remarks before the house today. said 90 per cent of the oleomargarine manufactured was sold as butter. mr. speaker. the evidence before our committee does not bear out the statement made by the gentleman from vermont. mr. wilson. late commissioner of internal revenue. was before the committee. and in his published testimony. on page 177. commissioner wilson testifies that not to exceed 10 per cent of oleoisargarine is sold for butter. but that 90 per cent of oleomargarine is sold as oleomargarine and that the people who buy it are fully advised of what they are buying. now. i submit that the commissioner of internal revenue is in the best position of any man in the entire country to form an accurate and correct opinion upon this subject. and his official opinion should be given credence by this house and by the country at large over the statement of men who have no data upon which to base their judgment and have formed their opinions solely upon prejudice. now. mr. speaker. there is no contention upon the part of the friends of the proposed bill that either the manufacturer or whole. sale dealer commits any fraud in the sale of oleomargarine. but the whole contention is that the fraud is perpetrated by the retailer. and considerable testimony was introduced showing this fraud. and speaking for myself. and. as i believe i do. for the subcommittee who drafted the substitute bill. it was our honest opinion. after listening to all the testimony. that the grout bill offered no

subcommittee."}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
