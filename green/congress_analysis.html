Thanks to his initiative and hard work. citizens affected by the Copper King Fire have been kept safe and up to speed on the latest fire activity. Sheriff Rummel has coordinated local law enforcement and emergency services for weeks to ensure the safety of Montanans and their property as the Copper King Fire has grown to be the largest wildfire in the State. As the fire increased in size to over 28.000 acres. Mr. Rummel implemented evacuation and preevacuation notices to numerous residences. In addition to phone calls. public notices around the county. and house visits. Sheriff Rummel has used Facebook to keep the community apprised of the very latest information about the fire. He has posted regular updates to the Sanders County Sheriffs Facebook page. using the power of social media to get the word out to his community. While recent weather has tempered the spread of the Copper King Fire. Sanders County will not be completely out of the woods until we see a seasonending weather event. As Montanans continue to suffer the consequences of Federal mismanagement of our forests. it is often up to local leaders to protect our communities from wildfires. I commend Sheriff Rummel for his tireless work to keep Montanans safe and keep his community informed. All Montanans. and indeed all Americans. owe our local law enforcement and emergency responders a debt of gratitude for their daily efforts on our behalf.*"},{"1":"2016","2":"E","3":"MILLER","4":"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize the MacedonianAmerican community in honor of their homelands 25th Independence Day. The people of the Republic of Macedonia voted on September 8. 1991. to officially gain independence from the former Yugoslavia. By voting for independence. the people decided that it was time for their country to forge its own democratic path and to begin a new era in their history. This 25th anniversary of their independence provides us all an opportunity to recognize the MacedonianAmerican communitys significant contributions within the United States. But first. I would like to ask for a moment of silence for the 24 victims of devastating floods that affected Macedonias capital Skopje (Scopyay) last month. which left hundreds injured and thousands displaced. Our own government provided over $50.000 in aid to help these flood victims and repair schools in time for the start of the school year. E1221 Since 2001. Macedonia has been one of the staunchest allies of the United States in the War on Terror. Macedonia was the fourth and fifth largest contributor of troops. per capita. in the mission in Afghanistan. Macedonian troops guarded American troops at the compound in Kabul. And. Macedonia welcomed 50.000 and 400.000 refugees during the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo. respectively. For a country of little over two million. Macedonia has done its fair share and deserves to be in NATO. On that note. I ask that you join me. and 35 colleagues. in cosponsoring H. Res. 56 in support of Macedonias NATO accession as soon as possible. With American support. Macedonia has become a model of stability in a region known for ethnic strife and tension. Up until earlier this year. Macedonia was struck with the unprecedented refugee crisis facing Europe. as hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees fled wartorn countries in the Middle East and North Africa. In one year. an estimated one million migrants traveled through Macedonia. and the countrys institutions organized an orderly response to the influx of people. including organizing daily trains to ferry migrants from the southern to the northern border. If the partnership between the United States and Macedonia is to remain strong. the country needs our continued support. I also use this opportunity to urge Macedonias leaders to continue strengthening their institutions and reforming its democracy and rule of law. especially following the slated December 11. 2016 elections. which will prove a true test of its democracy. As a way to recognize and strengthen this strategic U.S.-Macedonia partnership. I started the first Congressional Caucus on Macedonia and MacedonianAmericans. This Caucus is a bipartisan group of members of Congress dedicated to maintaining and strengthening a positive and mutually beneficial relationship between the United States and the Republic of Macedonia. as well as advocating for the concerns and interests of the MacedonianAmerican community in the United States. Michigans 10th District has one of the largest populations of MacedonianAmericans in the Nation. I would like to acknowledge their contributions to our District and our State. and I look forward to continuing that relationship as we deal with the problems facing our great Nation. Again. congratulations to all of Macedonian heritage for their achievements as we commemorate this important 25th anniversary of Macedonias independence. Long Live Macedonia (Da Zivee Makedonija) Long Live the United States (Da Zivee Amerika)"},{"1":"2016","2":"E","3":"BILIRAKIS","4":"Mr. Speaker.

In contemplating the work of these inventors. future generations can strive to emulate these honorees and their dedication to innovation."},{"1":"2016","2":"E","3":"MOORE","4":"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to recognize Richard Maslowski who has served as the City of Glendale. Wisconsins City Administrator since 1980. After 36 years of exemplary service to the City of Glendale. he retired effective on August 31. 2016. Richard Maslowski may well be the longestserving city administrator in the State of Wisconsin and is a native of South Milwaukee. Wisconsin. He held similar positions in West Bend and Butler prior to assuming the Glendale City Administrator position. Richard Maslowski has been a transformative figure for the City of Glendale. Wisconsin. He leaves behind a city that has undergone major positive changes due in large part to his broad influence and great leadership. When Richard Maslowski started working as Glendales City Administrator. the communitys most visible properties were Bayshore Mall and Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co.s massive grain elevator. More than three decades later. the mall has been redeveloped as the mixeduse Bayshore Town Center. while a business park has replaced the grain elevator. E1228 Under Mr. Maslowskis direction. Glendale created its first tax incremental financing (TIF) district in 1981. for a hotel project. eight more districts followed during his tenure. The nine commercial developments developed during Mr. Maslowskis tenure utilizing the citys TIF district authority include: hotels. business parks. apartments and the conversion of Bayshore Mall into Bayshore Town Center being the largest TIF project. Mr. Maslowski always found a way to move the project forward. I was proud to work with Richard Maslowski to obtain a federal grant to help finance an offramp from 143 to Bayshores main parking structure on N. Port Washington Road. At the time. I obtained the funds I did not represent Glendale in Congress but had previously represented Glendale in Wisconsins State Senate. I knew the area well and knew what it represented for the future of the City of Glendale and for this development. Bayshore Town Center. which opened in 2006. Mr. Maslowski has been an innovator. he was among the first to utilize TIFs for environmental cleanup costs. In 1992. Glendale used a TIF for environmental cleanup costs. an unusual tactic then but is now commonplace. to convert a closed hotel. built on the site of a former dump. into a new Hotel complex. Glendale also became perhaps the first city in Wisconsin where the developer/company paid the costs upfront for environmental cleanup. The company later received property tax rebates to compensate it for the environmental cleanup costs. Mr. Speaker. I am proud to recognize Mr. Richard Maslowski. He leaves big shoes to fill and a rich legacy of innovation. creativity. growth and sustainability for the City of Glendale. Mr. Maslowski has many skill sets and is always professional. However. I believe perhaps his strongest ability is bringing the right people together at critical times to complete a project and ultimately recreate a city. He is a true trailblazer. The citizens of the Fourth Congressional District. the State of Wisconsin and the nation have benefited tremendously from his dedicated service. I am honored for these reasons to pay tribute to Mr. Richard Maslowski."},{"1":"2016","2":"H","3":"WATERS","4":"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. we stand here today after an extraordinarily long recess. and Republicans first order of businesses is to protect Wall Street profits instead of dealing with a host of critical issues facing the American public. I recently visited Baton Rouge. Louisiana. where thousands of residents are still without homes and communities are struggling to recover in the wake of last months historic devastating flooding. There is so much that we need to do as Members of Congress to help our constituents in the short amount of time we have left in session. whether it is helping the people of Baton Rouge. ending the crisis of homelessness in America. or preventing senseless gun violence. However. rather than working together to pass sensible legislation to address these issues. we are debating H.R. 5424. a bad bill that would put Americans savings and investments at risk by opening the door to further abuses in the private equity industry. This is an industry that touches all of us because it is not just private businesses looking to these funds to raise capital. Onequarter of the investments held by private equity firms come from our public pension funds that are holding our teachers and firefighters retirement savings. And it is not just our public pensions that are on the line. It is also our emergency services and mortgages and consumer lending markets where private equity funds are increasing their presence. That is why it is so important to have adequate oversight of this industry. We must ensure that Wall Street does not turn a profit at the expense of investors. consumers. and retirees. Unfortunately. H.R. 5424 would roll back DoddFranks muchneeded oversight and transparency measures for the shadow banking industry. DoddFrank required advisers to private equity funds and hedge funds with more than $150 million in assets under management to register with the SEC and comply with important reporting and audit requirements. In addition. it required newly registered advisers to file systemic risk reports with the Financial Stability Oversight Council. because we had sufficient information on the risks that private funds could pose to our economy as a whole. Thanks to this new oversight. the Securities and Exchange Commission has been able to examine and. where appropriate. bring enforcement actions against private fund advisers. In fact. the SEC has brought numerous enforcement actions against private fund advisers for a variety of transgressions in the past few years. In 2013. the SEC identified violations or weaknesses in more than 50 percent of cases where it had examined how fees and expenses are handled by advisers. Recently. the SEC Director of Enforcement urged greater transparency in this area and said the Commission \"will continue to aggressively bring impactful cases in this space.\" All of this comes on top of recent news reports showing how private equity firms are investing in our fire departments. ambulance services. and mortgage and consumer lending markets. Their profitdriven tactics have resulted in slower reaction times in our emergency services. exorbitant interest rates. and the same sort of foreclosure abuses that we witnessed before and during the financial crisis. So. when it comes to private equity funds and hedge funds. it is clear that more regulation is needed. not less. Yet this bill takes us in the wrong direction. For example. advisers would no longer have to notify clients of a change in ownership or provide them with information on their procedures for handling conflicts of interest in voting proxies. Additionally. they would not have to disclose information on large funds to the FSOC. making it harder to monitor and detect systemic risk. Also troubling is that the bill would create a Bernie Madoff loophole by providing a broad exception from an annual audit requirement for funds whose investors may have a relationship with the adviser and for funds invested in private securities that are not represented by a paper certificate. I must note that. despite efforts by my colleagues to amend this bill and remove some of its harmful provisions. there are still too many problematic provisions in this bill that would put investors. retirees. and consumers at risk. That is why it is opposed by consumer and investor advocates. State security regulators. institutional investors. and labor unions representing workers whose pensions could be affected. Moreover. the White House has threatened to veto the bill. saying it \"would enable private fund advisers to slip back into the shadows\" and \"unnecessarily put working and middle class families at risk. while benefiting Wall Street and other narrow special interests.\" I. therefore. strongly urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 5424. I reserve the balance of my time. [ 0930"},{"1":"2016","2":"E","3":"FORBES","4":"Mr. Speaker. today I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in honoring the Department of the Navy Office of the General Counsel as it celebrates 75 years of providing timely. effective. and candid legal advice and counsel to the Navy and Marine Corps. The origins of DON OGC can be traced back to 1862. when the first civilian attorney was appointed to serve as Solicitor of the Navy. However. it was not until September 10. 1941. when James Forrestal. then Under Secretary of the Navy. recruited attorneys from private practice and formally established DON OGCs predecessor organization. the Procurement Legal Division. to consistently address the numerous legal issues surrounding the rapid increase in volume and complexity of ship and aircraft acquisition during World War II mobilization efforts. Over the last three quarters of a century. what began as a small cadre of civilian attorneys has evolved into an elite government law firm composed of civilian and military attorneys. and professional support staff. located in 140 offices worldwide. In addition. DON OGC has expanded its practice areas beyond business and commercial law to include acquisition integrity. federal employment/labor law. environmental law. fiscal law. intellectual property law. real estate law. ethics and standards of conduct. energy law. Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act. intelligence law. cyber security law. arms control law. legislation. and litigation. to ensure its attorneys possess the expertise needed to support the multifaceted mission of the warfighter. Mr. Speaker. I congratulate DON OGC on 75 years of dedicated service to our Sailors and Marines across the globe. and wish DON OGC continued success in expertly navigating the legal challenges confronting the Navy and the Marine Corps and significantly contributing to the national defense."}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}

I am not prepared to say today what his rights may be. Now. Mr. President. one single fnrther observation and I am done. and I hope the bill may pass with such amendments as may commend themselves to the Senate. The Senator from Nebraska criticised the slowness with which the work of the Pension Bureau is being performed. Why. Mr. President. there are on file today in the Pension Bureau 477.239 applications for increasefor increase aloneand a flood of those applicatiom is going off in every mail. In addition to that. every Senato and every member of the House is sending almost every hour of every day calls on the Pension Bureau for information cQncerning the status of claims. I sent one the other day and I four d that my colleague had sent one and each of the two members cf the House from mv State had sent calls the same day. The exsoldier had appliedto us all. The result was that four clerks were detailed to look up that case. A very large portion of the fo:.ce is on work of that kind every day of every year. I think the Pension Bureau is doing the best it can under the circumstances. I do not th.nk there is a member of this body who would like to be in the position the Commissioner of Pensions is in. or who could do any bet :er than the Commissioner of Pensions is doing in the laborious and irksome and thankless task that he has imposed upon him. I presume they are making mistakes. very likely they are making deci 3ions upon.technical grounds. and they ought to be broader in their interpretation of the laws. but-"},{"1":"1900","2":"S","3":"ALLEN","4":"In behalf of my colleague . who is necessarily detained from the Senate. I desire to introduce two bills: The bill granting a pension to Emily M. Gillespie was read twice by its title. and referred to the Committee on Pensions. The bill to authorize a trial of the outlet system of lowering the flood line and improving the lowwater navigation of the Mississippi River and its tributaries on the plan of \"No cure. no pay.\" was read twice by its title. and referred to the Committee on Commerce."},{"1":"1900","2":"S","3":"TILLMAN","4":"I will say for the information of the Senator from Georgia that if it is not taken with the first census it can not be taken at all without an intolerable additional expense. It is for the Senate to determine whether it will enlarge the scope of the census. If we break down the barrier erected by the Census Committee. we simply. as we were notified by the Senator from Missouri the other day. open up a flood of amendments concerning each special class of inquiry any Senator may wish to have included."},{"1":"1900","2":"S","3":"MASON","4":"I present the memorial of James S. Cowden. relative to the Lake Borgne outlet system for lowering the flood line of the Mississippi River. I desire that the memorial be ieferred to the Committee on Printing. It is a very cumbersome document. and the question whether it should be printed will have to go to the Committee on Printing."},{"1":"1900","2":"H","3":"RAY","4":"I do not agree with any gentleman who charges the gentleman with opposition to just pensions. I have found him reasonable. patriotic. and only desirous of careful scrutiny in passing private pension bills. In administering the law the Commissioner of Pensions must carefully examine or cause to be examined every claim. he must see that proof is furnished in every case. for if he does not the Bureau will be flooded with unjust and fraudulent claims. and the whole pension system discredited and brought into disrepute. The \"roll of honor.\" of which all are so proud. must. as it always has been. be kept purged of every imputation of fraud from a respectable source. The soldier himself feels this and is opposed to unmerited pensions. I want to say here emphatically. and I want the old soldiers in my district to hear it. and I want the old soldiers all over the country to hear it. that I believe the present Commissioner of Pensions in the administration of the pension laws of the United States has acted and is acting today faithfully. honestly. and intelligently. and is trying to carry out the law as he finds it written for the benefit of the old soldiers and their widows andorphans. That he has made mistakes I will not deny. We all make mistakes. But the man who rises here and condemns him as unfriendly to the pension laws or unfriendly to the old soldier is. in my judgment. unjust to himself and unjust to the Commissioner of Pensions. And I regret that any man on this side of the Chamber has taken that position. That injustice is sometimes done at the Pension Bureau I do not deny. but the Commissioner will correct all errors when attention is called to them. Now. Mr. Chairman. I desire to call attention to one or two other things. and the limit of my time will prevent my saying all that I desire to say. I called the attention of the gentleman from Kansas [M r. CURTIS] to the fact that there was an appeal from these decisions of the Commissioner of Pensions and that on the particular subjects to which he referred the Commissioner has been sustained by Mr. Webster Davis. the Assistant Secretary of the Interiorand. of course. that carries with it the approval of the Secretary of the Interiorand a bill is already pending now. and will undoubtedly be enacted into law. that will correct all evils complained of and leave no room for doubt in the interpretation of it. When questions of fact are presented the soldier should always be given the benefit of the doubt. and our pension laws should be liberally construed to carry out the intent. Again. it has been claimed that great injustices are being done to the widows of the old soldiers by H. Clay Evans. Commissioner. because he so construed the law as to hold that $96 per year net income is made the measure that entitles her to a pension under the act of 1890. Well. now. that decision has been sustained. and lawyers. men of good judgment everywhere. sustain the Commissioner. and the remedy is to correct the law itself. Let Congress change the law or take the Icussing \"-the Commissioner is not at fault. So a bill has been introduced in the Senate and has passed that body. and I hope it will pass this House. making $250 the measure. That. of course. I think is more just and more equitable. because no man on either side of the Chamber would claim for a single moment that $96 per year is sufficient to support the widow of an old soldier. with an added pension of $8 per mbnth. the maximum allowed a widow under the act of June 27. 1890. This question was of so much importance that Commissioner Evans recommended the change in the law and the President of the United States called attention to the subject in his annual message. As the years come and go. whitening the heads of our deserving pensioners and adding to their physical infirmities. I would see the laws made more liberal. for no deserving old soldier or war widow should ever know actual want or stand in fear of the almshouse. At the same time care must be exercised lest extravagance in this direction lead to more stringent laws instead of conservative liberality. It must be remembered that the act of June. 1890. only applies to the widows of soldiers who served in the war of the rebellion. and that they are getting old and feeble. and hence when dependent and entitled to the benefits of that law $8 per month is a very smaJl sum indeed."},{"1":"1900","2":"H","3":"GILL","4":"Mr.. Speaker.. it is in the presence of death. and in. the contemplation of- his handiwork that the kinship. of all humanity is most forcibly manifest to every thoughtful mind. Can it be other than a useful and humanizing experience to all. that live to thus receive a new. and most emphatic: impress of the great truth of the brotherhood. of man? The. divine laws of. kindness and of. charity can. not be. too often freshened up in. our hearts. and their timely. exercise toward the living. both as an opportunity and.. as an obligation. should be earnestly resolved upon each. time that. we pay our loving and tearful. tributes to the revered but unresponsive dead.. At such times the thoughts of the exalted should. tend toward humility. and the lowly may lift his head to a. higher level in the absolute assurance of a universal ultimate equality. Forthough the carved marble andthe laurel wreath may be placed. and justly.. over one. and the modest slab and. a solitary flower. may be theonly mark that love can give to the resting place of another. yet beneath the token of. remembrance in either case the. silent lips. the pulseless heart. and. the rigid clay are in every essential identical. Both. as they lie there prostrate.. have been strippe& of every possession. whether mateial.. intellectual. or spfritual.. and- to.neither is. there anything left beyond the equal hope of a common. resurrection morning. Surely some. such thought as- this justifies- the poet when he exclaims: O fading honors of the dead:! O high ambitions. lowly laid ! The full consciousness of this thought: is: borne in upon us in a striking manner if we but pause an instant to consider the sad havoc wrought by the fell. destroyer during- the past year in the ranks of those who have won fame in widely different walks of. life. By so doing we can learn. afresh the truth that the great Leveler grants no! favors. but that high and low. rich and. poor.. youth and age. alike must obey the summons to that \"unknown silent shore.\" Thus. even he who held. the great office of VicePresident of the United States was not exempt from the chilling blast. and when the genial Hobart. heard the summons. \"Weary wanderer. come.\"he. was. notwithstanding the showering tears of a nation bereaved. laid away inthe bosom of our common mother. earth. with the throng of undistinguished dead. to sleep the same dreamless sleep. This House can. not escape the universal experience. and today the work of legislation halts once: again to permit the performance of the sad duty of: paying our tributes of honor and respect to the memory of yet another of its members who has passed away in the last year. Were it not that LORENZO DANFORD was my immediate predecessor as the Representative of my district. on this. floor. I would prefer to sit silent and listen. to others. more able to speak in fitting language of my dear and honored friend. but conscious as I am of the exalted place he held in the hearts of the people whom I have the honor to represent. I should.. even in the absence of the custom of this House calling for my participation in the proceedings of this hour.. feel that I had. disregarded their wishes should I permit this occasion to pass without attempting to give expression to their high appreciation of his character and their love for his memory. Not in years has a sorrow so universal pervaded the homes. of the Sixteenth district of Ohio as that which followed the announcement on June 19. 1899. that LORENZO DANFORD was dead. Everywhere throughout the district the news came as a stroke of personal sorrow to all. and on the streets. in- the. factories. on the farms. and wherever men are wont to congregate. were heard mingled expressions of keenest sorrow and regret. When I recall the faces of his friends shadowed oer with thoughts- of parting and the eloquent. tears that sprang unbidden to the eye. I am reminded that no poor sentiment of mine can thrill the chords of love with such majesty and power as did his simple story. for each could say: His life was gentle. and the elements So mixd in him. that Nature might stand u And say to all the world. \"This was a man! Born on a farm in Washington Township. Belmont County. Ohio. October 18. 1829. he was fortunate in living through the most magnificent period of opportunity which the history of this nation presents. Breathing the free air of country life and intellectuallyexpanding under the educational influences of his teachers and the ready knowledge of his father. he was soon able to comprehend the fateful trend of the political movements of the times and to intelligently play his part in the great drama of human affairs. Beginning. at the period of his majority. a time of great activity had set in along all lines of progress.. not only in the sphere of politics. but also in the field of industrial advancement. Territorial acquisitions had. extended the boundaries of our nation from ocean to ocean. property qualifications had heen superseded by manhood suffrage.. the isolated settler. in his humble cottage. was now the peer of any in the land.. canals had brought the West into closer connection with the East and opened the markets for the surplus products of the farms. the Mexican war fired his youthful blood with martial valor. while the great discussion over slavery thrilled his. soul with freedoms highest and noblest impulses. He. received a commonschool education. attended college at Waynesburg.. Pa.. for two years. studied law.. and. was admitted to the bar in 1854.. The people of his. native county early recognized the characteristics which later were to carry him to higher positions of activity and responsibility by choosing him successively in 1857 and 1859 as prosecuting attorney. but ere his second term. had expired. vehement discussion of the burning question of that. hour had. given way to a passionate appeal to the arbitrament of force.. and the booming cannon heralded the first act in historys greatest tragedy. In that hour of his countrys peril hedid not hesitate to sacrifice all upon its altar.. and resigning his office. he enlisted for three months as private in the Seventeenth Ohio Volunteer Infantry. Upon the expiration. of his service. he. returned home and assisted in raising a company of the Fifteenth Ohio Volunteer Infantry. of which he was chosen second lieutenant. and later was promoted for bravery upon the field of battle to be first lieutenant and captain. He was one of the nations heroes who sustained his countrys. honor upon the bloody fields of. Shiloh. Stones River. Chickamauga. Resaca. Kenesaw Mountain. and many others. Owing to failing health he resigned. his commission in 18C.4 and returned to his native county. The sterling qualities which had so successfully carried him through his early career were manifest in the richer and more conspicuous triumphs of hi later years. Devoting himself assiduously to the practice of law. he soon became the leading advocate of the eastern Ohio bar. and stepbystep won the esteem and confidence not only of the people but also of his professional brethren. He was. eminently fitted for forensic triumphs. and was in. a most remarkable degree successful in obtaining favorable decisions. in his jury cases. Tall and graceful. with keen eye and massive head. a commanding presence and a most musical voice. he was an orator who carried conviction. to. the minds.of his hearers.. his clear logic and burning eloquence often enabling him to sway his auditors at will. Nor was this. power exerted in the court room alone. for he was one. of the most forceful and pleasing speakers who ever graced. the political forum of his- native State. and even in this Hallhe has wonnotable triumphs in the arena of debate. of which. and of other details. of his work in Congress. his friends and. associates still serving here are in a position to speak more fully and satisfactorily than I can. In 1864 he was a member of the. electoral college of Ohio. and in 1892 he was again a member and president of same. In 1872 he was acandidate for the Republicannomination for Congress from the Sixteenth Ohio district. and his personal popularity was so great that he was successful in his campaign over the intrepid and eloquent John A. Bingham. who enjoyed a national reputation as a brilliant statesman and scholar. Although the task before him was difficult. yet so well did he perform the arduous duties of his new trust that the people ratified the choice of that convention by reelecting him to Congress in 1874 and again in 1876. Retiring from political life in 1879. he resumed the practice of. law. His. reputation as a powerful advocate was so well established that hardly a case of any importance was tried in his native county upon which he was not employed as attorney for one side or the other. Although in many heated contests. he never took an unfair advantage of a witness:or an opponent. for. although intellectually combative and persistent in opposition. he was always generous to an adversary. and the kindness of his disposition was never more apparent than in the skill which he displayed in eliciting needed information. Always alert. active. and forceful in behalf of a client. his high sense of honor prevented him from falling into the tricks of a mere pettifogger. and he was consequently respected and admired even by his bitterest opponent. Just and dignified in his demeanor. he was a man of warm impulses. and his generous heart was large enough to carry within its sympathies all classes of men. To those who knew him well he was unassuming and confiding. and he was at all times absolutely steadfast in his friendships. Reentering politics in 1894. he became a candidate for Congress. and after a heated contest was nominated for that high position and elected by a large majority. Appointed by Speaker Reed chairman of the Immigration Committee. he displayed unusual breadth and ability in the discussions arising out of the intricate and difficult problems coming within the scope of the work of that committee. He was reelected in 1896 and in 1898. but ere the Fiftysixth Congress began its labors his spirit had taken its flight to the God who gave it. In 1858 he was married to Annie H. Cook. of Jefferson County. and as a result of this union three sons were bornWilliam. John. and Thomasthe first and last of whom still survive. His wife dying in 1867. he was again married in 1870 to Mary M. Allen. their only child being Carrie Lee. now a nurse in the Philippine Islands. The proximate cause of his death was the exposure to which he was subjected in attending the funeral of his father. Samuel Danford. and his constitution. already weakened by disease. was unable to withstand the insidious attacks of la grippewhich followed. Though he fought in the sick room with the same vim and determination he had always displayed. yet slowly but surely the tide of his life ebbed away. Surrounded by kind and sympathetic friends who forestalled his every wish. his mind wandered again to the scenes of his childhood. and he longed for the hills and vales. the simplicity and purity of country life. Lpving hands removed him to the home of his cousin. John Sidebottom. a few miles from his own home. at St. Clairsville. where. surrounded by peace and plenty. and subject to the gentle ministrations of his devoted daughter. Carrie Lee. the hourglass slowly ran its course. with hope freshening as renewed strength seemed to summon back the old fire and vigor. and anon giving way to despair. as the hectic flush faded. leaving the patient weaker than before. until at last. on a beautiful day in June. the morning sunrise seemed to flood his countenance with a strange. new light. and ere the evening shadows gathered Deaths finger touched him and he fell asleep. To describe him whom we honor today as merely an ordinary man would be to do his memory a great injustice. to say that he was a very great man. as that term is generally understood. would be fulsome flattery. but measured by the standard of purposes well and earnestly accomplished Captain DANFORD was truly great. for by faithful and honorable conduct in public and private life he won the confidence. esteem. and love of those who knew him best. and in their hearts his name will ever be written. like Abou Ben Adhem. as one who loved his fellowman. Mr. DANFORD was a man of action as well as a man of thought. and having that valuable possession generally termed \"good common sense.\" he was clear and practical in his views of affairs. and it was needless to be in doubt as to his position upon any public question. He was frank in all that he did. He was faithful in every sphere of life. public as well as private. and whether as soldier or as civilian fidelity to his duty always characterized his conduct. He was a patriot in the best and broadest sense of that term. intensely loyal to his country. He loved the Republic because it meant a sovereignty under organized law. able and ready to give back to its citizens a full return for all services demanded of them-\" a republic with iron in its blood.\" He loved his country for its devotion to human rights and its adherence to every pledge of public faith. and he gloried in its onward march of freedom and in its progressive spirit. He had unlimited faith in its imperishable vitality. power. and purpose to protect and rule the American Continent. Mr. Speaker. our friend ives in all that is deathless. the physical body is laid away under the sod of the valley. but those qualities of soul which manifested themselves in devotion to God and country. in kindness and love to neighbors and friends. and in fidelity to truth and honesty of purpose in life. will bear his memory upon the bosom of everlasting remembrance. There is so much to be said that is good of him. and with such justice. that I feel entirely free to say that I do not wish to be understood as claiming that he was a perfect man. Being only mortal. he had. like all of us. many faults. toward which he was even more severe than his most censorious critic. but when we think of the superabundanceof his many virtues. all else melts away into insignificance. It is also to be said that there was a sad minor strain of sorrow running through his life which brought to him a degree of suffering that at times gave his face that tenderly pathetic look which is born of irremediable heartache. but he complained not. and bore his cross manfully. Truly. in thie. it must be admitted. there was after all nothing so very exceptional. for where is the life that is ideal. or in which the stream of happiness or even of satisfaction flows smoothly without the murmering rapids or even the thundering cataract at some point? And here. not alone in contemplation of the facts in the life of Captain DANFORD. but referring to what I am sure is the too common experience of most mortals as to the painful contrast between the prospect and the retrospect of this life. I will venture to recall a vivid word picture by an eloquent tongue. in which there is very much of consolation to soften its somber shadows. He says: The loves and friendships of individuals partaking of the frail character of human life are brief and uncertain. The experiences of human life may be shortly summed up: A little loving and a good deal of sorrowing. some bright hopes and many bitter disappointments. some gorgeous Thursdays. when the skies are bright and the heavens blue. when Providence. bending over us in blessing. glads the heart almost to madness. many dismal Fridays. when the smoke of torment beclouds the mind and undying sorrows gnaw upon the heart. some high ambitions and many Waterloo defeats. until the heart becomes like the charnel house. filled with dead affections. embalmed in holy but sorrowful memories. and then the cord is loosened. the golden bowl is broken. the individual lifea cloud. a vaporpasseth away. As Captain DANFORD sank into his last sleep some one inquired as to his comfort. and he replied. \"All is well.\" Let us believe that at the dawning of the morning in the New Jerusalem he found a richer. fuller realization of his words than earth could give and was able to say. with Longfellow: There is no deathl What seems so is transition. This life of mortal breath Is but a suburb of the life elysian. Whose portal we call Death."}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
