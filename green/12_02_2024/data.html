I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Speaker. today. under President Bidens leadership. the SBIC program is making historic investments. In fiscal year 2023. the SBIC program provided a record-high $8 billion in investment and collectively financed more than 1.200 small businesses and startups resulting in over 130.000 jobs. H.R. 5333 will build on this monumental success and unleash even further investment in Americas small firms. Innovation is the cornerstone of economic growth and U.S. global competitiveness. Most often. the most innovative and disruptive R&amp.D is happening in our small business community. H.R. 5333 will encourage more SBIC investment in small businesses operating in our innovative sector and in rural and underserved areas all over the country. Mr. Speaker. I. again. thank Representatives Scholten and Meuser for leading this effort. I encourage Members to vote yes. and I yield back the balance of my time. {time"},{"1":"2023","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Madam President. public reports indicate that the armed forces of Ukraine have begun their long-planned counteroffensive in earnest. Having blunted Putins unprovoked escalation last year. Ukraine is aiming to drive Russian forces back and out of occupied Ukrainian territory on multiple fronts. Reaching this point in the conflict is. of course. due in large measure to the heroism of the brave Ukrainians defending their homeland. but their success is also--also--a credit to the tangible support of the United States. NATO allies. and friends around the globe who value the same sovereignty and territorial integrity which is under attack in Ukraine. The acute threat of Russian aggression helped wake many of our European friends from a holiday from history. Putins escalation drove many of our closest allies to start investing more seriously in their own defense and contribute more readily to collective security. This is. of course. a positive development and a critical one as we look toward deterring aggression from China. At the same time. Americas support for Ukraine has done much more than sustain their defense. As I have said repeatedly. sending lethal Western capabilities to the frontlines has been a direct investment in our own security in a number of concrete ways. First. equipping our friends on the frontlines to defend themselves is a far. far cheaper way. in both dollars and American lives. to degrade Russias ability to threaten the United States. Second. Ukraines effective defense of its territory is teaching us lessons about how to improve the defenses of partners who are threatened by China. It is no surprise that senior officials from Taiwan are so supportive of efforts to help Ukraine defeat Russia. Third. most of the money that has been appropriated for Ukraines security assistance doesnt actually go to Ukraine. it gets invested in American defense manufacturing. It funds new weapons and munitions for U.S. Armed Forces to replace the older materiel we have provided to Ukraine. So let me be clear: This assistance means more jobs for American workers and newer weapons for American servicemembers. I know that media reports about U.S. assistance to Ukraine have been really quite confusing--so has the Biden administrations messaging. Last week. for example. the administration announced what it called a new package of security assistance to Ukraine. In reality. this is the latest tranche of assistance. It is not a new appropriation. It is just the latest in a slow and steady disbursement--perhaps too slow and too steady--of assistance previously approved by an overwhelming bipartisan majority in Congress. I will have more to say as Ukraine continues to push Vladimir Putins forces backward. and Senate Republicans will continue our efforts to invest in Americas own national security."},{"1":"2022","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Madam President. the U.S. Postal Service is in dire trouble. The Government Accountability Office has listed its financial viability as high risk. and it has been in that status since 2009. From 2007 until 2020. the Postal Service had losses of $86 billion and over $188 billion in unfunded liabilities and debt. From October to December of last year alone--just a few months--it lost $1.3 billion. I think it is a mistake to rush postal reform now. when Congress should instead debate and consider the countrys response to and role in the Ukraine-Russia situation. We could be responding to skyrocketing energy prices. Nevertheless. I do very much support dealing with the post office and reforming the post office. We have to do this. Unfortunately. this bill falls far short in much more than just its timing. It does nearly nothing to make the Postal Service solvent. I have offered 12 amendments. Sadly. my efforts. along with those of my Republican colleagues. have been blocked. But I cant just step aside without trying to make the bill better. Today. I would like to briefly speak about just 2 of the 12 amendments I have filed. just two of them in particular. and ask that they be called up and voted on. The first strikes a provision in the bill that would require the Postal Service to maintain an integrated network for the delivery of postal products and would require the disclosure of the rates that the USPS charges private companies for the last mile delivery of packages. The term integrated network isnt defined in the bill. and it could be easily used to bundle or combine expenses. which would in turn allow the USPS to further disguise serious costs and make a proper accounting of certain products difficult or even impossible. The simple idea of an integrated delivery network may seem benign--and the term itself sounds friendly enough--but words do matter. Words in context and their meaning. these are things that matter. This particular legislative text with no clear definition is ripe for abuse. Because the Postal Service is required to deliver to every American. even on unprofitable routes. the Postal Service may be charging lower than market rates in its service contracts with private companies. This may not only shortchange the Postal Service. making further taxpayer bailouts likely. but it could also distort competition in the package delivery market. The American public deserves a proper accounting of Postal Service rates. and my amendment will ensure this disclosure is provided in a fully transparent manner. My second amendment prohibits the Postal Service from shipping any abortion inducing drug. Chemical abortions have four times the complication rate of surgical abortions and are far more likely to send women to the emergency room. Unfortunately. in December of 2021--just a few months ago--the Food and Drug Administration permanently rescinded a longstanding regulation that required healthcare professionals to dispense chemical abortion pills to patients in person. allowing them to be sent through the mail without even basic precautions to protect the life and health of the mother. Not only does this policy change threaten the lives and the health of women. but it raises the disturbing possibility that perpetrators of sexual abuse may be further enabled to hide their crimes from legal authorities and health professionals through mail-order abortion. Furthermore. because taxpayer dollars--particularly. over the last few years--have funded the Postal Services operations. American taxpayer resources are funding abortion and putting women at risk. Congress must put an end to this and exercise its authority to ensure that the U.S. Government does not encourage or facilitate the use of these dangerous and lethal abortion drugs. I also support the efforts of my many colleagues. Senator Scotts amendment would alleviate some of the financial burdens that this bill would impose on taxpayers and the Medicare Program by forcing the Postal Service to reimburse Medicare for all of the additional costs that would be created by requiring future postal retirees to enroll in Medicare. Congress and the Postal Service have historically made bad policy and business decisions. and now. instead of fixing those or otherwise meaningfully addressing them. it is simply shifting millions of workers from coverage historically provided by an independent Federal Agency onto taxpayers more broadly. The Postal Service and the American people deserve a thoughtful bill. one that reforms its key challenges. setting the Agency up for long- term success. But without any amendments to change the trajectory. this bill only kicks the can down the road without making the serious changes that are needed today. Madam President. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call up my amendment No. 4936. Further. I ask that the amendment be reported by number. that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided on the amendment. and that the Senate then vote on adoption of the amendment with no intervening action or debate."},{"1":"2021","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. we know that some of our biggest competitors around the world spend billions in propping up state-owned enterprises and investing in research and development. They have also gotten pretty good at taking our ideas. monetizing them. and using them to compete--and sometimes cheat--against American businesses while paying their workers less and giving those workers fewer protections and rights. China is often the worst offender. Ohio workers know all too well what happens to their jobs and their communities when they are forced to compete with Chinese companies that break the rules. pay poverty wages. and are propped up by the government. We are working to change that this week I want the technologies that will drive the next generation of U.S. economic growth and manufacturing--from semiconductors to hydrogen buses to the next-generation jet engine--to be developed in America and to put people to work in good-paying jobs in our country. This is something we should all agree on. It is what we are working to do with this comprehensive. bipartisan bill. This package is packed with investment in research and development. technology. and high-tech domestic manufacturing that will again set us up to lead the world. It supports American manufacturing and innovation. It gives businesses the tools to compete. It supports American workers--the engine behind our success. It includes my Build America. Buy America Act to strengthen our Buy American rules and ensure that American tax dollars go towards American-made products that create American jobs. This provision is the result of bipartisan partnership. I would like to thank my colleague from my State. Senator Portman. and also Senators Peters and Stabenow from Michigan. Senator Baldwin from Wisconsin. and Senator Braun from Indiana for their work. Our legislation would apply Buy American rules to all taxpayer- funded infrastructure and public works projects. When we ensure our tax dollars are spent on American products. these tax dollars go further in the economy. We employ more workers who spend on local businesses and lift up everyone. When we say Buy American. we mean Buy American--not import a steel slab from China. make it into a pipe. and stamp on it Made in America. We need to make sure these rules are thorough. tough. and effective. That is exactly what this provision does. This bill also gives our country tough new tools to crack down on Chinas cheating. Banking and Housing Committee Ranking Member Toomey and I worked together on an amendment to take on Chinese espionage against our economy. The amendment is the product of months of bipartisan negotiation. I thank Senator Toomey and his bipartisan staff. The Presiding Officer. Senator Ossoff. is a new member of that committee and has contributed greatly on this and other projects we have done. Our plan directly confronts action by the Chinese Government and Chinese firms that hurt American workers and companies by stealing their valuable intellectual property. These measures were developed by Senator Van Hollen. They require mandatory imposition of powerful new sanctions on Chinese actors who steal U.S. trade secrets. The United States remains a global center for research. development. and innovation. and for years. people have been stealing our ideas. China is the worst offender. we know that. The Chinese Government and the companies it props up engage in systematic and growing espionage against our businesses and our workers. The theft of trade secrets costs the United States as much as $540 billion every year. Our plan would give the President new tools to go after Chinese actors who target our country with cyber attacks. Americans have all seen over the past few weeks how serious cyber attacks are. how they can disrupt our entire economy. We need strong tools to punish these attackers and the countries that finance and support them. Sanctions are just one new tool this package includes to increase American competitiveness. We will build on the success of our bipartisan Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act to create more manufacturing innovation hubs around the country. Back in 2014. I worked with Republican Senator Roy Blunt and the Obama administration to pass the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act. This landmark bill created a national network of advanced manufacturing hubs. It was one of the biggest steps we had taken as a country in a long time to make our manufacturing more competitive. America Makes in Youngstown--the first of its kind. the first in this program--started as a pilot program back 9 years ago. It became the first hub in that network. I thank my colleagues for their work on this. I thank especially two members of my staff who are on the floor today. Abigail Duggan and Megan Malara. for the work they have done. I thank my colleagues for moving forward on this very important act. I yield the floor."},{"1":"2020","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Madam Speaker. the legislation also authorizes targeted sanctions on any person responsible for labor tracking. protects U.S. investors and consumers by requiring financial disclosure from U.S. traded businesses about their engagement with Chinese companies and other entities engaged in serious human rights abuses. directs the Secretary of State to determine whether forced labor or other crimes against Uyghurs constitute crimes against humanity or genocide. I think it couldnt be clear. Read the Genocide Convention. One item after the other articulated in that convention is being met. sadly. by Xi Jinpings horrible genocide against his own people. Madam Speaker. I urge support for the bill. It is a bipartisan bill-- 67 cosponsors in all. Republicans and Democrats joined saying. we want this stopped."},{"1":"2019","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I would just encourage those talks to move as quickly as they can. because as we share the interest of making sure that not only do we have better agreements. which this USMCA deal that was negotiated with Mexico and Canada does have better provisions for the United States. we need to make sure that there is proper enforcement. because if somebody doesnt follow through. then we need to make sure we can hold them accountable. While I am confident that there are already enforcement provisions in the agreement. if they can be made stronger. I know Ambassador Lighthizer is working to find a way to do that. but also in a way that doesnt start the whole process over. where we dont have to open the entire agreement up and then Mexico. which has already ratified it. would have to go back. Canada stands waiting to move on it as well. but right now. we are the holdup. There are a lot of jobs at stake. over 160.000 jobs. Our farmers are counting on this. So many other manufacturing sectors in our economy are counting on this. So. hopefully. we can move quickly to work through these and then ultimately get it passed and move to the next countries that want to enter into agreements with the United States. and ultimately to confront China. to resolve the differences that we are having with China. But I know the gentleman is working on his side. And. again. I would just encourage that we do that as quickly as possible and expedite it and then get it passed. but we will continue working on that. Something else we would like to work on in a more bipartisan way is drug pricing. The President has been very clear that he wants a bipartisan bill that is worked out here in Congress to lower drug prices. There have been many efforts made and. in fact. positive steps taken by the Energy and Commerce Committee to pass a package of bills out of committee unanimously to lower drug prices. Unfortunately. the Speaker took a different turn and. yesterday. had a press conference and then ultimately filed a bill last night. H.R. 3. which was written in secret. Many Democrats dont even know what is in it. But no Republicans were consulted and involved in the process. and it ended up becoming a very partisan bill. much to the socialist left. which wouldnt solve the problem and. more importantly. wouldnt get to the Presidents desk because it is not an effort that involved any bipartisan cooperation. Again. I point out there was a package of bills that passed unanimously out of Energy and Commerce that would lower drug prices. Both parties agreed. Every single member on the Energy and Commerce Committee agreed. Unfortunately. that was shelved in lieu of this partisan approach. I would hope that we take it more seriously than that and actually work together to get a bill that the President can sign to lower drug prices as quickly as possible. The approach that was taken yesterday does not answer this call. and I would hope we would do better. Mr. Speaker. I yield to the gentleman."},{"1":"2018","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Speaker. today marks the 350th anniversary of the founding of my hometown. Glen Cove. New York. on May 24. 1668. Earlier this year. we also celebrated the 100th anniversary of Glen Coves designation as a city. I love Glen Cove. I served as the citys mayor from 1994 to 2001. My father. Joseph. an Italian immigrant and an American success story. was the first Suozzi to serve as mayor from 1956 to 1960. My uncle. Vincent. also known as Jimmy Suozzi. was the second. He served from 1973 to 1979 and again from 1984 to 1987. The most recent Suozzi to serve as mayor. my cousin Ralph served from 2006 to 2013. In fact. in the 100 years since Glen Cove became a city. a Suozzi has served as mayor for 32 years. We Suozzis have devoted a great deal of our lives to serving the city we love. and we have been repaid with the satisfaction of knowing our friends. neighbors. and family will continue to strive to work to ensure our best days are still yet to come. Glen Cove was the first industrial center of Long Island. The Carpenter. Simkin. and Cole families purchased over 2.000 acres of waterfront property overlooking Hempstead Harbor and the Long Island Sound from the Native American Matinecock Tribe. { There they built a lumber mill and a gristmill powered by the fresh water of Glen Cove Creek. Originally named Musketa Cove. which means a place of rushes in the Matinecock language. Musketa Cove went on to become one of the top four ports for smuggling on Long Island. as no one wanted to pay the English taxes on brandy. rum. and wine. The area grew with professional craftsmen. weavers. carpenters. wool spinners. tailors. millers. and shipbuilders. Corn farming developed in the surrounding area. A second major industry began in the early 1800s when Dr. Thomas Garvie discovered massive clay deposits and began to mine and ship the clay to potteries in New York City and elsewhere on Long Island. Dr. Garvie also began a daily steamship operation between Glen Cove and New York City that began to attract residents looking to escape the citys sweltering summer heat. Tourism-minded residents started to worry that the name Musketa Cove sounded too much like mosquito cove. and. in 1834. they changed the name to Glen Cove. It worked. By the mid-1850s tourism was booming with daily steamship operations. leading to the development of six major hotels. taverns. and boarding houses. A new industry emerged. The Duryea Starch factory took advantage of the fresh water. the gristmills. and the plentiful corn and became one of the worlds largest starch factories. In fact. in 1878. Duryea won the Paris Gold Medal for the best starch in the world. Industry flourished. tourism flourished. and Glen Cove began to attract more attention. In the early 1900s. some of the wealthiest families in the world made Glen Cove their home. J. P. Morgan. the wealthy financier. who bailed out the U.S. Government. F. W. Woolworth. the founder of the original five-and-dime department store. whose marketing began the commercialization of Christmas gift giving. and the Pratt family. who amassed their fortune by controlling the kerosene market and. ultimately. merging with John D. Rockefeller to form Standard Oil. all built their massive summer estates in Glen Cove. leading to the moniker of the Gold Coast. Between the industries that flourished on the waterfront and the Town &amp. Country magazine rated Gold Coast estates. Glen Cove with its vibrant downtown of merchants was booming. Immigrants from all over the world and America flocked to the area to work at the starch factory. or the Ladew Leatherworks that tanned hides to be used for industrial belts. Immigrants like my grandfather and father from Italy. and others from Ireland. Poland. Germany. and elsewhere. worked not only in the factories. but in the gardens. kitchens. pantries. and garages of the Gold Coast estates. African Americans from the South migrated to the area and found work. many as experts training and caring for thoroughbreds and polo ponies. Around 1917. Glen Cove residents. who saw the economic vibrancy from the estates. the factories. and the vibrant downtown. populated by Jewish. Italian. and English merchants. no longer wished to share their plentiful property and sales tax dollars with the town of Oyster Bay. under whose jurisdiction Glen Cove existed as a village. Community leaders worked with the State legislature and the Governor to break off and become Long Islands first city. Glen Cove has traveled a long journey. Its population exploded. as did much of Long Island. with veterans returning from World War II. Its industrial vibrancy. which went on to include Li Tungsten. a munitions factory. Mattiace Petrochemical. Columbia Ribbon and Carbon. Powers Chemco. Konica. and Photocircuits. a circuit board manufacturer. all left behind a negative environmental legacy that the City has now cleaned up as it moves forward to a new age of development and waterfront revitalization. With hundreds of acres of publically-owned nature preserves. three public beaches. golf courses. a fishing pier. and multiple ballfields and parks. Glen Cove has been restored to a waterfront community with a short commute to Manhattan that once attracted some of the wealthiest families in the world. Unlike much of Long Island. that is either all rich or all poor. or all Black or all White. or all this or all that. Glen Cove remains a diverse community with the wealthiest of the wealthy and a large supply of low-income housing that is anchored by a solid middle class. It is home to over 60 ethnicities: two Catholic churches. two Baptist churches. two Jewish synagogues. It also has houses of worship for African Methodist Episcopalians. Lutherans. Methodists. Episcopalians. and Evangelicals. The Presbyterian church is one of the most beautiful architectural marvels of the City. Glen Cove is also home to a Russian Orthodox church. a Sikh gurdwara. Jehovahs Witnesses. and several Latino churches. Many movies. television shows. and commercials have been filmed in Glen Cove. including Alfred Hitchcocks North by Northwest. starring Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. and Sabrina. starring Audrey Hepburn. William Holden. and Humphrey Bogart. In fact. as mayor. I met Harrison Ford while filming the remake of Sabrina with Julia Ormond and Greg Kinnear. I met Michael Douglas while filming A Perfect Murder. and told him how his dad. Kirk Douglas. had filmed A Lovely Way to Die in the 1960s in Glen Cove. A former Pratt estate. now the Webb Institute of Naval Architecture. was stately Wayne Manor in Batman Forever. A host of other movies. such as Annie Hall. Hair. Eyes Wide Shut. and one obscure favorite. A New Leaf. were all filmed in Glen Cove as well. Famous historical figures called Glen Cove home. Bobby Kennedy resided in Glen Cove when he ran for United States Senator of New York. Jackie Kennedy called West Island home after the President had been shot. The first female congresswoman from New York was Ruth Baker Pratt. Baseball legends. including Roy Campanella. Whitey Ford and. more recently. Yoenis Cespedes of the New York Mets. Billy Joel spent a short time in Glen Cove. And Ashanti grew up in Glen Cove--I attended her sweet 16 birthday party--while many other artists record here regularly at Cove City Sound Studios. And Sergeant Major Dan Daly. a marine. is one of only 19 men in U.S. history. in our entire Nation. to have received the Medal of Honor. twice. Many of the old estates have been repurposed. including Killenworth. a former Pratt estate that served as the home of the Soviet Ambassador of the United Nations. and still serves the Russian Ambassador. Nikita Khrushchev visited the estate after pounding his shoe on the lectern at the United Nations back in the 1960s. Welwyn. another former Pratt estate. is a 200-acre nature preserve and serves as the Nassau County Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center. Not every Glen Cover has a boldface name. but every Glen Cove resident contributes in their own unique way to the community: the first responders. the business owners. and the volunteers. the elected officials. city employees. the coaches. and the moms and dads. the teachers. preachers. and the gadflies that show up at the city council meetings. the world-class restauranteurs and bakers. the multigenerational shop owners. and the too many to mention fraternal and service organizations. Glen Cove is alive and will continue long after these words are forgotten. As I said. I love Glen Cove and Glen Cove is why I love America. It has diversity. It has history. And it has wonderful people. Glen Cove has offered opportunity to so many families. including mine. It is what makes America great. E pluribus unum. out of many one. Glen Cove has every type of ethnicity. religion. and income group. It enjoys low crime. low unemployment. and a robust community life. It works and it will continue to work. Happy anniversary and congratulations to my friends and neighbors. God bless our warm city with the cool sound. and God bless the United States of America. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time."},{"1":"2017","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I thank the gentleman and both my colleagues. though I respectfully disagree that this Congress has placed any priority on helping get people out of poverty. Indeed. when it comes to poverty in America. this Congress has largely been silent. I think the Congress itself is impoverished when it comes to ideas about how to lift people up into the middle class. We talk here so much about the middle class. and appropriately so. but there are millions of people out there who are struggling to just climb up that first or second rung of the economic ladder and work themselves into the middle class. and this Congress is doing little. constructively. to assist them. The need for real and meaningful change is particularly evident in my home State of Texas. where the State legislature has been so incredibly indifferent to this problem. There. one out of every four children is below the poverty level. and over one-third of all Texans live in the shadow of poverty. meaning that their income is less than twice the poverty threshold. The Corporation for Enterprise Development ranked Texas near the bottom among all States on key measures related to financial security. Now. here is what todays bipartisan bill does to respond to that. and it is really a story of the number one. Of the several Republican proposals that were originally advanced by now-Speaker Paul Ryan two years ago. some introduced by Republican colleagues and some containing good ideas. this is the one last bill standing. With the notable exception of a budget that is devastating to opportunities for poor Americans. this is the one and only bill on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. previously known as welfare. that Republicans will even permit us to discuss on the floor of this House. This one very modest bill does not add one new dollar to address the challenges that those who want to rise from welfare to work need. It simply segregates $100 million from an existing fund for one year. Now. get this: the fund from which they are segregating the $100 million from. Donald Trump is seeking to abolish the entire fund so that no moneys for this proposal will be available after one year. This bill gives the States no new flexibility. and no new authority. It does not authorize them to do anything that they cannot do today. Indeed. some States--and I think my colleague from Illinois referenced one of these--are already finding ways to. in appropriate situations. subsidize employment. What this bill does is to say that on this particular $100 million fund. as long as it lasts. until President Trump eliminates it entirely. that the States must use the money in a particular way. In other words. it seeks to restrict the States who receive these moneys to require them to use it for one particular way to assist those who are in poverty. It is also significant that the Trump budget cuts are so far-reaching in trying to undermine efforts to raise people out of poverty. and for those who are not able-bodied. to provide them the support that they need. This bill deals with a little less than one-half of one percent of the Trump budget cuts. I believe. sincerely. that we need a better approach. that we have ideas on both sides of the aisle that are being blocked by a determination to not address root causes of poverty. First. we should support initiatives that strike at the early seeds of poverty. like the Home Visiting Program that will expire in a mere three months. which helps to improve opportunities for at-risk children and helps their parents be the parents they want to be. and certainly. early childhood education is a key part of that. Second. we should increase efforts to help people gain the skills they need to secure jobs through which they can support their families at a living wage. and that is the challenge here. Sure. some employers will love to have taxpayers subsidize their workforce. pay part of the wages that they would otherwise have to pay. and sometimes this is a valuable support. particularly for people that are reentering our society after incarceration and other groups of particularly hard-to- place employees. But for many folks. the big question is. when the subsidy ends. when the taxpayer stops paying. will there be a job there? Is there a job ladder that will allow that person to work themselves up. or are they essentially participating in minimum wage employment that will not support their family and will not provide them a future? There are in-demand skills-training programs that do work and do offer an alternative. but they are not free. They take an investment. An example is Project QUEST in San Antonio."},{"1":"2016","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I would like to once again rise to address the water crises that are facing not just California. but our Nation and throughout the world. Today. global communities and business organizations have joined together. and the White House is holding a water summit to raise awareness of the 650 million people around the world who dont have access to safe drinking water. urging leaders to focus on ways in which we can increase access to safe. sanitary water. This is appropriate. but it is long overdue. On the Web site. waterday.us. it states: Water stress is the impact a lack of water has on a particular sector or population. Water stress affects nutrition. public health. environmental services. housing and urban growth. and national security. { And national security is directly related to our ability to grow food to ensure that American consumers are independent and have sufficient nutrition for their daily consumption. Water. therefore. is a resource issue of the future not only for our Nation. but throughout the world. These impacts of not having a reliable and safe water supply are all too familiar for those of us who live in the San Joaquin Valley in California and my colleagues who represent that area. So while I believe it is fitting and appropriate that we recognize that there is a nationwide and worldwide issue regarding our water resources and how we manage them--with the planet having 7 billion people last year and by the middle of this century another 2 billion. or 9 billion people--we need to look at both short-term and long-term comprehensive solutions to our water needs not just throughout the world. but here in the United States. specifically. in California. So I find it extremely disappointing that Californias San Joaquin Valley is not at the forefront of this discussion after 4 years of devastating drought. While I empathize with those in Flint. Michigan. and other areas of the country. like those of us in the San Joaquin Valley. we have been facing water shortages for 4 years. it is getting much worse. and there is less national attention being focused on our plight. In the valley. instead of lead poisoning due to the failure of all levels of government. as we have seen in Flint. Michigan. we are dealing with waters that have high nitrate levels in drinking water. In addition to that. in many places. we dont have access to water at all. The solutions are clear. We need to increase Federal funding for infrastructure to build resiliency during drought periods and reduce the impacts of water quality using all the water tools in our water toolbox. We need to increase coordination between local. State. and Federal agencies to reduce the impacts of communities impaired by water quality or a lack of access to water. Finally. we need to increase our focus on ensuring that regulations. where they are in place. achieve their intended purpose while minimizing negative impacts that they have with contradictory results. For instance. due to the decisions made by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. the Bureau of Reclamation is required to operate pumps in Californias water system under what I believe are scientifically flawed provisions. biological opinions. which have lost. as a result. hundreds of thousands of acre-feet of water. This year. if the Federal agencies had operated within the flexibility provided even in those flawed biological opinions. San Joaquin Valley communities could have been provided an additional 2- to 300.000 acre-feet of additional water. In addition to that. that would have benefited over 400.000 households. As a result of the drought and the inability to capture water that is flowing in the system. over 600.000 acres of prime productive agricultural land have gone unplanted. and we have seen families impacted. Families that literally do not have access to water have had to bottle in water. There is a very certain human toll--the impact--that is taking place to provide highly uncertain benefits for species. This is unacceptable. it is avoidable. and it is immoral. I urge the Federal agencies to take action to do experimental increases in pumping with increased detection and monitoring so we can find out if. in fact. delta smelt and salmon traveling through the delta are even being harmed by the exact pumping levels under discussion. So while I appreciate the comprehensive plan the administration is trying to implement to solve our Nations water crisis. we need short- term solutions now so that farmers. farm workers. and farming communities in the San Joaquin Valley do not go without a water supply under the Federal project for a third year in a row. Additionally. we must do everything possible to get Federal legislation passed and signed into law that would not only deal with our short-term needs. but to deal with our long-term needs as well. We passed the House bill last year. We need to get Senator Feinsteins bill passed so we can go to conference because. if the Federal agencies dont act--and they have not been doing the job that I would like to see them do--then Congress must act."},{"1":"2015","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. A lot of discussion. passionate discussion about jobs tonight. But I would point out to my Democratic colleagues on the other side of the aisle. where was this passion when ObamaCare was passed? The Congressional Budget Office says that it is going to cost this economy 2.5 million fewer jobs. Where was this passion when H.R. 30 came to the floor that would repeal this 30-hour definition of full-time employee? According to one study. 2.6 million Americans making under $30.000 are at risk of having their hours cut due to the ObamaCare 30-hour rule. Where was the passion on the other side of the aisle when H.R. 351. the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. came? That is estimated to put up to 45.000 unemployed Americans back to work on liquid natural gas export projects. Where was the passion when S. 1 came. the Keystone XL pipeline? The State Departments environmental impact statement said: During construction. proposed project spending would support approximately 42.100 jobs. But we didnt hear much from our friends on the other side of the aisle when this was going on. { But. again. I think. too often. my friends on the other side of the aisle are always happy to subsidize what they can regulate and control. I would say to my friends on my side of the aisle that I respect your opinion. and I hope you respect mine. but I think there is a better way to promote exports. I think there is a better way to promote jobs. It has everything to do with regulatory reform. It has to do with the REINS Act. It has everything to do with fundamental tax reform. which. according to the National Association of Manufacturers. is half of our competitive disadvantage. It has everything to do with litigation reform. We have greater remedial costs than do our green energy European competitors. There is a better way. and there is a more fair way to come to this floor. As for whatever you think of the process of the Financial Services Committee. if this is going to come to the floor. every Member ought to be allowed to have an amendment. and we should reject this discharge petition. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time."},{"1":"2014","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I rise today to speak in support of Project Labor Agreements. As the House begins consideration of the annual Department of Veterans AffairsMilitary Construction Appropriations bill later today. I urge my colleagues to continue to support Project Labor Agreements. We have a great example of just how effective and efficient PLA projects can be with the Navys largest ongoing military construction projectthe construction for the second Explosives Handling Wharf at Naval Base Kitsap. The Explosive Handling Wharf is a critical component of our Nations nuclear deterrent capability. The use of a PLA at a site of this significance is telling. The Navy recently shared with me that: To date. the PLA has performed its primary function by ensuring no labor disputes interfered with the progress of work on the project and that the project is on schedule and the PLA is operating as intended. Mr. Chairman. why would we remove such a useful tool for military construction. especially at a time when budgets are tight and milestones are tighter? Lets stay on the path to success and maintain the continued use of Project Labor Agreements. I yield back the balance of my time."},{"1":"2013","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Madam President. there has been a complete abdication of fiscal responsibility in Congress. particularly in the Senate. for the last 4 years. in that there has been no budget passed in this Senate for that period of time. What better manifestation. what uglier manifestation of that fiscal irresponsibility than the $16.5 trillion in debt. Another symptom of that problem is the fact that in addition to the Senate not passing a budget for the last 4 years. in 4 out of the last 5 years. the President of the United States has missed the statutory deadline on submitting his proposed budget to the Senate for consideration and to the Congress. Really. when we are talking about budgeting. the House is going to pass a budget that limits the rate of growth of Federal spending from 5.4 percent to 3.4 percent. It limits the rate of growth. Now. most of America would not call that a cut. But for some reason that is called a cut in Washington. What I would call that is a limitation on the rate of growth of Federal spending. It is important we get the Presidents proposed budget. as required by the law. The law requires the President to send his proposed budget to the Congress by the first Monday in February. He has not done so. and we have been advised that we probably will not even see the Presidents proposed budget until our work here is done. I do not know what the President could do that would render himself any more irrelevant to this important process than not contribute his proposed budget on a timely basis. as required by the law. Because the President has not complied with the law. I am going to offer an amendment to this budget resolution called the No Budget No OMB Pay Act of 2013. OMB. of course. stands for the Office of Management and Budget. the executive branch agency responsible for preparing the Presidents proposed budget. The No Budget No OMB Pay Act would prohibit paying the salaries of the Office of Management and Budget Director. the Deputy Director. and the Deputy Director for Management for any period of time that the President is late in meeting the statutory requirement to submit his budget. as I said. by the first Monday in February. I have also filed an amendment to the budget that would allow the Senate to express its support for this legislation. It is certainly progress that now. after 4 years. Senator REID has seen fit to bring a budget to the floor. That is his prerogative as the majority leader. something we in the minority have no authority to do. But it represents progresssome small progressthat Senator REID has finally decided to bring a budget to the floor and that the Senate is now able to amend and debate that budget resolution. As you have heard. the proposed budget that has come from the Budget Committee. Senator MURRAYS budget. raises taxes by $1.5 trillion and increases spending by 62 percent. What is worse. it actually fails to balance within 10 years. which is the budget window. Equally as unfortunate. for the first time in recent memory. is that the Congress is acting before receiving the Presidents proposed budget. According to the National Journal. this marks an unprecedented break of 92 years of tradition in having the President make the first move in the budget process. This is called leadership. Current law requires the President to send his budget by the first Monday of February. which I have said. President Obama has ignored this requirement. He has missed the deadline 4 out of 5 years he has been President of the United States. This year he was required to issue the budget proposal on February 4. but he missed the deadline once again. While the Senate is acting this week. it has been 45 days since the President has failed to live up to the legal commitment for the President to submit his proposed budget. We all know nowhere else in America. whether in private life. private business. or in local or State government. can you fail to do your job and still be paidonly here in Washington. DC. We know it is important the President and the executive branch live up to their responsibilities. just as it is important we do so ourselves. If the Office of Management and Budget does not do its job and produce a budget. its top official should not be paid. Based on legislation we have already passed. both the legislative branch and now. if my budget amendment passes and if Congress embraces this requirement. both executive and legislative branches share responsibility when it comes to the budget. Without us doing our jobs and the President doing his job. spending will remain out of control. We all deserve better and the American people deserve better. They deserve the accountability which comes from the President fulfilling his legal responsibilities under the law of the land. I yield the floor."},{"1":"2012","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I very much thank the gentleman from Colorado. I appreciate you holding this very important leadership hour tonight. And. of course. Mr. Speaker. I rise today to express my extreme disappointment over President Obamas decision to block the Keystone pipeline by rejecting an application to build and operate the oil pipeline across the U.S. and Canada border. I think every American should be aware of the consequences. More than 100.000 jobs could be created over the life of the project. including an estimated 20.000 immediate American jobs in construction and manufacturing. Oil accounts for 37 percent of U.S. energy demand with 71 percent directed to fuels used in transportation. That is equally true of a mother who drives her children to school as it is the businessowner who operates a fleet of delivery vehicles. When the price of gasoline increases. Americans hurt. And the price of gasoline increased 81 cents per gallon in 2011 alone. I support an alloftheabove approach to energy. which includes opening up new areas for American energy exploration. transitioning to renewable and alternative energy. and using more clean and reliable nuclear power. In his State of the Union address. the President stated. This country needs an all out. alloftheabove strategy that develops every available source of American energy. a strategy thats cleaner. cheaper and full of new jobs. In my opinion. his decision on the Keystone pipeline is blatantly inconsistent with this very statement. The door is now open for this Canadian oil to go to China. Canadas Prime Minister announced his profound disappointment with the news. While the Chinese Government has ensured its future supply of oil and other energy resources. the United States has rejected a new source of energy that was laid at our doorstep. Mr. Speaker. I ask. how does the fact that China could receive this energy supply not serve our national interests? Mr. Speaker. I consider President Obamas decision a grave mistake. And on behalf of the American people who want secure oil and new manufacturing jobs. I hope that the Congress will continue to push him to reconsider this error in judgment. Again. thank you to my friend from Colorado for holding this important hour tonight on this very important topic to the American people for job creation."},{"1":"2011","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. last week we celebrated Thanksgiving. the time of year when we look back and we give thanks for our blessings. We are all grateful for our family. our men and women in uniform. and those who also defend our Nation in civilian life. I am particularly thankful this year. because 1 year ago today I had the honor of my life to be sworn in as the newest junior Senator for the State of Illinois to complete Senator Obamas term. And what a year it has been. Coming from the House of Representatives. I had to adjust to the measured place and pace of the Senate. But while Americans may have a dim view of what we do here. I remain an optimist. Americans have always faced tough challenges but then rose to the occasion more successfully than any other people in history. Although I believe there is much more to do to reduce debt. repeal burdensome regulations. and encourage job creation. I want to take a few minutes to lay out what my team has accomplished for the State of Illinois and the Nation in 1 year. In my first 30 days in office we moved three times. we hired a staff. and then voted to prevent the largest tax increase in history. while Congress extended tax relief for millions of Americans in that legislation. We also worked to block the transfer of alQaida terrorists from Guantanamo Bay to northwestern Illinois. Since then. Congress enacted the Budget Control Act. mandating about $2 trillion in reduced Federal borrowing over the next 10 years. which in my view is only a first step in addressing Washingtons outofcontrol spending. No one here would say that we have come near to solving the problem. but I am heartened by the bipartisan and bicameral support of the Gang of Six proposal. and now with the probable support of 45 Republican and Democratic Senators. I hope we will soon go big with their recommendations to find $4 trillion in savings. The Congress approved three freetrade agreements to boost U.S. exports to South Korea. to Colombia. and Panama. as both President Obama and Speaker BOEHNER wanted. The action will open markets for Illinois farmers and boost exports for companies and employers such as John Deere in Moline. Caterpillar in Peoria. ADM in Decatur. and Navistar in suburban Warrenville. Congress repealed the onerous requirement mandated by the health care law that required small businesses to document all payments over a few hundred dollars. This absurd 1099 rule was the first part of the health care law to be repealed. and it will soon be followed by the misnamed CLASS Act that even the Obama administration appears to have canceled by executive action. Additionally. Congress reformed our patent system by moving to a firsttofile. instead of a first -toinvent. system. This signals to inventors that they should quickly file their invention and allows us to innovate without endless and expensive litigation. Along with that effort. the Kirk amendment authorizing the patent office to have a small business fast lane became law. My office published a Great Lakes report card that gave our largest body of fresh water a C grade to draw attention to invasive species. to poor water quality. and beach closures. demonstrating the need for our legislation by myself and Senator DURBIN to ban sewage dumping in the Great Lakes. To create more construction jobs in Illinois. I introduced the Lincoln Legacy Infrastructure Development Act which would unlock more than $100 billion in new revenue for roads. rail. transit. and airports. through more infrastructure funded by publicprivate partnerships. I have since met with Secretary LaHood. Chief of Staff Daley. and House Chairman MICA as a way to advance this legislation to restart our economy. We have also had an active year in protecting our allies and Americas interests overseas. On the floor today. we may consider the MenendezKirk amendment pending to the Defense Authorization Act which would impose crippling sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran. This is a result of a collaborative effort involving 92 Senators who signed the SchumerKirk letter calling for the United States to collapse Irans terrorsponsoring bank. In May. Senator GILLIBRAND and I introduced the Iran Human Rights and Democracy Promotion Act which establishes a special representative on human rights and democracy in Iran. imposing sanctions on companies that sell or service products that enable the Iranian regime to oppress its people. It would require a comprehensive strategy to promote Internet freedom in Iran and reauthorize the Iran Freedom Support Act. The bill is now part of the Iran. North Korea. and Syria Sanctions Consolidation Act. In February. the Senate passed a Kirk resolution condemning human rights abuses in Iran. and we founded the Iranian Dissident Awareness Program to make dissidents such as Hossein RonaghiMaleki. a blogger and human rights activist. and Nasrin Sotoudeh. a lawyer and human rights activist. household names now in America. We also fought for strict assurances that data collected from our new Xband radar in Turkey would be shared with our allies in Israel. In total. my office introduced 18 bills and resolutions and 11 amendments. We cosponsored 132 pieces of legislation. I am a member of four committees that have held more than 130 hearings and markups. This year we worked on the reform of No Child Left Behind. and those reforms passed the committee with bipartisan support. We also worked on legislation regarding flood insurance funding bills under the Appropriations Committee. Most Americans who watch cable news think all Democrats and all Republicans may hate each other. While Congress has grown more partisan. I am particularly proud of the bipartisan partnerships we have fostered in such a short time. I have continued a longstanding battle against the corrupt sugar program by working with Senator SHAHEEN of New Hampshire on S. 25 to Stop Unfair Giveaways and Restrictions Act. the SUGAR Act of 2011. which would eliminate sugar price supports and increased costs for consumers that destroy American manufacturing jobs. Senator WYDEN and I introduced legislation targeting more than $60 billion in Medicare fraud every year by issuing new identify theftproof medical ID cards. offering the same ID card protection our troops have for our seniors. I also joined Senator WYDEN in his efforts to ensure your constitutional rights are protected with regard to your GPS data and cell phone and other location information. Senator CASEY and I worked together on antibullying legislation to keep our kids safe at school. I joined Senator WHITEHOUSE in an effort to criminalize the pointing of lasers against civil aircraft to keep that industry safe. In my capacity as the top Republican member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee. we worked across the aisle with Chairman TIM JOHNSON to pass the first standalone appropriations bill out of the Senate since 2009. Since then. we have broken the logjam on appropriations bills. and I hope to quickly complete that legislation. I especially wish to recognize one of my first friends in the Senate. Senator JOE MANCHIN of West Virginia. for our collaborative effort on many issues. the latest being a bipartisan resolution calling for the Congress to go big on deficit reduction. When we first came to the Senate together. we saw that there were few opportunities for Republicans and Democrats to interact outside the Senate floor. That is why we began to have an open lunch together each Thursday instead of the regularly scheduled partisan lunches. to discuss ways to bridge the political divide in the Senate and in Washington. I also wish to highlight the partnership I have developed with my senior Senator from the State of Illinois. While we may not see eye to eye on many issues. Senator DURBIN and I have worked closely on a whole host of issues for Illinois. Following in the footsteps of the late Senator Paul Simon. Senator DURBIN and I have now held more than 25 joint constituent coffees here in Washington. It is like a townhall meeting. where we talk with Illinois families about what is going on at home and in the Congress. In March. Senator DURBIN and I worked with Secretary of Transportation Ray Lahood to help the city of Chicago. American. and United Airlines come to an agreement to keep the OHare Modernization Program moving forward. This is the single greatest job creation program in northern Illinois. and the agreement that we helped foster keeps thousands at work at OHare. We worked closely to bring highspeed rail to the State of Illinois. and together introduced legislation to expand charter schools. to improve access to EpiPens at schools for children with severe allergies. to ensure military families in North Chicago continue to receive their Federal education assistance. We fought to open a new Federal prison in Thompson. IL. but without alQaida detainees. to create jobs in northwestern Illinois. and address also flooding issues in southern Illinois and levee rehabilitation in the metro east area. We have also successfully confirmed four new judges for central and northern Illinois. and have an additional two nominations. one Democrat. one Republican. pending. But legislation is not all we do here. In my opinion. one of the most important things a Member of Congress can focus on is constituent service. We formed advisory boards for African Americans. Latinos. small business. agriculture. health care. education. and students. Since I first came to the House of Representatives in 2001. I have worked diligently as an advocate for Illinois before the Federal Government. In 1 year now. my staff has held more than 3.440 meetings with constituents and other officials and dignitaries. To be as accessible as possible. I have visited 50 out of Illinoiss 102 counties and held 20 townhall meetings throughout the State. This month. my successor in the House of Representatives. Congressman BOB DOLD. and I held the first ever live Facebook townhall meeting and answered questions we received via the social networking site and Twitter. My office has arranged 340 Capitol and White House tours for approximately 2.800 constituents. We received more than 85.000 phone calls and responded to 66.000 letters and emails. We have helped more than 4.000 constituents with casework details before the government. and written more than 200 letters in support of Illinois towns. counties. and organizations for Federal grants. I have convened eight constituent advisory boards and met a total of 18 times. My office helped process 122 passports and assisted 750 veterans and their concerns before the VA. We have accomplished quite a bit this year. I remain optimistic about the longterm future of our Nation. We can outinnovate and outproduce any nation on the planet if we create an environment that supports full job creation. But there is still a lot of work to do. The Illinois unemployment rate stands at over 10 percent. It seems each day we hear of a new company thinking of leaving our State. The health care law threatens a further drag on our economy. We face a global sovereign debt crisis in Europe and fears of future credit devaluations for the United States. U.S. troops continue to pursue enemies of freedom in Afghanistan and Iraq. and Iran continues its effort to develop nuclear weapons. Protests are accelerating in Egypt. and civil unrest in Syria. Piracy remains a concern off the coast of Somalia. As I have for the past year. I will spend the next 5 years making sure that America remains the best place on Earth for any individual to rise to their full potential. a place where your rights are protected against the government. whose main mission should be to defend us. and to foster higher incomes for our families. In these battles. I will advance the interests of the State of Illinois as the job engine at the center of the Nations economy. protector of the Lake Michigan and Mississippi ecosystems. and the special place that sent Abraham Lincoln and hopefully future Lincolns for national leadership when America needs it most. Of course. my heart and soul will always be with the troopstheir care. their mission. and their spirit of defending a place that is the greatest force for human freedom and dignity ever designed. I am truly grateful for the opportunity to serve my Nation twicein the Navy and in the Senate. I thank the people of Illinois for this first year in the Senate and for the even bigger things we will do together in the years to come. With that. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum."},{"1":"2010","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Ms. SHEAPORTER. thank you so much. You were talking about the many options available to us. the choices we are making. In this tax policy. we are making a choice to invest in Americas future. that is. the working men and women of America. or investing in the very wealthy. All of it with borrowed money. If America is going to make it. then we are going to have to rebuild Americas industrial strength. These are choices. There are ways that we can rebuild Americas industrial strength. One of them is to stop exporting jobs. Now. the American Tax Code until just a month ago provided a $12 billion annual tax break to American corporations who sent jobs offshore. Yes. thats right. How could that be? Well. it was in the Tax Code. The Democrats said thats wrong. and we passed a tax bill that ended that nefarious. useless. jobharming tax proposal. We brought $12 billion back into the Treasury. put a stop to the incentive for American corporations to ship those jobs offshore. Did the Republicans support that jobcreating program? They did not. Only a handful. I mean. one handful actually voted with the Democrats to end a tax break that encouraged the offshoring of jobs. An example of how we can bring jobs back to America is to set our tax policy in place so we dont encourage the offshoring of jobs. Another piece of this is to use our tax money to build jobs in America. Very quickly. and then I want to turn to my colleagues in the final 15 minutes of this hour. We spend a lot of money. Our gasoline tax. our diesel fuel tax is used to maintain our highways and to buy buses and trains and light rail systems and things that move people. It is all well and good. But much of that tax money is used to purchase buses. light rail. trains that are made in foreign countries. My proposal is. hey. that is our tax money. lets spend it on equipment that is made in America. You want to build a bridge. use American steel. You want to buy a bus. our tax money. buy an Americanmade bus. You want to build a light rail system with our tax money. buy an American made light rail system. If we just use our tax dollars in a way that promotes American industry. we can grow America. I think of Walt Whitman and his beautiful poetry about the great industrial strength of America. the way America would get up in the morning and build. I dont think Walt Whitman would be very enthusiastic about American industry today given our policies. But if we institute policies that are make it in America so that America can make it. once again these are choices about where we are going. Manufacturing matters. Walt Whitman understood that the strength of America was in its industries. We have forgotten that. and apparently our Republican colleagues are perfectly willing to give American industries a tax break to ship jobs offshore. The Democrats are not. We ended that."},{"1":"2009","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"Congressman GINGREY. I appreciate that introduction. You know theres no way I can possibly live up to that now. But I did want to come down here and talk not about health care specifically. but about some of the things were doing differently and uniquely with energy. I realize there is somewhat of a connection because what Dr. GINGREY was talking about is a vision of another approach to try and solve the energy crisis. What we are talking about as Republicans is trying to give options to individuals and choices to individuals. And when it comes to energy. it Is the same kind of concept. We are talking about a vision for America and a road or option that can be taken. Its not just simply one. So I appreciate very much the concept of health care. In fact. when I leave. I expect Dr. GINGREY will come back again to that area and show once again how these are all the concepts that have to be in there. But I did want to take just a moment. if I could. because today the Western Caucus as well as the Republican Study Committee did introduce a new bill that deals with energy. And it is. once again. with the same purpose or overall vision that Dr. GINGREY was talking about. because our goal is to say there are two competing visions of where America is ready to go. Its kind of like the Frost poem of two paths in the woods that are diverging. We have to choose which one we want to go. The Democrats have already offered a proposal of capandtax. And the Republicans are now coming up with a different proposal of trying to take the cap off our energy development so that we have the choice of which of these two paths Americans want to take. If we go with what the Democrats are already proposing. there will be an increase in the energy costs of every individual. It can be as high as $3.000. which is a legitimate number. But the problem is it is also disproportionate. There are some parts of the country that will have a bigger hit than others. And it is worse on the poor than any other segment. If youre rich. this is an inconvenience. If youre poor. this is a decision on whether you can celebrate with Hamburger Helper that evening or not. The Republican option. on the other hand. the Republican road. is to try and increase and grow our energy supply so we reduce the cost because there Is more available. It also recognizes that energy has always been the vehicle for those in the lower classes and poverty to raise themselves up. Their ability to increase our gross domestic product and our wealth has been based on the concept of having affordable energy. The Democratic . approach. once again. will cut jobs. The greatest estimate. most conservative estimate. is at least 3 million jobs will be taken. The Republican one is not to increase jobs. its not to increase taxes. but rather. instead. to create increased royalties we will get from increasing production. and put that into a trust fund to attack the deficit that this country has and take the cap off of our production so that we can actually succeed as a country. The Democrats would have us go down the approach where there is no real reward for conservation. only mandates. The Republican option that will be before that Is to reward people for their efforts at personal conservation. which is what we should be doing. The Democrat road would take us down to the approach in which government starts telling people how to live their lives. We will harken back to the era of Jimmy Carter. where the government told you how fast to drive. how warm your house could be. and when you could buy gasoline. unless youre like the one family we knew about who had two different license platesone odd. one evenso he could buy gasoline whenever he wanted to fill up his car. The Republican approach. though. is different. It is trying to reward innovations. giving prizes for ingenuity. What we realize in this country is there is within Americans the spark of creativity. the ingenuity. the ability to come up with new solutions. We dont need the government to pick winners and losers and tell us how we shall live. Open up the options for individuals and reward them for taking the risk to come up with those options. and we can create a better world. There are ideas that are out therenew ideas in this particular bill which gives incentives for every kind of energy. from solar to new algae production. and some old ideas that have been around which have never been done. And they are going to be new ideas until we actually do itand there is no better time to do it. In fact. the Democrat approach is simply saying: We cant do it. so why try? The Republican option is saying: There is limitless opportunity in this country. We should do it. and we should simply do it now. Its kind of like the tale of two cities: one city where the lights are off. the Republican city. where the lights can be turned on. Actually. a better one is if you remember the sequel to Back to Future where there were two options in which civilization could develop. The Republican one takes you down to where the McFly family is happy. the Democrat option takes us down to where Biff is still ruling the world. We have a chance of making the choice between those particular options. The bill is basically about all the energy that we can create. It says that there is. in this country. a better dream and a better vision of what the future can be. The Republicans want to take us down a better road for Americas future. a better vision. by creating a bill that. once again. does three things: It rewards Americans for efforts of conservation. We are talking about a lot of mandates. but not allowing Americans to voluntarily conserve and be rewarded for it. And for every gallon that we can conserve. it is a gallon that we dont have to try to import from a country that basically doesnt like us. To increase significantly the amount of production we have so there is more energy. it is more affordable. it is more useable. it is more helpful. and. that it can be that type of thing that will allow those in the lower classes economically to rise above their situation right now. And. third. reward Americans for innovation. Prizes for innovation have always been the way the world has made quantum leaps forward. When the British were trying to become the maritime power. they didnt know how to map the waters. so they offered a 20.000 pound reward for anyone who could solve the problem. and a London clock maker came up with the concept of latitude and longitude we still use today. When Napoleon needed to have his troops fed. he offered a 14.000 franc award for the first person who could come up and solve his problem. and the result was the concept of vacuum packing that we still use today. When Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic Ocean. he was responding to a prize offered by a newspaper. The ability of Americans to solve our problems and come up with creativity and new ideas and new solutions far and beyond what we are thinking about today is something that has never been driven by Washington. It has been driven by giving Americans the opportunity to use their native abilities. expand the horizons. be creative. and then be rewarded for that kind of creativity. We are talking about two potential roads: one road which leads to more control of government. one road that leads to greater innovation and acceptance. and the ability of Americans to dream new dreams and create new visions. Dr. GINGREY was talking about that same concept in the field of health care. that what we need is to look at the two roads that we are taking. and perhaps even look atI think the word in the vernacular in the medical community would be trying to come up with a second opinion of where we should be moving and where we should be going. I do thank Dr. GINGREY for allowing me to intervene here. because. like I say. there is a new energy bill that has been produced. It is an energy bill that I think is positive. It is one I want Americans to deal with. because what we are trying to say is there is a better path. there is a better future for this country. and we want this out here as an option so people can understand it. On the issue of health care. I think the good representative from Georgia will also admit there has got to be a better path and a better option that is out here. one that ennobles and empowers Americans. I think he has some great ideas on how you can steer this country down to that correct path."},{"1":"2008","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Thank you. Mr. DEAL. for yielding.

I rise today to introduce legislation with my good friend and partner on the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee. Senator AKAKA. to address the critical management challenges facing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). I am pleased to have Senators LEVIN and McCASKILL as original cosponsors of this measure. The legislation would elevate the role and responsibilities of the current Under Secretary for Management of the Department to a Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security for Management. The language preserves the authority of the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of DHS as the firstand secondhighest ranking Department officials. respectively. The Individual appointed as the Deputy Secretary for Management would serve a five year term and be the third highest ranking official at the Department. A term would provide management continuity at the Department during times of leadership transition. such as following a presidential election. The role and responsibilities of the Deputy Secretary for Management would include serving as the Chief Management Officer and principal advisor to the Secretary on the management of the Department. The Deputy Secretary for Management would also be responsible for strategic and annual performance planning. identification and tracking of performance measures. as well as the integration and transformation process in support of homeland security operations and programs. The division of labor between the Deputy Secretary and the new Deputy Secretary for Management will be similar to the leadership structure at the Office of Management and Budget. The Deputy Secretary will continue to be the Secretarys first assistant on all policy matters. while the newly created Deputy Secretary for Management will be the Secretarys principal advisor on the development of sustained. longterm management strategies. I offer this legislation today because of my belief that the existing Under Secretary position lacks sufficient authority to direct the type of sustained leadership and overarching management integration and transformation strategy that is needed departmentwide. There continue to be significant management challenges associated with integrating the Department of Homeland Security. whose creation represented the single largest restructuring of the Federal Government since the creation of the Department of Defense in 1947. In addition to its complex mission of securing the Nation from terrorism and natural hazards through protection. prevention. response. and recovery leadership of the Department of Homeland Security has the enormous task of unifying 180.000 employees from 22 disparate Federal agencies. Since 2003. the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has included implementing and transforming the Department of Homeland Security on its highrisk list of programs susceptible to waste. fraud. abuse. and mismanagement. In announcing its 2007 highrisk list. Comptroller General Walker said that. The array of management and programmatic challenges continues to limit DHSs ability to carry out its roles under the National Homeland Security Strategy in an effective riskbased way. Similarly. in December 2005. the DHS Inspector General issued a report warning of major management challenges facing the Department of Homeland Security. The report noted that although progress has been made since the Departments inception. Integrating its many separate components in a single. effective. efficient. and economical Department remains one of DHS biggest challenges. The -Departments own Performance and Accountability Report. released in November 2006. states that it did not meet its strategic goal of providing comprehensive leadership and management to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Department. further underscoring the need for good management. The Homeland Security Advisory Council Culture Task Force Report. published in January 2007. detailed persisting organizational challenges within DHS. and prescribed leadership and management models designed to empower employees. foster collaboration. and encourage innovation. The third recommendation of the report is that the Department establish an operational leadership position. The report noted. Alignment and integration of the DHS component organizations is vital to the success of the DHS mission. The CTF believes there is a compelling need for the creation of a Deputy Secretary for Operations (DSO) who would report to the Secretary and be responsible for the high level Departmentwide measures aimed at generating and sustaining seamless operational integration and alignment of the component organizations. The creation of the Deputy Secretary for Management will help address the concerns outlined by GAO. the DHS Inspector General. the Homeland Security Advisory Council. and the Department itself. As former Chairman and now Ranking Member of the Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee. improving the management structure at the Department has been one of my top priorities. The Subcommittees Chairman. Senator AKAKA. and I have been committed to ensuring that DHS has the proper tools to make continual improvements in its operations. It has become clear that the Department needs a stronger management focus to enable programmatic and operational success. Congress must act to strengthen the management function at DHS. During my long career in public service. including as a Mayor and Governor. I have repeatedly observed that the path to organizational success lies in adopting best practices in management. including strategic planning. performance and accountability measures. and effectively leveraging human capital. When instituting reforms as Mayor and Governor. individuals tasked with implementation would tell me. We dont have time for Total Quality Management. we are too busy putting out fires. I appreciate that DHS is also busy putting out fires. But the connection between good management practices and operational success should not be lost. With the four year anniversary of the Department only weeks away. we must be honest about the remaining management challenges it faces. The legislation I offer today provides the focused. highlevel attention that will result in effective management reform. I believe this legislation is vital to the Departments success. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation."},{"1":"2006","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. first of all. let me say this. We are in a procedural quagmire in the Senate as happens once in a while. Of course. it would have been the right of the minority to stop this Defense appropriations bill from going forward. For a couple of reasons I felt that was inappropriate. First of all. the defense of this country is extremely important. and we should try to get a few things done dealing with our fighting men and women around the world as quickly as we can. But one of the factors in my agreement to go forward with this legislation is the two managers of this bill are history itself. Two of the most senior Members of the Senate. two of the most experienced Members of the Senate. the two Members who manage a bill as partners. as a couple of friends should. are experienced. I felt that with their management of this bill we would have a fair opportunity to do what was appropriate. My feeling has been underscored in the little while we have been on this bill. We will give a fair shake in the process to the men and women who are defending our country. I come to the floor today with a simple amendment. I must confess that the amendment I brought to the floor is certainly not new and unique with me. The amendment that I am offering has been taken directly word for word from a bill that was passed by the Republicancontrolled House last week by a broad bipartisan margin. This amendment consists of tax provisionssocalled extendersexcluding the abandoned mine land fund in the Housepassed bill. Again. every single provision in my amendment enjoys broad bipartisan support. But I am forced to offer this amendment for a couple of reasons. First. our friends in the majority have allowed many of these provisions to expire. Second. the statements made by the majority leader yesterdaywhich I dont think are hard to understandI have to confess that the statements by my friend. the majority leader. were wrong in a number of different ways. What he basically said yesterday was we have a vote on the motion to proceed to a big bill on Friday. take it or leave it take that bill which includes these extending tax provisions which are so important to the country. some of which have expired. It also has in it a minimum wage provision which is so flawed. It takes 3 years to kick in. but. more importantly. for seven States it would be a wage cut for these people. The threatsfor lack of a better way to describe itare simply an attempt to coerce. blackmail Members of the Senate to vote for a bill that Is bad just because there are certain provisions that people might like. thinking. well. this allows a chance. whatever. we are going to have to vote on the extenders and the pension bill simply is not true. We have to pass these extenders. We always do. and we will this year. I certainly hope we pass the pensions legislation. We have worked on that in conference for almost a year. Last Friday. it was all agreed on. and on a bipartisan basis it was done. They were ready to sign the conference report. Had that happened. we would have long been done with this. For the majority leader to say it is now or never. you vote for this Friday morning on the motion to proceed. that it is a very faulty. wrongheaded piece of legislation. not the least of which is to create an $800 billion further deficit and debt for this country with the estate tax800 billion. It affects 8.100 people in our country. We are a country of 300 million people. This whole matter is being driven for 8.100 people-$800 billion. If we are talking about priorities. what is more important? The pensions provisions affect 45 million people. and these extenders which affect virtually everybody in the countrybusinesses and. of course. directly our citizens. We do not need to go through each of these extenders. and I am not going to do that. For example. take the one that allows taxpayers to deduct up to $4.000 of their college tuition expenses. Senator FRIST is telling us and the American people that the 8.100 Americans that we are creating a debt for this country of $800 billion are more Important than parents sending their children to college with this deduction. It doesnt sound good to me. It doesnt seem like a fair chance. This amendment contains an R&D tax credit to encourage American businesses to make investments that will benefit American workers. What is more important. to get that done before we leave here at the end of this week or to pass an estate tax repeal costing $800 billion? Senator FRIST said that the 8.100 people are more important than the R&D tax credit. My amendment contains a provision that will extend the State and local sales tax deduction. led by a number of Members but certainly the senior Senator from the State of Texas. That States residents will benefit so significantly because there are so many people there. But Nevada. which doesnt have as many people. has a sales tax. and we want this benefit. Senator FRIST says. no. you are not going to have a chance to do that unless you support my estate tax repeal$800 billion to extend the State and local sales tax. This amendment includes a provision to allow teachers to deduct outofpocket expenses when they incur classroom expenses. In Nevada. we are struggling to find ways to have affordable housing for our teachers. This means a lot to themdeduct outofpocket expenses for classroom activities. Senator FRIST says. No. 8.100 of the richest of the rich of the rich take precedent. As I have said. I am not going to go through each of these provisions. But why dont we just go ahead and pass this? People say the House is out of session. The House is still in session. I think it would give true impetus to this defense bill. and we could perhaps finish this bill within a day or two. There will be some stimulus for doing that. On the House side. just like we do over here. leadership can bring the House back into session. They have to come every 3 days. That is the rule. They cannot adjourn unless we give them permission. They can do this by unanimous consent. We could do the Defense appropriations bill. and we could do these extensions. This amendment is important. It provides an opportunity for every Member of this body to show the American people that we are prepared to respond to their needs. These extenders should have been extended a long time ago. I am speaking for my friend. the ranking member on the Finance Committee. Senator BAUCUS. who. as you know. is not here as a result of his nephew being killed while serving us in Iraq. He feels very strongly about this. I dont believe we can be coerced into providing budgetbusting tax breaks for the wealthiest of the wealthy in our country. We should not leave here without giving our colleagues every opportunity to provide working Americans some tax relief. which they deserve."},{"1":"2005","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. Socrates said. Four things belong to a judge: to hear courteously. to answer wisely. to consider soberly. and to decide impartially. To date. the Senate has confirmed 209 of President Bushs judicial nominees. The vast majority of them received overwhelming support from this body. We looked at their records and decided that they had the qualities that Socrates described. Janice Rogers Brown. however. lacks these qualities and falls far short of this ideal. I sincerely regret that the President has asked this body to confirm her to a lifetime appointment to the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals. This is no reflection on her individual accomplishments. She comes from a very humble background. a sharecroppers daughter. and has taken full advantage of all that this country has to offer to become a Supreme Court judge. She has gained some wisdom from this experience. I am sure. and I have no doubt that she will take her job as a judge seriously. soberly. My greatest concern lies with her impartiality. Some of her statements and her decisions on the California Supreme Court lead me to believe that she will let her personal bias dictate her consideration of issues of law. I cannot trust the impartiality of someone who may be considering issues involving Medicare or Social Security who says that senior citizens blithely cannibalize their grandchildren because they have the right to get as much free stuff from the political system. Nor can I accept that she will be Impartial when she says that age discrimination does not mark its victim with a stigma of inferiority. Tell that to the 50 year old waitress who loses a job because she doesnt look pretty anymore. and ends up getting replaced by a younger. less experienced person. Janice Rogers Brown has been nominated to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. the court that closely oversees the actions of Federal agenciesmore than any other Circuit Court. It is widely recognized in the legal community as the second most important court in the country. Citizens come to the D.C. Circuit to enforce fair labor practice decisions made by the National Labor Relations Board. worker safety protection regulations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. regulatory decisions made by the Federal Communications Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency. and much. much more. But Janice Rogers Brown has said that where government moves in community retreats. civil society disintegrates. . . . The result is: families under siege war in the streets. unapologetic expropriation of property. the . . . decline of the rule of law ... a debased. debauched culture which finds moral depravity entertaining. ...  She also called the New Deal. which gave us Social Security and the Tennessee Valley Authority. programs that exist today. the triumph of our own socialist revolution. With sentiments such as these I can only wonder what she thinks of Medicare. Medicaid. child nutrition programs. agricultural subsidies. No Child Left Behind. and a whole host of other programs that give opportunity to our citizens and help people live up to their given potential. To me. these programs are not socialism. they are what a compassionate society does for its people. So I will vote against the confirmation Of Janice Rogers Brown. I do so knowing that she will likely be confirmed. Her nomination is moving forward because she was one of the nominees that 13 of my colleagues and I agreed to no longer filibuster. I want to talk about this agreement just for a moment. First. I must say that the compromise was essential to avoid a serious breakdown in the Senate rules and its functions. It represents the Senate at its best and upholds the traditional 151. Pt. 9 June 8. 2005 constitutional role of the Senate as the protector of the rights of minority interests when they were seriously threatened and perhaps irrevocably ended. But more than this. my colleagues and I helped steer a better course with this compromise. A course for jobs. opportunity. better education. and future peace. I hope the President will reflect upon the resolve of these 14 Senators to protect and respect the minority and do so by sending us nominees who will respect the law and not come exclusively from the far fringes of the political spectrum. I am open to discussing nominees with the President. I make this offer in good faith and in the same spirit as one of his original campaign promises from 2000: to change the culture in Washington. Here is what thenGovernor Bush said in a speech at that time: There is too much argument in Washington and not enough shared accomplishment. . . . As President. I will set a new tone in Washington. I will do everything I can to restore civility to our national politics. My colleagues on this compromise have already helped set that new tone for the Senate. I urge him to work with the entire Senate on judicial nominees. I am ready to forge this new civility in Washington. I know future nominees will be conservative just as all of the 208 previously confirmed Bush nominees have been. I fully accept that fact. But I also expect future nominees to be fair and to have shown their fairness and impartiality by their words and their deeds. Janice Rogers Brown has not."},{"1":"2004","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I recognize Paul Igasaki. a Chicago native. for his contributions to the important work of advancing our civil rights. Mr. Igasaki has dedicated his entire professional career to ensuring justice for the powerless in our society who are often neglected and ignored. In his most recent years of public service as a commissioner. vice chair. and acting chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. EEOC. Mr. Igasaki not only enforced laws that helped prevent employment discrimination practices. he himself broke the glass ceiling as the first Asian American appointed to the high office. Mr. Igasaki was successful in reducing overwhelming case backlog that was impairing the effective functioning of the agency. His recommendations led to the development of the National Enforcement Plan and the Priority Charge Handling Program. which have reduced the EEOC case inventory by over 70 percent. These structural changes have allowed the agency to focus on more serious cases where the EEOCs involvement can make a difference to the lives of American workers. Similarly. Mr. Igasaki cochaired an EEOC task force that recommended focused litigation strategy. placement of attorneys in area offices. and greater cooperation between attorneys and investigators in agency. which have led to increased law enforcement effectiveness of the agency. One of his most notable accomplishments during his term on the EEOC was his role in guiding the settlement of the Mitsubishi Motors of America casethe largest case involving sexual harassment at the workplace. His success with this case was influential in moving the Japanese government to implement gender discrimination and sexual harassment enforcement laws for their own country. In the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks. Mr. Igasaki brought valuable perspectives from his personal experiences as a Japanese American to the EEOCs efforts to combat unfair backlash and scapegoating of Arab Americans. South Asian Americans. Muslim or Sikh Americans and others who were wrongly targeted by hate and discrimination. Mr. Igasaki mothers family owned a small truck farm near San Diego. Like thousands of other Japanese Americans. Mr. Igasakis grandparents had been in the United States for almost a half century. and like most immigrants they were proud and loyal Americans. Yet. following the devastating attacks at Pearl Harbor. Mr. Igasakis family was subject to harassment around town and at school. One day. the FBI showed up at their home. and without warning. warrant or explanation. they took his grandfather into custody. His family would not know where he was. what his condition was or why he had been taken for several months. They relied on community rumor. knowing that other Japanese Americans had been arrested for no apparent reason. When our government issued the relocation orders for Japanese Americans. Mr. Igasakis family had two weeks to give up the farm and nearly all of their property. Only in the horse stall that the family shared in the relocation center at Santa Anita Racetrack did they find out that Mr. Igasakis grandfather was arrested because he was the secretary of the local Celery Growers Association and because he had taken some notes of their meetings in Japanese. Their family eventually reunited when they were sent to a more permanent camp in Arizona where they were held for the duration of World War II. Having experienced the pain and injustice of such treatment based on no reason other than their ethnic ancestry. Mr. Igasakis became a passionate voice of conscience in the months following the September 11th attacks. His voice comforted all Americans who faced discrimination at the workplace because of their ancestry or appearance. and the work of the EEOC was that much more important because of Mr. Igasakis presence. His voice has also been an important one in the development of the national Asian American civil rights movement. Mr. Igasaki has served as the Washington. DC. representative of the Japanese American Citizens League. executive director of the Asian Law Caucus. and executive director of the City of Chicagos Commission on Asian American Affairs. A more detailed list of Mr. Igasakis accomplishments is described in a resolution that the national board of the Japanese American Citizens League recently adopted. I ask unanimous consent that this resolution be printed in the RECORD."},{"1":"2003","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I thank the distinguished ranking member for yielding me time. Mr. Speaker. it would be my greatest desire that we would have a full debate on the question of the next step for our economy and walk out of this Chamber with the mark of the Congress in the bipartisan way. Two days ago. Warren Buffett wrote an oped. and I believe everyone knows the portfolio of Warren Buffett is still very strong. one of the richest men in the Nation. And he argued vigorously with the approach this Congress was taking. Clearly. he said. the tax plan now moving through the Congress is not a gift for him. It is an outright bonus. It is Christmas every day. and it is for everyone in his predicament and condition: $40 billionplus in assets. But he compared his status. Mr. Speaker. with the status of the secretary or receptionist working in his office or even the cleaning woman working in his office. He said. under this effort. this tax cut program. he would be paying or being given a gift and he would be paying onetenth of the amount of monies required by the receptionist and the cleaning woman. What that says to me. Mr. Speaker. we are going up the wrong road. There is a dead end at the end of the road and the dead end are the millions of unemployed who are not getting an extended unemployment package of 26 weeks because we have got to give a tax cut to the rich. We are going up a dead end. Mr. Speaker. because the program that is now being fostered upon us does not create jobs. If we took the Democratic plan. Mr. Speaker. and we invested a million dollars in transportation infrastructure. you would get 13 jobs. If you did it in health care. you would get 26 jobs. Mr. Speaker. if you use the plan that the President has put forward. you take a million dollars and you get two jobs. Now. I know that there is a difficulty in math in this great body because we are willing to go forward on $550 billion. which I understand is a compromise on $350 billion. but it does not invest back into America to create jobs. and the plan as proposed by the Republicans takes $1 million to create two jobs. And I can take $1 million and put it in transportation and create 15 jobs. and in health care and create 28 jobs and on down the line. And then I could provide 26 weeks of unemployment for those whose benefits are being cut off. I know the American people are focused as we honor the dead this coming weekend. and I will join them in cherishing those who fight for our freedom. But it is time for America to wake up. You are going to be hungry after 13 weeks. You need to stand up and fight for 26 weeks. That is what I believe we should be doing today. Putting up this marshal rule does not allow us to collaborate and to work together. Let us work through tomorrow. let us work through Saturday. let us work through Sunday. Let us leave this place with a tax bill that really invests in America. Let us leave this place with 26 weeks of unemployment insurance for the single mothers and dads who are going to be facing eviction because they do not have the benefit. Let us churn the economy by ensuring that those people who are without work who are looking for work because there are no jobs. still have the benefits to pay their mortgage and their rent and to buy the food. Mr. Speaker. we are forcing this down the throats of the Members of Congress. I know we are better than this. This is not a good rule. We need to deliberate and work for a better economy for America because our economy is in shambles. I ask my colleagues to work together and vote against this."},{"1":"2002","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I rise to announce my opposition to the underlying bill that we consider today. it is a near certainty that the substitute amendment offered by my colleague from California will not be approved. and without the improvements contained in her amendment. there is little choice for me but to vote against this bill. Last December. I voted against this bills passage when it was considered under suspension of rules. I did so because I objected to a provision in that bill that would have provided immunity to customs officers for personal searches at border locations. as long as the officers follow agency guidelines. That was too broad an exemption. I share the view of many in this chamber that the men and women who make up the U.S. Customs Service are good and hard working people. dedicated to performing their jobs and committed to protecting the safety of this countrys borders. Nowhere is the dedication of U.S. Customs Service personnel exemplified more than at Detroits ports of entry. Unfortunately. inspection abuses have occurred and civil rights have been violated. The grant of immunity provided in the earlier bill asked that the constitutional rights of Americans be surrendered at the border. I opposed passage of H.R. 3129 last December. and I oppose its passage today for the very same reasons. I have dedicated my entire life to the advancement of civil rights under civil law. To vote for this bill as it is presently configured would require me to suppress a deepseated core value that I hold dear. There are times when many in this chamber put aside their personal values in order to advance causes and issues that provide for the greater good. This is not one of those times. This bill has the potential of short circuiting the civil liberties of Americans and international visitors who step on to U.S. soil from international ports. By doing so. we are compromising on the values that make up part of the American character and surrendering the protections guaranteed to us under the constitution. I cannot in good conscience surrender my convictions to protect the civil liberties of all Americans and those that come to this country. For that reason I oppose the passage of this bill."},{"1":"2001","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. This amendment puts the scientific decisionmaking process into the hands of the best scientists for the job. I oppose the FDA making environmental decisions on GE fish. The FDA does not staff fish scientists. and has not consulted with the National Marine Fisheries Service or the Fish and Wildlife Service. The following passage is from an article in The Washington Post. Edwin Rhodes. aquaculture coordinator for the National Marine Fisheries Service. said he was surprised to hear that the Food and Drug Administration was overseeing the environmental review regarding new salmon and making decisions on such things as whether fish would be grown in net pans. Mr. Rhodes said the National Marine Fisheries Service. not the Food and Drug Administration. had the expertise to make such decisions and would need to be involved. So I think we have to look at the scientific issues here. And does this sound like the FDA is adequately addressing the environmental concerns that are raised? It does not. But a 1year delay would give Congress the opportunity to make sure that the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service are included in the process. I want to make sure that Congress will include the appropriate scientists in the approval process. This amendment is about a 1year moratorium to give us the chance to make sure that the right decisions are being made. or else. my colleagues. we may soon see a version of Frankenfish which will exterminate whole species of fish. We have an obligation to consumers to look at this and not to jump to a hasty decision which would involve the FDA giving approval for fish when in fact the FDA is not involved with health issues and environmental issues relating to consumers. This amendment is strongly supported by commercial fishermen. including the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermens Association. the Alaska Trawlers Association. and the Washington Trawlers Association because their struggling industry. industries important to this country. cannot afford a negative ecological impact on the wild fish species that they depend on for their livelihood. Vote for this amendment. It is to protect our peoples health. our environmental health. and it is only for a 1year moratorium."},{"1":"2000","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I am a strong supporter of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. I strongly agree that every child deserves the opportunity to benefit from a public education and is able to reach his or her fullest potential. In addition. I recognize the tremendous cost of this endeavor. If our schools are truly to serve all students. the federal government must increase IDEA funding. During my years in Congress. I have worked tirelessly to support increases in special education funding. I continue to support increasing funding for special education. and would like to see us funding it at $7 billion this year. But there is a right way. and a wrong way to go about this. The right way is to increase overall funding for education so that. in this time of extraordinary budget surpluses. we are meeting the needs of all students. The wrong way is what is proposed in this amendmentrobbing Peter to pay Paul. This amendment takes money from other equally worthy programs in order to pay for IDEA. Simply shifting money around doesnt solve the problem. The Labor HHS Education bill is woefully underfunded. Why? Not because our nation cannot afford to invest in education. But because our Republican colleagues want to give large tax breaks to their wealthy friends. The result is that good programs are pitted against one another. forced to compete for artificially scarce resources. This is no way to govern. I am committed to moving ahead with fully funding the Federal governments promised 40% of IDEA expenses. But I will not do so at the expense of other equally worthy programs. As the Labor HHS Education bill goes to conference. I will be urging my colleagues in the House to accept the far more generous funding levels of the Senate bill. and to direct some of those additional resources toward special education. So I urge my colleagues to increase funding for IDEA. but to do it the right way. Therefore. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment."},{"1":"1999","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I am pleased to introduce today legislation to establish Americas Private Investment Companies. or APIC. This legislation is part of President Clintons New Markets Initiative. which I am also pleased to be able to support. The New Markets Initiative. of which APIC is a crucial element. is an important response to economic problems that persist in many neighborhoods and communities in our urban and rural areas. These communities have been bypassed by the increased investment. job growth. and income increases that have characterized this unprecedented period of economic expansion. Indeed. the areas that would benefit from the New Markets Initiative are experiencing increased poverty levels. increased isolation. and ongoing joblessness and decay. Yet. research increasingly shows that most of these areas represent good economic opportunities for American business. Michael Porter. a renowned business analyst who has written widely on competitiveness at both the firm and national levels. has written that a ... major advantage of the Inner city as a business location is a large. underserved local market. . . . In fact. inner cities are the largest underserved market in America. with many tens of billions of dollars of unmet consumer and business demand. Another group called Social Compact has done intensive studies of buying power in a number of communities around the country. These studies confirm Porters earlier work. Social Compact estimated retail spending power in two communities in Chicago. Residents in the first community have median incomes of over $67.000 million whereas the median income in the second community is under $30.000. Yet. on a per acre basis. the lower income community has more than twice the spending power of the wealthier area. Moreover. as labor markets grow tighter and tighter. inner cities have the advantage of an available. loyal workforce. to again quote Mr. Porter. However. we need a catalyst to encourage business to take advantage of these opportunities. The APIC program provides that push. This bill gives the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). together with the Small Business Administration (SBA). authority to provide lowcost loans on a matching basis to specially constituted investment companies. called APICs. that raise private equity capital for investment in businesses in lowincome areas. Individual APICs will operate in a manner similar to Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs). a very successful program that helps fund start up small business. APIC will target its investment funds to larger businesses that locate in these underserved areas. with particular emphasis on those businesses that create good jobs in those neighborhoods."},{"1":"1998","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Let me just mention a few of the companies we have heard from already: Intel. IBM. HewlettPackard. Ford Motor Company. Eli Lilly. The list goes on and on. and it spans a variety of areas from medical research to information technology. And as those projects go on hold. it means not only that the company will not be growing as fast as we would like to see. it also means that we will not be filling as many ne% job opportunities with people WHO currently are hoping that those companies will begin their new product lines. It is estimated by the Hudson Institute that if we dont increase this cap. we could see a significant impact on economic growth. They have even projected it to be as much as $200 billion in lost output. That almost works out to nearly $1.000 for every man. woman and child in the United States. But the ramifications actually go beyond simply not being able to fill those positions until next October. There are other implications as well. For example. if we cant hire these talented people and bring them here now. foreign competitors can and will fill that gap. and we will lose people to other countries who will then be the ones developing the technologies that we are talking about. At the same time. if we dont even reach the cap and if American companies cant bring the talent here to fill their needs. it increases the possibilityin fact it is a very real possibilitythat they will begin to move some of the operations we are talking about overseas. That means we dont just lose that one job which we are attempting to fill through a temporary worker. It means existing jobs in the United States could be lost if product lines of divisions. if new projects. are initiated in another country. Obviously. we dont want to lose American jobs simply because we cant get certain specific skilled workers to this country to begin these kinds of operations. The types of operations we are talking about are also very significant. We are not just talking about a new widget being developed. We are talking about dealing with enormous important problems confronting our country at this time. We have all heard in recent weeks from Senator BENNEr. our colleague from Utah. who is the Senates foremost expert on the problems we confront with the year 2K situation. Now. we have a Senate task force to examine those issues specifically with what the intent is for us in the Senate. but what we clearly know is there is not one sector of our economy that is not going to be impacted by the year 2K problems. I have heard from numerous companies and numerous individuals trying to meet the year 2K challenges. who said it is absolutely vital that we increase the H1B visa program at this time so we can bring in sufficient talent to deal with the year 2K problems between now and the end of 1999. Yet. as I say. we have hit the cap. I will be talking about this in greater detail as we go along this afternoon. but let me talk specifically about what our legislation would do to meet these challenges. both the shortterm problem we have. such as the year 2K problem. and the longterm problem we are trying to address. the challenge of having enough American workers to meet the dramatic increases in job creation in the information technology sector of the economy. Our legislation would do the following: First. it would temporarily increase from 65.000 to 95.000 the cap on H1B visas. That means an increase of 30.000 per year. In addition. we have created as a safety valveso we would have at least the possibility of congressional oversight and examination if we hit that 95.000 cap sooner than anticipateda safety valve which would permit us to use up to 20.000 visas from the H2B program. if such visas were available and unused by that program in the previous year. As I say. our legislation has a 5year sunset to it. In short. we tried to make this a shortterm rather than a longterm focus piece of legislation in the hope that in that 5year period we can develop through job training programs and our educational system the talent we need right here at home. So it would be a 5year program. Those increases we have mentioned would be for 5 years. In addition. starting in the 1999 fiscal year. we would separate out of the H1B program health care workers. and create a new category. the HiC program with a limit of 10.000 annual visas for health care employees. We do that because a number of people have expressed concerns about the hightech program. the skilled worker program. That addresses concerns that if we make this significant increase in the numbers. too many of those will end up being used in areas which do not necessarily. right now. seem to have the need that the hightech information technology sector requires. So what we have decided to do in the legislation is essentially to create a new category of 10.000 visas that would be the limit annually for health care workers. That would reach 85.000 for the information technology and other highskilled categories. In addition. our legislation calls upon the INS to provide us with more information with regard to the H1B program. One of the frustrations that we have all had. and I know the Senator from California and I have talked about this in the subcommittee when we discussed this program. is that we dont actually know how many workers are coming in. into various categories. because the records are not that explicit. We have records of who applies for these H1B visas. but we do not and are unable to get a count on how they actually are distributed. We need that information if we are going to do the kind of longterm focus that I think necessary to properly oversee this whole program. To that end. and in addition to getting numbersthanks to an initiative that Senator KYL. a member of our subcommittee. has proposedwe include in the legislation the conducting of a study by the National Science Foundation to try to more accurately gauge our hightech. skilled worker needs. During the deliberations on this legislation in the committee when we had our hearings and so on. a lot of different issues were raised as to what the real longterm needs will be. Senator KYL. I think. has wisely proposed because our program is a 5year program with a sunset that we. in a shorter period of time. study the actual situation. what the real needs are today. what are likely to be long term. to determine whether the projections in such things as the Commerce Department study bear out. Finally. as I said. our legislation is aimed at being both a shortterm as well as a longterm fix. The shortterm fix is to increase the number of H1B visas. The longterm fix is to provide various mechanisms by which American workers can be trained to fill these jobs. Thus. a key part of our legislation is a scholarship authorization which authorizes funds for scholarships in science and math for needy students. We have worked very closely with the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on this part of the legislation. We will be talking about it. I think. a little bit later. We have worked with Senators COLLINS and REED who have been involved in the higher education reauthorization bill to try to make sure our language tracks the language in that legislation. And we believe that. by focusing more resources on science and math and computer science training. we can have an excellent chance of meeting some of the longterm needs that have been referenced in my remarks today. That is essentially what the legislation attempts to do. It also attempts to provide protection. protection for American workers to make certain the HlB program is not abused. Already in the existing program I believe there is a very firm set of protections that stand as safeguards for American workers. Essentially. what those protections are is a requirement that anyone who brings somebody to this country under the H1B visa program must pay that individual the higher of the prevailing wage or the salary in their company paid to people of like experience and skill. We think that is a pretty effective approach and it has proven to be effective. In the entire history of the H1B program there have been only eight willful violations determined to have existed. But it was our view that if we were going to increase the numbers we should also increase the vigilance with which we look at this program and the penalties against anyone who might seek to take advantage of it. So in addition to the aforementioned components of the legislation. our bill does the following: It increases from $1.000 to $5.000 per violation the fines to be imposed on any company that fails to meet that standard I indicated of requiring an H1B individual to be paid the higher of the prevailing wage in the industry or the actual salaries paid in that company for this type of position. Furthermore. in an attempt to make certain that no one in any way attempts to lay off an American worker to bring in an H1B employee. we impose a $25.000 fine per violation and a 2year debarment from the program where anyone violates the prevailing wage rule and it is determined has laid off somebody to fill the position with an H1B worker. In short. I think we have taken the steps necessary to guarantee that abuses in this program will not occur. And. as I said. at least in its history so far. very few have occurred. The legislation enjoys broad support. support here on the floor of the Senate on a bipartisan basis. support throughout the business community. It has been endorsed by the United States Chamber of Commerce. the National Association of Manufacturers. Tech Neta hightech trade organizationthe Information Technology Association of America. the Motion Picture Association of America. and numerous other organizations. It. likewise. enjoys broad support of the academic community. because many of these H1B workers actually come to the country and assume jobs in academia teaching American kids the skills needed to fill these hightech jobs. As a consequence. the legislation is endorsed by the Association of American Universities. the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges. and the American Council on Education. It is similarly supported by a broad array of heritage groups. including the National Asian PacificAmerican Legal Immigration Consortium. National Immigration Forum. the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. the PolishAmerican Congress. Bnai Brith. and a variety of others. I will summarize later why this legislation must be passed. but I think in this opening statement I have laid out the key essentials. Right now. against the backdrop of very low unemployment in this country. we have a shortage of skilled workers. We need to address that on both the short- andlongterm basis. Our legislation tries to do both. In the shortterm sense. we increase the cap on H1B workers to come to this country. We need that or else we are going to see American jobs lost. not gained. This is not a zero sum situation. Mr. President. Without change in this cap. without doing it soon. we will start to see a very significant impact. I believe. in our hightech industries. Mr. President. I yield the floor. We expect to have additional speakers on our side as the afternoon goes on."},{"1":"1997","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I strongly support this motion to restore funding to the National Endowment for the Arts. I am grateful that the other body has more clearly understood the value of the NEA and has in its wisdom not only rejected efforts to eliminate the agency. but has also rejected efforts that would have dramatically altered the fundamental structure and mission of the NEA. The NEA has a proven track record of supporting the creation of excellent art and facilitating Americans access to it. For 30 years the NEA has helped bring art and culture to those who otherwise would be without it. The NEA is sometimes accused of being elitist. but just the opposite is the case. Before the NEA. there were 38 orchestras in the country just 30 years ago. Today there are more than 1.000. Before the NEA. there were 37 professional dance companies. Now there are 300. Before the NEA. 30 years ago. only I million people attended theater each year. Today more than 55 million attend. All of this because of the NEA. The NEA plays a crucial role in the nonprofit arts industry. which supports 1.3 million jobs and generates more than $3.4 billion in Federal income taxes. We cannot afford either culturally or economically to eliminate the NEA. I am especially pleased that the House of Representatives will now finally be allowed to vote on whether or not to fund the NEA. Earlier this year the leadership of this House took extraordinary steps to prevent the House from even considering funding the NEA. On the controversial vote on the rule. several Members of Congress who have supported the arts in the past and had pledged to support the NEA failed to do so at that critical moment. I hope that these Members in particular will seize this opportunity to demonstrate their support for the NEA by voting for this motion to instruct conferees. I urge all of my colleagues to support the National Endowment for the Arts and to vote to accept the Senate funding level of $100 million for the NEA."},{"1":"1996","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. this should not be a contest to see who is more for the environment.

I yield back the remainder of my time."},{"1":"1995","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. we have just concluded the debate and the vote on the appropriations bill for the Education. Labor. and Human Services portion of the budget. We have almost concluded the entire appropriations process. The big one left. of course. is the Department of Defense. This process moves us a little further along the road toward the remaking of America. Speaker GINGRIcH and the Republican majority have said they intend to remake America. Speaker GINGRICH also says that politics is war without blood. So we have concluded the first phase of the war. The Contract With America with Just a warmup. The budget and appropriations process really opened the blitzkrieg. The first phase of the blitzkrieg is about to come to an end. I think it is important to take this time to note that it has been devastating indeed. The people of America. the caring majority. the majority of the people in America. have been the victims of the beginning of this scorched Earth policy. Tremendous cuts have been made already. and this is just the first year in the effort to balance the budget in a 7year period. This is the easiest one. These cuts will escalate greatly over the next few years. So whatever has begun today. as horrible as it may be. is only the beginning. It is very important that the American people understand that this is only the beginning. and $9 billion was cut from the Health and Human Services and Education and Labor budget. $9 billion for the budget year that begins October 1 1995 and goes to September 30. 1996. If $9 billion was cut in this first round. you can imagine how much more will have to be cut and will be cut in the second round. the next budget year. because the budget for this year still leaves the Republicans. who are controlling the process now. with a deficit of $170 billion. the HouseSenate budget that concluded. under which we are laboring with respect to the appropriations now. That budget still left us with a deficit in 1996 of $170 billion. Over the next 7 years. that deficit will go down from $170 billion to a surplus of $.614 billion in the year 2002. In order to get that deficit down and end up with a surplus In the year 2002. drastic additional cuts have to be made. So it is important to understand where we are in the process of the remaking of America. in the process of this war without blood. Speaker GINGRICH says that politics is war without blood. but he did not say it was without pain and he did not say it was without suffering. And there is a lot of blood. too. I think it is very important to note that in the process of making budget cuts in the appropriations process. the Committee on Appropriations went far beyond its jurisdiction. and they did a lot of legislating. against the rules. they violated the rules. This majority violates the rules whenever they see fit. and they have the same kind of contempt for rules that dictators and tyrants have. Rules are just to be played with the bourgeoisie and the folks who believe in little words on pieces of paper. They violate them when they get ready. So a massive violation of the rules occurred in this appropriations process with respect to the Labor. Education. and Human Services appropriation. They had a large number of legislative matters introduced into the process. One of those matters related to the enforcement of health and safety standards on jobs by OSHA. the Occupational Health and Safety Administration. One of those legislated items cut the effectiveness of OSHA by onethird. By cutting the budget by onethird and specifically saying that the cuts have to apply to the enforcement process. OSHAs enforcement administration. enforcement process. the people in charge of enforcing the rules and regulations on health and safety. they could not spend but twothirds of their last years budget. They are cut by onethird. That is going to cause not just pain and suffering. but there will be some bleeding and dying. because last year in America 10.000 workers bled and died on the job. Another 46.000 died as a result of diseases contracted or as a result of health conditions contracted on the job. They died elsewhere. but right on the job 10.000 died. So in this process of making budget cuts. they have also legislated a less safe environment for all the workers in America. They have declared war on workers. and that war has casualties. That war has a body count. The body count and the casualties will go on. There were many other areas within this appropriations process where the Committee on Appropriations usurped the powers of the authorizing committees and legislated. They changed the National Labor Relations Boards ability to operate by cutting them by 30 percent. They are going after the workers. A major target in this war are working people. They say unions. They have a vendetta against the unions. They want to get revenge on the unions. But working people out there. most of them in America do not even belong to unions. In the process of getting revenge on he unions. they are destroying conditions for working people in general."},{"1":"1994","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"We are driven by some forces that are irrational here. I said before I hope welfare reform does not become revenge on the poor where we throw away any reason because there Is a scream out there by people who really do not know who the fat cats on welfare are. and do not realize they are being swindled out of their taxpayers money day in and day out by people who are in some cases billionaires. They just see poor people and they want to get revenge. get rid of any benefits that they are getting. and they lose their perspective. we lose our perspective and we create more problems than we solve. We are going to scar and hurt children in ways that will make it more costly for society in the future. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii. I am going to have to leave now. but I look forward to further dialogues with her. I hope that the American people are watching closely as we develop this welfare reform program. The gentlewoman has facts and statistics and Is on top of the program and following the development of the plans in a way which is commendable. and I look forward to the use of her monitoring of the program as a resource. I have in my district large numbers of people who are on welfare. I have large numbers of people on welfare who tell me all of the time that they would like very much to get off. Nobody seems to want to stay on welfare. And one of the major problems they point out right away is that they cannot find a Job. and the jobs that they find do not have health care. And immediately. if you have a child. the first thing you worry about is being able to have some way to deal with their health problems that will not cost you an arm and a leg. They just cannot on a minimum wage job. and most of the Jobs are minimum wage Jobs. where they can barely make ends meet in terms of food. clothing. and shelter. and if the child gets sick. if you do not have health care. you are wiped out. And I imagine that many of the mothers. you say they leave welfare and they come back. I would wager if a detailed study and analysis were made of why they come back. a sick child probably is often one of the reasons that they come back. We want welfare reform. I am all for welfare reform. I am all for the principle that people should not accept any Federal handouts. any government subsidies. you know. without a closed end. It should not be on and on assistance. it should not go on and on without some kind of a terminal point. But that should apply across the board to everybody. all Federal subsidies. all assistance to victims. And I think that if there is going to be a 2year rule for welfare. we ought to calculate how much money is involved in that. It may be that even in very liberal States like Hawaii and New York we are talking about $15.000 a year as a subsidy. which over a 2year period would be $30.000. and that may be the standard. $30.000 of assistance to all victims in America. If you are a victim of anything. if you are a victim of an earthquake you are entitled to $30.000. If you are victim of a flood. you are entitled to $30.000 worth of assistance. If you are a victim of a hurricane you are entitled to $30.000 worth of assistance. The farmers. they have already gotten their $30.000 a long time ago. But maybe we will give them 2 more years at 30.000 a piece. and the ranchers who are grazing on the lands for free. and making big profits. we give them $30.000 worth of discounted grazing. and that is it. Let us be fair right across the board. and we would save a lot of money by being fair. having the same standard apply to them. and we would save a lot of money that would allow us to be able to provide the kinds of Job training. and the kinds of education and child care that would solve the welfare problem. It is a pleasure to hold this discourse with the gentlewoman. and I look forward to it in the future."},{"1":"1993","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I am pleased to introduce H.R. 2474 today on behalf of myself and 14 colleagues. Democrats and Republicans. liberals. conservatives. Members of this body from the North. Midwest. and West. This legislation would assist members of the Armed Forces affected by defense reductions in obtaining employment with law enforcement agencies. Today. there are thousands of talented. highly educated. highly trained. highly motivated men and women out of work due to defense cutbacks. As a cochairman of the California Delegations Task Force on Defense Reinvestment and Economic Development. and as a U.S. Representative from Long Beach and Los Angeles. CA urban communities struggling with military cutbacks and increasing crime rates. I feel that our Nation has a unique opportunity to encourage. throughout America. these highly skilled people toward a career in law enforcement. Police and sheriffs departments are understaffed and overworked. Since 1988. the Department of Defense has put 530.000 active duty and civilian personnel out of work. Last year alone. the military cut 178.000 active duty personnel. Estimates of private sector defenserelated layoffs. resulting from the last 6 years of defense cuts. approach 1 million individuals. To put these figures into perspective. the country was shocked following General Motors announcement in 1991 that it would lay off 75.000 people over a 4year period. Laying off 1/2 million to 2 million people in terms of civilian and military personnel is certainly the equivalent to 20 to 30 General Motors announcements. I am introducing this legislation for two reasons: First. to assist the dedicated men and women who have been affected by defense reductions. and second. but not least. to put more police on the streets in order to protect our neighborhoods. our schools. and our businesses. We have a unique opportunity to.channel the talents of those who once worked to keep this country and this globe safe from aggression toward efforts to make our local communities safe from internal aggression once again. Whether in Charleston. SC. or Los Angeles. CA. able and imaginative police chiefs have shown that communitybased policing and more police on the streets works. During the recent potential for disturbances in Los Angeles. the very able chief of police of Los Angeles. Chief Willie Williams showed that more police on duty and visible to the community is a deterrent to crime. Under this proposal. a member of the military who has been involuntarily separated from the Armed Forces may apply for law enforcement training and employment. The local jurisdiction must hire participants in the program for at least a period of 2 years. The Department of Defense would reimburse 100 percent of the participants salary for the first year of employment. 80 percent in the second year. with 20 percent from the locality. 60 percent in the third year. with 10 percent from the locality: 40 percent in the fourth year. with now 60 percent from the locality. and 20 percent in the fifth year. with 80 percent from the local jurisdiction. and then. of course. in the sixth year the responsibility is completely that of the county or city which is responsible for that law enforcement service. Individuals accepted Into this program must agree to serve at least 2 years as a law enforcement officer for the jurisdiction that provided the training. Threequarters of the resources of this program will be allocated to the States on the basis of population. That is. If a State has 4 percent of the Nations population. then that State will receive up to 4 percent of the resources available under this portion of the act. For onequarter. 25 percent of the resources. priority will be given to jurisdictions experiencing an especially high crime rate. as determined by the Attorney General of the United States. Finally. at least one jurisdiction perI State will be made eligible to participate In the high crime rate portion of this program. I am pleased that President Clinton recognizes the need for law enforcement expansion. The White House Domestic Policy Council is currently looking into a police corps program for retraining veterans and discharged military. Last year. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman SAM NUNN introduced legislation with much the same purpose as what I and my colleagues are introducing today. His proposal. which was approved as part of the Defense authorization bill. provides retirement benefits to encourage and assist separating military personnel to enter public or community service jobs such as education and health care. as well as law enforcement. The legislation we are introducing today builds upon the program established by Senator NUNN by training a greater number of those affected by the defense cutbacks exclusively for law enforcement. If you knock on the door in most urban neighborhoods. they will say there are two problems that confront them: One is the level of crime. and the other Is the quality of their childrens education. Both are related. To have learning occur In out schools. we need to control the criminal activity that surrounds all too many of our schools. If all of the resources available under this act are not used by members of the Armed Forces who are involuntarily separated. the Secretary of Defense may extend the program to include Department of Defense civilians and defense contractor employees who have lost their jobs due to defense cutbacks. There has been increasing concern about incidents of crime In the United States. and correctly so. In Los Angeles and other major cities. there are repeated incidents of violent crimes. murder. rape. robbery. assault. and the new phenomenon of carjackings which has also resulted in deaths of the drivers and sometimes the passengers involved. There is a clear need for more law enforcement on our streets. and out proposed program can help accomplish just that. In recent years. drugs and violence have taken over too many of our streets. too many of out neighborhoods. too many of out housing projects. and even Infiltrated out schools. The chance of being a victim of a violent crime is greater than that of being hurt In a traffic accident. Between 1990 and 1991 the number of violent crimes attempted against our residents went up 11 percent. That Is a significant increase. Mr. Speaker. I am enclosing an article from todays Washington Post on gang violence. long associated with major urban areas. Now It Is spreading even to Midwestern cities such as Wichita. KS. Currently. many of our cities are under serious desperate financial constraints. Recently. the National Association of Chiefs of Police surveyed every chief of police and sheriff in the United States. Almost 74 percent of those sheriffs and chiefs of police believe that their law enforcement department is presently undermanned to carry out the duties expected of the elected officials and expected of them by the citizens. Keep in mind that more police will save money. We must not forget that crime costs money in a variety of areas: medical costs. property damage. court costs. jail costs. and costs of police work associated with each crime. Additionally. there are the intangible costs of lost sales in the area. and lost productivity of victims and witnesses to the crime. The connection between peace In the streets and economic growth is clear. As Richard Riordan. the recently elected mayor of Los Angeles. has said. No business wants to locate in a war zone. Because more police will mean less crime. the economic climate in our hardhit urban areas will Improve. It will reduce the rationale for businesses to leave. and it will increase the chances that businesses will locate there. It will also provide struggling businesses and new businesses with a better chance to survive. This bill will also provide jobs for many outstanding members of ethnic and racial minorities who. in turn. will serve as vitally needed role models for out inner city youth. Black and Hispanic individuals are certainly affected by defense cutbacks since black Americans comprise approximately 23 percent of out enlisted force and 7 percent of the military officer corps. Similarly. Hispanic Americans constitute 5 percent of the enlisted force and 2 percent of the military officer corps. This Nation has been looking fo a plan to attack violent crime. Men and women who are displaced as a result of the defense cuts can help tip the balance against the criminals who have declared war against those who live In urban America. This is a worthy proposal that all Members can support. regardless of party or Ideology. It fulfills several of the most basic functions for which our Government was established: To establish justice. insure domestic tranquility. promote the general welfare. anti secure the blessings of liberty to outselves and out posterity. Nothing will aid us to achieve these noble goals more than helping our citizens overcome the threat to their lives. liberties. and pursuit of happiness that resuits from the epidemic of crime that is rampant in too many and too much In out cities. Crime is not a partisan issue. This is a bill that Democrats and Republicans. conservatives and liberals. can support. It is a vitally needed measure at a very critical time. This proposal is in the national interest because it helps offer protection for out children. out homes. and our neighborhood. . I am pleased that this bill has the support of the Non Commissioned Officers Association. Mr. Speaker. I would like to note my colleagues who joined in this effort. The principal coauthor is EDOLPIUS TOWNS. Democrat of New York. and he is joined by BEN GILMAN. Republican of New York. DAVID HOBSON. Republican of Ohio. NANCY JOHNSON. Republican of Connecticut.

Democrat of New York: CHRISTOPHER SIIAYS. Republican of Connecticut: ESTEBAN TORRES. Democrat of California: JAMES TRAFICANT. Democrat of Ohio: FRED UPTON. Republican of Michigan. and HENRY WAXMAN. Democrat of California. They see in this legislation as I see In this legislation and I hope all in this Chamber and all Americans will see. an opportunity to deal with one of the most serious problems that affects millions of Americans either through violent crimes having been committed upon hundreds of thousands of them or the fear of crime that keeps citizens from going out and enjoying the quality of life that our cities do offer. We need to overcome the fear citizens have who would stay in their homes. and we need to once again assure there are safe streets. safe neighborhoods. and a safe society.

Hal Braymans service to this institution is indeed remarkable. His commitment to public policy and his untiring effort these many years to help many of us around here produce good legislation. particularly in the area of water resources and public infrastructure. is well known. Mr. President. I first met Hal Brayman in his capacity as a staff person on the Environmental and Public Works Committee in my first term in the Senate. Those early years working with Hal Brayman and Lee Rawls were immortalized in a book written in 1980 by T.R. Reid. of the Washington Post. entitled Congressional Odyssey. the Saga of a Senate Bill. Hal. who had recently come to the Environment and Public Works Committee from being a legislative assistant to Senator Caleb Boggs. brought with him an unerring desire to reform the Corps of Engineers inland waterway financing structure. The tenacious determination of this Princeton and Columbia graduate resulted in the first user charge bill ever enacted affecting the inland waterways of this country. The Inland Navigation Improvements Act of 1977. however. did more than just establish good public policy. As T.R. Reid wrote: It was the one thing I remember most from my first six years here. It instilled confidence in my ability to accomplish things up here. It helped me to become a better Senator. For this I owe Hal a big debt of gratitude. His work did not end there. A decade later. the Congress adopted landmark legislation. the Water Resources Act. which was crafted by Hal through the Water Resources Committee which I chaired at that time. This statute com-. pletely reformed the Corps of Engineers water resource programs. He has been one of the leaders in developing the concept of environmental infrastructure bonds as a way to address needed infrastructure investments. In addition. in his capacity as a professional staff member of the Environment and Public Works Committee he worked on all the major environmental laws of the 1970s and 1980s. He has worked on transportation legislation. the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts. and the major resource conservation laws. More recently he has been directly Involved in helping to find ways to reform our campaign financing. mechanisms. Hals nearly 16 years on the Environment and Public Works Committee. and these last 5 years on the Budget Committee has brought him in contact with many of my current and former fellow Senators. I know they and all his friends and fellow staffers join me in wishing him health and continued success in a well deserved retirement from the Senate. I can only believe that he has left his mark on public policy. and fortunately for the country. I believe we can all agree that it was and is a good mark. I note that Senators MITCHELL. DOLE. SASSER. and others have cosponsored this. I think that is an indication of what Hal Brayman. who served here for 22 years. has meant to this Senate. the Environment and Public Works CJommittee. the Budget Committee for a litany of accomplishments and service. He is going to leave us and take a bit of a sabbatical and perhaps bicycle across America. and he will come back and decide what he wants to do. He has a lot of life left in him. This resolution details what he did for this institution called the Senate. It should be obvious from it that many Senators were served by him and helped by him. 49059 G95 Vol. 137 (Pt. 4) 4"},{"1":"1990","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. the other day the Nation was focused on the stock market. a 50point drop. a 100point drop back up to 50 points down.

But the only problems today are for workers. defense workers are being laid off. workers who own homes suddenly find the values of their homes being lost. What is the White House doing?

I appreciate the remarks of the distinguished Senator from Idaho and I appreciate the intent with which he gives them. I. too. want to see the finest people come into Government. But I could not disagree with him more on doing It on this bill and the way we are going about it. I think we have within this bill. the seeds of the destruction of the civil service system of the U.S. Government. I do not overstate that one iota. If we want to start shuffling people around and paying special pay for this and that and something else. then this bill is the appropriate way to do it. I did not call the amendments up yet. but my remarks will be addressed to amendments 458. 460. and 461. which deal with different aspects of this particular problem. I rise to speak in opposition to several sections of the Defense bill. I speak as a member of the Armed Services Committee. I opposed this in committee. and I oppose It on the floor because I think it is flat wrong. I agree we should be getting good people in the Government. I have talked personally to Energy Secretary Watkins. I know the problems he is having. I know the problems we are having at NIH. I know the problems we are having at NASA. I know the problems we have getting good people at DARPA. If we are to make a new policy. as the administration has begun to propose with their pay proposal. and if we are going to say. OK. we are going to pay what we have to pay in whatever branch of Government to get these people. then that is a whole new departure from the protections of civil service and the equities of civil service that have guided our Government employment policies for a long. long time and done very well. What is at the base of our problem here? Did the Senator vote for the pay increase for the Congress? I do not know. I have not checked it. There were not many Senators who voted for it. I know that. That is at the heart of our problem. We do not have guts enough in this body to get up and say since civil service pay is linked to the Congress. the pay of the Judiciary is linked to the Congress. that we. in fact. should take care of that problem. We do not have guts enough to do that. We dance all over the lot on it. So we wind up with pay scales of our civil servants being below what they should be. I agree with that. We cannot always get the right people into Government at our present rates of pay. NIH has had 20 percent of their top staff quit in the last 10 years to go other places. Are we to ignore them. ignore NASA? Greg Field was over at DARPA and he was before our committee. He was not testifying on this particular subject. but I talked to him before the hearing about this at DARPA. the people used to line up to try and get their 4- or 5year stint at DARPA in order to get it on their recordbecause it was such a high visibility. highly technical program. He is having trouble getting fully qualified people. That would argue in one respect in favor of what was done in the Senate Armed Services Committee. But I oppose this provision because I think it may well wreck civil service. Sections of this defense bill authorize numerous exemptions from civil service limitations on pay. This bill waives the civil procurement integrity restrictions and criminal conflictofinterest laws for people at DOE. Did anyone hear that? The civil procurement integrity restrictions and criminal conflictofinterest laws are waived. We worked on creating those restrictions for years around here. In particular. I rise to oppose three sections of the bill which. if enacted. will begin the dismantlement of the civil service as we know it. Sections 843 and 3142 would. respectively. permit DOD to pay 500 persons. and section 3142 would permit DOE to pay 25 persons. 525 persons total. as much as 150 percent of the pay applicable to executive level II salaries. This would permit them to be paid approximately $135.000 a year. more than the vice President of the United States. Section 3142. which covers DOD personnel. would also waive dual compensation limits and allow those individuals to make as much as $180.000 a year. Section 3142 would also waive criminal conflictofinterest restrictions. It would waive criminal conflictofinterest restrictions and procurement integrity legislation which applies to Federal employees. I believe this makes the provision objectionable on a variety of grounds. Let me go on to another section. section 845. It is a waiver of current dual compensation provisions in the current law for 1.000 employees of DOD. The effect of this change would be to allow retired military. but not civilian personnel to accept their pensions and a full Government salary. Mr. President. I have some sympathy with this one. I must admit. I was a military retiree before I came to the Senate. I thought that was earned income that I had done without all those years. and I do not like these restrictions that say you have to give up some of what you have earned in order to come in here and serve as people do in other branches of Government. But this is not the way to take care of that problem. as I see it. The problem here is we are doing it Just for these employees of DOD. 1.000 of them. and at the same time you are telling the civilian employees who are retired and getting their retired pay. no. they cannot come back and get that same waiver. What on Earth is fair about that? You say. well. military retirees have the option of retiring at an earlier date. OK. what about your civil service employees who have 30 years in. they are in their late 50s. they retire. why should they be excluded from coming back and getting another 10 years of employment if they wanted to? We freeze them out with this. We say it only applies to military. We give 1.000 military retirees this option. As many of you know. I serve both as chairman of the Manpower Subcommittee on Armed Servicesit deals with those manpower matters in this bill before usand also I am chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. Under the Governmental Affairs Committee. we deal with civil service. These two posts have given me a very keen sense of the problems of the civil service and the overall problem created by failure to provide adequate pay raises to dedicated Government employees. I have often spoken of the crisis facing the Federal Government because of our inability. addressed just a moment ago. to hire and retain an adequate cadre of scientific and technical personnel. While this problem certainly exists at DOE and other hightechnology mission agencies. it is a problem that exists not just there. not just DOD. not just DOE. but across the whole length and breadth of Government. wherever we need highly technical people or highly trained management people for this $1.2 trillion budget that we try to administer every year. Similar problems exist at NASA. NIH. all other places where the Government requires topflight scientific and technical personnel. In fact. apart from these types of technical personnel. it equally affects other disciplines. For example. the FBI. and other law enforcement agencies can legitimately claim they suffer problems in staffing retention due to salary restraints. and in particular. recruiting agents for areas of high living expenses. Therefore. I am aware of the problems DOD authorization bills special pay provisions are attempting to address. As chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. I must recognize there are larger issues here that need to be addressed. I believe we need to address our scientific and technical manpower problems on something more than an ad hoc agencybyagency basis. Taking piecemeal action like this Just encourages delay in dealing with the larger problem and will allow certain favored departments to be the beneficiaries of salary largess while others lacking the same political clout will fall behind. Endorsing any of the exceptions to the civil service structure that are contained in this bill. particularly those which create separate pay systems allowing up to 150 percent normal Government salaries. would be particularly illtimed given that the Bush administration has recently tendered a pay proposal that would address the scientific and technical pay problems Governmentwide. That proposal has been referred to the Governmental Affairs Committee. It would create 200 such positions Governmentwide. And. remember. this provision that we are talking about this evening right here creates 500 such positions in DOD alone. We should consider that proposal and those of the Members of the Senate before addressing the Federal Government scientific and technical personnel problems in such a piecemeal fashion. The Governmental Affairs Committee. which I chair. plans to hold hearings on the administrations pay proposal in the near future. I know some of my colleagues. particularly Senator PRYOR and Senator STvaNs. the chairman and ranking member of the Civil Service Subcommittee. have very strong opinions on these issues and are looking forward to hearing the many witnesses who undoubtedly wish to address these issues. I believe this issue could await the outcome of those discussions. I know also. over in the House. Congressman FoRD. in a discussion with him this afternoon that some of the staff had. indicates that there already are things under way that we were aware of before. discussions with OMB in trying to get a satisfactory pay package that will address this thing Governmentwide. I cannot guarantee we will get it through this year. I can guarantee we are working on it. I know the other thing that will be brought up is I promised this same thing last year that we were going to address this in the new year. I said let us not piecemeal it last year. What I depended on. and I was wrong in my dependency. but I depended on the Senate to have some common sense and vote for a pay raise that would have taken care of this whole thing so that we could move on to consideration of raises for civil service. technical pay. whatever was needed to get the right pay scales in Government. to get the talented people in that we need and must have. We got stopped dead in our tracks because we did not have the guts as Senators to vote that kind of a pay raise and get it through the Congress. So I got sidetracked on that. and I am the first to admit that that is what happened this year. So we were not able to fulfill that promise of last year when I stood on the floor and made promises that we were going to deal with this thing as soon as we got into the new year. Mr. President. I would like to address sections 843 and 3142 in the bill. compensation for critical personnel. I have the following specific objections to each of the provisions in the civil service area. With respect to the 150 percent pay provision. in the interest of preventing chaos and maintaining a unified civil service. it is important that Congress continue its moratorium on approving different pay plans for individual agencies. If we allow DOD and DOE to exercise special pay authority. then how do we say you cannot do it. with the same latitude for the SEC. NASA. NIH. and all the other agencies which have asked Congress repeatedly for special pay authority. If this provision is allowed in the defense bill. every member of a standing authorization or appropriation committee will see the agencies they oversee making the case. and the justified case. for such provisions of their agencies. How will you be able to stem this gold rush once you breach the principle of civil service pay in this way? How will you be able to distinguish the legitimate need of one agency from another? I believe a special pay program of this sort could have an extremely negative impact on civil service as a whole. The effect of the program would be higher pay for a select few and demoralization for all the rest in the workplace. How long will it be before the politically correct civil servant obtains the rewards of higher pay versus colleagues who do not play politics on the job but simply represent the best interests of the taxpayer? Allowing certain employees to make 150 percent of executive level II salary. as this bill currently provides. would mean that some scientists and engineers could make more than the Vice President of the United States. This is a ludicrous possibility and one we should not establish at this time. Let us channel our energies into obtaining a decent pay raise for all civil servants and for Congress and the judiciary and then turn our attention to the special programs where greater incentive pay is needed. And I agree with that. Not in this way and in this manner. Mr. President. I would also like to address section 845. the waiver of dual compensation provisions. Is this just a limited pay raise plan in disguise for certain lucky military employees under this plan? All 1.000 employees authorized by the amendment could retire tomorrow. draw their full military pension and a Government salary as well. Now. at a minimum should this section of the bill be passed. there should be a mandatory waiting period before military retirees drawing their full pension can also draw a Government salary. We should not have people simply change clothes from military to civilian dress and keep the same position with greater pay. What criterion will be used to designate the lucky thousand? The bill is silent in this regard. I said before I have a great sympathy for that. I do not like it that my military retirement. which I thought I earned by giving many years service with lesser pay for that retirement incomeit was like deferred income. We looked at it that way. We talked about it that way. So I have great sympathy for taking away those restrictions. but not Just for a favored thousand in the Department of Defense with no such provisions for other agencies and no such provision for civil service personnel that have retired. Finally. there is just a fairness issue at stake here. It is not logically consistent to allow military retirees to return to work with full pensions while disallowing civilian retirees the same privilege. Will we now make such a provision available for civilian retirees? How do we keep people from retiring in name only. so they can collect a pension and a salary for the same position. be they military or civilian employees? What is fair about that? Mr. President. there is an old saying that hard cases make bad law. Sections 843. 3142. and 845 represent an attempt to address an admittedly difficult problem in recruitment and retention of good people for critical positions in Government. But the proposed remedy may bring with it a host of equally or more serious problems. If we have not the courage to completely decouple congressional pay from executive branch pay so that all Government employees can be treated fairly. then let us not destroy the civil service system by arbitrary assignment of special pay and privileges to a select few in order to reduce the pressure on us to do the right thing for the entire Government work force. Let us be clear about this. The problem these sections of the bill try to address has been created by the failure of Congress to raise its own pay. Having failed to do that. we are now going to dismantle without hearings. without careful deliberation. a structure that in past years has served us I think very well. Perhaps there is a need for the establishment of additional pay bands in Government. If so. it should be carefully examined and commented on by those who have devoted parts or all of their lives and careers to studying the public service. Proposals in sections 843. 3142. and 845 have not been subJected to such scrutiny. Until they are. I cannot support them and I urge my colleagues to vote for my amendment to strike them from the bill before us. Now. there are two related provisions in this bill concerning senior DOE managers which I believe create very serious concerns. Some of the concerns are similar to the ones expressed previously concerning specific DOD exemptions. These DOE provisions can be found in section 3142 of the bill. It begins at page 444. Summarizing these provisions. they allow the Secretary of Energy to designate 25 senior Jobs as critical positions and fill those jobs with persons from outside DOE. Again. unlike normal Government servants. these persons can also be paid up to 150 percent of a normal Government executive salary so long as they stay in Government. There is no limit on them. Dual compensation limitations will be waived for them. One could only speculate as to the impact this will have on the morale of Government employees who perform similar work for their significantly more modest Government salaries. Secondand this one is even more disturbing to meif these individuals are drawn from one of several DOEsponsored laboratories. they will be exempted from all civil procurement integrity law restrictions and the criminal laws of the United States. 18 United States Code 207 and 208. concerning conflicts of interest will be waived. The practical effect of these provisions could be devastating to the fair operations of the Departments contracting and decisionmaking powers. To give an example. pursuant to these provisions DOE could hire a senior employee from one of the DOE laboratories who will then be vested with sweeping powers over admiinistrative. budget. and procurement authority. These authorities could be used consciously or unconsciously to benefit the laboratory from which the critical employee is drawn. and to which he or she intends to return. No effort has been made to encourage even minimal limitations upon such possible activities by such usual methods of requiring recusal where possible. or limiting power over procurement sensitive source selection information. or limiting control of budget authority with regard to the laboratories from which the person comes. It would be human nature for any person given such powers to look favorably upon his own programs. his own laboratory. indeed his own future. In addition. based on the loose drafting of this section. it does not appear that the person who benefits from such dispensation is limited to returning to the lab from which they came. although I am told that is the committees intent. I believe this also is very bad policy. and that it will encourage a process of balkanizing our ethics in civil service laws. I am very sympathetic to the concerns of the Secretary of Energy. who feels that DOEs level of expertise is so woeful he can only obtain the type of help he needs at the expense of dispensations from the usual terms of Government service. I have talked to him personally about these things. and I am very concerned about how he is going to staff some of the positions over there. But without more meaningful limitations upon these powers. this provision simply opens up the Government to potential fraud. waste. and abuse. Once we breach the conflictofinterest laws for DOE. will we breach them next month or next year for DOE. NASA. National Science Foundation. and others? Mr. President. those are my concerns. I know there are others who wish to speak on this particular subject. At the appropriate time it would be my intention to combine amendments 458. 460. and 461 and ask to consider them together and ask that sections 843. 845. and 3142 be taken out of the Department of Defense authorization bill that we have before us on the floor. Mr. President. I yield the floor. or stand by for questions if people have any questions."},{"1":"1988","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. in my home State of Nevada. as in States throughout our Nation. many single mothers cannot afford to work.

Either bill could help provide child care for families who qualify and who are beyond the welfare and Job training stages. Both bills cannot become law.

That bill had three titles. Title I reauthorized the National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology Assessment. the National Center for Health Statistics. and several preventive health programs within the Public Health Service Act. Title II created a National Health Service Corps loan repayment program. Title III revised and extended provisions dealing with the National Health Service Corps.

This bill contained provisions paralleling those in titles II and III of S. 1158. The House then substituted the text of H.R. 1327. as amended. for the companion Senate bill. S. 1158. On October 13. 1987. the House passed by voice vote H.R. 3189. the Health Services Research Extension Act of 1987. This bill contained provisions paralled to ones in title I of S. 1158. Because the two bills were not controversial. the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee decided to resolve the differences and incorporate the agreement into a Senate amendment to S. 1158. in lieu of holding a conference. Last Tuesday. October 27. 1987. the Senate passed. by unanimous consent. S. 1158 after amending the House amendment with an amendment which represents the agreement between our two committees. I urge the House to concur in the Senate amendment and pass S. 1158 as amended. While this bill is not controversial. its provisions are essential to public health in this country. S. 1158 would extend the authorizations for the National Health Service Corps field program for 3 fiscal yearsfiscal years i98890at $65 million a year. In addition. the bill would extend the authorizations for the corps scholarship program and create a loan repayment program. The authorizations for both programs is such sums as necessary. The loan repayment program would pay off the loans that a doctor takes out to go to medical school. In return. the doctor would serve in a health manpower shortage area. The National Health Service Corps has always enjoyed bipartisan support in the Congress. It has an outstanding track record of placing doctors and other health professionals in medically underserved communities. This fiscal year there are approximately 3.000 corps providers serving in rural and urban sites all over the country. The continuation of the corps is essential because the corps is the only Federal program which attempts to provide needed health care professionals to underserved areas. The corps is needed now and it will always be needed. The areas served by the corps are either so sparsely populated or have such a high incidence of poor people that the private practice of medicine is not economically viable. The corps might appear to be on sound footing because there are approximately 3.000 corps providers now serving in health manpower shortage areas. In fact. the program is in a desperate situation. Without S. 1158. the corps will decline to approximately 1.000 providers in 1990 and to 200 providers in 1993. As the Members will recall. it is because of this rapid decline in the size of the corps that the House bill contained a provision to attract those corps obligors who have breached their agreement to serve in the corps. A special onetime provision was included to relieve defaulters of thier current liability if they reenter the corps in fiscal year 1988 or fiscal year While the Secretary is given a good deal of discretion in administering the provision. the goal for the Secretary is to maximize the number of corps defaulters who can be made available to provide much needed health care services in underserved areas. For example. the Secretary is authorized to remove sites from the supplemental health manpower shortage area placement opportunity list if those sites may reasonably be expected to recruit a health care professional. The Secretary should be sure that the sites have definite. reliable sources for the needed professionals before striking them from the list. If the supplemental list is compiled this way. it will have the maximum number of sites from which defaulters can choose. In addition. the Secretary should quickly establish a placement process for these defaulters that. to the extent possible. resembles the current placement process for corps scholarship obligors. The Congress should not turn its back on the millions of Americans living in areas that are not attractive to private doctors. S. 1158 will provide the necessary authority to maintain this essential program. S. 1158 also reauthorizes for 3 years the programs of the National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology Assessment [NCHSR/HCTA]. and the National Center for Health Statistics [NCHS]. The authorization of appropriations for the Health Services Research Center for fiscal year 1988 is $30 million and for fiscal years 1989 and 1990 is such sums as may be necessary. The authorization of appropriations for the Health Statistics Center is $55 million for fiscal year 1988 and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1989 and 1990. The legislation continues the authority for the council on health care technology operated by the National Academy of Sciences. It requires that at least the same amount of money from nonFederal as from Federal sources be spent in fiscal year 1988 and fiscal year 1989. and at least twice the amount in fiscal year 1990 and subsequent years. The duties of the National Advisory Council on Health Care Technology Assessment operated within the Department of Health and Human Services are defined and the composition of the council is consolidated. Several periodic reports required under existing law are consolidated. and research on rural health care is required. The S. 1158 also requires peer review of research proposals to the National Center for Health Services Research and Health Care Technology Assessment that parallels the peer review of the National Institutes of Health. Language in current law regarding the administrative location of the Center is clarified by specifying that the Center must retain its direct relationship with the office of the Assistant Secretary for Health. S. 1158 further extends the authority of the Federal childhood immunizations program for an additional 3 fiscal years. The authorization of appropriations would be $94 million for fiscal year 1988. and such sums as may be necessary for both fiscal years 1989 and 1990. These funds would be available for grants to States to purchase vaccines that currently are approved and recommended for routine use by children. (including those to prevent polio. measles. mumps. rubella. diphtheria. pertussis. tetanus. and childhood meningitis) as well as to purchase those vaccines that may be approved and recommended for routine use after the date of enactment (such as those to prevent chicken pox and an improved meningitis vaccine. which are expected to be approved and recommended for routine use for children within the next 3 years). With respect to these authorities. S. 1158 includes a provision that specifically prohibits States which receive grant funds for free vaccine from charging for that vaccine. This provision has been included to ensure that no child be turned away from immunizations or be forced to postpone vaccination because of his or her ability to pay for a shot. The imposition of charges for vaccine can only serve as a disincentive to parents for getting their children immunized. a result that would prove detrimental to the great public health advances that have been made since the establishment of the Federal immunization program. It should be noted that this prohibition against charges for vaccine is not intended to prevent grantees from accepting voluntary donations from individuals who have received an immunization through a publicly supported vaccine program. However. donations may only be accepted if given completely freely and not as a condition of receipt of an immunization. In addition to providing for these grant authorities. the bill authorizes appropriations of such sums as may be necessary for the next 3 fiscal years for grant funds for States to assist them in paying for the expected increase in vaccine costs that would result from the imposition of an excise tax on childhood vaccines. This tax would be used to support the childhood vaccine compensation trust fund established through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (title 21 of the Public Health Service Act). The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services is required to acquire and maintain a 6month supply of vaccines. The authorization levels to carry out this activity would be $5 million in fiscal year 1988 and such sums as may be necessary for both fiscal years 1989 and 1990. The legislation also extends the program for tuberculosis control for 3 fiscal years. The program would be authorized at levels of $24 million in fiscal year 1988. $31 million fiscal year 1989. and $36 million in fiscal year 1990. In addition. research and demonstration authorities for immunization. tuberculosis control. and preventive health services are established. Funds for the immunization and tuberculosis research and demonstration programs would be limited to a level up to 10 percent of the grant authorities. No new funds would be authorized for any of the research and demonstration programs. Finally. S. 1158 amends provisions dealing with geriatric medicine training projects to authorize traineeships and fellowships and to permit departments of geriatrics to be eligible grantees. It also clarifies provisions dealing with access to reports of professional review activities. I urge all Members to join me in supporting this important bill. Mr. 8peaker. I reserve the balance of my time."},{"1":"1986","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Madame Speaker. today I voted for the Tax Reform Act of 1986. I voted for the bill because. on the whole. it is a historic step toward real fairness and equity in the tax system. When I voted for the bill. however. I did not forget my most serious objection to the tax bill: the retroactive repeal of the 3year recovery rule for Federal and other public service employees. The repeal of the 3year recovery rule is unfair. It is one of the few retroactive provisions in the tax bill. It will affect thousands of faithful public servants who have carefully planned for their retirement. This amounts to changing the rules in the middle of the game. I opposed this change today. just as I opposed it last December. And I pledge to continue the fight to retain the 3year recovery rule. Today I am joining my colleague. Congresswoman OAKAR. in introducing legislation to restore the 3year recovery rule. By restoring the 3year recovery rule. we will be telling Federal and public service employees that they will not be left behind. And we will be taking an important step toward some of the dignity of public service. so that millions of hardworking Americans do not have to regret the decision to dedicate their lives to their country. When the tax bill first came before the House last December. I voted to send the bill back to the committee because of the proposed repeal of the 3year recovery rule. When the bill went to the Senate. I wrote to Senator PACKWOOD. urging him to retain the 3year recovery rule. The Senate voted to eliminate the rule. but at least it provided for a gradual phaseout. The conference committee bill doesnt even do that. Instead. it slams the door in the face of millions of Federal and public employees. by making the repeal effective as of 3 months ago. Madam Speaker. Federal and public employees are the people who keep this country running. Without them. America could not be the great Nation it is today. However. the Government has repeatedly failed to reward the contributions of its employees. In the past few years. the Government has asked it employees to make great sacrifices: It has cut their benefits. played with their retirement plans. replaced them with more expensive contract workers. and kept their salaries and their pay increases well below those of workers in the private sector. The Government had done about everything possible to remove the prestige and honor which once went with serving ones country. The 3year recovery rule was one of the few special benefits received by Federal employees. helping paritally to offset the sacrifices which these workers make in dedicating themselves to public service. Now. the retroactive repeal of the 3year recovery rule is yet another blow against comparability. a further attack on the dignity as well as the checkbooks of Federal Workers. In the name of fairness. the conference agreement included over $10 billion in special transition rules for a variety of projects. developments. and industries. It is outrageous that when it came to Federal employees. fairness was sacrificed in the name of revenue neutrality. Madam Speaker. I believe that the tax bill as a whole contains too much good for me to vote against it. The tax bill will remove more than 6 million lowincome individuals and families from the income tax rolls. and will significantly reduce the tax burden for millions more lower income families. I was unwilling to lose this unique opportunity to achieve true tax reform. because I believe that if we rejected the bill this time. we would not have another change. But just as I voted for the bill because of fairness. I will fight to restore the 3year recovery rule for the same reason."},{"1":"1985","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker. I rise to support this rule but I would like to make at least a brief mention of why the situation that we find ourselves in in Africa and in other parts of the world and the things that. some were mentioned by our colleague. Mr. SCHzUER. in his remarks a few minutes ago. About 16 years ago. the Agriculture Committee. under then chairman. the distinguished Texan. Mr. W.R. Poage. traveled through the area of Africa that finds itself in drastic trouble. I was among the group that traveled with him and 16 years ago. he said what would happen. exactly his prediction. and he said. Heaven forbid that it ever come to pass. But it has come to pass. The main reason that it happened was just three things: They did not take care of their soil. they did not take care of their water. and they had the wrong system of government. Those three things brought them basically to the situation they find themselves in. They let the farmer fall by the wayside. They did not use the technology that was available. as meager as it might have been. The government did not protect the agricultural section. Merely to say now that. well. the desert is moving south. well. the desert did not have to move south. The desert could have been contained. it may be too late now. Hopefully. it can still be contained. We have to now work in tandem because the nations of the world. including us. cannot sustain for food the countries that are suffering. We have to bring them back to some semblance of productivity at least in the basic areas. The grains. edible beans or the things that they are accustomed to in that particular areas. How odd that we should be debating about the same time keeping our farmers on the land. and keeping the farmers available to conserve the land and to conserve the water so that we might. hopefully. not that we could be in as drastic a situation. because we are so diversified and the good Lord has given us the geography not to have a famine of that proportion. For example. recently Mrs. Rupee of the Peace Corps has asked for volunteers to go work in agriculture. the soil conservationists. The people that would work in technology. in irrigation. in agronomy and seeds and the things that are needed. So we cannot put the one aside and only worry about the immediate. because the immediate can become permanent. We. in the rest of the nations. will not be able to provide. in a permanent manner. the needs that they have now. We have got to get their farmers back on the land. we have to give them the resources. Every time that you give some food. you should also give a plow or a rake or a hoe. Every time that you give some food. you should bring one more farmer that can feed. in our country 80. in that country probably it would be less. but it has to be done in tandem and we should not forget that because our charity. our compassion. our sensitivity all can go for naught if you do not correct the basic problem which is. they did not keep their farmers on the land."},{"1":"1984","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. we must upgrade the quality of the Armed Forces and reward those that sacrifice for our national security. A new GI bill is the most effective. and costeffective step we can take to improve the quality of recruits for our Armed Forces. To meet this goal. I am pleased to introducealong with my distinguished colleagues. Senators ARMSTRONG. MATSUNAGA. COHEN. and CRANSTONa new GI bill program for our Armed Forces. We must recruit more highquality. highly motivated young men and women. The manning problems of our Armed Forces will become quite severe in future years when the pool of young. serviceage people is diminished and if our economy improves. Demographic forecasts show that young males age 19 will diminish over the next decade by 25 percent. The educational benefits provided by a new GI bill should attract increased numbers of high school graduates into the services and will assist them in retaining the career middlegrade noncommissioned officers needed to train and lead our fighting men. Under the provisions of the new GI bill. veterans could receive education assistance payments of up to $300 per month for up to a total of 36 months while attending an approved educational institution. Eligibility for benefits at this level would be attained through a number of active duty and Reserve service options. For example. a young man could enlist for 2 years of active duty and agree to serve 4 years in the Reserves to become eligible for the maximum benefits commencing at the time he is honorably discharged from active duty. A longer period of active duty would reduce the Reserve obligation. Military personnel who perform in critical skill and combat arms jobs as designated by a service Secretary could be eligible for up to a $600 a month benefit. A unique feature of the bill is that it also provides educational benefits for persons who serve in the Reserve Forces without having served on active duty. While the benefits for eligible reservists are roughly onethird of what is provided to active service veterans. they are still substantial and should prove to be an attractive recruitment incentive. The Reserves are experiencing even greater difficulties in filling their ranks with quality people than the Active Forces. I believe that this bill can go a long way toward providing the needed incentives to draw young men and women into the Reserve Forces. A second unique feature of the bill which should have the greatest appeal to our career military people is a provision which provides for transferability of benefits. As written. the bill would enable a person eligible for education benefits to transfer these benefits to one or more of his dependentsbut not to exceed the 36month/$300 level. This requires a contribution from the military member that is matched on a 2for1 basis by the DOD. Thus. for every $1.000 contributed by the serviceman. DOD will kick in $2.000. I believe that this will provide an extremely valuable retention incentive for many of the very important middlegrade noncommissioned officers. An alarmingly large number of these small unit leaders are presently leaving the services because they cannot afford to send their children to college on the military pay they receive. This bill can provide them the assistance they need to educate their children while continuing in a career that most of them prefer. Support for the GI bill starts at the White House. President Reagan indicated he would reinstitute the GI bill as a campaign promise that is yet unfilled. Nonetheless. I would like to provide the following quotations from the many supporters of the GI bill program: I will ask Congress to reinstate the G.I. Bill. a program which was directly responsible for the most rapid advance ever in the educational level of our population.Ronald Reagan. Televised Address to Nation. October 19. 1980. President Reagan is far from alone in his appreciation of the benefits to the Armed Forces and to the country of a new G.1. Bill. Below are excerpts from the testimony at the most recent of the 24 hearings that have been held on the G.. Bill during the last three Congresses. this one before the House Veterans Affairs Committee on April 12. 1983: The Army must have an educational pull mechanism permanently authorized in law which is not subject to the vagaries of year to year change.... The education benefits about which we are speaking do two things at once. They are recruitment incentives for us. and they are rewards for service to the Natlon.-LTG Maxwell Thurman. USA. Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel. No Americans are more deserving of educational assistance than those who serve our Nation in the military services. I believe their service and their sacrifice should be rewarded. Although the individual services would benefit greatly by a G.I. Bill. I believe in the long run our country benefits even more.-Vice Adm Lando Zech. USN. Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. I think the G.1 Bill is a must for the future. I have been in the recruiting business. and I can look down the pike and know that the talent market is going to become much smaller. competition is going to become much more intense with industry and other means looking for the quality of youngsters we want. and I think that a good education bill in the future will be of great assistance.-LtGen C. G. Cooper. USMC. Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower. There is no question about it: A new G.I. Bill will help recruitment. retention and society. and I think it is especially important as we look down the road and see a recovering economy. a declining pool of eligible youth to serve the country. and some programmed growth in the Air Force. A new G.I. Bill would help us attract and retain the kinds of people that we need in the increasingly complex and high technology Air Force that we have today.-Maj. Gen. Kenneth Peek. USAF. Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower & Personnel. The VFW supports the concept of a peacetime G.I. Bill and has testified so on previous occasions. We recognize the undeniable need of the military to attract and retain qualified. highcaliber personnel.James N. Magill. Special Asst.. Natl Leg Service. Veterans of Foreign Wars. The G.1. Bill model for recruitment and retention is preferable to a contributory educational program.-G. Michael Schlee. Director. Natl Security Commission. American Legion. AMVETS. which was born with the original G.I. Bill. believes that the traditional hard distinctions between wartime and peacetime veterans. which has formed the matrix for much of our veterans legislation. is becoming increasingly irrelevant in this age of constant. increasingly dangerous and expensive struggle with the forces of totalitarian communism throughout the world .... The sacrifices which military service exacts. especially in terms of years away from that period of life usually devoted to education are just as real for the peacetime veteran as for his wartime comrade. The crucial need for armed forces of the highest caliber is greater now than at any time in our history. including periods of hostilities. AMVETS believes that it is high time that the dignity of military service during this age of peril be recognized at least to the same degree that wartime service has been recognized in the past.-LTC David Passamaneck. USA (ret). Legislative Director. AMVETS. We believe that recruiting and retention in the Armed Forces in the future will become more difficult and that consideration supports the creation of a G.I. Bill. But we have also said . . . that we believe the creation of a 0.I. Bill is something that should not be done specifically for the purpose of recruiting and retaining people in the Armed Forces. but also for the good that it has on the Nations economy and for its positive effect on veterans. -Richard W. Johnson. National Legislation Director. NonCommissioned Officers Assn. A new 0.I. Bill should not be considered as an expenditure of funds. rather. it should be considered as an investment of funds .... An investment in the youth of America is one of the best. for It returns the highest dividends.-Max Bielke. Legislative Counsel. National Association for Uniformed Services. An educational assistance is a proven. highly effective recruiting incentive. Not only is it a strong magnet among bright. motivated youngsters. it also is attractive to their parents.-Col. Erik Johnson. USA. Director of Legislative Affairs. Association of the U.S. Army. The Fleet Reserve Association. in cooperation with U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter. held a public 0.I. Bill Forum in San Diego. Thirtynine active duty witnesses. ranging from pay grades E3 with three years of service to E9 with 30 years of service. presented the views of over 200.000 active duty personnel. Amazingly enough. the views of all personnel. those in the Tidewater area. Boston and San Diego. were the same: a peacetime 0.1. Bill was needed and all felt such a program would attract and retain Service personnel.--Robert W. Nolan. Natl Executive Secretary. Fleet Reserve Assn. I ask my colleagues to look at particular quotes from the various authorities such as Lt. Gen. Maxwell Thurman. the Deputy Chief of Staff of Personnel in the Army. Adm. Lando Zech. from the Navy. and Lt. Gen. C. G. Cooper. the Marine Corps Deputy Chief of Staff for Manpower. But more than anything else here is one particular commitmentI say to the Senator from Virginia. who did such a splendid job yesterday in the Chamber. for which I commend himand it was made in October 1980 by President Reagan. He said. I will ask Congress to reinstate the GI bill. a program which was directly responsible for the most rapid advance ever in the educational level of our population. The GI bill is one particular promise or commitment that can be carried out without busting the budget. We have had billions and billions for weapons as we have pointed out. We have doubled the defense budget. This amendment is one that would really strengthen our defenses. strengthen the AllVolunteer Force. strengthen the Reserves. We are 200.000 shy in the Reserves and Guard in our country right today. With this amendment we can begin to strengthen the Reserve Force and when you strengthen it. again you get a cross section of support in our socieJune 1-. 1984 ty for the national defense and for the Nations defenses. So I thank my colleagues for their attention and strongly support the amendment of the Senators from Colorado. Maine. Hawaii. and California. and the others who are now sponsoring this particular measure that I introduced some 3 years ago. I hope we can pass it now and not delay this very critical requirement. In closing. let me state that Congress has moved decisively in recent years to provide our military forces with the modern. hightechnology equipment they need to at least keep abreast of the Soviets from a weapon systems standpoint. But. as we all know. we are now at a point where we must significantly improve the quality of our military manpower. I believe that we must now move resolutely to remedy this problem if the security of this Nation is to be assured. I believe a new GI bill can be a step in that direction. I am very pleased to join with my colleagues in introducing this vital legislation. I gladly yield the floor."},{"1":"1983","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I would like to thank both of my colleagues. Congressmen JOHN PORTER and TOM LANTOS as cochairmen of the Human Rights Caucus for the opportunity to pay tribute to Lech Walesa. As the leader of the outlawed Solidarity Union. he is a most deserving recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for 1983. It is befitting that the Norwegian Nobel Committee. announcing the award. cited Walesas contribution. made with considerable personal sacrifice. to insure the workers right to establish their own organizations. The Nobel committee should be commended because. although the subject of human rights was probably not originally conceived by Alfred Nobel as a category within the scope of the prize. it is a most appropriate expression of its purpose. With the advent of totalitarian dictatorships in this century the cause of human rights has become a part of the cause of global peace. This is so because these same totalitarian governments have declared war against the rights of their citizens. Yet despite such oppression Lech Walesas activities have been characterized by a determination to solve his countrys problem through negotiation and cooperation without resorting to violence. In this respect the deafening silence of the Soviet Union after the announcement that Walesa was to receive the Nobel Peace award is ironically the highest tribute that could be paid to the Nobel committee for their choice. Similarly. I recall 5 months ago that the Polish authorities published their most vitriolic attack against Lech Walesa. saying he was no longer fit to play any role in public life. The article stated Whatever Walesa does or says. he is no longer credible anyway. the article said. The time when he could have been a partnerbut when he refusedhas passed. He himself has crossed out the value of his name in the public life of Poland. His receipt of the Nobel Prize is evidence that such reports of his demise were premature and is likely to give further impetus to the Solidarity movements efforts to achieve the human dignity and rights that workers in the freer half of the world enjoy. I share the sentiments of AFLCIO President Lane Kirkland in his recent remarks that: Lech Walesa symbolizes more than any other man in the world today the basic principle of freedom of association as a fundamental human right of which the other rights and privileges and freedoms that men and women aspire to are based.o"},{"1":"1982","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I commend the Senator from New Mexico on the amendment which he introduced to Senate Joint Resolution 58 and which the Senate passed 97 to 0 on Tuesday. There are a number of details which have to be worked out In the balanced budget amendment. and I think the place to spell these details out is in statute. One major complication to the balanced budget amendment which I would like to see resolved in later legislation is the problem of how to handle social security. Mr. President. it occurs to me. as I think about how the balanced budget procedure is going to work. that there are going to be some serious consequences for social security financing if the Congress does not enact special provisions for handling this program. Some have suggested that Senate Joint Resolution 58 needs to be amended to exempt social security from the provisions of the balanced budget amendment. However. in looking over the Senators amendment and the projected context of the implementing legislation he intends to propose in the future. it is my opinion that Congress will have authority to set up special procedures for social security in statute at a later date. I would like to take a moment to review the difficulty I see in lumping social security in with other programs in the balanced budget amendment. and ask the Senator from New Mexico if he agrees that his amendment and implementing legislation would assure the hands of the Congress will not be tied in responding to these difficulties. Before he replies let me explain why I think there is going to be a problem. Taking for a moment Just the cash benefits part of social securitythe old age. survivors and disability Insurance programs (OASDI)-we are talking about a program with a 75year planning horizon. That means that at any particular time. we try to assure that the cash benefits are adequately financed for the next 75 years. This 75year actuarial balance is a promise of sorts to those now paying tax contributions that there will be funds to pay them benefits when they are retired. Before next summer. the Congress will have to act to correct the longrun imbalance which currently exists in OASDI. When we do. the program will be balanced for the next 75 years. assuming our estimates for the future hold true. The fact that the program will be in balance over the long run does not mean. though. that it will be in balance in each of the next 75 years. Social security is a dynamic program. Constant changes in demographic and economic conditions necessitate the buildup of trust fund reserves in favorable times which can then be spent down in less favorable times. The use of these reserves enables the financing of the system to respond to changing conditions without annual statutory changes In payroll tax rates and benefit levels. Now the balanced budget amendment is going to establish as the general rule that in each and every year receipts of the U.S. Government should grow no faster than national income. and that outlays should not exceed receipts. At the same time. social securitys receipt and outlays will fluctuate depending upon a number of factors such as the relationship between workers and retirees and between wages and prices. In some years social security will have several. indeed many years in a row. of surpluses and in other years it will have many successive years of deficits and have to spend some of its reserves. Trying to forecast budgets more than a few years ahead has its dangers. None of us can state with impunity what the future will hold. But I think there is one longrun phenomenon which we can all agree is likely to occur and which is going to have tremendous effects on social securitys finances. This phenomenon is the aging of the baby boom generation. Like a rabbit swallowed by a snake. this generation will advance slowly through the age groupsfirst swelling the ranks of the workers. and then after about 2015. swelling the ranks of the retirees. Under current law. even with the longrun deficit we now have in social security. this demographic pattern will result in annual surpluses most likely beginning in the 1990s. Now we are going to do something to improve the financing of social securityand just about anything we do is. I think. going to have the effect of building up even larger surpluses. I would like to ask the chairman of the Budget Committee if he agrees with this assessment. Does he agree that it is likely that we are going to have to build up surpluses in OASDI during this relatively favorable demographic period?"},{"1":"1981","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"At age 62 there are some jobs that you cannot do anymore and should not.

It is the one thing that gives peace of mind and a sense of reasonable and dignified old age. an age in which you have an income for which you have saved. which is part of a large system of social insurance to which you are entitled. They are entitled to this. Now. these people have come to feel they are not going to get it.

A twopage press release had Crisis. Crisis. Bankrupt. Crisis. Crisis. Four crises and one bankrupt in two pages. describing a system that is nothing of the kind. Mr. President. I wish to set forth a basic proposition with what I think is now a sufficient sense of the demography of our country and the actuarial bases of these funds. It is an important proposition for Americans to know. because I am sorry to have to tell the Senate there is some good news. This will be alarming to many. a source of despair to some. and profound suspicion to most. but the fact is this country and its economy are in very good shape. We have absorbed that great explosion of population that took place after the Second World War. We have brought it through the schools. through the colleges. in an unprecedented degree. We ended up with a situation where for the first time in the history of any nation in the world more females go to college than do males. We have gone through that turbulent entry into the labor force. that postwar experience. which is behind us. Those people are settling down. To an alarming degree they appear to be turning Republican. We have learned this. But there is nothing the matter with Republicans. They are said to pay taxes with the same quiet desperation that we associate with the backbone of our society. They have a small cohort coming behind them. There are two facts: First. for the next 25 years when the persons retiring in this country are those born before the end of the Second World War. we will have a very thin cohort of retirees and a large cohort paying into the system for the next quarter century. This system will then be in surplus. There is an abundance and surplus of funds. In the following quarter century that surplus runs down. In the middle third of the 21st century. there are actuarial difficulties to which we will have to address ourselves. and we will address ourselves to this while maintaining a payasyougo system. The founders of this system. wishing to give an aura of permanency to it. set the 75year parameters. But this is almost presumptuous. Mr. President. we know very little about our economy in the year 2055. We know something. We know there still will be plenty of coal. we know the Senator from Lousiana will look out for the interests of hydrocarbons in fluid form that arrive in his happy estuary. there will be more older persons in relation to the population as a whole. That will be about 18 percent. which is that of Switzerland today. Great Britain is 16 percent. We are still a young country. only 11 percent of our population is 65 or over. Mr. President. in the meantime not only is there a surplus coming forward in this fund for a quarter century. but the dependency ratio in our society goes down for the next 40 years. What is the dependency ratio? It is a calculation demographers make. They take the total number of persons aged 60 to 64. these persons In the work force. and compare those to the portion of persons under 20 and over 64. People under 20 and over 64 typically are dependent and are supported by the group in between. That ratio goes down. down. not up. We are not turning into a society in which there is no one to look after its dependent population. In demographic terms. we are stronger now than we have ever been. We have never been so strong. If this country had nothing greater to worry about than the demographic profiles and the prospects for the social security trust fund in the next 40 years. we would be a happy Republic indeed. Not only is this. going down. but the third point. Mr. President. is that as a proportion of gross national product sociAl security benefits are going to decline between now and the year 2020. The curve goes downby the year 2015 it perks up a bitand not until the year 2020 do social security benefits exceed their percentage of GNP in 1980. Now hear this: The number of people retiring is a very small cohort. The number of people who have entered the work force is large. The trust funds will be in surplus for the next quarter century. and that surplus will not be used up until the second and succeeding quarter century. point one. Point two. the dependency ratio goes down not up. There are more people in the work force and working. that great cohort. and something astonishing happens: more people work. For centuriesMr. President. I exaggerate. for decadesthis is a tendency that can come upon speakers in this Chamberfor decades since we began to measure the labor force participation rate that rate was so stable it came to be known as one of the great ratios in economics. It was 59 percent plus or minus some decimal point. In 1910. as I recall this date. when families worked on farms. women rarely were engaged in occupation for which wages were paid. Children. on the other hand. entered coal mines and 59 percent of the population was in the work force. In 1920. when women began to enter the labor force. children left the coal mines. people left the farms. the labor force participation rate was 59 percent. In 1950. after the great experience of World War II and Rosie the Riveter. while children started going to school for 30 yearsthey never get out. doctors do not start practicing until they are 4059 percent of the population was in the work force. Today. the ratio is 63.8 percent. There are more people working than ever in our history. and they are paying into the social security fund. That is point two. Point three. as a proportion of benefits. proportion of gross national product. benefits go down. If the President would bear with me. we have the exact percentages of GNP that are social security benefits. These are in the report of the social security trustees. Why they did not include data on labor preparticipation. I do not know. Let me just read from the rate for IIA. which is the projection based on the Presidents budget assumptions. In 1981. in the estimated cost of the OASDI system as percent of GNP is 4.97. I have to admit that my statement has to be modified only to the degree that in 1982 it goes up by onehundredth of 1 percent to 4.98. In 1983. 4.91. down. in 1984. 4.84. down. in 1985. 4.77. down. in 1986. 4.69. down. in 1987. 4.63. down. in 1988. 4.61. down. in 1989. 4.59. down. in 1990. 4.56. down. down. down. down. down to the year 2005. when it reaches 4.20. Then it begins to rise slowly. By the year 2020. the portion of the GNP represented by benefits will be 5.33. That will be 0.37. onethird of 1 percent. above today. That is. in the next 35 years. it goes down. down. down. down. Now. what is the crisis about? Where is the bankruptcy? What more do we need to know about the basic solidity of the system?"},{"1":"1980","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"To the best of my knowledge the program as scheduled for the week of November 10 is that the House will meet. will reconvene and resume its sitting on the 12th of November.

Mr. Chairman. I. at the outset. want to commend our distinguished colleague from Maryland for offering this amendment and having the persistence in the face of apathy. and perhaps even hostility. to continue to express his commitment and his concern for the real needs of the people of this country. Mr. Chairman. I would like to comment upon the specific budget authorization suggested for economic development in the gentlemans amendment. The $231 million in proposed authorizations and $187 million in actual outlays would be most useful in implementing an effective defense economic adjustment program. Such a program would. in turn. bolster our economy and generate needed revenues for the Federal Treasury. I am sponsoring legislation cosponsored by some 30 of our colleagues to create a rational procedure whereby phasedout defense facilities can be converted to civilian production. My bill would also enable workers laid off as a result of contract terminations and base closings to be trained for new and rewarding jobs which the legislation would help generate. I would like to describe briefly how this adjustment mechanism would work and to explain why it is so vital to our economy. My colleagues will recall the March 29 Pentagon statement announcing the closing of several military bases across the country. More than 13.000 jobs will be affected by this action. and its adverse economic impact will be felt by many local communities. It is important to note that the March 29 announcement was by no means a unique or isolated decision. The Department of Defense has shut down 66 bases during the past 8 years. It has terminated 11.376 contracts during the same periodan average of 1.422 a year. Thousands of workers have lost their jobs as a result of these actions. and hundreds of localities in every region of the country have suffered serious economic losses. Nearly 1 million people are presently employed in manufacturing goods -for Pentagon consumption. Another 4.6 million workers in our country are employed in defenserelated industries. Each of these individuals is potentially vulnerable to sudden termination of his or her employment. Every community in which they live and work could experience a sharp economic downturn. There is at present no effective Federal response to these regular adjustments in Pentagon programs and budgeting. Even if this Congress ultimately approves an enormous increase in Pentagon spending for fiscal 1980. there will still be a series of specific modifications and shifting emphases in the coming year. The statistics over the recent years confirm the need for rational contingency planning. Facilities are going to be shut down. Workers will lose their jobs. Communities will suffer economic disruptions. And if this Congress should eventually decide to limit the proposed increase in Pentagon outlays to a more justifiable level. there will be an even greater need for adjustment legislation of the sort I am proposing. In future years. as meaningful arms limitation agreements hopefully take hold. we may be faced with an urgent need for this kind of program. Since sound adjustment planning must be thoughtfully developed well in advance of the actual event. conversion legislation is needed now. We must begin to create the framework that will prove so valuable to us in coming years. The legislation I am offering would create a Defense Economic Adjustment Council in the Executive Office of the President. with members to include the Cabinet officers. heads of other Federal agencies and representatives of management and labor. The Council would engage in broad. longterm planning to be coordinated with local alternative use committees. These committees would be charged with developing specific conversion plans at the local level. The legislation requires that the plans developed by the committees should make the most efficient possible use of facilities. equipment. and personnel affected by budgetary modifications. The bill also creates an economic adjustment fund. to be financed through a 1.25percent payment by defense contractors based on their gross annual revenues. This fund would then be used to maintain the salaries of laidoff workers and to retrain them for new civilianoriented employment. Finally. the legislation provides economic adjustment planning aid to local communities affected by base closings and contract terminations. Mr. Chairman. we could begin to move toward this essential conversion process through adoption of the human needs amendment before us today. It could provide the seed money for the program I have been describing. This is but one possible way in which the human needs amendment would benefit our constituents and strengthen our private economy. Again. Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to support Mr. MITCHELLS proposal. C 1150"},{"1":"1978","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. I rise in support of the amendment. I am always amazed at the eloquence of my good chairman of the full committee and the convincing ways in which he presents the fact that if this bill is not passed. there is going to be some scourge which will come creeping out of the great darkness and destroy all the wilderness and the wildlife. What is strange to me. Mr. Chairman. is that we have occupied or inhabited for numerous years. approximately 4.000 years. the area in question. This is by men. by the way. not just by the birds and the bees. Mr. Chairman. the areas of which the gentleman speaks. very honestly. are wilderness areas by *nature alone. and they will continue to be wilderness areas by nature alone unless this Congress has a real crunch put upon it. Mr. Chairman. the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington. very honestly. picks out those areas which are the crown jewels. and I think we might call them the family jewels. because if we achieve these jewels. that will direct the whole destiny as far as the wilderness goes. However. the bill. as written. takes in approximately. according to the chairman. 147 million acres. I think we start out with 147 million acres of wilderness. That was the position of the committee. and I do not know what gave them the authority which they seem to espouse to be able to say that that is the right thing to do. Now I understand the committee has gone down to 74 million acres. the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. The substitute amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona has only 65 million acres in it. is that correct? Is that the position of the chairman. that it has 65 million acres in it at this time?"},{"1":"1977","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I want to express my gratitude to those Members on both sides of the aisle who have earnestly endeavored to work out this impasse and come to some language that this Congress could enact. I do not know whether this language under consideration represents such a compromise or not. I hope that it does. because if it does notif we do not enact this language today. or something very similarextremely serious consequences will follow. A very substantial part of the essential activities of the Government will be totally paralyzed. As of last Wednesday night at midnight all appropriations expired for all the programs carried on through the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare and those carried on through the Department of Labor. The other body has made it clear that it is not going to accept a continuing resolution without some modifying language in it. It may sound very heroic for some Membersto be able to sit here and say: I did not yield one inch. I stood by my convictions. It is equally heroic for those on the other side. and for those in the Senate to say: I did not yield one inch. I stood on my convictions. But so long as that obtains on both sides. there is no possibility of legislation. Unless we break this impasse. please understand what is going to happen. Members should be prepared to assume responsibility for the results of what we do here today. Unless we break this impasse this week. 145.000 faithful employees of the Government will have a payless payday between now and Christmas. Not only those employees of the Federal Government but also an additional 600.000 local and State employees whose salaries are funded through these programs will have payless paydays between now and Christmas. But let me emphasize that it is not just for these public employees that I am making this plea. For instance. some 475.000 Head Start students will have no money to fund their continuing education. Eleven million aidtodependentchildren recipients will be out of money between now and Christmas. Are Members prepared to assume the responsibility for that? Some 2 million SSI beneficiaries will be adversely affected. Ten thousand hospitals will not receive Federal funds because there are no moneys for grants any more. It has run out. It is gone. Five million recipients of title I elementary and secondary school education will likewise be adversely affected. Four hundred and thirtyfive thousand daily meals for older citizens will be terminated between now and Christmas. Do you want to assume responsibility for that? Two million students receiving scholarship aidbasic oportunity grants for the most needy studentswill go out the window unless we as a legislative body can resolve this controversy. The money for 1.8 million recipients of rehabilitation services. and 450.000 black lung beneficiaries. has run out. These figures came today from Secretary Califano. I called and asked him for them. There simply is no more money for grants. If you want to sit intractably and inflexibly and insist that you have not yielded one inch from your convictions. if those in the Senate sit intractably and inflexibly and insist that they have not yielded one inch from their convictions. well. then. the legislative process will simply break down.

Today the Chicago Daily News not only has over.come the barbs of its competitors. but is now recognized as one of the greatest newspapers in our country. It has reached that plateau of greatness because of an early philosophy developed by its founders that the paper would be beholden to no one. That spirit of independence has served the paper well over the years. That same unswerving dedication to journalism is being carried on today by the distinguished publisher of the Chicago Daily News. Mr. Marshall Field. and my good friend. Emmett Dedmon. vice president and editorial director of the newspaper. They have continually shown their devotion to the city of Chicago and have upheld the highest standards of integrity in presenting the facts to Daily News readers. These. two gentlemen stand in a long line of great journalists who are a part .of the Chicago Daily News history. Among the famous who wrote for the Chicago Daily News were Carl Sandburg. Ben Hecht. Robert J. Casey. one of the greatest war correspondents of all times. Eugene Field. a famed childrens poet. and hundreds of others who although not as famous were nonetheless responsible for the journalistic tradition of the Chicago Daily News. The men and women who write for the Chicago Daily News have shown that they can carry on the great tradition of the past. That tradition has seen the newspaper win 15 Pulitzer Prizes for meritorious public service and excellence. I predict there will be many more such awards in the years ahead.

There are other issues. such as pollution. busing. the condition of the ghettos. crime. justice. drug control. and the like. all important. However. in my opinion. Mr. President. the most important issue nowand it has been for some years pastis the issue of our involvement in Southeast Asia. It is brought to our attention because of recent events in Laos and Cambodia. According to the latest reports the Pathet Lao and the North Vietnamese are very close to Long Cheng. the CIAsponsored base in southern Laos. According to the latest reports the constitution of the Khmer Republic formerly known as Cambodia. in effect has been overthrown and the position of first responsibility has been taken by Lon Nol. In Cambodia we are witnessing the folly of the American desire to export its political. economic. and social institutions to foreign lands where they do not need them. do not want them. and should not have them forced upon them. Two years have elapsed since the overthrow of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the result has been chaos. Two years later seventenths of Cambodia is under the control of hostile forces. and 2 years later. out of an estimated population of 7 million. onethird has become homeless. The net result has been nothing but destruction and ruin. There is. of course. -the makings of a constitutional republic. but when the constitution supposedly was to have been put into effect Lon Nol threw it to one side and said he would not recognize it. So now the constitution and the republic. except in name. have gone down the drain. Marshal Lon Nol dismissed the constitution as unacceptable. He dis7 solved the assembly and he has taken over complete control as a dictator in his pitiful country. The South Vietnamese Army. the traditional enemy of Cambodians. is once again penetrating into Cambodia. to the extent of approximately 30.000 or 40.000 troops. Does anyone remember the invasion of Cambodia just about 2 years ago? Does anyone know what has happened since? Well. the North Vietnamese are back where they used to be. in the area of the Parrots Beak. More of Cambodia is under the control of the North Vietnamese and their allies and more of Cambodia has been destroyed in the meantime. So I would hope that those who are advocating continued aid to this small country. made up of kindly peoplethose in the Pentagon. those in the administration. those in the State Department. and those in the aid programwill think and think again. because this is not a prime example of the Nixon doctrine. it is anything but. It proves just how bankrupt the policy of our country has been allowed become. not only in Cambodia. but also in the rest of that part of the world. Then there is Laos. another small country with a very kindly. peaceful people. What happened there? Hundreds of thousands of Laotians have been made homeless refugees and much of their country has been destroyed. A clandestine army under the control of the CIA has been operating. the overall commander is the proconsul. the U.S. Ambassador to Laos. He is the one who directs operations. tells where the strikes will be. whether they will be on the Plain of Jars or in the region of Long Cheng. the CIA subsidized base which is now under siege. Much could be said about what happened in these two countries in addition to what happened and what is happening in Vietnam. But it is all a tragedy as far as this republic is concerned. It is the worst tragedy in our entire history. I think if anything is going to be done it is going to be up to King Savang Vatthana in Laos. SRI. and Prince Norodom Sihanouk. now In exile in Peking. to put their talents and their efforts to use. so that a degree of stability and peace can be returned to their respective countries.

I would like to indicate that I am not really speaking these words. Try as I might. I could not get the floor to deliver my plea on behalf of the coal miners disabled by pneumoconiosis. I do not want to kid anyone into thinking that I am now on my feet delivering a stirring oration. As a matter of fact. I am back in my office typing this out on my own hot little typewriter. far from the madding crowd. and somewhat removed from the House Chamber. Such is the pretense of the House that it would have been easy to just quietly include these remarks in the RECORD. issue a brave press release. and convince thousands of cheering constituents that I was in there fighting every step of the way. influencing the course of history in the heat of debate. As a matter of fact. Mr. Speaker. I have been more than slightly interested in legislation to compensate those coal miners and their families disabled by pneumoconiosis. There was a major rebellion in West Virginia in 1969 which led to the enactment of this legislation and the inclusion of black lung benefits in the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969. This landmark law needs the clarifying amendments which the Congress is considering today. All we are doing is perfecting the 1969 law in order to insure that the principles of justice and humanity are extended to the coal miners of this Nation. Today. some 60 coal miners from West Virginia and Virginia. many of whom are my constituents. visited the Capitol and called on a number of Congressmen. I have been with these miners much of the day. and appreciate their efforts in bringing home to the Congress the inequities in carrying out the provisions of the law. They know from experience in the coal mines that there are many doctors who have down through the years denied the existence of pneumoconiosis. They know from experience that there are many miners in the coal fields who have been denied the benefits justly due them. by reason of negative Xrays. Since pneumoconiosis interferes with the ability of the coal miner to transfer oxygen into the blood. what is really needed is to measure how much oxygen is actually getting into the blood. This necessitates an arterial blood gas test with exercise. to measure the oxygenation of the bloodand these tests are being performed daily at such places as the Appalachian Regional Hospital in Beckley. W. Va.. by Dr. Donald Rasmussen and his associates. The Xray may possibly pick up positively lumped coal dust in one section of the lung. but frequently overlook very fine coal dust which is spread out in the lung in such a way as to severely impair the ability of the lungs to transfer oxygen into the blooa. This is why it is so important to supplement the Xray with other tools like the arterial blood gas test with exercise in order to prove conclusively whether a miner is disabled by pneumoconiosis. On September 12. 1971. a statement by 12 doctors assembled in Beckley. W. Va.. indicated that the Social Security Administration use of a single chest Xray and simple breathing test was unduly and unnecessarily restrictive. Dr. John Rankin. chairman of the department of preventive medicine at the University of Wisconsin and a specialist in lung disease said the simple breathing test employed by the Social Security Administration often fails to measure black lung disability. The New York Academy of Sciences sponsored an international conference on coal workers pneumoconiosis on September 13 through 17. and lung specialists from all over the world presented their analyses of how to test and measure pneumoconiosis. These papers conclusively demonstrate that you cannot rely on a simple Xray to determine either the presence of pneumoconiosis. or the extent of disability resulting from it. I refer to the October 5. 1971. RECORD. at pages 34916 to 34943 for a more complete account of these matters which I have included for the information of Members. I would also like to include a table prepared by the Social Security Administration which sets forth the most recent figures on black lung claims filed. processed. and paid in various States:"},{"1":"1970","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. on August 23. 1968.

These provisions are inconsistent with a basic tenet of sound urban developmentto permit the local government and the people affected to participate meaningfully in planning their transportation system. Under the Constitution. the Congress does possess .special and unique responsibilitiesdifferent. from its powers over the fifty Statesto legislate for the Nations Capital. The desire of the Congress to move forward with the construction of a highway system to serve the Washington area is understandable. But it is vitally important that these roads be constructed In accordance with proper planning and engineering concepts and with minimum disruption of the lives of the District citizens. Fortunately. the Congress has called for construction only in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Federal highway law. If the authority of the Executive Branch were not so preserved. I would have no choice but to veto this bill as an infringement of basic principles of good government and Executive responsibility. The City Council in August of last year passed a resolution to comply with section 23. a section of law I would again remind my colleagues is of disputed interpretation and is currently the subject of litigation pending before the court of appeals. Despite that action. the House of Representatives wrote into the revenue bill for the District of Columbia provisions which could have held the citys revenues and the development of the rapid rail transit system virtual hostage to the proposed highway projects. That section was generated. in my view. by the same intention as that of the House in drafting section 23 of the 1968 Highway Act. A week ago the City Council. after studying the recommendations of the District of Columbia Department of Highways and Traffic. and after conducting extensive hearings. adopted a plan for the north leg of the inner loop and the south leg. and excluded the North Central Freeway from the overall highway plan. The plan. which is much like that adopted by the Council in December of 1968. has been supported by many groups from all segments representative of the District of Columbia. Opposition to the North Central Freeway was voiced throughout the hearings. not only from those who live in the path of the construction. but also from experts in the fields of engineering. city planning. architecture. air pollution. and from citizens of Montgomery County. including a member of their county council.

It is noble to dream great dreams. and bold slogans may serve as a call to action. But the situation in this country today calls for more than slogans and dreams. Recognizing that we have not done nearly enough to eliminate the joblessness which is a chief cause of slum conditions. and the substandard housing which is one of the principal effects. I am introducing today the JobsinHousing Act of 1968. Eight of my colleagues have joined me in sponsoring this proposal. I would like to emphasize that our bill. which calls for the construction of 3.160.000 public and publicly assisted housing units over the 4 years. is in a real sense one of the least radical housing proposals to come before Congress this year. It does not contemplate any new programs. simply because we already have legislation on the books providing for almost every type of federally financed low- and moderateincome housing. including public housing. privately sponsored mediumrent housing and rent subsidies. America is already committed. on the books. to doing away with our slums and. in the process. providing muchneeded employment. In the Housing Act of 1937. which has now been law for more than three decades. Congress declared that it is the policy of the United States. through public funds and credit. to assist local governments in eliminating unsafe and unsanitary housing. remedying the acute shortage of decent lowincome housing and alleviating present and recurring unemployment. This is the promise. The only missing ingredient has been the money to carry out our commitment. Over the years. we have built new housing for the poor at a rate which will not suffice to do away with existing inadequate housing. much less keep pace with our enormous population growth. The administrations proposed Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968. which is now before the Congress. goes a long way in the right direction. I have cosponsored it. and I support its promise and its provisions wholeheartedly. But. at the same time. I do not feel it goes far enough in terms of the number of new housing units it would build in the next few years. As a spokesman for the influential and responsible National Housing Conference said the other day. testifying before the House Subcommittee on Housing in support of the administration bill: The longrange requirements for meeting the nations needs (for low and moderate income housing). taking into account the massive population growth which is in process. are greatly in excess of the proposals contained in the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968. A representative of the AFLCIO also offered general support for the bill but added: We feel the Immediate need is for far more housing than is envisioned by this billconsiderable as it is. Thus the jobsinhousing bill which I am introducing authorizes the funds to construct 2 million public housing units over the next 4 years. including 500.000 units in fiscal year 1969. which begins on July 1. 1968. It also authorizes over a 4year period funds for 400.000 housing units under the rent supplements program. 160.000 units under the 202 program for the elderly and handicapped. and 600.000 units under the 221(d) (3) below market interest rate program. In fiscal year 1969. 100.000 units would be constructed under rent supplements. 40.000 under section 202. and 100.000 under 221(d) (3). Increased funds are also sought for such directly related programs as model cities. urban renewal. urban planning assistance. urban mass transportation. water and sewers. and neighborhood facilities. As I mentioned earlier. a primary goal of this proposal is the creation of jobs in ghetto areas. For many years. most white Americans have shared in an economic boom sustained in part by massive Federal spending. But the residents of our urban and rural slums have seen little of the money spent on defense. highways. space. agricultural subsidies. and other programs. The benefits of Federal largesse and general prosperity have trickled down to them. if at all. almost entirely in the form of welfare subsistence allowances with all of their debilitating and degrading implications. Socalled makework programs for the poor are really no better than welfare if they consist of projects comparable to assigning one team to dig holes in the ground and another to go around filling them up. If there were no socially valuable work that needed to be done in this country. such a scheme might be justifiable. But obviously there is at least one public works program that will meet a desperate national need while avoiding the stigma of makework charity. This program is public and public assisted housing. a fertile field for the expenditure of Federal funds that will reach the residents of poverty neighborhoods. Housing construction will provide goodpaying jobs right where they are neededin the ghetto. What is more. it takes into account the fact that most slum residents have a low level of education and skills. Equally important. it is wholly realistic in view of prevailing attitudes. the political climate in this country and our form of Government. According to most housing surveys. there are approximately 10 million dilapidated or deteriorating housing units in the United States at the present time. The President proposes to replace 6 million of these over the next 10 years. at an average rate of 600.000 new and rehabilitated low- and moderateincome units a year. Through the jobsinhousing bill. my colleagues and I propose to build just over 3 million units in the next 4 years. Like the President. we project over a longer period the construction of an average of 600.000 units a year. In about 15 years. the total need of 10 million units will be almost completely satisfied. But the administration would start with only 300.000 units in the first year. I want instead to start bigwith 740.000 units in the coming fiscal yearand then taper off very gradually after 4 or 5 years to reach the projected average. The principal advantage of this approach is that it will produce a great stimulus to the labor market by creating a sudden demand for 500.000 or more new construction jobs. The result of this demand inevitably will be the hiring of tens of thousands of presently unemployed Negroes and other ghetto dwellers. The existence of widespread public support for this type of public works program was clearly demonstrated in a Harris poll published last August. near the end of a summer of racial tension and violence in the cities. Sixtysix percent of the white respondents and 91 percent of the Negroes said they would favor setting up largescale Government programs to make jobs available to all unemployed Americans. Sixtythree percent of the whites polled and 84 percent of the Negroes supported a Federal program to tear down urban ghettos. Mr. Speaker. the jobsinhousing bill is a solid. realistic programfirmly based in our federal system of government and calling upon the full resources of our free enterprise economy. It is a program behind which the support of the white community can easily be mobilized. Even more important. perhaps. it is a positive program behind which Negro Americans can coalesce. channeling their natural frustrations and their desire for less words and more action into the democratic mainstream. When we consider the alternative. how can we turn our backs? For the benefit of my colleagues and other readers of the RECORD. I am inserting the full text of my bill herewith: H.R. 16266 A bill to increase funds authorized for existing programs to build low- and moderateincome housing and for other purposes Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.

I have taken this time to ask the chairman of the committee a few questions about this bill. The other day Mayor Daly testified before a committee of the Congress about the crisis of water pollution in the Great Lakes. Besides the problems of industrial wastes being dumped into the Great Lakes. one of the problems we have had and have had all summer is the problem of the alewives. It is my understanding that many things are being done to deal with this problem. We have had millions of alewives dying in the Great Lakes and being washed up on shore. This creates a tremendous problem for many communities along the shores of the Great Lakes. One of the suggestions for dealing with this problem is the development of industry that will harvest the alewives for fertilizer. for cat food. and other purposes. Now. do I understand correctly that under this legislation and underthis title the Upper Great Lakes Commission could indeed finance and develop industries along these lines in this hardpressed area and help under the regional commission provisions of this act to develop this kind of industry to make a contribution toward reducing and perhaps eliminating the problem of alewives in the Great Lakes? Could it be done under this bill? Do I understand that correctly?"},{"1":"1966","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"No. I believe the Senator is misreading the purport of section 2.

There is no way by which we can see to it that the business people in Latin America pay their laboring people a decent wage for their labor. unless we hold the price high enough so that those people can make enough money to pay the labor."},{"1":"1964","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing a bill to provide realistic relief to American nationals who suffered expropriation of their property at the hands of the Castro Communist government in Cuba. My bill provides for adjudication of claims of American nationals against the Government of Cuba and provides for payment of claims from Cuban assets seized by the U.S. Government. Mr. Speaker. as I predicted when Castro began his expropriation of Americanowned property. no meaningful effort has been made to reimburse American owners. Recently. overtures have been made by Castro to the Shell Oil Co. in London regarding compensation for expropriation of the Shell refinery in Cuba. but we must not expect that he will willingly compensate Shell for their losses. Furthermore. it must be remembered that even this weak and very late offer comes only after the British began selling buses to Castro. This latest statement is just a propaganda move on Castros part in an effort to legitimatize or naturalize his governmental relations with other governments. It is naive to presume that further delay will permit more proper adjudications. With the passage of time it will become more and more difficult to obtain records. witnesses. and evidence to substantiate claims. At present. claims may be filed with the Department of Stateand that is exactly what happens to them. They are filed without comment and that is the end of it. Furthermore under present procedures claims can be settled only by country to country negotiations. None have been entered into for this purpose and there is little likelihood that such negotiations will be started. Thus after more than 5 years. no meansexists whereby these thousands of Americans whc lost their land. their homes. their small businesses. or other personal effects may have their claims adjudicated and look forward to the day when they will have the means to start over. A great reservoir of talent now lies dormant because many of these citizens are without economic means to start over. yet. especially in Latin American countries. they could play a vital part in our oversea economy. just as they did in Cuba. The loan provisions of my legislation would give them this opportunity and at the same time stimulate new activity and growth under the Alliance for Progress. The United States has already acted to relieve the big Americanowned corporations of their basic losses in Cuba by way of tax writeoffs. but the individual is still without redress. Many of these citizens were forced to flee the island of Cuba with only the clothes they wore. It is about time our country examined the plight of these Americans as we have done for others. Machinery now exists in the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission to adjudicate these claims. Since its establishment in 1949. the Commission has adjudicated millions of dollars in losses suffered by Americans in Czechoslovakia. Poland. and Hungary. Mr. Speaker. I have long been interested in assisting these American citizens. A great deal of interest in remedial action has also been forthcoming from individuals and groups. The Cuba Claims Association of Miami. a nonprofit organization headed by Clarence W. Moore. publisher of the now exiled Times of Havana. represented the first collective effort on the part of U.S. citizens to obtain adjudication of their losses. I believe this legislation represents an equitable solution to their dilemma. H.R. 10327 A bill to amend the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 to provide for the determination of the amounts of claims of American nationals against the Government of Cuba. to provide for payment of such claims. and to provide that the uncompensated portion of approved claims may be the collateral for certain loans made to claimants by the Secretary of State Be it enacted by the Senate and House o1 Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled.

It is appropriate that during the year there will be a number of special events in which public and private organizations will join to recognize and pay tribute to the enviable progress we in this country have made in the marketing of farm products. Last week in the Administration Building of the Department of Agriculture. I saw an outstanding exhibit tracing the development of our marketing system during the past 50 years and depicting the marketing services that today help bring to us better food and fiber in greater variety at less cost. Although some of the USDA marketing services. such as the collection of statistics. had their beginnings much earlier. it was in May 1913. that the first marketing agency. the Office of Markets. was established. This was the predecessor agency of todays Agricultural Marketing Service. whose broad assignment in the USDA is to help advance orderly and efficient marketing and effective distribution of the Nations farm output. When the first formal work in agricultural marketing was started in the Department of Agriculture in 1913. there was no such thing as a milking machine or a mechanical cottonpicker. The sawdustfloored meat market. the open pickle barrel. the live or New York dressed chkken were commonplace. A network of highspeed highways to transport prepackaged meat or frozen foods and the supermarket were still dreams of the future. Yet to come were a nationwide market news service for agricultural products. FederalState inspection and grading. our present laws to protect the interests of farmers marketing livestock and fruits and vegetables. a national schoollunch program. and an extensive program of marketing research. Marketing farm products is now the Nations biggest businessone that annually moves and transforms 135 million tons of foodstuffs with a retail weight and value of more than $60 billion. It likewise handles nonfood products of agriculture worth several billion dollars more. Moreover. this marketing system does this job well. A few figures dramatically spotlight the importance of agricultural marketing in the American economy: Consumer expenditures for farmderived productsfood and nonfoodare equal to onefifth of the gross national product. For every person at work on a farm growing farm products. two persons are employed off of farms in marketing those products. Out of every dollar spent to buy products of farm origin. twothirds of it pays for marketing them. This is because marketing has taken over many jobs from the kitchen. as well as from the farm. And for our society of abundance. American agricultural marketing is providing consumers with services unmatched anywhere else in the world for variety. as well as for quality and quantity. A report on consumer protection activities of Federal agencies. issued in 1961 by the Committee on Government Operations. shows that of all the Federal people engaged in service to consumers. nearly half are in the Department of Agriculture. This fact may come as a surprise to most people. But consider these facts: We can rely on the safety and wholesomeness of our meat and poultry. because all of it that crosses State lines has been carefully checked by USDA inspectors. We can rely on the quality of produce. meat. butter. eggs. poultry. and many other foods. because of the grades and grading services provided by USDA. We can get these foods in infinite varietyincomparably clean and freshbecause of the remarkable private marketing system developed with the aid of USDA marketing research and service. In this country we can buy these foods at less real cost than can any other people in the world or in history. For this. we can thank both efficient production and marketing and the help of our public servants in the Department of Agriculture. Our children or our neighborsonethird of all the schoolchildren in the Nationget wellbalanced lunches every day to help them develop robust health and good eating habits for a lifetime. This. too. is provided through the help of USDA. These are some of the marketing services that have grown up during the past 50 years. They are of direct benefit to the consumer. Yet they also serve the farmer and the marketing industry which acts to bring the consumer and his food supply together. How well our marketing system works in serving as the connecting link between the producer and the user concerns practically everyone. The efficiency and effectiveness of the marketing systems largely determines the ease with which products flow from the distant highly specialized producing areas to the consuming centers. the returns received by the producer. and the prices paid by the consumer. There are two basic ways in which order is maintained in our marketing systemways which not only promote market stability but also are capable of changing to meet the growing needs of our dynamic economy. One is the socalled regulatory laws which have been passed by Congress to guarantee fair play in agricultural marketing. The other is marketing agreements and orders. which are selfhelp programs by which producers and handlers of agricultural products can stabilize buying and selling conditions in the marketplace. Several regulatory laws are in effect to insure proper functioning of the marketing system by safeguarding individual rights. supervising marketing practices. or assuring honesty in dealing. The regulatory measures establish rules of fair business practice in marketing and help to preserve the free and open competi.tion upon which our economy is based. One of these laws is the Federal Seed Acta truth in labeling lawwhich traces its beginning back to the original Seed Importation Act. passed in 1912. a year before the first USDA marketing agency was established. The Federal Seed Act. which was passed in 1939. requires proper labeling of seeds and prohibits low quality seed from interstate and foreign commerce. This law protects the interests of both farmers and individual homeowners. . Another regulatory statute Is the U.S. Warehouse Actpassed in 1916which provides assurance of safe storage for farm products and preservation of the integrity of warehouse receipts. Under this law. more than 1.800 public warehouses are licensed. bonded. and supervised to foster economic marketing of agricultural products. One of the most important of the regulatory laws is the 42yearold Packers and Stockyards Act. This act which provides for more orderly marketing in the livestock and packing industries is not only a fair business practice and antimonopoly law. somewhat simulating the Federal Trade Commission Act. but also is a public utilities type of law. As a fairbusiness practice and antimonopoly act. it provides safeguards against restriction of competition and price manipulation and discrimination in livestock. poultry. and meat marketing. As a public utilities type law. the Packers and Stockyards Act provides for registration and bonding of livestock dealers and commercial agents. maintenance of correct livestock and meat scales. and Just rates at stockyards and auction markets for reasonable services and facilities. Another important regulatory law is the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act. an enforced code of ethics for the fruit and vegetable industry. This law is almost as broad an act in Its field as the Packers and Stockyards Act is in livestock and meat. Fruits and vegetables are highly perishable. so people in the fast moving produce industry are especially dependent on the honesty and good faith of those with whom they deal. This law is designed to protect the individuals in the industry from such unfair practices as unwarranted rejection of shipments. failure to pay. and misbranding of produce. Interstate traders in fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables are required to have licenses. USDA is authorized to suspend or revoke a traders license for violating the act. Another means by which our marketing system has developed is through marketing agreements and orders which regulate the handling of various agricultural commodities. These are designed to improve returns to producers by establishing orderly marketing conditions. They are selfhelp programs through which producers can work together to solve marketing problems they cannot solve individually. Although the first marketing orders date back to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933. which used the term licenses. these programs are now authorized under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937. Producers In 27 States are now using 45 Federal marketing agreements and orders to maintain orderly marketing conditions for fruits. vegetables. tree nuts. and shadegrown tobacco by restricting the quantity or quality that can be marketed. There are also Federal milk marketing orders which establish minimum prices for producers in 83 of the Nations large milk markets. All of the USDA marketing services came into being in response to public needs and public demandsat the direction of Congress which wisely recognized that what happens to farm products after they leave the farm is just as important as their production. This marketing workand in fact the whole marketing process. all of the buying and selling. shipping and storing. processing and packagingall this seems to be very little known to the general public. Apparently there is good reason for that. The reason is that we do have a good marketing system and good marketing services. They do a good job day after day. But they are not glamorous or spectacular like shooting a rocket to the moon. So. we canand dolook on .the whole marketing process as routinesomething that we just expect as a part of our way of life. When we stop to think about it. this really is one of the best things about our marketing systemthat our food supply is so ever present. so readily available that we never have to give it a second thought. The American farmer today. under our system. produces enough for himself and 27 others. This high level of productivity and an efficient marketing system serve the wellbeing of all of us. The result is reflected in our high standard of living. Most of us are inclined to give little or no thought to the fact that because of our agricultures productivity and the efficiency of our marketing system. we have available in this country. the largest quantity and variety of the most nutritious foods ever known to mankind. These foods are placed in our local supermarkets before we even decide we want them and are there for sale to us at the lowest percentage of income in history. We expect and get fresh strawberries and other fruits in the middle of the winter. potatoes already peeled and perhaps cooked. even company dinners prepared so that we only have to warm them and watch TV or rush out for the evening. We give little thought to how all this happens. and the children of most families know only that milk comes from the refrigerator and that it is always safe to drink. In less fortunate parts of the world. from onehalf to threefourths of the working people must devote their lives to food production alone. Too many people are trying to stave off hunger. In our country we have freed nearly all our people from food production and at the same time virtually freed everyone from hunger. Our people and other resources thus released from food problems pursue those activities which constantly give us a rising standard of living. providing not only for ourselves. but also enabling us to supply large quantities of food for needy. less fortunate people in other parts of the world. As a recent study of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations concluded. one of the major reasons why the United States is a land of plenty. while other countries are witnessing mass hunger. is this countrys highly developed and efficient marketing system. Thus it is only fitting that this 50th anniversary of the start of marketing service work in the Department of Agriculture should afford us with the opportunity to consider the benefits we all derive from this marketing systemand from the USDA services that help to make it efficientand orderlyand economical. We can also realize that our marketing systemgood as it iscan be improved much more. We can further improve quality and the keeping properties of our foods. We can find new and better ways of handling and transporting farm products. We can cut the costs of marketingto help farmers get better returns and keep down costs to consumers. As USDA starts its second half century of marketing work. we can confidently expect still greater progress in marketing. Working together with State departments of agriculture. the State universities and colleges. and with private industry. as it has in the past. the Department of Agriculture will continue to seek out improvements in marketingimprovements that can bring undreamed of advances in the years aheadand can mean a still better life for all of us."},{"1":"1962","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"The Committee on Ways and Means realistically approached this problem. The purpose of this bill is to stimulate trade both ways. It is going to affect some of our domestic industries from the standpoint of higher import competition. The trade adjustment assistance provisions are designed to assist those industries and workers who might be affected by the increase in imports."},{"1":"1961","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I have followed closely the shaping of S. 1 during the past several months. I have corresponded with the senior Senator from Illinois . who has labored so long and hard over this bill. A few weeks ago I proposed an amendment to S. I which would include. in the criteria for eligibility. the factor of distance traveled to and from work. This was designed to permit the Administrator of the program to take Into account the areas where raw unemployment statistics do not fully tell the story. in my own State of Colorado. and in others. there are areas where a large percentage of those able to find employment must commute 40 or 50 miles a day from their homes to their place of work and home again. There just are not enough jobs near their homes. The committee did not see fit to adopt my proposed amendment. I do not quarrel with the committees judgment. Its problem is a difficult one and the funds are limited. However. I am happy to be able to say that as I read the bill. the criteria adopted by the committee unquestionably will help at least one depressed area in Colorado. and likely two. I am referring to the oncethriving coal mining areas in south central Colorado. centered around the cities of Walsenburg and Trinidad. With the replacement of coal by natural gas for domestic and industrial fuel. these regions have been suffering chronic unemployment for decades. Their plight has been made worse by the inescapable advance of automation in those mines that remain in operation. And in recent months. their woes have multiplied because of layoffs in the steel mills at Pueblo. which have further curtailed the demand for coal. Both these cities are amply endowed with fine climate. scenery. recreational advantages. water. power. natural resources and alert aggressive citizenry. All they need Is a bit of help to get started in full swing. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind that Walsenburg and surrounding Huerfano County will benefit under S. 1. Section 5(a) of the bill states that the Administrator shall designate as redevelopment areas those areas where unemployment is currently 6 percent or more. and where the annual rate of unemployment has been at least 50 percent above the national average for 3 of the preceding 4 calendar years. In Walsenburg. unemployment has been over 6 percent for the last 5 years. 1956 through 1960. and in Walsenburg. unemployment has been more than 50 percent above the national average in 1957. in 1959 and in 1960. The following table shows this in specific detail: National National Walsenburg Year average average plus unemploy(percentage) 50 percent ment 1957 -------- 4.3 6.4 6.9 1958 -------- 6.8 10.2 8.3 1959 -------- 5.5 & 2 9.2 1960 -------- 5.6 8.4 9.8 Under a reasonable application of these criteria. the city of Trinidad. and neighboring portions of Las Animas County. most probably will qualify under S. 1. Unemployment there has been above the national average and above 6 percent for 3 of the last 4 years. but it has not been 50 percent above the national average for 3 of the last 4 years. However. the report of the Committee on Banking and Currency on page 15 says this: The Administrator may also. at his discretion. designate other areas as eligible for assistance where substantial and persistent unemployment has existed and which have unemployment conditions generally comparable to those of the areas of mandatory designation. For example. this is intended to give the Administrator the necessary discretion to designate as a redevelopment area * * * an area which has suffered from a sudden. severe or catastrophic loss of employment opportunity and which might not otherwise become eligible for assistance until at least a year had passed. This language. Mr. President. is based on the wording of lines 6 and 7 on page 42 of the bill: * * * on the basis of standards generally comparable. There has been a sudden and catastrophic loss of employment opportunity in and around Trinidad. The Frederick mine closed down tight just before Christmas. 1960. and the Allen mine has undergone a drastic reduction in force. Last May. these 2 mines were hiring 1.000 men. They now hire only about 200 men. Does this layoff sound small? Only if we fail to remember that the entire work force in the Trinidad area consists of 5.780 people. I submit that this loss of employment. Mr. President. is as sudden and catastrophic as anything short of an earthquake. tidal wave or major conflagration can be. I want to say now that I will take this up with the Administrator of this new program as soon as he is able to function. I am confident that a fairminded Administrator will agree wholeheartedly with me. In this connection. I ask unanimous consent to have inserted in the RECORD at this point a letter from Senator DOUGLAS which bears directly on the subject under discussion."},{"1":"1960","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. I am worried when Members of the Congress will ridicule the work of one of its own committees. I am worried because it means that Members of this House are not taking seriously the work of men and women who have been elected from their districts to come to the Congress and do the right kind of job in representing their districts as every Member of the Congress tries to do. We do not all come from the same kind of areas. When a committee like the Committee on Banking and Currency of this House which has produced great legislation brings a bill such as the bill they have brought before us now. in my opinion. it little behooves any Member to ridicule the legislation. You may disagree with It. but let us not ridicule it. You may find some mistakes in the report. but there are not any reports that are brought out by any committee where. if you look long enough. you will not find something that is wrong with it. But for years. let me tell you this. the Department of Labor of the United States. under every administration since they have been making reports. has been telling the Congress and the people of the United States that there are areas of chronic unemployment and. yet. I have never heard anybody get up in the well of this House who says they are opposed to this type of legislation and who says that the Department of Labor reports are wrong. Let us quit kidding ourselves. There are areas of chronic unemployment in this country. and I represent one of them. But let me tell you. if you do not believe itI am not talking about people who just have not received a pay check in the last week or two or about people who have been out of work for just the last couple of monthscome up to my district and I will show you families that have not cashed a pay check for years. They are the kind of people who want to work. They do not want a dole. They do not want any Government handout. They do not want to live on surplus food. All they want is an opportunity to work. I have had some people tell me to tell them to move. Well. that may be all right for young people and our young people are leaving our districts and they are leaving the districts in every place where there is chronic unemployment in this country. But. when you find a man and woman who have bought themselves a home. where you find a family that has invested in their own community. where their family ties are in the communityyou cannot ask the older people to get up and move. Let us quit kidding ourselves. What this bill would provide for our own people. it seems we are willing to do for every other country in the world. The President has just requested us to give him $4 billion to spend for foreign aid. And they have so much money that they could not spend it all this year if they wanted to. Yet. you have people who get up here in the well of the House and say that we should not spend money for our own people in our own country. Shame on you for not being willing to support the people of our own countryour own people who when they had jobs were willing to pay their taxes and to support our country and our Government. That. Mr. Chairman. is what this bill does. It is not perfect. there are some places where we disagree with it. but do not forget that the President of the United States has recommended a bill of his own. Here is an excerpt from the Sunday Independent of WilkesBarre. Pa.. dated Sunday. May 1. 1959. stating that three of President Eisenhowers aides went up to the ScrantonWilkesBarre area and that when they returned they had made the decision that they were going to ask not the $50 million that had been recommended by President Eisenhower. but $100 million more. or a bill with a total amount of $150 million."},{"1":"1959","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"We want to make it perfectly clear in the law this time that the officials cannot exercise their escape as they are now exercising it by making an administrative interpretation which we think obviously was never intended by the Congress when we put in the law the clear language wood moldings.

It is not raw lumber. and it is not the type of lumber that was contemplated to come in free of the 17 percent. as is true of raw lumber.

But that is all right. For the last 20 years the people of this Nation have been living in a state of fear. First. it has been one thing and then another.

What are they going to do? The gentleman from Texas has told us that one of those studies would cost $100.000a study to learn how bombing affects our minds. A little inquiry was made and it was learned that it was proposed to build underground shelters. What for? To take care of us when Russia or some other countryI do not know which. but some countrybegins to bomb us. Well if we are to lose to Russia. I would rather be blown to death than be sent to Siberia or a labor camp. We are appropriating $38 billion for national defense. Now they come along and ask us to spend $32 billion. or around that. to provide a place where we can run and hide when we hear the planes coming. But why live if Russia is to take over? It does not seem to me that we are being consistent about the situation. We either ought to have a little faith in our national defense program or else we should abandon it. Why spend $38 billion-$32 billion for places to hide when war comes. Shades of Molly Pitcher and General Putnam and the men and women at Lexington and Bunker Hill. Instead of fighting from the top of Bunker Hill they should have dug a cave and hid under the hill. Instead of fighting from behind the fence rows the minutemen should have hid in the woods.

I have an idea that I think just as much of my children. my grandchildrenand now listen to thismy greatgrandchildren. as the gentleman from Oklahoma may have for his people. if he ever has any greatgrandchildren. And I hope he lives to have a dozen or more. I do not like this idea of being accused of not being considerate or kindly of the people who are to come after.

Something was wrong with the jobsecurity formula. even for those who were not affected by reductions in force. The morale of Federal employees slipped. noticeably. The jobturnover rate reached alarming proportions. Even Presidents of the United States took time out to wonder why Federal employees were no longer satisfied with their work. and to consider ways and means of providing the incentives that would hold experienced and trusted employees whose places could be filled only at considerable cost and inconvenience. if ever. To work on a treadmill that causes a person to lose ground no matter how hard he tries to advance is no encouragement for a person to remain in the Federal service. Private industry. on the other hand. is quick to notice ability. and to reward it. voluntarily. Federal employees. however. have had to wage an uphill fight. and over a long period of time. to awaken those who control the pursestrings that Government workers are also human beings who must be able to make both ends meet if they are to do their best work. For the past year and a half we have seen this vital issue kicked around for political advantage. This has not fooled the Government workers for 1 minute. If anything. it has added to their discontent. The time has come. therefore. for the Congress to pass a genuine pay increase bill. and by a unanimous vote. if the harm that has been done to the morale of Federal employees is to be repaired. We have established a precedent in our cwn case by raising our own salaries generously. We have increased the pay of career personnel in the Armed Forces. We have made it possible for letter carriers and postal clerks to earn well over $4.000 a year. * The 1.073.262 Federal employees come last. but their arguments are now the strongest. There is no doubt whatever that they have earned and will get an upward pay adjustment. The only question is. How much? The Senate has voted 10 percent. The House Post Office and Civil Service Committee has recommended 71/ percent. The bill to increase postal salaries has already become law. and dissatisfaction is already apparent with its twoinstallment increase to 8.2 percent. with proportionately higher percentage increases for those in the upper brackets. I suggest that we do not write similar irritations into the Federal employees pay raise bill. An acrosstheboard boost would be fair to all. Personally. I believe that a 10percent raise would not be too much. But. whatever this House does decide. I hope that it will overwhelmingly endorse a substantial and longoverdue salary increase for all Federal workers today."},{"1":"1954","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. the railroad employees in my district. and I believe throughout the Nation. sincerely hope that bill H. R. 7840 will pass at this session of the Congress. This measure has been pending before the House since June 21. 1954. when the bill was favorably reported by the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. H. R. 7840 is supported by all the standard railway labor organizations. both operating and nonoperating. and contains many provisions beneficial to railroad employees and their dependents. So the Members of the House might know just what is being proposed. following will be found a short digest of what the bill contains: First. Under the present law aged widows are not eligible for survivor benefits until age 65. The bill reduces the eligibility age to 60. The same change would apply to dependent widowers or dependent parents otherwise eligible. Second. Under the present law a widowed mother and her child cease getting survivors benefits when the child reaches age 18. even though the child may be completely disabled for any employment. The bill provides that if the child is permanently and totally disabled the survivors benefits to the widowed mother and child will continue beyond age 18. Third. Under the present law a widow who has had railroad employment and is eligible for a retirement annuity in her own right and who would also be eligible for a survivor annuity by reason of her husbands employment has the latter offset against the former and cannot receive both. The bill provides for both to be paid. Fourth. Under the present law the maximum compensation that is taxable and creditable for both railroad retirement and unemployment insurance purposes is $300 per month. The bill increases this maximum to $350 both for tax purposes and for credit toward benefits. Individuals with an average monthly compensation in excess of $300 would obtain higher benefits than are obtainable under present law. A person with 30 years of service and an average monthly compensation of $350 would obtain an increase in his monthly annuity of $20.70 over the maximum amount that is payable under present law. Survivor benefits would also be increased in those cases where the deceased employee has had an average monthly compensation in excess of $300. Fifth. Under the present law. compensation earned after retirement age is used in computing the annuity even though through lower earnings in later years this operates to reduce the annuity. The bill provides for disregarding such compensationthough crediting the serviceif using such compensation would reduce the annuity. Sixth. Under the present law. a disability annuitant who earns more than $75 in each of 6 consecutive months is deemed no longer disabled at the end of the 6month period. The bill eliminates this test and provides instead for the nonpyament of the annuity to a disability annuitant with respect to any month in which he is paid more than $100 in earnings from employment or selfemployment. This will remove hardships on the one hand and eliminate abuses on the other. Seventh. Under the present law. the service of delegates to national or international conventions of railway labor organizations is covered employment under the act. These conventions frequently include delegates from units outside the railroad industry or outside the country who have no other covered employment. The accumulation of these trifling credits is of little if any value. particularly when compared with the nuisance of recording them and collecting the taxes on them. The bill excludes such service from coverage where the individual has no other previous covered employment. Eighth. The bill would strike out the present requirement that the child of a deceased employee under 18 and over 16 must attend school regularly if feasible in order to be eligible for a survivors benefit. This provision was placed in the law originally because a similar provision was contained in the Social Security Act. This provision has long since been stricken from the Social Security Act and it should be removed from the Railroad Retirement Act. Ninth. The bill proposes to establish a new unemployment insurance daily benefit rate of $8 for persons having had base year compensation of $4.000 or more and it further provides that if the daily benefit rate payable to an employee iq less than 50 percent of his daily rate of compensation for his last railway employment such daily benefit rate will be increased to that amount. but not to exceed $8. This Congress should not adjourn without taking action on the bill. It is sound and wellbalanced legislation in that it provides the revenue out of which tha increased benefits are to be paid."},{"1":"1953","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Let me tell you something about this offshore procurement. I have been reading some of the British financial journals. The British Financial Times says gleefully that although American dollars labeled aid may be reduced. American dollars received from offshore purchases will make up the loss. if any. So if you reduce the direct funds to the British in this bill you are still not cutting them out of anything. Let me go further. The London Economist assures its readers that American giveaway artists have a plan full of special devices which have been carefully worked out by mutualsecurity officials with the idea of including as much as possible under headings which will have the effect of economic. or defense support. and technical aid. while appearing to ask for much less for these purposes. In other words. trick American taxpayers into believing there is a cut in foreign spending While dishing out as much or more than before under offshore procurement. That same publication observes there may be a slight cut in the outright dole to Britain and other countries because it will be hard both to counter the argument for stringent economy and to explain away the existence of eleven and ninetenths billions of unspent funds voted in previous years. over four billions of which are still uncommitted to any particular project. So the British are saying they expect America to cut direct aid in military appropriations. but they will get it back in the offshor2 program. I call this particularly to the attention of Members from industrial districts. because this may well come back to haunt you in the future. The British seem amazed. as well they should. that any new foreign aid funds are sought on top of prodigious uncommitted funds. They can scarcely believe their continued good fortune in grabbing more and more American tax dollars in outright aid or offshore procurement. which means practically the same thingan Americanfinanced international WPA. On top of that the London Statist. another economic magazine. proclaims United States Aid Cut Need Cause No Alarm. because. it says in effect. British economy can stand alone if American aid is cut off. All this provides additional incentive for me to continue to vote against foreign aid and attempt. as I have done before. through legislation. to prevent the use of American tax dollars for offshore procurement. which deprives American Industry. labor. and agriculture of whatever contracts are let in foreign countries under that scheme."},{"1":"1952","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. I have had occasion to go before the Appropriations subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations. and I never expect to be used any more courteously than I was by that group. Notwithstanding the long hours they had spent in hearings they gave me an audience and heard me at length. I do not know how I can express my feeling of gratitude any more appreciatively than to say that I have never been used better. I have also been very appreciative of the work of the committee dealing with Interior appropriations. I think our chairman made a fine statement this morning in talking about how he would like to build those things that so closely touch the people of America. In cutting an appropriation bill for the Interior Department any cut that is made is not economy. for when we cut an appropriation bill for this department we take away future earnings of this Government and cut out revenueproducing enterprises we very badly need. Out in my particular section my people were interested in some development of the Missouri Valley. Minnesota has one of the highest cost power rates of an y State in the Union. due to being located in a highcost fuel area. We have been hampered very much over the years because of our inability to produce power at a rate cheap enough to provide industrial and agricultural expansion to the extent enjoyed by other areas located closer to fuelproducing areas. When our people heard of this Missouri Valley development their hopes were raised and they thought they saw an opportunity where they might receive part of the benefit of this development such as is taking place in the Northwest at Bonneville. in the South on the Tennessee Valley. and in the Southwest through the dams that have been put in by the Bureau of Reclamation. When the Minnesota people came down here a year Lgo they were told in the Senate that they should see what they could do about getting together with public and private power and see what could be worked out to the best advantage. They went home and held meeting after meeting. This year they came before the committee with a united front. When they heard that the Bureau of the Budget had approved this item for the building of a transmission line it gave them a feeling of confidence. for somehow people seem to feel that when they can secure that approval they have overcome one of the big hurdles. So it came as a great disappointment to them and a great disappointment to me when this particular item was stricken out of the bill. This particular item about which we are talking eventually will cost $54.000.000. but the $54.000.000 will all be repaid by the users plus 3 percent interest. In addition it will bring power in to Minnesota that will be distributed throughout the southwestern part of the State. an advantage they never have had before. It will mean that in the development of that country there will be greater earnings. and who can profit by those earnings any more than the United States Government through the collection of internal revenue? So on top of a loan. which is repayable with 3 percent interest. revenue will be collected by the Treasury of the United States from the earnings of the people in that particular area. It will do another thing that is very badly needed. It will encourage production. Production of what? The production of agricultural products and agricultural resources and that sort of thing which we presently talk of in terms of surpluses. But by the time this item is built and transmission lines are completed. we may be faced with an entirely different situation. a situation in which consumers will be trying to find some place from which to get food and fiber. I appreciate this opportunity to bring before the Members of the House this particular problem and I hope some future consideration can be given to the matter. This project was initiated by the Senate in 1951. The Minnesota REA cooperatives and the private utility companies appeared at that time. the REAs in favor of the project. the power companies requesting that no action be taken until a complete study has been made. The Senate did not act favorably on the proposal primarily because the project had not been included in the Presidents budget message to the Congress. and also because a coordinated plan had not been developed. Statements on the floor of the Senate were to the effect that the REAs and the private utilities in Minnesota should undertake a joint study of the Minnesota project in an effort to agree on a plan whereby Missouri Basin hydroelectric power could be made available to the people in the most economical manner possible. This year the Bureau of Reclamation project for Minnesota has been included in the Bureau of the Budget message. likewise the REAs and the private utility companies this year have agreed upon a plan in support of the project. This joint plan is in response to the request of the Senate and was arrived at after months of study and joint discussions. It is a plan which will utilize the present and planned facilities both of REAs and the private companies in a manner which will require a minimum expenditure on the part of the Bureau of Reclamation. and will result in the most practical and economical means of making hydroelectric power available in an area already included in the original overall Missouri Basin project previously approved by the Congress. The proposed 230.000volt transmission line in Minnesota is not initiating a new program inasmuch as lines previously have been authorized to points in North and South Dakota which are now under construction or have been completed. This line is an extension of previous authorizations and would simply close and complete a highvoltage loop making possible utilization of power that will be generated at previously authorized hydroelectric facilities in the Missouri River Basin. Careful coordination of the engineering studies that have been made of the problem by the cooperatives. the private power companies and the Bureau of Reclamation reveal that for technical and economic reasons it is necessary that the proposed backhome transmission line be built by the Bureau for the following reasons: (a) This line will integrate areas served by three large private power companies. 20 REA cooperatives. and many municipalities. It is essential that this large area. with its divergent interests. have a central medium through which overall integration of all power facilities will be accomplished. (b) Under the plan proposed Federal investments will be limited to this one line. thus providing overall economy. (c) It will provide for full use of all existing generating and transmission and distribution facilities. (d) It will provide the basis for intelligent planning for future development of added facilities that will become necessary to meet evergrowing demands for power."},{"1":"1951","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. the Federal Reserve Board is faking statistics to prove the need for Federal control over installment credit. and to continue the jobs of a horde of bookkeepers. economists. statisticians. messengers. typists. and house dicks who should be at work in defense plants anyhow. On June 30 of this year. the Congress again turned over to the Federal Reserve Board the power to control installment credit. This control is known as regulation W. one of the most vicious. useless. repulsive. and immoral laws ever passed in the annals of a constitutional democracy. As you know. regulation W affects only poor people who depend on installment credit for everyday necessities. It discriminates against the poor and deprives them of their inalienable right to buy when. where. and as they see fit. There was a time in this country when poor people could sit around the table after supper and figure out a budget. but the Federal Reserve Board has decided that people cannot do this anymore. The Board wants to regiment the thinking and planning of the poor people. You understand. of course. that the rich are not affected by this regulation. It is the same old story. like every war we have: a rich mans war and the poor mans fight. The present international crisis which brought on the national emergency gives the Socialists the opportunity to nationalize the poor mans credit. The Federal Reserve Board has been flooding the country with phony figures designcd to show that consumer credit and installment credit are getting out of hand and are being held in control only because of the great work of the Board and its secret police. The Federal Reserve Board has been getting away with propaganda murder for years now and it is about time somebody exposed them. The double talk of the Boards double domes is a masterpiece of deception and falsification and even the newspapers and radio stations seem to fall for it. The Federal Reserve Board has built up such a great name for honesty that Washington correspondents and radio commentators run off with the Boards press releases without even checking them. There seems to be a general feeling in Washington that whatever the Board says is true and does not have to be checked. Board cfflcials are smart enough to know. too. that there is only a handful of Washington correspondents who would have time to analyze the Boards figures so that their chances of getting caught in the act of a brazen falsehood are pretty slim. Incidentally. I have no quarrel with Gov. William McChesney Martin. of the Federal Reserve Board. for I know he is not a part of this conspiracy to fool the American public. but I am going to write him a personal note and ask him if he cannot promise the Congress a shakeup in his Research Division so that we can be guaranteed a little more honesty in the future publication of the Boards statistics on consumer credit. And while I am at it. I want to pay public tribute to J. K. Vardaman. another of the Boards Governnors and the only one I know of who has had the courage to speak up against regulation W and the efforts of somebody to make a case for Federal control of installment credit through misrepresentation and downright falsification of figures. This is the same Governor Vardaman who they said would be a stooge for President Truman when the Governors appointment was up for confirmation. Well. Governor Vardaman is loyal to his President but he does not mind disagreeing with him when he sees the economic and social dangers inherent in such regulations as W. As far as I can see. Governor Vardaman has been a stooge for the American people because he has taken a lot of thankless abuse over his position on regulation W. At any rate the Federal Reserve Board. using its high office and prestige. now tells the country that outstanding consumer credit today amounts to $19.000.000.000. That is an impressive figure and in some respects it scares you. The Boards economists want it to scare you. They want you to get the impression that every Tom. Dick. and Harry in the country is buying three televisions. four radios. and more furniture than he can possibly use. They want you to feel that this thing called consumer credit is getting out of hand and that there is only one way to stop this runaway machine and that is through Federal control. which we now have but which the Board is afraid of losing when they come up here next year for a renewal of this authority. Do you see what they are up to? They are laying the groundwork nowin October. mind youfor demands next year for continued control over the relationship between retailer and customer. This is an old propaganda trick and one the American public will see through. once they have all the facts. Hitler pulled this stunt and so did Mussolini and it worked for awhile. at least. The trick is to scare the people into legislative reforms. Of course. only Government can bring about any remedial legislation. Private industry cannot police itself. It is too weak and selfish. That is the propaganda line that the Board is feeding the American public and I am afraid they will gain their objectives unless they are exposed. Now what are the facts about the phony $19.000.000.000 which the Board says consumers owe? I will start out by saying that the truth about all consumer debt lies closer to $7.000.000.000 and not $19.000.000.000 and that of the $7.000.000.000 only $2.000.000.000 is owed by persons buying radios. televisions. furniture. and household appliances on the installment plan. The Board would like the country to get the impression that the $19.000.000.000. which is strictly a phony figure to begin with. is credit outstanding for articles bought on the installment plan. Obviously. they do not say that. They just leave that impression hoping that newspapers will confuse the figures. Actually. the newspapers seem to believe that outstanding consumer credit and outstanding installment credit are one and the same thing. The Federal Reserve Board says that the total consumer installment credit outstanding is $13.000.000.000. which is another bloated and faked figure as I will prove in a minute. but to the newspapers the $13.000.000.000 and the $19.000.000.000 figures seem interchangeable. Now. consumer credit to me means credit that is used by an individual for personal. family. and daily needs. On the other hand. credit used by professional or businessmen is commercial credit and has nothing to do with consumer credit. Yet. nowhere in its blowup of statistics does the Federal Reserve Board make this distinction. For example. they classify a bank loan of $100.000 as consumer credit. in an effort to exaggerate and build up the total of outstanding consumer credit. How do they arrive at the phony $19.000.000.000 which they say consumers owe? By a simple process of manipulation and fraudulent accounting. Let me show you. step by step. just how dishonest these figures are and you can judge for yourself who is telling the troth here. The Board says that the Nations gas. electric. and telephone bills total $1.000.000.000 and that they are a part of the $19.000.000.000 in outstanding consumer credit. Now. everyone knows that these bills are either payable in advance or that a deposit is required. so how consumer credit gets into this figure is something I do not understand. You will have to agree with me. however. that since there is no credit involved in these transactions. we deduct a billion dollars and the Boards padded figure of 19 billion become 18. The next item which the Board includes as a part of consumer credit is charge accounts. Here I can nail them with their own definition of installment credit. with which I do not agree. but I will use it to show you how dishonest their figures are. The Board says installment credit is the mortgaging of future income to satisfy current desires. The middle and upper middle classes with charge accounts certainly never thought they were mortgaging future incomes when they opened charge accounts. All of us know that a charge account is not a credit account but an account of convenience only. Yet. the Board adds charge accounts totaling $3.750.000.000 to outstanding consumer credit because it helps to make the total look bigger. Obviously. this $3.750.000.000 should be deductzd from any total of outstanding consumer credit. The next item the Board adds to the total outstanding consumer credit is $1.396.000.000 for bank loans. the types that are made by businessmen and individuals who use the mozncy to buy stocks. We have the Boards own word for it that all of these loans are paid off to the banks in a lump sum. Mind you. these are not the types of loans where the little fellow agrees to pay back so much a month over a year. These are the single payment loans. the kind the big fellows make. And the Federal Reserve Board has the gall to classify them as consumer loans and they add this figure to the total. to help bring the total up to $19.000.000.000. In all fairness and honesty. the gas. electric. telephone bills. charge accounts. and single payment loans. which total more than $6.000.090.000 and which are listed as consumer credit items. should be stricken from the total of $19.000.000.000 which the Board says consumers owe. That leaves a more realistic consumer debt of only $13.000.000.000 but even this figure is bloated and purposely padded to show how this type of debt is getting out of hand and how Government controls are needed to keep it in line. Here is a breakdown of the $13.000.000.000. as outlined by the Federal Reserve Board and classified as debt incurred by consumers either buying merchandise on the installment plan or borrowing money to be repaid in installments: $6.000.000.000 from various lending agencies. $3.000.000.000 for such articles as televisions and household appliances and $4.000.000.000 for automobiles. I have no way of telling how much of the $6.000.000.000 listed as consumer installment credit should actually be tabulated as business loans. The Board does not give a breakdown of this figure. All I know is that a high percentage of this $6.000.000.000 represents loans made to business and industry. Business borrows money on the installment plan. the same as individuals. but the loan certainly should not be listed as a consumer debt. From information available through trade and banking channels it is clear to me that 50 percent. or only $3.000.000.000. of this $6.000.00.000 should be listed as consumer debt. The $13.000.000.000 of outstanding consumer installment credit now becomes only $10.000.000.000. Even this figure is bloated to bolster the Boards case for continuance of regulation W. The Board claims that consumers owe $3.000.000.000 on furniture. televisions and other home appliances that they are buying on the installment plan. The Board does not tell the newspapers and the public that a high percentage of this figure includes such items as furniture bought on the installment plan by roominghouse owners. Such installment credit can scarcely be called consumer installment credit. yet it is so listed by the Federal Reserve Board. further evidence of dishonesty and hyprocrisy and the Boards sly attempts to influence the Congress into making Regulation W a permanent law. I dont say that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board is intentionally deceiving the public. I honestly believe that the Governors have not considered the conclusions of the pencil pushers. who are pulling the wool over their eyes. How do I know the intent of the Governors when they themselves dont know? This much I can say in all kindness to the Governors: it is their responsibility to see that their research division gathers facts and figures and lays off the propaganda stuff. The $3.000.000.000 listed as debts contracted by individuals buying articles on the installment plan also includes books bought by young doctors and lawyers and tools bought by carpenters. most of which are bought on the installment plan. but are not considered consumer credit. by any reasonable person. by nobody. I know. in fact. except the Federal Reserve propagandists or the pen and pencil boys down there who have a talent for making figures tell tall tales and give them jobs at the same time. Many farmers buy necessary equipment on the installment plan and while I do not have the exact figure for that outstanding indebtedness it obviously runs into hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The Reserve Board says that this debt is part of the outstanding consumer debt. while even a child knows that it is part of a business or farm debt. But the Federal Reserve wants that figure in the consumer debt column because it will scare a lot of Congressmen into believing that regulation W should be made permanent. My best guess is. and do not forget that all of this work by the Reserve Board ribbon clerks is only guess work at the best. that at least onethird of the $3.000.000.000 listed as consumer installment credit debt should be sliced off. so that the real or true figure would be closer to $2.000.000.000. The next and last item listed as consumer installment credit is $4.000.000.000 for automobiles. There are more jokers In this figure than in a riggedup deck of cards. To begin with. the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that onethird of all automobiles are bought and used primarily for business purposes. But the Federal Reserve Board charges the entire auto debt up to the consumer. in a further attempt to show the public and the Congress the continuing need for regulation W. Other studies reveal that almost twothirds of United States automobiles are used in connection with making a living. The automobile the insurance salesman buys on the installment plan can hardly be charged up to consumer credit debt. but that is what the Federal Reserve Board does. Clearly. this is a business debt and should be so listed. My own study of this item shows that 50 percent of automobile debt is business and 50 percent outandout consumer. Theerfore. the $4.00.000.000 the Board has charged against consumer debt should be two billion. not four billion. If we subtract this $2.000.000.000 sum. plus another three billion from the six billion Installment loan column and another billion from the $3.000.000.000 that the Board says consumers owe on all other items we begin to get a more realistic picture of the true consumer installment debt. namely. a figure of seven billion. not thirteen billion. The $7.000.000.000 contrasts sharply with the hysterical newspaper headlines of $19.000.000.000 which the Board says is the total outstanding consumer debt. Excluding for the moment the items of consumer installment debt and consumer automobile debt. the American consumer owes about $2.000.000.000 on all other items. It is this $2.000.000.000 sum that forms the basis for regulation W. In other words. all the ranting and raving over the consumers wild spending spree is over this $2.000.000.000 which is much less than one percent of the total national income. I want to repeat that statement. The frenzied efforts of the Federal Reserve Board to whip the country into a fury over the consumers spending and the inevitable demands for Federal regulation of this spending. pivot around a sum of money that is much less than one percent of the total national income. Meanwhile. the Keystone Comedy cops of the Federal Reserve Board are enforcing regulation W. falling all over each other in their silly efforts to browbeat the little fellow. Actually. there is nothing to police because private industry. the retailers who are out on the firing line every day and the manufacturers who supply them. were doing the job themselves. In other words. Congress this year passed a law to regulate retailers and buyers when they were already doing more than the regulation required anyway. Regulation W requires a fifteen percent down payment on most articles. with the balance paid off in 18 months. It never occurred to the Federal Reserve Board when they asked for this renewal authority that most reputable retailers would not give the customer better terms than this anyhow. Why then do we have this senseless law on the statute books? The reason is very simple. It gives power and jobs to a bunch of men in the Federal Reserve Board who could not make a living in a free and competitive society. It gives people like J. Leonard Townsend something to do. He is the Boards chief of police. He is winding up his attack on L. M. Giannini and the Bank of America and pretty soon will be idle. Townsend wants to destroy the Bank of America. the greatest retail merchandisers of money in all history. When he gets the Bank of America case out of the way. Townsend and his Rover Boys can devote full time to harassing and jailing. if possible. poor old women who violate regulation W. We must not forget that we turned over very sweeping powers to the Federal Reserve Board and that a cop like Townsend. already endowed with a jail complex. will use them to the utmost. For example. if a customer can not meet an installment payment that he signed up for. he must report to the retailer like a paroled convict and explain why he can not meet the payment. The retailer does not require this indignity. The Government forces him to do it. It seems absurd to me for Americans to worry about the loss of personal liberties of people two. three. and five thousand miles away. They better start worrying about their own personal liberties first."},{"1":"1950","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"As I stated. I now repeat. while I have doubts. and the Senator may be able to dispel them in the discussion here. they. would not deter me from voting for the submission of the amendment to the people. The very essence of democracy. the foundation stone under the whole foundation of our Government. is that if the people are given the right and oportunity to discuss matters of public import. to debate them. and to present opposing views. out of that discussion will be crystallized a decision that will be for the best interests of the people. To refuse to submit to them. not a capricious matter. but a matter of genuine concern. to me is to contravene and negate the very foundation on which we build our governmental structure. and to express distrust of it.Mr. President. in commencing the dedate on Senate Joint Resolution 25. which proposes an amendment to the Constitution of the United States. I should like to try. if I can. to set this proposal in its historical context. I do not mean to say. nor do I wish the statement I have just made to be construed to mean. that the Congress should submit to the people every whimsical matter which may be presented to it. but where there exists such support of a question concerning the public welfare as to justify taking action upon it. or. as the Constitution says. to make it necessary that action upon it be taken. then of course I am convinced. and I think no one can deny. that the people have the right to pass on the question regardless of any individual views. That is why I refer to the historical background. In the first place. of course. it is a rare occasion when the people of this country are offered the opportunity to amend the basic law. In the first half of this century the Constitution has been altered only six times. In fact. the twentyfirst amendment merely repealed the eighteenth. leaving a net change of only four amendments added to the Constitution since the year 1870. Secondly. this occasion marks the culmination of a 27year legislative campaign in the Congress to reach a decision on submitting an equalrights amendment to the States for ratification. Thirdly. the proposal before the Senate is an expression of the ultimate objective of a popular movement that began more than 100 years ago. a steadily growing movement of both men and women which has sought to guarantee equal rights under the law for all citizens regardless of their sex. The nineteenth amendment. ratified in 1920. assured both male and female citizens of equal political rights as voters. It did not. however. assure them equal legal rights. and from that inadequacy has flowed as a corollary. the effort of the past quarter century to attain full constitutional recognition of the legal right of citizens. regardless of their sex. to be treated equally under the laws of the country. Lastly. this sketch of the historical setting for the amendment would be Incomplete without mention of its significance in the present worldwide ideological struggle between the advocates and the enemies of human righto. What we do here to guarantee equal rights under the law to all our citizens. men and women alike. cannot help but affect our countrys success in the global battle to win mens minds away from tyranny and toward free society. With these considerations In mind. Mr. President. I urge that the Senate move speedily to a decision to submit the proposed amendment to the people. Mr. President. this joint resolution was Introduced In Congress on January 13. 1949. Associated with me as cosponsors of the joint resolution are a very great number of Senators: The distinguished Senator from Maine . the Senator from Oklahoma . the Senator from California . the Senator from Delaware . the Senator from Arkansas . the Senator from North Dakota . the Senator from Maryland . the Senator from Florida . the Senator from Wyoming . the Senator from Pennsylvania . the Senator from Wisconsin . the Senator from Maryland . the Senator from Iowa . the Senator from Arkansas . the Senator from Nebraska . the Senator from Michigan . the Senator from Kansas . the Senator from Vermont . the Senator from Washington . the Senator from Wyoming . the Senator from Indiana . the Senator from New Jersey . the Senator from North Dakota . the Senator from Pennsylvania . the Senator from Minnesota . the Senator from California [Mr. DowNEY]. and the Senator from New Mexico . I Interpolate at this point. Mr. President. that this morning the Senator from New Mexico called me by telephone to express his very great regret that the state of his health would not permit him to be present to vote for the joint resolution. but he asked me as a favor to him again to state his deep interest in the measure and his desire to be present to support it. At the time the joint resolution was submitted. the late distinguished Senator from North Carolina. Mr. Broughton. from Kansas. Mr. Reed. and from Idaho. Mr. Miller. were alsosponsors. They have all passed from among us. Thus. originally. the joint resolution was sponsored by a total of 33 Members of the Senate. Two additional Senators. the Senator from Tennessee . and the Senator from Oregon . also signified to me their desire to participate as cosponsors of the joint resolution after it was already in print. Many of us who are sponsoring this proposal in the Eightyfirst Congress have been associated with similar efforts for equal rights in previous Congresses. It is one measure of the steadily increasing demand among the American people for this proposed constitutional amendment to find a much larger group of Senators participating in the presentation of the joint resolution in this Congress than ever before. Not only in the Senate. but In the House as well. the trend has been toward an evergreater support for a constitu-. tional amendment to provide equal rights under the law for both men and women. This rising curve of support is a reflection of the evergrowing body of public opinion in the Nation at large for such constitutional amendment. I feel sure it is not necessarythat indeed it would be an imposition on Senatorsfor me to trace the long struggle through which we have passed in trying to place before the country an amendment to the Constitution providing simply that equality of rights under the law shall not be abridged or denied on account of sex. It is enough to note that this Is the twentyseventh consecutive year that this proposed amendment. in one form or another. has been before the Congress. Since 1923 there have been 26 different hearings on itexhaustive hearingsin committees and subcommittees of both Houses of Congress. For 27 years the question has been examined. debated. reexamined and redebated again and again by our citizens and by their elected representatives. In my opinion. it is highly significant that each year a greater number of individuals and a greater number of organizations have endorsed the idea. that each year adds to the number of State legislatures which have memorialized the Congress in favor of the amendment. that oach year more and more State Governors have urged its adoption. It is noteworthy. too. I think. that today there are 10 Members of the Senate who in the past. while serving as Governors of their respective States. wrote strong endorsements of the equalrights amendment. Of these former Governors now serving in the United States Senate. seven are cosponsors of the pending joint resolution. Their continued keen interest and their stanch support of equal rights for men and women are. to my mind. further evidence of the widespread and increasing favorable opinion in the Nation regarding the proposed amendment. Not only has this issue been alivevery much alivefor more than a quarter of a cpntury. but in the last two national elections both of the two major political parties wrote unequivocal endorsement of equal rights by constitutional amendment into their national platforms. Many of the Senators who worked in the drafting committees on the equalrights plank for their respective party platforms are sitting in the Senate today. The Republican Party platform of 1940. for example. stated: We favor submission by Congress to the States of an amendment to the Constitution providing for equal rights for men and women. The 1944 Republican Party platform carried a plank in the same language as its 1940 platform. The Democratic Party platform for the year 1944 declared: We recommend to Congress the submission of a constitutional amendment on equal rights for women. * Mr. President. I do not consider that absolutely binding on any Senator. While I go along with the major provisions of my party platform. as. in my opinion. representing on the whole. the better statement of my views on issues. I reserve my right as an individual not to be bound by every line and every paragraph. I simply cite the platform declarations for the purpose of showing that this is not a capricious. a whimsical matter we are presenting to the people. but that behind it is a volume of public interest and public pledge which justifies our giving the people a right to express themselves on the subject. In the interim between the 1944 and the 1948 national elections. the Senate had an opportunity to vote on a joint resolution calling for submission of the equalrights amendment to the States. The resolution received a majority of the votes cast at that time. in 1946. but lacked the necessary twothirds majority. largely because of extremely heavy absences among its supporters in the last days of the session. Had every known supporter been in the country and present in the Senate when the vote was taken. the exact number of votes in the affirmative would have been 56which is the same number of votes cast when the womanssuffrage amendment received its final vote in this body. The pressure of public opinion behind this equalrights amendment did not abate. however. because of this temporary setback. Quite the contrary. Responding to massive popular support. the national platforms of the two major I parties in 1948 again declared in unequivocal terms the intention of the Republican and Democratic Parties to press for submission of an � equalrights * amendment such as we are considering today. It is noteworthy that the equalrights planks of the two parties In 1948 were written in almost identical lan. guage. Both parties favored submission of a constitutional amendment providing equal rights for women. Thus. there is no possibility of anyone Imagining that this is in any sense a partisan issue. - A thoroughly bipartisan group of Senators has submitted the amendment as set forth in Senate Joint Resolution 25. This is no party issue. it cannot be. since we are dealing with the basic rights of human beings to which both our great parties are equally dedicated. In the past session of the present Congress. on March 22. 1949. the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. for the first time. reported the resolution unanimously. Every member but one of that distinguished committee of able lawyers. was present and voted affirmatively. There can be no doubt whatever. at this late date. that the text of the proposed amendment has been minutely and meticulously scrutinized by the most capable and judicious legal minds in the Senate. both in past Congresses and in the present Congress. There was in the Seventyeighth Congress a favorable Senate Judiciary report by Senators Austin. OMahoney. Kilgore. and McFarland. in the Seventyninth Congress. favorable Senate Judiciary Committee. report by Senator Hatch. in the Eightieth Congress. favorable Senate Judiciary Committee report by Senator Ferguson. in the Eightyfirst Congress. favorable Senate Judiciary Committee report by Senator McCarran. There has never been an unfavorable report on the equalrights amendment. Every legal and constitutional aspect of it has been weighed a score of times. And now at last we are to vote on this issue which has for so long been beforethe country and before the Congress. The controlling argument. to my mind. which should guide us in our discussion of the proposed amendment is this: What we do here when we vote on this measure is to allow the people their democratic right to decide. themselves. through their State legislatures. whether or not they want to have the amendment ratified and made a part of the Constitution. I do not stress the fact that the joint resolution must be passed by a twothirds majority of both Houses of Congress. nor the fact that before the amendment can become part of the Constitution. it must. of course. be approved by threefourths of the States. The founding fathers of our country did not give Congress the authority to amend or change the Constitution. In their wisdom. the men who drafted the Constitution placed the source of power in the people. The problem. then. was how to tap the reservoir of power in the people so as to make changes in the fundamental law from time to time as circumstances and exigencies might require. Two methods to which I referred a moment ago were provided: One was by the peoples Initiative. expressed through the States. requesting Congress to call a Constitutional Convention for the purpose of amending the basic framework of law. This method was difficult and cumbersome. The other way provided that Congress should submit proposed amendments to the States. for the legislature of each State to determine whether it wanted to ratify or not. The question before the Senate. then. Is not Shall we amend the Constitution? I cannot repeat that too often. That question is not for us to decide. The States. with at least threefourths of them concurring. if the amendment is to become part of the Constitution. must make the real decision. No. the question before us is simply this: Should we now submit this amendment to the States for their decision? If I were opposedwhich I am notto this amendment to the Constitution. I would vote for submission of the amendment to the people of the United States. I do not distrust the wisdom or judgment of the people of the United States. I do not have such a high regard for the wisdom of my own judgment that I will refuse to submit proposed constitutional amendments to my fellow citizens of the United States. to let them pass judgment in the way that the founding fathers. those who wrote the Constitution. said the people have a right to do. In other words. our power of determination is limited to deciding whether or not the people should be permitted to express themselves locally in their own States on this issue. Of course. it goes without saying that the Congress should notand does notsubmit to the people every capricious. whimsical. or captious notion that may be suggested to it. Not long ago. Mr. President. I stood on the floor and argued against the shipment in interstate commerce of colored oleomargarine. I argued as earnestly and as strongly as I knew how. But I would not think of submitting that question to the people of the United States as a constitutional amendment. More recently. we took up the basingpoint conference report. a matter of tremendous importance to the people. But that is a legislative matter. not a matter to be submitted to the people as a proposed constitutional amendment. I would not favor doing so. So. as I have said. Congress does not submit to the people every capricious. whimsical. or captious notion that may be suggested. But I am sure that no one will pretend today. after 27 years of public discussion of the equalrights amendment. that the proponents of the present joint resolution are moved by caprice. whimsy. or crackpot faultfinding. Nothing new or startling is here being sprung upon the people. I hesitate. in fact. to guess how many pages of testimony are available concerning this longsought amendment. how many volumes have been written to enlighten the people about it. how many public speeches have been made about it in every State of the land. Mr. President. I mention here some of the many national organizations which have endorsed the amendment: The National Womans Party. the General Federation of Womens Clubs. the National Education Association of the United States. the National Federation of Business and Professional Womens Clubs. the National Association of Women Lawyers. the American Medical Womens Association. the Osteopathic Womens National Association. the National Association of School Secretaries. the National Council of Women Chiropractors. Association of American Women Dentists. the American Federation of Soroptimist Clubsthe largest association of women in our country. the National Association of Colored Women. the Ladies of the Grand Army of the Republic. the Congress of State Societies. the Pilot International. the Alpha Iota Sorority. the Wheel of Progress. Delta Phi Epsilon. the Quota International. The biennial convention of the National Council of Women of the United States. in May 1946. recommended that its member organizations request the Congress of the United States to follow democratic procedure by submitting the important question of the equal status of women. as embodied in the equalrights amendment. to the States for action. Furthermore. hundreds of State. regional. and local organizations of women representing social. political. industrial. business. and religious groups. have endorsed the amendment. Mr. President. I pause here to say that I understood that there was presented. or was about to be presented. a statement from leading women jurists opposing this amendment. On Saturday. I received the following telegram from Judge Marion J. Harron. whose name appeared or is to appear. if and when that statement is filed: WASHINGTON. D. C.. January 20. 1950. Senator Guy M. GILLETTE. Unitea States Senate. Washington. D. C.: My name erroneously included in list submitted by committee. Status of women dated January 13 as opposed to Senate Joint Resolution 25. equalrights amendment. letter. and list may be inserted CONGRESSIONAL REcORD. Please request deletion of my name from list of opponents. As a citizen I support equalrights amendment to guarantee civil rights for all women uniformly in United States and I also support American minimum . standards for labor in American industry. Our Nation has advanced beyond both types of nineteenth century backwardness. there cannot be a lasting conflict under law between these two principles if by constitutional amendment equal rights under law for all citizens is established. The temporary period of legal clarification of local statutes after equalrights amendment is adopted will require relatively small effort and should not prevent the uniting of all .women in a common effort for the good of all citizens. You may insert this in RECORD. Respectfully."},{"1":"1949","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I am only trying to bring out the facts.

They have voluntarily retired from the Congress of the United States. I assert. and I say it as a fact. that if either Mr. LEA or Mr. ELLIOTT had sought the nomination of the Democratic Party in California in their districts this time. each of them would have received the nomination. and. in my opinion. also the nomination of the Republican Party. by overwhelming majorities. . Mr. LEA is a man who endears himself to every young and new Congressman. I recall when I came here. 31 years of age. and feeling pretty green. notwithstanding the fact that I had for some 8 or 9 years been district attorney in my home county. Because our districts border each other for some three or four hundred miles in northern California and because Mr. LEA has been so admired and respected by my people. I was told the first man I should see when I got to Washington was Congressman CLARENCE LEA. the dean of the California delegation. When I landed at Union Station I did not even stop to check my bags until I had gone to the phone booth and phoned CLARENCE LEA. His kindness and personal attention and friendship on that occasion will never be forgotten. Since then I have had many occasions to be grateful for his friendship and for his guidance. He has made the way much easier for me in the years that I have been here in Congress. In the early stages of my career he helped me consistently on committee assignments and in the making of the hard decisions which young Congressmen have to make. I regret very much to see him leave the Congress of the United States and I regret that notwithstanding the fact that I know after 30 years of service Mr. LEA is entitled to take some time off and to enjoy a few years out In California. I know that he will find much happiness and much contentment. There is a great deal of legislation which I could mention to which Mr. LEA has attached his name and which will go down to his credit in the records of the Congress of the United States. There Is one piece of legislation. however. which he initiated on which the task has not been finished. I hope when it Is finished that proper credit is given to Mr. LEA for the fact that he started the initial flgbt to change the electoral system of the United States. The legislation which he proposed has been considered by the Judiciary Committee of the House and by other committees and I believe some day will be enacted as the law of the land. In all probability that legislation will be the finest monument to Mr. LEA of all he has done in his years of service here in Congress.  With respect to my good friend ALFRED ELLIOTT. also a Democrat. I feel that he has a quality which is more important in public service than any other. I rate a man in public service on three qualities and in this order: He must. first. be honest. he must. second. be courageous. and he must. third. be able and intelligent. If he is not honest he is dangerous just to the point that he is courageous and intelligent. If he is honest and able without being courageous then his honesty and ability do not serve the public interest because he does not assert his capabilities. Mr. ELLIOTT. in my opinion. is one of the most courageous men I have ever seen in public life. He is a man who says what he thinks. The high esteem in which he is held on both sides of the aisle in this Chamber is due to the fact that he says what he thinks. and people who hear him say what he thinks know that he thinks that honestly. That is the reason that in this JIouse. time and again. in my experience. men on both sides of the aisle have been willing to follow his leadership in the position he has taken on public questions. It is regrettable we do not have more men of his caliber in the Congress of the United States today. men of that type of courage. because it is that type of courage we need in the era through which we are passing at this time. I am sorry Mr. ELLIOTT is leaving. He has not been here 30 years as has Mr. LEA. but I have reason to believe that his people will miss his services in this Congress. I know there are some jobs to be done which he would like to see finished. one of them being to see water coming down the KernFriant canal to give additional impetus to farming and Irrigation in the south San Joaquin. We will go aheadand promise him to try to get the job done. Mr. Speaker. these men. CLARENCE LEA and ALFRED ELLIOTT. are great. experienced. and able champions. The little humble people of this Nation can feel safe by their firesides In the evening when they know that men like CLARENCE LEA and ALFRED ELLIOTT are on guard under this Capitol domeagainst those elements which. for their own ends. would turn over the established systems. political and economic. under which we live. They are retiring from their posts. and It is a loss to this Nation. as well as their districts. No new man will take their places or even dent the sands upon which they have so substantially imprinted their efforts and accomplishments in this Congress. These men are my friends. I am happy for this opportunity to acknowledge my indebtedness and say my thanks. They have befriended me so much and so often I could not mention it all here. But I am sure that when I have completed my service in Congress and look back over the path along which I have comeas they do nowthere will be two milestones which will stand out along the way. ALFRED ELLIOTT and CLARENCE LEA. I am as grateful to them for our associations and our friendship as their people and this Nation should be for the service they have rendered. As our friend. the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts said. we are not saying goodby to these gentlemen because we know that we will hear from them again and that we will see them again. but they leave this Congress with the highest esteem and respect and friendship that I believe any men in the California delegation ever had.

Mr. Bill Warne. in tribute to"},{"1":"1947","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I wish to state what I should like to have the RECORD show as myreasons for favoring the confirmation of the nomination of Mr. Murdock. I think we should keep in mind the fact that no question has been raised at any time as to the intellectual honesty of Abe Murdock. I wish to lay that down as the criterion of prevailing importance in passing judgment upon the qualifications of any man. I care not who he is. who is nominated for a quasijudicial or a judicial office or for any other office. Is he intellectually honest? If we start with that premise. then there is a rule of legal ethics..I submit. Mr. President. which removes any doubt as to whether that individual as a lawyer is going to participate in an impartial administration of the law. Lawyers are ethically bound by the great trust imposed on them of administering justice impartially in accordance with the law applied to the facts as shown by the record of a case. I think it would be most unfortunate if the Senate should ever take the position that when it comes to pass judgment. by way of confirmation or nonconfirmation. .upon lawyers who are recommended and nominated for judicial office. we should be influenced because of the position they took as legislators on what they considered to be the social and economic merits of given pieces of legisldtion. We should recognize very clearly that the functions of a legislator and the functions of a judge are as different as opposites can be. Hence. at no time have I ever shared the criticism of some socalled liberalswho violate principles of liberalitywhen they oppose the confirmation of men nominated for judicial office who as legislators were considered as conservative in their legislative point of view on pieces of social and economic legislation. Mr. President. I deny premise that both political liberals and conservatives are not equally qualified for judicial appointment. I do so because of the principle of legal ethics previously referred to in these comments. Lawyers. both liberal and conservative. if intellectually honest. till rise to the trust of impartial administration of justice when elevated to the bench. Give me a man who I am convinced is intellectually honest. and then I have a man who also will carry out to the highest of standards the high ethics of my profession. for he knows that when he takes the oath of office. as a judicial officer. to uphold the law and to apply the law as it is found in the statute books. he has been given a trust of such importance that we need have no doubt as to the impartiality of the justice he will administer. Mr. President. I say Abe Murdock is .a man who Is intellectually honest. He Is a lawyer and he understands the ethics of our profession. I am satisfied that under his administration we shall receive an impartial administration of the TaftHartley law in accordance with the law as he finds it applied to the record in the cases presented to him. During the- war. as a member of the National War Labor Board. I had an interesting experience. Mr. President. I saw men sit on that great quasijudicial tribunal of this Government. representing a clear crosssection of American points of view in the field of social and economic legislation. Let me say here. because I do not wish to rise a second time today. that on the list of nominations now before us is the name of one of the employer members of the War Labor Board to whom I wish to pay tribute. I refer to Cyrus Ching. who has been nominated to head the new Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. In serving with me on the War Labor Board. he represented industry. I wish to say that I consider him to be one of the great industrial statesmen of America. and a man who when sitting on the War Labor Board applied the two criteria of judicial judgment to which I am referring today. namely. intellectual honesty and the ethical obligation of applying the law impartially to the facts as shown by the record of a given case. I served as the enforcement officer of the War Labor Board. and I wish to say to the everlasting credit of Cyrus Ching that. although we did not always agree as to the decisions in cases. nevertheless. once we reached a decision on a case. he never failed to take the position that all members of the Board. employer and labor members. as well as public members. should unite in support of enforcing the decision. I mention that in passing only because I think it is so important. Mr. Pxesident. that we have our recollections refreshed now and then as to the differences between judicial functioning and legislative functioning. I think men such as Abe Murdock and Cyrus Ching recognize those differences. Hence I think that as we approach the question of confirmation of these nominations and other nominations in the future. we should always ask ourselves the questions. Are we satisfied as to the intellectual honesty of the nominee? Next. are we satisfied that the nomineebe he liberal or conservative or nondescript In political philosophy recognizes and appreciates the ethical obligation that must be maintained by our judicial officers if we are to preserve government by law in this countrynamely. the obligation of handing down evenhanded. impartial justice based on the judicial record made before the tribunal in the trial of a case. Because of my personal acquaintance with and high respect for Abe Murdock and Cyrus Ching and because I know they meet the tests of the true criteria for impartial administration of justice to which I have referred. I am happy to join in voting for confirmation of their nominations today."},{"1":"1946","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. the House a few minutes ago received the message of the President vetoing the OPA bill. The question now before us is. Shall the House pass the bill notwithstanding the veto of the President? We passed the bill in the House by a vote of 265 to 105. An overwhelming majority of Democrats and Republicans voted for the compromise bill. I was one of the 265. The 105 votes against the bill represented two groups. One group insisted that OPA be continued another year without the changes. The other group was against any extension whatsoever. It will require a twothirds vote to override the veto of the President. The President has been warned heretofore time and again by his friends and his leaders in the House and Senate that a veto of this will would kill OPA. but the President ignored the advice of Speaker RAYBURN. Democratic Leader McCoRMACK. Mr. SPENCE in charge of the bill. Senator BARKLEY. and Senator McKELLAR. the President pro tempore in the Senate. and no doubt he accepted the advice of Chester Bowles and others who desired to continue for at least another year these waremergency controls over agriculture. industry. and the American people. These Democratic leaders. as well as Republicans. have been studying this pricecontrol problem for more than 4 years. They really know more about it L7978 than the President. Mr. Bowles. and others who urged him to veto this bill. They seem to think that. if they could kill the OPA bill. that they could force through the Congress a resolution to continue the life of the OPA without change. The Roosevelt and Truman administrations. because of the war emergency. secured almost unlimited control over the American people. agriculture. industry. and commerce. Although the war has been over in Europe for nearly 15 months and in Japan nearly a year. they refuse to relinquish these war emergency controls. Now is some modification necessary? Many able Members of the House and Senate and countless millions of Americans in agriculture. industry. and in all walks of life insisted that we could not have recovery in this country under present OPA. They pointed to the fact that after 4 years of OPA. scarcity and famine stalked through the richest agricultural and the greatest industrial country of the world. Poultry and livestock were dying because of the lack of necessary food. The health and lives of the American people were threatened because of the lack of food and other necessities. I am receiving daily pleading wires and letters from the people and businessmen of my district stating that workers were forced to quit their employment because of the lack of food. and they also stated that poultry and livestock were dying because of the lack of feed. It was claimed that the OPA would *prevent the rise of prices. black markets. and inflation. We all know that prices have rapidly and steadily risen. Many commodities have increased from 25 to more than 200 percent. Black markets have increased by leaps and bounds. so that today it is generally admitted that 75 percent of the transactions are handled in some form or another of the black market and. of course. the threat of inflation has steadily grown stronger. There have been appropriated by the Congress and made available approximately $4.500.000.000 in the way of subsidies which the OPA insisted was necessary to help keep down prices. The Congress has appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars to provide the salary and other expenses of more than 60.000 office holders. The OPA has had almost unlimited power over the Aierican people and all of their activities for approximately 4 years and yet we find this country in the worst condition it has ever been in. Literally millions of people have been insisting that there must be a change. They say the OPA has failed to realize the purposes for which it was set up. To wit: Keep down prices. prevent black markets. provide for an equitable distribution of available supplies. and prevent inflation. To this appeal those engaged in industry. agriculture. and commerce. as well as the American people. the President. Chester Bowles and his crowd have insisted that the Congress extend the life of the OPA with all of its war powers knd with billions in subsidies and more than 60.000 office holders. The House and Senate decided to make a thorough investigation of the whole subject and to that end bills were introduced in the House and Senate to extend the life of the OPA. These bills were referred to the Banking and Currency Committees of the House and Senate. Chester Bowles and his associates and others who insisted on an extension with no change and the representatives of agriculture. industry. and business and others who insisted there must be changes. and many of the very best experts in the land on this subject testified before the Banking and Currency Committee of the House and the Banking and Currency Committee of the Senate. I know of no other proposed legislation that has been given more thorough hearings than these bills. It turned out on crossexamination Mr. Bowles and others. that they each and every one admitted that OPA had not achieved its objectives. They admitted that there should be changes. The Banking and Currency Committee of the House. made Up largely of Democrats. reported favorably a bill which provided for many changes to the OPA. This bill came to the House. It was debated and considered for many days where additional amendments were adopted by an overwhelming majority and the bill. as finally amended. was approved by a vote of 265 to 105 and as we have pointed out. an overwhelming majority of Democrats and a very substantil majority of Republicans voted for the bill. It then went to the Banking and Currency Committee of the Senate. That committee held exhaustive hearings and all groups were given the fullest opportunity to appear and give their views. that committee. controlled by the Democrats. made other substantial changes and reported the bill favorably to the Senate. In the Senate the bill was debated and considered at great length. The Democrats have a very substantial majority in the Senate as well as in the House. The Senate passed the amended OPA bill by a vote of approximately 3 to 1. As there was some difference between the Senate bill and the House bill it was necessary for them to go to conference. The conferees. made up of Republicans and Democrats of the Banking and Currency Committees of the House and Senate. spent about 2 weeks in considering the .wo bills and finally the conferees agreed upon a compromise bill and submitted in their report to their respective Houses. this compromise bill. The compromise bill came up in the House and was debated and considered and was adopted by an overwhelming majority. The compromise bill was taken up in the Senate and discussed for some days and the Senate adopted it by a vote of more than 2 to 1. When the compromise bill was up in the House Speaker RAYBURN. Democratic Leader McCORMAcK. and our colleague."},{"1":"1945","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Administrator. Office of Price Administration. House Office Building No. 1. Washington. D. C. DEAR MR. BOWLES: About a year ago. an investigator for the OPA told me that I could not charge for my labor and expense in getting shingles for my customers. This surprised me. but since that time I have had. and my lawyers have had. many surprises. I want to mention a few of them to you at this time while a change in RMP 164 is under consideration. (a) As soon as I was told that hiring out to small lumber yards. or collecting labor and expenses from them when they did not increase the retail price. having. however. always made a commission since I have been in business. I immediately turned over all my books. accounts and records to the local OPA. Voluntarily appearing before the OPA officials here I submitted to sworn examination and caused Mr. Olsen to come here from the State of Washington and he allowed himself to be examined under oath by the OPA. gave them permission to take charge of his records. .those of his partner. Mr. Main. and the records of the Northwestern Lumber. & Shingle Company. Bellingham. Washington. Our lawyers assured us that if we played fair with our Government it would treat us fairly in turn. So We did not expect a distorted story to be given out of your Office such as appeared in Colliers magazine of September 29. 1945. The intent of this article is obvious. (b) A few days before the hearing on my protest. which was a matter for the Review Price Branch onlyan enforcement attorney of the San Antonio OPA telephoned to the newspaper in Corpus Christi. Tex.. and thereafter released a story that was incorrect and calculated to prevent witnesses from appearing for the hearing. Your own records will reveal that I did not make a $1.000 bond last week or last month. nor is it fair to speak of decent businessmen as accomplices because we have done no.wrong in accepting payment for services and the return of expenses.

I shall not detain the Senate for any great length of time. However. in view of the fact that today is a day which some of us who have Viking blood in our veins feel should be remembered by the Senate and by the Nation in commemoration of the great sacrifices of that martyr nation. little Norway. since the invasion 2 years ago. I desire to say a few words. In September 1939 I was a representative of this Nation attending the Interparliamentary Union at Oslo. Norway. It will be remembered that the meeting was held about 2 weeks before the Germans struck into Poland. Gathered at the capital of that little nation. Norway. were the representatives of all the free parliaments on earth. Germany was not represented there. Japan was not represented there. Italy was not represented there. but representatives from the parliamentary nations were there. It was my privilege to have an audience with the King. It was my privilege to attend the functions of the Interparliamentary Union. and if I had the gift of an artist. I would portray for the Senate the critical. tense situation which existed. Telegrams were constantly coming in. radiograms were being received from all the other capitals of Europe. Men were recognizing that great events were about to take place. I remember that one night I had dinner with Lord Davies. of the British delegation. While we sat at dinner he received a telegram. We saw him no more after that. he flew back to London. Mr. President. today. 2 years after Norway was ruthlessly invaded. Bataan fell. The next 100 days. it has been said. are to be the most critical days in the history of the world. If we look about we can. when we remember what happened in Norway. profitably ask a few questions. In the next 100 days can Hitler push Russia back beyond the Caucasus? In the next 100 days will Hitler get control of the oil fields at Grosny and Baku? If he does. we know that will add to the length of the war. Mr. President. will Vichy send her Navy into the battle for the Axis? Vichy is a conundrum. the world is wondering where Vichy stands. Will Turkey be forced to join the Axis Powers or will she stand firm? Will Spain and Portugal. under diplomatic or military pressure. join the Axis Powers? Will Japan join hands with Germany and attempt to strike at Russia from the east as Germany strikes from the west? Reverting to Norway. I said I had an audience with the King. and I very distinctly remember saying to him then. It seems to me that all the small democratic nations of Europe would do well to get behind a large nation and form an association of some kind by means of which they would operate together. It was then that he said to me. No. we have faith that the neutrality arrangement which we have with Hitler will carry through. as it did with the Kaiser. How mistaken they all .were. That little nation went down under the hammer blows that .came from the sea and the land and the sky. However. as suggested by the junior Senator from Minnesota . the spirit of Norway lives on. it is not dead. The courage of the Norwegian people is a constant example to the world. The flame of liberty burns- intensely there. The men of the church. the men of the schools. the men of the parliamentary body. the farmers. the merchants. the professional men. all of them sense that this is a battle for great. vital principles. Norways 30.000 seamen and 99 percent of her people are fighting the Nazis. Norway believes that the wave of the future will be the wave of democracy and not the wave of the totalitarian government. We know. Mr. President. that America did not want this war. but we were attacked. and now we are not simply fighting for our libertyside by side with Norway and the other democracies of the world. but we are fighting for our life. Democracy all over the world recognizes that it is a fight to the finish to see which ideology shall finally prevail. Shall it be the old idea of absolutism. now under the new name of naziism or fascism. or the ideology of Japan. or shall it be the American way. the American freedoms. the American concept which shall prevail? In the political field the issue is. Shall the hands of the clock be turned back a thousand years? and. as was so ably demonstrated by the clergymen of -Norway the other day. another issue is in the field of religion. Shall the hand of the clock be turned back 2.000 years in the field of religion? These are the two questions that mark the two large issues. We know that the ideas expressed In the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution of the United States manifest the democratic way of life. and we know that those very ideas have sprung from the religious concept of man as brother to man. Democracy practiced by good men is the Golden Rule in actiondo unto others as you would be done by. It Is a way of thought and life. and we shall make sure that. on this continent at least. no dictator shall dominate the minds of men. the channels through which Gods inspirational ideas are fed. . The enslaved nations. from which many of us have sprung. France. Belgium. Holland. Poland. Norway. Denmark. Czechoslovakia. are still thinking freedoms thoughts. and. with our help. they will join the ranks of free men later on. Of course. Mr. President. we are fighting for home and country. but we are also fighting for an ideal. for the things of the spirit. for the unfettered mind. for human dignity. Only in a democracy. where the minds of men are free. do we find that respect for the dignity of the individual which differentiates democracy from a totalitarian form of government. Under the Stars and Stripes we believe in the intelligence and the integrity of the average man. under the swastika. the average man does not count. he is not supposed to have enough sense to decide things for himself. and. therefore. he must be governed by master men. who have absolute power over the public and private life of every citizen. The Axis Powers hate democracy because they know that freedom of man. exemplified in a republic. is the fruit of religion. Here in America we have thoughts of freedom. Witness the preamble to the Constitution. I quote: We. the people of the United States. in order to form a more perfect union. establish justice. insure domestic tranquility. provide for the common defense. promote the general welfare. and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. What inspired language! Every phrase of it could well be the subject of a master oration. We are to establish justice. we are to promote the general welfarenot the welfare of any particular class or group but the general welfareand we are to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and to our posterity. making us trustees of those great values and those great freedoms which were handed down to us. Mr. President. witness some other language which. like a great beacon. shines forth in the sky. and which should be burned into the consciousness of each of us. I quote from the Declaration of Independence: We hold these truths to be selfevident. that all men are created equalAll menthat they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. that among these are life. liberty. and the pursuit of happiness. And then: That to secure these rights. governments are instituted among men. ce:xiing their just powers from the consent of the governed. Mr. President. I believe that if in our schools those two great beaconlight statements were burned into the consciousness of every youth. so they would comprehend the real meaning. the inner meaning of each phrase. our youth and ourselves would be not only better citizens but better qualified to meet the challenge of today. Mr. President. we have inculcated into our economy that it is the function of each citizen to do justice. to love mercy. and to walk humbly before our God. The democratic way of life which glorifies this country is not a static thing. it is a growing thing. As man grows and appreciates the things of the spirit. democracy will grow. It is an attitude toward life which each member of the American social. order possesses. Mr. President. a week from Monday next we will take up the Connally bill. At that time there will. undoubtedly. be a number of amendments offered. It appears from letters and from newspaper columns and from other sources that many persons have conceived the idea that in the United States Senate their representatives are either prolabor or antilabor. proindustry or antiindustry. The real. true approach to this problem. as I am sure every Senator sees it. is this: In this tragic period all of us are proAmerica. and what we want is to have taken out of the American economy the influence of those minds. those men. those groups of men who are selfish. who selfishly place group interest above the welfare of all the people and thus jeopardize victory. Of course. it is the human element that controls. As I. said before. bad men make bad legislation. bad men make bad business conditions. bad men make bad labor conditions. There is. however. no thought in the Congress of the United States that the Congress should. in any way. take from any group in this country any of its inalienable rights. as mentioned in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution. The thought is that we should remove from the national picture those elements that would termite the very values wlich are mentioned in the Declaration of Independence and in the Constitution. Thus. Mr. President. after speaking the other day on this very subject in the Senate. I received a letter which suggested that I must be pro this or anti that. I repeat that. in my opinion. the Senate of the United States wants to cleanse our economy of those factors which would interfere with the greatest possible war production and which would make more difficult the victory of our cause. No one wants defeat. I am sure no one in industry wants defeat. and no one in labor wants defeat. Consequently. if we could remove from the picture. those racketeerminded persons whom we find in every segment of our society we would get rid of an element which is causing great damage to our country. Mr. President. the Axis Powers would have us believe that we should feed our souls with the material philosophies of men. the thought that there are master races and races to be enslaved. and that greed and injustice make for the new order. We know that such thinking leads only to rotten politics. to a degenerate race. and to poverty. injustice. and international strife. We know that such teachings bring tyranny in management. in labor. in politics. and in government. we know that such thinking leads to decay and the turning of the hands of the clock back. and we reach the conclusion that only through right thinking. through reeducation. if you please. can the real values which make for freedom and liberty be maintained in this country. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD. at the conclusion of my remarks. a statement under the heading Norway continues the fight. signed by Wilhelm Morgenstierne. Minister of Norway. Washington. April 8. 1942. dnd published in todays Washington Post. As indicated by the Minister of Norway in this article. Norway carries on in her battle for freedom. Her King and 30.000 of her seamen and thousands of her youth are in the actual fighting forces opposing the Nazis. Norway. the land of the Vikings. from which have come so many of our citizens. is about 125.000 square miles in area. about the size of California. It possesses the most ruggea and broken stretch of seaboard in the world. with a coastline. measuring the shoreline of the fjords. of. 12.000 miles. The nature of Norway is extremely varied. Pineclad hills and great forests. the wild grandeur of the towering mountains. the myriad fjords. the valleys placid and smiling. the mighty glaciers clinging to the mountain slopes. the cool lakesthis is the land which sent forth Leif Ericson in the year 1.000 to discover North America. This is the land that sent its blood stream into France and into Britain. into Ireland. Scotland. and into northern Italy. It was the Vikings who founded the city of Dublin in the ninth century. In those days they were the sea rovers guided only by the stars. but theywere also the great traders of their day. But. Mr. President. before misfortune struck Norway 2 years ago today. that people had emerged from many shadows and they had found their way up the ladder of civilization until most of -their economic and political problems werelsolved. here were no great rich and there were no poor in that land. That little nation. beiore it was invaded. each year more than balanced its budget and laid aside some money for what was thought might be rainy days ahead. The last century in Norway was a century of progress. In fact. that little nation was a laboratory where freedom prevailed and where freemen practiced the rules of liberty. As a result. poetry. music. and the sciences prospered and dveloped and the people were happy. Henrik Wergeland was the poet of the new freedom. He was a Norwegian Byron. with a touch of Shelley. In music there was Edvard Grieg and an OleBull. and in the field of letters there were writers like Ibsen. Bjdrnson. Lee. and others. Men who were not simply poets and buthors but who were prophets and seers. men who not only influenced the lives of that nation but the thinking of all peoples. Norway .has a population of a little more than 3.000.000 people. yet beford she was invaded she had the fourth largest merchant fleet in the world. In the field of capital and labor Norway had established a balance between the rights of organized labor and capital. on the one side. and society as a whole on the other. It permitted labor organizations to be sued the same as capital organizations. It required that both obey the law of the land. This little land of Norway in the field of agriculture. prior to Germanys invasion. had established a system of balance also between agriculture and the state. This people were not afraid of government in the picture. But when government entered the picture to compete with its own citizens government had no advantage. The purpose of government was to aid the citizen and not to injure the citizen. to create values. not destroy values. Cooperative organizations in Norway functioned previous to Hitlers invasion equitably and constructively. Now this land of promise-dconbmically and sociallyhas been overrun by the Nazis. But I repeat. Mr. President. the spirit of the people is not dead. It is a living flame and a living example for all the world to behold. The iron heels of goosestepping Nazi legions have thundered over all of Norway and the other conquered lands and have ground into the earth the hardwon rights and liberties of freemen. These peoples are temporarily fettered with the chains of Nazi bondage in a menacing new order of tyranny. of. pillage. and privation. but. Mr. President. the hopes and souls of freemen can never -be permanently fettered. The love of liberty and freedom. like the love of Christianity. -can be whipped Into the catacombs and scourged into martyrdom. but it cannot be annihilated. The great values of freedom and.religion become dearer under the whiplash of oppression. Freedoms flame burns fiercest when its torch is locked in the hearts and minds of freemen now enslaved. The dreams and hopes of liberty soar highest in the lengthening shadows of conquest. Freemen now slaves know what they have lost and the knowledge fires them with a fierce determination to recapture their own. Today there are tall sons of the Vikings in Bergen. at Stavanger and Trondheim. looking westward over the fjords toward a people still free. The loss of Bataan today brings their problem closer to us. The loss of Bataan gives us a grim picture of the battle in the east and the possibilities for further disasters. The harrowing lesson of Norway and the other conquered countries will not be in vain if it makes all of the world realize the peril of losing freedom and the need for paying any price to retain it. The hopes of libertyloving peoples everywhere. be they fettered or free. are one today. Our destiny here in America in the march of history ahead is to realize those hopesto cast off the shackles of tyranny and to insure the survival of freemen. I renew my request that Mr. Morgenstiernes statement be printed in the RECORD."},{"1":"1941","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Well. that may be. but this little union in my section found they had a chance to make a killing and there was not a word of protest from Washington about it. I complained to the authorities here. but what response did I get? None. The President of the United States for 7 long years has been abusing industrialists. but never once has he criticized one single labor leader. no matter how much racketeering went on. So the unions understood perfectly well that they could get away with it. They placed a fee of $75 for a man to go to work on a defense proposition. What a travesty. That was the first baptism at this camp. This committee now knows all about it. What do you recommend? Nothing. We who live near one of those camps know a good deal more about the moral and the expense side of it. and my public are greatly exercised. Read any or all of my weekly newspapers and you will see what they are worrying about. Then they ask us. How much is the defense program to cost? You cannot tell them. There are so many things added to the regular apparent defense expenditures that you cannot estimate it. And then they ask me. Where are you to get the money? And they ask it with some trepidation. They do not worry so much about the waste and extravagance. They know all about that. and they can see how difficult it is to stop it in the effort to build these camps quickly. Probably the contractor there did the best he could. He will say that he did. He had to build that camp in 75 days. Why should we dare criticize? My people now are rather attempting to try to protect that camp and the contractor from too much criticism. But they are asking. Where are you going to get the money? What are we telling them?

The decision in that case. in effect. stated that workers engaged in the advanced stages of processing and preparing for markets agricultural products are in no different situation than any other industrial workers. These persons work in establishments that are essentially industrial in character. There they have the conveyorbelt and the assemblyline technique. In no substantial sense can these workers be considered as having anything to do with farms or the actual process of farming.

Therefore. more than 9.000.000 of our unemployed have been unable to obtain work in private fields or on W. P. A. We have observed many strikes throughout the land. led by aliens and others. which have destroyed hundreds of thousands of jobs. Thousands of the strikers have left their employment in private industry to go on the relief rolls and W. P.

I am very glad indeed to support such a measure. but I do not want P. W. A. coming in here. under the guise of organized labor or anything else. and laying violent hands on W. P. A. money. I have always gone along with the labor boys and I expect to continue to go along with them when they are right. but when they come in here and try to lay violent hands on W. P. A. funds. I am opposed to it and I shall fight it right straight down the line. If you want P. W. A. money. bring in a bill and I shall support it. but the W. P. A. fund is about $250.000.000 short now. I would support an amendment to bring it up to $500.000.000. and I may say to those who come in here and want money diverted in this way. if they want to add to the amount so as to provide money for such a diversion that is one thing. but right now we want more money for W.

Connected with Newtown Creek there are 20 untreated domestic sewers emptying into this body of water. not counting the hundreds of other sewers that empty into the creek from industrial sources. This sewage is carried into the East River. which in turn empties into Long Island Sound. which borders the shores of the district represented by the gentleman from Massachusetts who is opposed to the bill.

Loss in wages alone is put by International Labor Office at $21.000.000.000. Huge sums spent for aid. Universal reduction of hours of work to provide more employment is urged. I call attention to another news story in one of the large newspapers under a headline as follows: Commodity prices reach new lows. This article is under a New York date line of January 26. I next call the attention of the Senate to another news story in one of the late newspapers. the headings of which read as follows: Car loadings lower in week. I call attention to another news item with headlines as follows: Commodity average declines for week. Has been lowered each week since yearend. London slightly lower. Under that heading is a dispatch to the New York Times. under the date line New Haven. January 29. the first paragraph which I will read. as follows: Prof. Irving Fishers index number of commodity prices. based on 100 as the average for 1926. is 55.5. which compares with 56.4 a week ago. 57.3 two weeks ago. 57.4 three weeks ago. and 57.6 four weeks ago. I submit these items of news as evidence that times are getting worse instead of getting better. and I base such conclusion upon the proposition that the dollar is going higher and higher and commodity prices are going lower and lower. I next call the attention of the Senate to a headline in the Washington Post of Sunday. January 29. It is the leading editorial in that publication and the heading of the editorial is: New York wants a dole. I read the first paragraph. No sooner had Governor Roosevelt left Albany than New York came knocking at the door of the Federal Government for emergency aid. So long as Mr. Roosevelt was in charge of New Yorks affairs he upheld the principle that each State should look after its own destitute people. But the new governor. Herbert H. Lehman. took one look at the $140.000.000 deficit which Governor Roosevelt had left him. and directed a plea for $45.000.000 to Washington. On the same editorial page. Mr. President. which contains the aforementioned editorial. I find the second leading editorial with the following headline: What they barter. That editorial catalogues the class of barter that is now going on throughout the United States."},{"1":"1932","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Oh. there were some machines there for making shoes that everyone understood had been installed some time ago. but the amount they turn out is limited. The prison labor is more in competition with that of farmers than anybody else. Prisons have dairies. they raise fine hogs. they raise everything to eat. Still you never hear complaints from the farmers. because they recognize that the cost of maintaining our prisons comes out of the Federal Treasury. that it is absolutely essential to provide work for prisoners. and. as pointed out. we now have a system whereby we pay to the personnel a small amount. and if the prisoner has a dependent family. a part of his pay is sent to his family. and this practice is in keeping with the spirit of the Hawes and Cooper bill. I think Members may have read the statement recently published by Senator HAwEs and Congressman COOPER. analyzing the underlying principles and purposes of this bill. which soon becomes effective."},{"1":"1931","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I think that is what the report states. that it is hopeless. and where it is hopeless there is no wisdom in the Government making further Federal appropriations or reimbursable appropriations. If projects are without merithave failed because of lack of water or for other reasonsit is unjust to the taxpayers of the United States to waste more money and it is unjust to the Indians to take from their tribal funds moneys to waste upon such projects. Concerning the Blackfeet Reservation the committee say: On the Blackfeet project. which represents a net investment by the Government to June 30. 1927. of $1.276.851.81. only 45 acres were farmed by Indians in 1926. The area now reported as irrigable from the canal system is 21.377 acres. Of this. 7.150 acres. or practically onethird. was irrigated in 1926. 45 acres by Indians and 7.105 acres by white lessees and owners. The Indians receive a rental of 50 cents an acre for their irrigable land. which is a small fraction of what it costs the Government to operate the project. The principal crop is wheat. the average yield for 1926. 13 bushels. During some seasons much of the project land is dryfarmed. In discussing the Tongue River project. the committee report states: The evils of the allotting system: Reference to Table I of this report shows.that. based on the acreage -of land being used. many of the socalled Indian irrigation projects are in reality white projects. The acreage farmed by Indians is small in comparison with that farmed by whites and is continually decreasing. and under present conditions will continue to decrease. The continual decrease in the acreage farmed by Indians is the natural and logical result of the leasing system. and the leasing system in turn is the inevitable result of the allotting system. May I say to the Senator from Montana that this report deals not only with what might be called irrigation matters per se. but with cognate questions. leasing and allotting. and generally with the situation which they found upon the various projects. and it contains recommendations in regard to various matters which they investigated. I continue the reading: Once leasing was begun and the Indian saw the possibility of receiving without any effort on his part larger returns from his land than he himself was able to secure by his own labor the leasing system naturally became very popular. As the Indian expresses it. Why should I try to farm my land when I can lease it to a white man and get more out of it than if I farmed it myself?  The result of the leasing system as practiced on some reservations is that an increasingly large number of Indians are living in indolence and profligacy from their land rentals. It is a virtual return to the ration system. in fact. it is far worse in its effects upon the Indians than the ration system. as it frequently gives them a relatively large income to be squandered in indolence and dissipation. This condition is worse on the Yakima than on any other reservation. This situation presents an urgent problem. Unless it can be curbed. much of the welfare work already done among these Indians will be of no avail. In an instance of this kind the irrigation system. instead of being a benefit to the Indians. is a curse. Two remedies suggest themselves for curing the evils growing out of the allotment to the Indians of more land than they can beneficially use: First. withhold the lease proceeds as a means of compelling all ablebodied Indians to support themselves by their own labor. and. second. grant fee patents for all lands except such an area for each family as is actually required to support a family. to be held under a trust patent issued to the head of the family. which would soon result in the sale to white of all surplus lands. or lands that the Indians themselves can not use. The success of the first suggestion is questionable. as an Indian deprived of his lease money would simply live with some of his relatives. The committee discussed the lack of real attempts to make farmers  out of the Indians or to teach them how to farm. The report deals not alone with irrigation. but with problems relating to the development and the improvement and civilization of the Indians. Projects and extensions of projects have been built without securing in advance the data necessary to determine their feasibility. such as a survey and classification of soils. determination of productive acreage that reasonably may be expected to contribute to defraying the cost of irrigation works. necessity for drainage. status of water rights. adequacy of water supply. and reasonably close approximation of cost. On but few of the projects examined is there complete. definite. and reliable information as to the acreage of productive land that can be irrigated. In consequence the per acre construction cost to be collected from the landowners is not definitely known. and in many cases not even approximately known. As an instance. on one project fully onefourth of the land is worthless as the result of seepage and alkali. Unless this unproductive land is reclaimed by drainage. or that part of the construction cost heretofore apportioned against it is written off. the construction charge on the productive land will be proportionately increased. In some cases it seems apparent. as the result of overoptimism. coupled with a desire to demonstrate the feasibility of a project and thus bring about its construction. there has been a surrender on the part of the investigating engineer to the inherent human tendency to minimize difficulties and swell the irrigable acreage by the inclusion of lands that in all probability never can be profitably used. Until such areas are eliminated or suspended. the per acre cost is not known. The report further states that  there is inadequate inspection and supervision of both construction and operation and maintenance work. That is a very temperate criticism of the methods employed by the engineering division of the Indian Bureau in the selection of projects and in getting data and in the cost of construction."},{"1":"1930","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Do I understand that this law may be applied in other fields throughout the country?

I will discuss for a short time one of the most vital problems now confronting not only the American farmer but our Nation. We have in our midst a master criminal. a gigantic thief. a highwayman. I want you. my unseen audience. to act as a Jury. listen to the evidence. render a righteous verdict upon the destructive depredations of this. the master criminal of our age. and by your verdict not only find this criminal guilty. but condemn the inaction and neglect of the Government of States and Nation in not sooner apprehending and condemaning to eternal confinement this master criminal. thereby stopping his depredation. The name of this master criminal is soil erosion. the washing away of the soil of our farm and pasture lands by the uncontrolled rain water that falls upon their surface. Uncontrolled surface water is the enemy of man. Controlled. it is a priceless blessing. Every drop of water which falls upon the agricultural land of our Nation and finds its way to the sea is an economic loss to our country. If the priceless heritage transmitted to us by our forefathers Is to be preserved unmarred. and by us transmitted to our children. we must control our surface water and conserve our soil. The three most valuable gifts of God to man are soil. sunshine. and rain. They constitute the earthly trinity. absolutely essential to the existence of man. If either is destroyed. then our civilization and our people will perish from the earth. Now listen to the evidence against this master criminal. soil erosion. For several years the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas. the Missouri Experimental Station. the North Carolina Experimental Station. and the Bureau of Soils and Chemistry in the United States Department of Agriculture have conducted experiments. made surveys. and recorded observations upon the present and ultimate effect upon our Natloif of the uncontrolled surface water. washing away our soil and carrying It to the sea. It has been determined that 1.500.000.000 tons of soil matter Is washed from our farms and pasture lands and carried to the sea every year. This soil. thus stolen from us by erosion. contains 126.000.000 pounds of plant food. which is twentyone times more plant food than is removed from the soil by crops. You must remember that when plant food is removed from the soil by agricultural crops it can be restored by fertilizer and soil legumes. but when the soil is washed away It can not be restored by man. and the land from which it is washed is forever lost to agriculture. It has been conservatively estimated that the value of the soil our country loses each year by erosion amounts to $2.000.000.000. and the farmers of the Nation suffer a direct primary loss of two hundred million a year by reason of the destructive depredations of this master criminal--erosion. In 1879. when erosion had not Inflicted such enormous damage on the agricultural soil of the Nation. the farmers spent only $28.000.000 for fertilizer. In 1919. as a result of erosion. they were compelled to spend $326.. 000.000. Thus. year by year. as the fertility of the soil of the farmers Is decreased. and the soil Is washed away. the farmers burdens for fertilizer increases. I will give you a few facts demonstrated by some of our experimental stations. At the North Carolina experimental station It has been established beyond question that land sodded In grass holds back four hundred il(n sixteen times more water and soil than bare ground. and two hundred and thirteen times more water and soil than unterraced cultivated land. and yet by a scientific system of terracing more water and soil can be held on the ground. in cultivated land. than is held there by grass sod. At the Missouri Experimental Station. It has been found by actual experiment. with only 31/-foot slope in 100 feet of bare ground. 7 Inches of surface soil was washed away in 24 years. but on the same type of soil. with the same slope and with the same rainfall. sodded in blue grass. It will take 3.547 years to wash away the same 7inch layer of surface soil. and yet by scientific terracing. the surface water can be held upon the land and the soil conserved to a greater extent than it is. by being sodded in blue grass. At the experimental station. Spur. Tex.. it was demonstrated by actual experiments and measurements that on land. sloping only 2 feet in 100. with 27 inches of rainfall per year on unterraced cultivated land 40.7 tons of soil was washed away per year on each acre. and 4.4 per cent of the total rainfall ran off. On adjoining plots of same land. same rainfall. same slope. properly terraced. all the rainfall and all the soil was conserved and by reason of the increased moisture absorbed by the soil. as a result of this conservation. 20 per cent increase yield was procured. The average depth of productive surface soil. on our sloping farm lands is 6 to.8 inches. and each acre has about 1.000 tons of productive soil. If erosion Is permitted to run wild in the future. as it has in the past. with a loss of 40 tons of soil per acre per year. in 25 years. at least 50 per cent of our agricultural lands will be destroyed for agriculture and 75 per cent in 50 years. If you will take a retrospective view of the vast and dreary solitudes of past ages. you will find that archteological and other scientific research has now established that there once existed countries that were inhablited by a prosperous and highly civilized people. They did nothing to check soil erosion. and this master criminal. year by year. gradually washed the soil of such countries to the sea and ultimately destroyed such people and their civilization. and now there is nothing but barren waste and rocky surface where once existed a happy. prosperous. contented. and highly civilized people. Such will be the ultimate end of our country unless effective steps are taken to control our surface water. and conserve our soil for ourselves and our posterity. Erosion is not a sectional problem. Its prevention is vital to our continued national existence. It has carried on its fearful destruction in every section of our country. Wherever water runs over the surface of the soil. erosion is gradually taking place. and because it seemingly operates under natural laws. its Insidious conduct does not challenge our attention. and we attribute our decreased acre yield to exhaustion of the soil. when. in fact. 99 per cent of It on eroding areas is due to erosion. In a few years the land ceases to be as productive as formerly. and the farmer concludes that the land is being exhausted by his crops. and resorts to expensive fertilizers and legumes to restore the fertility of soil he no longer has. le is fertilizing an unproductive clay subsoil. incapable of retaining either the fertilizer or moisture."},{"1":"1928","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"In some of the States engaged in tile production of beet sugar there may be Mexican labor. or Spanish labor. or Belgian labor. in the Senators own State there is some Belgian and Mexican labor. as I recall the testimony before the Inmigration Committee.

I do not believe in confiscating property. And I also do not believe in taxing the American people $150.000.000 to execute the provisions of this bill and pay the waste and leakages already existing in this office.

I am one of those who do not believe that it is right for the specially favored ablebodied men who are left at home surrounded by their friends. families. conveniences. and pleasures to pull off 6.000 strikes during war time when we had 4.000.000 men in uniforms depending on them for supplies and munitions. Therefore I am one of those who are of the opinion that when our Government is in war it has the right to take everything it needs to overcome the -enemy. let it be man power. property. or labor. it matters not.

I will later insert as a part of my remarks that part of the committees report bearing on this question. As a result of the restrictive immigration law many have been stimulated to file applications for citizenship. and on June 30. 1924. more than 100.000 applications were pending and this number has steadily increased since that time. The committee were unanimous in concluding that it was important to provide the Secretary of Labor with a fund so that he could secure the cooperation of State and county officials at all congested offices and thus speedily dispose of the applications for naturalization. I The facts submitted to our committee made It clear that this could be done at a reasonable cost. and the report of the committee was unanimous in Increasing this appropriation $50.000. $20.000 of which is made immediately available. I think the report will make sutliciently clear to the House the wisdom of the committees action. I quote from the report. as follows: The Budget estimate for the Department of Naturalization has been increased by $50.000. $20.000 of which is to be Immediately available. making a total appropriation for this service of $780.000 for the fiscal year 1926. This Increase is granted in order that the congestion which now obtains at sone of the offices can be corrected. On June :30. 1924. there were about 100.000 petitions waiting to be filed or awaiting final action. and this number has steadily increased. The committee feels that with the increase herein provided the cooperation of State courts can be had on a basis that will prove helpful in the removal of this congestion and without undue expense to the Government. The law provides for such cooperation and the work. of the State officials is entirely under the supervision of the Bureau of Naturalization. and any part of this appropriation prudently expended for this purpose will be immediately returned several times over to the Federal Treasury. It is estimated that the cost for preparing declarations and petitions for naturalization represents approximately 25 per cent of the amount received from the petitioners. tln(er these circulnstances it seems but simple Justice that parties entitled to citizenship )e given fair consideration and that facilities he provided to insure the prompt handling of their applications. When the new Congress convenes. if it Is found that the amount provided by the committee is insufficient. additional funds can be secured. If the suggestions of the committee are followed. as we feel they will be. there will certainly be no complaint such as the gentleman from New York seems apprehensive of. that we are providing an expensive method for the handling of naturalization papers. It is simply continuing the old method on a perfectly rational basis."},{"1":"1924","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I claim for myself that same symi)athetic interest in the welfare of children which every normal person must feel. and am in hearty accord with all proper legislation. State and National. which would safeguard and improve their conditions both of work and play. but I do not believe that these purposes will be best served by this measure or that the necessity exists to adopt it. There are today child labor laws in 46 States of the American Union. Under the progress of State government the number of children engaged in gainful occupations has decreased 50 per cent in a single decade. Of the 1.060.858 now at work. 6.47.309 are found in agricultural pursuits. the great majority of whom assist their parents with the crops. Aside from the fundamental objections to centering all governmental power in Federal bureaus in Washington. can it be faithfully contended that a real necessity exists for this constitutional amendment in the light of the wonderful reduction in child labor in the States already so rapidly made? The Constitution 9hould not be lightly or unnecessarily amended. The great improvement of the States under laws and agents of their own choosing negatives the necessity of authorizing an additional army of bureau agents at public expense to visit from Washington the people of the country and tell them how to run their homes. In the section where I live it is often difficult for the farmer to make ends meet even with tihe proper help of his children. We are aslied now to vote for a measure which would give to the Federal Government the power to limit. regulate. and prohibit the labor of persons under 18 years of age. Threefifths of the children who are working today are on the farms of our country. There may be some good reason to deprive the farmer of the services of his 16 or 17 year old boy. but I must confess that I for one am unable to find it. Such labor is performed at a season when it does not interfere with the duties of school. and certainly those will not be found lacking who will rightfully contend that wholesome work in the open air is helpful in promoting both the physical and mental welfare of the growing lad. Surely the agricultural States may be relied upon to solve their problems in the best interest of their people. In the old days we were told that the Government was founded on its homes. New teachers have now arisen who advise its that the homes are founded on Government agent.. And so this proposal seeks to follow this new philosophy and send to our firesides these guardian angels from Washington. The principal complaint with reference to child labor seems to be directed agailst those who work in agriculture. and the outstanding purpose seems to be to make of Federal agents tile lares and penates of the rural home. They are to be the godfathers to the farmers children. I want to picture in the brief time allotted me the visit of one of these Washington agents to the farmers roof under tile operations of tile pending proposition. And let it be understood in tills connection that my remarks have reference only to those unnecessary officers that this proposal would create and not to men and women now engaged in a faithful performance in the States of proper functions of the Federal Government. SLet us suppose that the bureau officer arrives conveniently just before supper. Of course. lie takes no scrip for his journey. for the fearing farmer will furnish him with Ilis daily bread and his nightly bed. He is greeted with that show of hospitality which his authority naturally insures. His wards. the children. are graciously allowed the privilege of packing his grip to tie best room. and the rules are also sufficiently relaxed to permit them to fill his car with water and oil and gas. And so lie enters the farmlers humble home with that commendable display of condescension which royalty can sometimes manifest when visiting obliging subjects. An appreciatioll of ills importance is brought to his attention as he enters the door. for there. above the fireplace. where used to hang tile old familiar motto.  What is home without a mother?  is another in its stead. which reads.  What is home without a Federal agent? And over the door be observes with complacency another prayerful one. Bureau officer. bless our home. What a fitting recognition of his supremacy! And then. the more to add to his comfort and to inspire a friendly concern for the welfare of the dependent household. the larder is emptied for the evening meal and he feeds on the best that the humble family can afford. I see the group gathered after supper in the combination sitting and bed roomthe agent. the father and mother. John. the fine. strapping son of 17 summers. and Jim. his equally hearty 16yearold brother. For their delectation the distinguished guest kindly monopolizes the conversation and glibly descants upon the vast extent of his power. his Importance. his prestige at the Capital. The attentive auditors listen in admiration and terror. eyeing with awe this Federal being so wonderfully and fearfully made. At length arrives the hour for the usual nightly devotion. Of course. the Federal agent is glad to conduct it. but he does not read. to be sure. from the good old family Bible on the table beside him. which through all the years has been a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our path. and ever should be. It does not teach quite the lesson he wishes to impress. So lie substitutes for it an illuminating volume of his own. emnbodying the forceful precepts of the bureau. And these are the inspiring passages which his wisdom selects: Consider the Federal agent in the field. he toils not. neither does he spin. and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his populous household was not arrayed with powers like one of these. Children. obey your agents from Washington. for this is right. Honor thy father and thy mother. for the Government has created them but a little lower than the Federal agent. Love. honor. and disobey them. Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do. tell it to thy father and mother and let them do it. Six days shalt thou do all thy rest. and on the seventh day thy parents shall rest with thee. Go to the bureau officer. thou sluggard. consider his ways and be idle. Toil. thou farmers wife. thou shalt have no servant In thy house. nor let thy children help thee. And all thy children shall be taught of the Federal agent. and great shall be the peace of thy children. Thy children shall rise up and call the Federal agent blessed. These are the new and strange doctrines which he would preach. Quite naturally. after the solemn contemplation of such novel instruction. the children of the company seek diversion in song. and quite as naturally the Federal agent leads them. The songs are the old ones. to be sure. but changed sufficiently to conform to the new conditions. First they sing the grand old tubes about father. Whats the matter with father? Hes all wrong. The Federal agent told us so and modified this song.  The old man has to work. said he.  But you just pattern after me. Whats the matter with father? Hes all wrong. And then that other old favorite: Nobody works but father. And we hang round all day. Feet in front of the fire. Spending our time in play. Mother helps a little. So does Sister Ann. But the guy that works at our house Is our old man. After these helpful melodies the children gladly join in a dear old modern song about mother: Sure. I love the dear silver you dream of by day. And the brow that is furrowed from drawing your pay. I press the dear fingers that meddle with me. 0. there neer was a mother like Agent McGee. Then they warble that plaintive old air of the SpanishAmerican War days.  Just break the news to mother. It has been appropriately altered. of course. and the tender term of bureau man has been substituted for the more prosaic word of mother. It is true the alteration hinders somewhat the rythmical flow of the original lines. but is there not adequate compensation for this in the added strength of the sentiment? LXV454 .Just break the news -to the bureau man. He loves me as no other can . Just tell him not to wait for me For Im not coming home. He Is the only other Whos dearer than my mother. So kiss his dear. sweet lips for mne And break the news to him. Finally. the group breaks up for the night. The agent. the cynosure of all eyes and the observed of all observers. uncomplainingly remains in the choicest quarters to niuse further on the blessings of his supremacy. the father and mother. hopeful but bewildered. slowly wend their mystified way to the cottonseed bin. for lack of the spare room they have longed for. there to doze and meditate hazily upon this new order of creation. the big. stalwart boys betake themselves to their accustomed places. marveling at the wisdom and authority of their governmental parent and purposing firmly ili their hearts some day to be themselves wonderful Federal agents. The next morning the agent and the boys slumber peacefully on until father and mother apprise them that by their joint efforts the breakfast is ready. At length it is over and the parents must offer their humble apologies to their guest and depart. for it behooves father to leave for the cotton fields to pick the fleecy staple fron the bolls. perhaps accompanied on the cotton rows by his wife. but for the further entertainment of the Federal visitor the strapping John is left at home to pick a fleeting tune on the zither. accompanied on the organ by his brother Jim. Is it not a beautiful picture? Who would not help speed its happy realization by voting for this measure? Ohl. what a marvelous creature is the Federal agent. 01. how the people love him.. I can not cite the following instances with approval. and refer to them facetiously. of course. but they are indicative of the regard in which the Federal agent has heretofore been held in some quarters. To those who have expressed the fear that Government agents may not be able to make themselves at home and grow accustomed to the new locations to which they may be assigned. let me bring it to their remembrance that in the old days some of the Federal agents. who have ventured Into the mountains of Kentucky and Arkansas and Tennessee to regulate the labor of some of the citizens. have become so permanently attached to the local soil that they will leave it nevermore. Let us hope for a happier fortune for those whom we now arrange to create. Where and when. my friends. will the establishment of Federal bureaus end? This proposal plans to take their agents to our very homes. Washington is to direct all our energies and tell us what to do. Individual incentive and effort and zeal are to be no longer necessary. Our emotions will be prompted from the Federal Capital. If we continue this course. some day we may reach the time when we may appropriately paraphrase the familiar verse and say: Breathes there the man with soul so dead. Who never to himself hath said.

I move to strike out .the last word. I desire to make a. few observations in. connection with the national forests. There has been: a good deal of discussion in connection. with the Forest Service. When the Federal Government installed its system of national forests out in. the publicland States. it was done in accordance with a law passed by Congress.. not at the behest of. the people of the States where. these forests were located. but on the. recommendation of a certain- gentleman who wanted to install a system of conservation. I am in. sympathy with the spirit of conservation of our national resources. I beliee our timber should be conserved. I believe it should be saved to a certain degree. but Mr. Chairman and gentlemen. we have gone conservation inad on this proposition. Like other businesses in which the Government has embarked.. this service. is top heavy. They are spending. more money than they ought to spend in conserving these national resources. They employ more people than they ought. to. employ. The idea of conserving our timber and. all. these things is: right.. It is a good idea. but whenever you go to leasing. these lands. then you drive. the. settlers away from those- States. When this system of issuing permits for grazing. purposes- in. the national forests was installed. it was said that it was going to. be in the interest of the small stockmen. What has been the result? The result has been that the large cattleowners and sheep owners are the ones who. are asking for these- additions to. the national forests. It does not encourage the settling. of those lands. in any way. The homestead. forest act of 1906 is almost a dead. letter today. I know that by experience. I live within the Carson National Forest in New Mexico. I own several hundred acres of land within that forest and outside of it. They talk about the expense. Nobody out there asks that those expenses be incurred. We are perfectly willing to take: the public domain and manage it ourselves without running in. debt. If you want to get rid of that expense. you can. do it very easi]ly. If these public lands are a liability to the Government.. and they have been a liability so far. turn them over to the respective States and we will handle them. Gentlemen talk about conservation of this. that. and the other but those of us that. live within: these forests. feel that we are paying a reasonable fee for the privilege that we get for grazing now. and to. arbitrarily raise those. fees. at this time would be an injustice. I. in behalf of my constituents. feel constrained to enter my earnest protest against it. Furthermore. Mr. Chairman.. we are trying. to devise ways and: means to lower the high. cost of living all albng the line and. have been trying to curb prqfiteering by enacting such legislation as will serve that purpose. and here the Committee on. Agriculture and the Forestry Bureau are engaging in the very thing we are: trying to. stop. The proposition to raise arbitrarily the. grazing fees at this. time. regardless of the agreements or understandings that exist between the bureau and the national forest. strikes me like a clear case of an effort to profiteer on the part of. the Government. alleging that commercial rates for grazing on private lands are higher than those by the bureau. If we: want to lighten the burdens of those that raise beef and mutton and the byproducts of the industry of stock raising we- certainly do not want to make the charges for the privileges of grazing treble of. what they now are. These people have to meet Federal. State. and other taxes. The expenses of running and managing their business have doubled the last three years. and while prices for their products have increased that inerease certainly does not justify an unreasonable clmrge for grazing. A leasing system of the unentered and unoccupied public lands at this time would. in my* judgment.. have a tendency to retard the growth of several. of the publicland States. it would have a. tendency to createa system. of land. lordship under our Government whereby the small stockmen would be compelled to go. out of business. and those that are able to pay would monopolize the industry. If we. want to assist in developing and settling unentered public domain we certainly must not embark on any- such: a systein at this time.. Whilst a good deal of the land! is arid in. character. experiences in other sections of the country demonstrate that there are a good. many people that are willing. to. go into these lands of the country..into. the hardship of pioneering thereon.. by developing water and. otherwise improving the lands. If we want these. States to grow and become prosperous Commonwealths we must not do anything here to retard that very essential progress. 1 have just received the following telegram. from the New Mexico Cattle and Horse Growers AssociationD. a representative body of men engaged in: the. industry of cattle and horse growing. and from the New Mexico Wool Growers Association. representing 2.000.000 or 3.000.000 cattle and sheep. respectively. in that State. a number- of whom now graze. their flocks and herds within the national forests in that State. and which tele. gram reads as follows:.

James Bryce. former ambassador to this country from the United Kingdom. is not satisfied. Mr. Bryce wrote quite a critical article only a few days ago dated at London. He says that this whole treaty has in it the seeds of future commotion. He says that open diplomacy. of which so much has been said. is yet far away and declared that if they had not been too much occupied at home the English people would not have allowed so much to be kept from them. The article continues: Lord lryce said lie thought the conference committed sone very grave errors and was in grave danger of committing others. He goes. on to give in detail what lie thinks some of the vital nistakes are and is not at all optimistic as to the future abolition of war so coniidently promised by the league and tie treaty.

I will now take up the discussion of the food production. FOOD PRonUvCTIO. In this connection. I desire to make some observations with reference to the farming situation and outlook. We spend most of our time talking about the Army aid Navy. These subjects are important. very important. but there Is another subject more fundamental. that is. the production of an adequate amount of food. Without food. which Is growing scarcer daily. our cause is lost. It Is about time that Members of Congress and the people wake up to that fact. for it is the man behind the plow who keeps the man behind the gun. Listen to the authorities that I present to show you the seriousness of the food situation: RoMi. January 21. 1918. Food is the most important matter now before the allies. David Lubin. American representative in the International Institute of Agriculture. said today. He added: It is useless to deceive ourselves. In view of the increasing consumption of food and .decreasing production we shall be unable to feed our armies unless exceptional weather prevails this spring and unless extraordinary measures are applied. Europes crops may be worse than last years. The mobilization of women of the United States for farm work may be necessary. This morning I received through the mail a memorial presented to. the President by the Federal Board of Farm Organizations. which represents 2.000.000 farmers. Here are a few paragraphs of the memorial: We know that the world is short of food. The crops now available are barely sufficient to meet the urgent need. and next year the world shortage is certain to -be worse.- Insufficient food supplies involve a most serious threat to the early and victorious conclusion ofthe war. for a starving people can not fight. Unless the farmers of the United States nan fill the mouths of our own peoplb and our allies. they will not be filled. Just how great the demand for American food will be we can not yet foretell. but we know already that a larger crop is absolutely necessary. If food Is to win the war. as we are assured on every side. the farmers of America must produce more food in 1918 than they (lid in 1917. But unless present conditions are radically changed. increased crops next year are impossible. Under existing conditions we can not equal the production of 1017. much less surpass it. andthis for reasons over which the farmers have no control. The American farmer does not ask to be relieved of any task or any burden which belongs to him. He asks for no class exemption. nor special consideration of any sort. The duty which the Nation and the times have laid upon him he desires to fulfill. But he can not make bricks without straw. The conditions which prevent increased production are national conditions. and only the National Government can �remove them. It is the duty of the Nation to give the farmer a fair chance to succeed in raising the food the Nation needs. just as It is the duty of the farmer on his part to leave no furrow unturned. A dispatch appearing recently in one of the great dailies of Iowa states: Interviews with farmers in various parts of Iowa have revealed the fact that 10 per cent less corn will be raised this year in the tlawkeye State than in 1917. principally because of a lack of farm labor. I do not wish to be understood as expressing my judgment that there will be less raised in Iowa this year than last. On this subject I have had some correspondence with county farm agents. chairmen of county councils of defense. and others. These gentlemen differ in their views as to the outlook for increased food production in Iowa. but most of them agree that the shortage of farm labor presents a serious sittation. Iowa Is the leading cornproducing(Etate in the Union. If less foodstuffs will be raised in Iowa this year. what can we expect from the rest of the country? Along this same line a certain publicity bureau on January 3 had this statement: In the East the matter is being taken up. and the press of New York City Is giving it prominent notice. Word has come from Connecticut that that State has been positively combed clean  of laborers of every description. and thousands of valuable farms In that section of the country are lying idle as a consequence. I could cite you further proofs along this line. but theseare enough. It pres6nts a situation that is appalling. There is no use to talk about winning this war if we do not produce more foodstuffs this year than we did last. and more next year than we do this year. If we do not increase our food production. we are going to be licked. We ought to quit wrangling about the creation of a war council and go to farming. We must dig a hole and bury politics until after the war and go to work. What the war needs right now more than a secretary of munitions is 1.000.000 and more additional farm hands. The farm hands will keep this country and the allied nations from starving. while the President already has more secretaries and councils than he can handle to advantage. The people are demanding that this Congress differentiate between essentials and nonessentials. and that we get busier in actions than in words. What do we- propose to do to increase the production of the farms? We can not pass it by. We must face and solve that problem or face defeat. Last spring the Department of Agriculture seriously proposed a plan to conscript the idlers and highschool boys of the cities to relieve the shortage of farm labor. Why tie combination of idlers and highschool boys I never quite understood. But time plan is so utterly impractical that it never received serious consideration from anyone who ever saw or knows anything about a farm. There is a certain group of college presidents and certain boards of financiers who are urging a change in our laws to permit the importation of Chinese coolies for farm labor. To me such a plan. even though it might be practical. is unthinkable. The American farmers are patriotic and are willing to offer up their sons to die for their countrys cause. But the American farmeV is hardly in a frame of mind to receive into his home a Chinaman to take the place of a son who has gone to serve his country in the trenches. With that I pass up this plan as not worthy of further consideration."},{"1":"1917","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. there Is a Senate joint resolution (S. J.

I yield five minutes to the gentleman from California. [Mr. J. R. KNOWLAND]. Mr. J. R. KNOWLAND. Mr. Speaker. having supported the bill now pending before the House. I shall now vote to pass it. the veto of the President notwithstanding. The necessity of some character of restriction to keep from our shores undesirable classes of immigrants has been growing more apparent from year to year. as the records have disclosed an annually increasing number of arrivals at our ports. Variotis methods have been proposed to solve the problem during the decade that I have been a Member of this body. In 1907 Congress provided for the appointment of a commission to make a thorough study of the entire question. At that time a bill providing a literacy test was pending. Before adopting this plan the House desired that a thorough investigation of the whole subject should be made. This commission was composed of three Members of the Senate. three Members of the House. and three others not Members of Congress. One of these outsiders was a distinguished citizen of the State of California. Mr. William R. Wheeler. An investigation was made of conditions abroad. Exhaustive hearings were had. In reporting the commission was unanimous that some method of restriction was necessary. As I recalland I think the gentleman from Massachusetts so stated upon the floor yesterdayeight of the nine members of the commission advocated a literacy test. The President in his veto message declares that he knows of no desire on the part of theAmerican people for this character of law. My experience in this House has taught me that when a measure passes this body by an overwhelming vote it is In response to a welldefined public sentiment throughout the United States. Upon two occasions a literacy test has .passed this House by an overwhelming vote. I maintain there can be no better or more accurate test of public sentiment throughout the country than shown by a majority vote of the Members of Congress representing every section. and. who are responsible to the people of their various districts for their every act. Yes. and I have found that the Members of this House are quicker to detect public sentiment than any other :body or individual in the country. They appeal to the people every two years. The President also declares that the political platforms should speak. It seems to me that the President of the United States is the last person upon the face of the globe to disapprove a bill because it is not mentioned in the platform of the party. We have seen too many planks repudiated that were contained in the platform of the Democratic party. We saw the freetoll plank repudiated. and now the President and his party.are about to repudiate another plank in the Democratic platformthe one in reference to a second presidential term. So. it seems to me. that this argument falls to the ground. Oh. it may be that this test will not keep out of the United States all of the undesirable immigrants we would desire to keep out. but. in my opinion. it is a step in the right direction. This method may not be perfect. but what better plan is offered? It will be found that most of those who oppose the literacy test are unfavorable to any form of restriction. As a natidn we have always welcomed the thrifty and industrious immigrant. and will. I hope. continue this policy. Those who fail to have the proper respect for our institutions. those who do not appreciate the value of American citizenship and would subvert our laws. this class we do not welcome. :The literacy test. in my opinion. will bar many. I freely acknowledge that many of- our best and most desirable citizens are foreign born. Had they come to this country under present conditions. considering the advance the world has made in education. there would be few. if any. who would have been unable to meet the simple literacy test provided in this bill. Any foreigner imbued with the proper ambition and possessed of sufficient enterprise would fit himself for the test. In this connection I will quote the language of the literacy test. I do not see how it can be seriously objected to in this enlightened age. It reads as follows: That after four months from the approval of this act. in addition to the aliens who are by law now excluded from admission into the United States. the following persons shall also be excluded from admisslon thereto. to wit: All aliens over 16 years of age. physically capable of reading. *who can not read the English language. or some other language or dialect. including Hebrew or Yiddish: Provided. That any admissible alien or any alien heretofore or hereafter legally admitted. or any citizen of the United States. may bring in or send for his father or grandfather over 55 years of age. his wife. his mother. his grandmother. or his unmarried or widowed daughter. If otherwise admissible. whether such relative can read or not. and such relative shall be permitted to enter. That for the purpose of ascertaining whetheraliens can read theImmigrant inspectors shall be furnished with slips of uniform size. prepared under the- direction of the Secretary of Labor. each containing not less than 30 nor more than 40 words in ordinary use printed In plainly legible type in some one of the various languages and dialectsof immigrants. Each alien may designate the particular language or dialect In which he desires the examination to be made. and shall be required to read the words printed on the slip in such language or dialect. When the war in Europe ends the Pacific coast will be confronted with a new immigration problem resulting from the opening of the Panama Canal. Then the European immigrant will land directly at our doors. We are taking steps to meet the situation. The best methods of locating immigrants in the soil is being studied. With this in view. a Pacific coast. immigration congress was held in San Francisco in April. 1913. attended by 327 delegates from 42 cities in California. Oregon. and .Washington. As shown by evidence already placed in the RECORD. the chief fight against this section is being inspired by the foreign steamship companies which profit so largely from the traffic. They want no restriction of immigration. It is not surprising that these companies have contributed to the fund raised by the National Liberal Immigration League. which is the leading organization fighting against the restriction of immigration. Probably it will be Impossible to override :the veto of the -President owing to his power. but the issue will be a live one in the next campaign. Organized labor is interested. Patriotic men and women in every section. anxious to raise the standard of. American citizenship. *ill continue the fight. In California no :man or woman can enjoy the privilege of full citizenship. can exercise the right -of thu ballot. unless able to both read and write. Should not the immigrants entering that State be able to read at least. as -provided in the literacy test? We of the Pacific coast want restriction that will aid in excluding the undesirable classes. and. in my opinion. this bill is a marked advance over existing laws or any new law so far proposed. :"},{"1":"1914","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Yes. This stupendous decrease in the volume of our foreign trade and the adverse balance do not. however. indicate the entire significance of the effect of the present tariff law. Its effect upon the volume of our trade is important. but even more so is its effe.t upon particular classes of imports Ind exports. Foreign trade is sensitive. and.will Invariably follow the line of least resistance. This being true. the revenuetariff system in general. and the present law in particular. is calculated to affect Injuriously two great classes of our citizens more than any others. The wageearning classes and the agricultural classes are the direct recipients of the shock of this adverse balance of trade. LABOR. The American laboring man now witnesses the product of his labor offered and sold to the consumers of his own country in direct competition with like and competing commodities produced in Europe and elsewhere abroad as a result of labor which receives a wage varying from 25 to 50 per cent of the wage which he receives. Not only this. but he sees the product of his labor brought in direct competition with the product of classes of labor in Europe and elsewhere which. under the laws of this country. he is no longer required to meet to any considerable extent here.. Into our ports from abroad is coming the product of child labor. underpaid female labor. pauper labor. and prison labor of Europe and Asia. True. we have undertaken to exclude a portion of these products. but experience demonstrates that such legal provisions are practically futile. There is no way by which the man in the customhouse in an American port can determine what class of labor entered into t.he production and manufacture of the merchandise offered for entry. I Invite the attention of the House to a few statistics taken from the Summary of Commerce and Finance. issuedby the Department of Commerce. .1 do this in order that Members may see upon what classes of our productions foreign competition impinges most directlyand strongly.

In fact It could not amount to anything that would injure the Federal Government. because. as has been suggested. the Federal Government is. as a matter of fact. already expending more than the total receipts of the national forests upon the conservation work of the country at this time.

For years the Republican party has contended- that the number of strikes during Clevelands administration was an evidence of hard times. low wages. and dissatisfied labor conditions. and the Republican party has persistently and falsely asserted that the number of strikes during that administration and the number of men out of work were the largest in the history of the country. and when the official figures contradict that statement they seek refuge in the statement that men can not strike when they are out of work. Strikes are an evidence of low wages. long hours. and conditions that are unsatisfactory to the labor world. During the administrations of McKinley and Roosevelt and the operation of the Dingley law. which the Republican party assured the country was the best tariff law ever enacted. and would Insure constant employment and high wages to every laborer in the land. the strikes and number of men thrown out of employment more than doubled that of any period in the history of the country. according to the official figures. But I started to talk a little more about Mr. CANNON. Before he makes another speech on the labor question he should visit Danville. his own home. and inform himself. The miners in his own county have been on a strike since the 1st of April under the operation of the Payne tariff law. and I see from an Associated Press dispatch that only a few days since two companies of militia were sent to Westville. in his own county. to suppress striking miners under the operation of the Payne tariff law. [Laughter and applause on the Democratic side.] The political physicians of the Republican party know that the patient is very ill and near deaths door. but they can not agree on a diagnosis of the case. [Laughter and applause on the Democratic side.] The distinguished Speaker asserts that under the operation of the Payne tariff law labor is universally employed. while the author of that monstrosity. Mr. PAYNE. the heavy artillery of the- Republican party. recently came out of cold storage long enough to declare on the floor of this House that many of the paper mills of the country are closed by strikes. Here is what he said: We are criticised because we did not fix the duty at $2 a ton and close our paper mills. in the vain hope that Canada might remove her embargoes on exports of wood pulp. Now she is extending her embargo. and. with a great many of our mills closed by strikes. there is a scarcity of paper. The Speaker says that labor under the operation of this law is universally employed. The gentleman from New York says that a great many of our mills are closed by strikes.

[Applause on the Democratic side. I"},{"1":"1909","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"from the Select Committee on Pulp and Paper Investigation. submitted the following report: The Select Committee appointed under House resolution No. 344. to make investigations concerning pulp wood. pulp. and paper. beg leave to report as follows: Papers are made from a large number of different materials originating from the fibrous portions of plants. The materials used are. generally speaking. in the nature of waste products. Linen and cotton rags. old papers of various sorts. straws. and the products of the forests not commercially profitable for the manufacture of lumber furnish in the main the raw material from which papermaking pulp is manufactured. Linen rags in the main constitute the material from which the highest grades of paper are made. cotton rags from which lower qualities of paper are made. and different kinds of wood producing different characters of wood pulp. out of which lower grades of paper are manufactured. The refuse material. such as straw. from various of the annual farm crops are also used to a large extent in the production of low grades of paper and strawboards. There are three processes generally used in this country for the production of pulp or fiber from wood. These are the groundwood process. sulphite process. and the soda process. The cheap production of the lower grades of paper depend largely upon the cheapness of the groundwood process. Practically only one kind of tree is used to much extent in the groundwood process. and that is the spruce tree. including its various varieties. The groundwood process consists in pressing a 2foot stick of spruce wood by hydraulic pressure against a revolving grindstone. the power used being entirely water power capable of operating under favorable conditions twentyfour hours per day. By this process about a ton of ground wood can be obtained from a cord of spruce wood. The sulphite process consists of a chemical treatment of chipped spruce or hemlock wood with sulphurous acid. by which 1.000 to 1.200 pounds of sulphite fiber may be obtained from a cord of wood. The soda process consists of the chemical treatment of chipped woods of various kinds. including both soft and hard woods. with caustic soda. by which process about the same number of pounds of soda fiber can be produced from a cord of wood as in the case of the sulphite process. The groundwood process is by far the cheapest process known for producing pulp from raw material. and. in addition to being the cheapest process. it produces a larger quantity of pulp than can be produced by any other process from raw materials. The cheaper grades of paper are usually produced by mechanically mixing ground wood pulp with other kinds of pulp in different degrees oft percentage. The ordinary newsprint paper is generally produced by the use of about 80 per cent of ground wood and about 20 per cent of sulphite fiber. though the exact percentages differ in different papers and in different mills. it depending somewhat uon the character of the paper to be produced and somewhat upon he character of the ground wood and the sulphite fiber used. Whether other kinds of wood besides spruce can be profitably used for the production of cheap print paper is a matter concerning which there is some difference of opinion. but as a matter of fact practically all of the ground wood manufactured today is manufactured by the aid of water power from the different varieties of spruce with a slight admixture of balsam. So far as the investigations of the committee can indicate. it would seem that the production of newsprint paper or the other very cheap grades of paper are today dependent upon the continuation of cheap ground wood produced from spruce trees. and that condition is likely to continue to prevail in the future. The amount of spruce forests throughout the world is. of course. limited. The largest spruce forests are in the United States. Canada. Norway. and Sweden. Spruce is used not only for the production of ground wood. but is also the material generally used for the production of sulphite fiber. Not only is this the case. but the best spruce trees of sawlog size are worth more for manufacture into lumber than they are for manufacture at present prices into pulp or fiber. The amount of spruce consumed in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains during the year 1907 the last year for which we have complete reports. was about 1.266.000 cords for ground wood. about 1.420.000 cords for sulphite fiber. and about 1.300.000.000 feet b. m.. equai to about 2.600.000 cords of lumber. making a total of about 5.280.000 cords. The amount of spruce imported from Canada into the United States for paper making during the fiscal year ending June 30. 1908. is stated at about 920.491 cords. The amount of standing spruce in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains is variously estimated with very rough estimates or guesses at about 35.000.000.000 feet. equal to about 70.000.000 cords. and the total annual production Is estimated at about 770.000.000 feet. or about 1.540.000 cords. The amount of standing spruce in the Dominion of Canada can not today be safely estimated with any considerable degree of accuracy based upon our present knowledge. The cheapness of ground wood depends upon cost and convenience of spruce wood. water power. estab ished mills. and transportation. It is quite evident that there is not today enough spruce forests standing in the United States to furnish a future constant supply based pon the present methods of manufacture. the probable needs of the future. and the present methods of forest conservation and waste. Your committee believe and recommend that both the General Government and the state governments. within the limits of their respective jurisdictions. should endeavor to encourage the production of spruce forests. both by giving a more adequate fire protection and by exempting as far as can be young forests from the ordinary rates of taxation. If adequate protection can be given from the danger of fire losses and young spruce forests can be exempted from taxation. private owners may be led to use lands which would often otherwise run to waste for the production of forests. The benefit to be obtained from continued production ofspruce in the future will not go only to those who may own the forests. but the benefits through the cheapness of paper will be received by the entire population. A private owner can not In general afford to grow a crop which will not mature within from fifty to a hundred years. paying taxes each year upon the value of the ground and the crop and running the risk all the time of having his entire crop swept away by a forest fire started without his fault and against which his efforts are in vain. There should be organized fire protection in every considerable forest in the United States. It would be quite possible for the National Government to start large tracts of young spruce forest. If our country should be shut off from the utilization of its present water powers and mills in grinding spruce wood imported from Canada. it would. we think. be the duty of the General Government or of the different state governments to organize. own. protect. and control large areas of young spruce forests. ready to furnish an adequate supply of spruce wood when the existing forests shall have in the main been exhausted. It is highly probable. however. that there exists sufficient spruce forests and spruce forest lands in the United States and Canada which. if protected by any reasonable conservation and reproduction methods. will furnish a sufficient supply of spruce wood for paper making for all time to come. We believe and recommend that the tariff on ground wood coming Into the United States be removed and ground wood admitted free under certain conditions. Practically. the question relates in the main to our relations w~h Canada. In some of the Provinces of Canada pulp wood can notgnow be exported from the Dominion if cut upon the public lands. and in other Provinces there is a higher charge for pulp wood cut upon tile public lands if such pulp wood is to be exported. We therefore recommend that in revising the tariff there be inserted the following schedule: Mechanically ground wood pulp. onetwelfth of 1 cent per pound. dry weight: Provided. however That mechanically ground wood pulp shall be admitted free of duty from any country. dependency. province. or other subdivision of government which does not forbid or restrict the exportation of or impose any export duty. export license fee. or other export charge of any kind whatsoever. either directly or indirectly (whether in the form of additional charge or license fee. or otherwise). upon mechanically ground wood pulp or wood for use in the manufacture of wood pulp.  Chemical wood pulp. unbleached. onesixth of 1 cent per pound. dry weight. bleached. onefourth of 1 cent per pound. dry weight. Provided. That if any country. dependency. or province shall impose an export duty or other export charge of any kind whatsoever. either directly or indirectly. on pulp wood exported to the United States. the amount of such export duty or other export charge shall be added as an additional duty to the duties herein imposed upon wood pulp when imported from such country. dependency. or province. It can not be expected that Canada or Its Provinces will remove the present discriminations as to the exportation of pulp wood to the United States or cease from adding additional discriminations unless we also lessen the tariff on the cheap paper which is made mainly from spruce wood. The United States is amply able to protect Its future supply of cheap paper and its future supply of spruce wood by undertaking the production of new spruce forests and the conservation and reproduction of existing spruce forests. but a very large proportion of the spruce forests of Canada. consisting of small. black spruce timber. Is practically valueless for manufacture into lumber and profitable to cut only for the manufacture of ground wood and cheap paper. It would seem desirable. both for our own country generally. for the pulp and paper mills of our country now largely dependent upon the Canadian pulp -wood supply. as well as a matter of neighborly courtesy and interest. if we endeavor to utilize in our country with its great reading population those Canadian forests of spruce which if shut out of our country would be of little value. and we believe and recommend that in the long run it will be mutually profitable. both to the publishers and other users of cheap paper In the United States. to tbe mills producing print paper. to the owners of American spruce forests. to the owners of the Canadian spruce forests. and to the mutual good feeling and respect of our two countries. if a considerable reduction be made in the tariff on the cheaper grades of print paper. dependent. however. upon receiving from Canada (so far as the supply comes from her) the removal of all discriminations now existing in that country or its provinces against the exportation of pulp wood into the United States and the prevention of future discriminations in the exportation of either ground wood or paper. We therefore recommend that in the revision of the tariff the following schedule be inserted:  Printing paper. unsized. sized or glued. suitable for newepaper and books. valued at not above two and onefourth cents per pound. onetenth of one cent per pound . valued above two and onefourth cents and not above two and onehalf cents per pound. twotenths of one cent per pound. valued above two and onehalf cents per pound and not above three cents per pound. fivetenths of one cent per pound. valued above three cents and not above four cents per pound. sixtenths of one cent per pound . valued above four cents and not above five cents per pound. eighttenths of one cent per pound. valued above five cents per pound. fifteen per centum ad valorem : Provided. That if any country. dependency. or province shall Impose an export duty or other export charge of any kind whatsoever upon pulp wood. wood pulp. or printing paper. exported to the United States. or if any country. dependency. or province forbids or restricts the exportation of pulp wood. wood pulp or paper to the United States in any way there shall be imposed upon printing paper. when imported from such country. dependency. or province. an additional duty of twotenths of one cent per pound. if valued at two and onehalf cents pr pound or less. and in addition thereto the amount of the export duty or other export charge imposed by such country. dependency. or province upon the printing paper imported from such country into the United States. The present tariff on print paper valed at 2 cents per pound or less is threetenths of i cent a pound . valued at over 2 cents a pound and not over 2* cents a pound. fourtenths of 1 cent a pound. The schedul e propose is onetenth of 1 cent a pound on paper valued at not over 2I cents a pound. and twotenths of 1 cent a pound on paper valued above 2* cents and not above 2 cents per pound. This in the main is a reduction in the tariff on ordinary newsprint paper from $6 a ton to $2 per ton. The retention of a duty of onetenth of 1 cent per pound. as suggested. is justified both on the principles of a tariff for revenue and a tariff for protection. It is not desirable to strike down or injure the present paper mills in the United States. To do so would not only be very expensive to the present papermill owners and employees. but would. probably. in the future enhance the cost and price of paper. The duty proposed is about equal to the additional cost of labor in the United States and the additional cost of materials used by the paper mills caused by other tariff provisions. The committee also recommend that the Bureau of Plant Industry make investigations in the procurement and breeding of annual and perennial plants in the endeavor to find either some new plant or some elisting plant which through breeding to that end can be profitably used for the commercial manufacture of paper. not believing. however. that it Is possible to find or produce any annual or perennial plant which can successfully compete with spruce ground wood in the production of the cheaper grades of print paper. We recommend also that the Forest Service investigate the question of the production of ground wood and sulphite fiber from other kinds of wood than those now used. It is not unlikely in our opinion that by a difference in the mechanical treatment. or by some other slight treatment. it will be Fossible to successfully manufacture a good cheap grade of news printg paper by the groundwood process from other than spruce. That there is an enormous waste in the forests is conceded by everybody familiar with the facts. Much of what would otherwise be waste is now absorbed in pulp manufacture. A large proportion of the spruce wood used in the United States for ground wood would be valueless if not so used. and the same is true to a much greater degree in the case of woods used for sulphite and soda fiber. In many places in the eastern and southeastern States. and in some cases in western States. practically all of the waste from lumbering is saved and used in the production of either sulphite or soda fiber. This saving should be encouraged in every way practicable. In some of the eastern mills. where the trees are cut into saw logs and manufactured into lumber. the slabs and edgings. limbs and tops. in the proper kinds of wood. are used in the manufacture of sulphite. and the same is true of other kinds of wobd which are manufactured into soda fiber. The manufacture of sulphite and soda from fibers is not overly profitable under existing conditions. and as the main competition with these products is from mills in Europe. where the labor is much cheaper and many of the articles which are used in the processes are much cheaper. we do not think that the present rate of duty on chemical pulp. consisting in the main of sulphite and soda fiber and also a sulphate fiber. should be disturbed. and in the recommendation we have made above we have recommended that the existing rates of duty upon chemical pulp should not be disturbed as they now exist. Your committee has taken a vast amount of testimony. which Is acknowledged to be of great benefit in the pulp and paper trade. We have collected a large amount of information which. both at present and in the future. will prove of immense service to those who are interested in the use or production of pulp or paper. Your committee personally has visited and inspected carefully a large number of pulp and paper mills. have inspected and examined forests. both in the United States and in Canada. have given long study to the woods used. have considered every phase of the subject concerning which information was available. and have reached the conclusions hereinabove stated. It Is not practicable. or. in the opinion of your committee. necessary for the committee in this report to set forth in detail or even in a general way the results of the information obtained. The committee has obtained from a large number of newspaper publishers of the United States schedules showing the cost to them of paper through a series of years. which schedules have been tabulated and published in the committees hearings. The committee has also obtained schedules from the pulp and paper manufacturers of the United States. giving information concerning the capital invested. the cost of production. the percentage of cost paid in wages. the selling price of the articles produced. the quantity of p reduction. etc.. which schedules have been reduced to general tabulations and the tabulations published in the hearings. The committee has also carefully investigated. through schedules and through the aid of the Department of Labor. the percentage of wages going into the cost of production of pulp and paper and the cost of labor per unit both for pulp and paper. including the cost from the forest to the finished product. all of which tables are published in the hearings. The committee has also investigated. through statements obtained from manufacturers In Canada and through personal investigation by the Department of Labor. the wage cost in Canadian mills. The committee has also obtained information concerning the wage cost and cost of production in Sweden. The committee has also obtained through the Treasury Department full information as to the importations of pulp wood. wood pulp. and print paper into the United States from different places and at different ports of entry. The committee has also obtained full and complete Information as to the exportation and importation of paper and papermaking materials from and to the different countries of the world. All of this information has been published in the hearings of the committee. comprising between 3.000 and 4.000 pages of printed testimony. and all of which has been carefully and conscientiously considered by the committee in forming its decision. The members of your committee. when appointed. had no special or general knowledge of the subject. They have labored diligently and as effectively as they could. The effort of your committee has been to arrive at facts and just conclusions. regardless of personal bias or partisan considerations. The recommendations which the committee present are the unanimous views of the entire membership of the committee. In making its report to tile House. the committee begs leave to express its thanks and appreciation for the services rendered to tile committee by the President. by the State Department. by the Census Office. by the Bureau of Statistics. by the Bureau of Corporations. by the Bureau of Labor. by the Forest Service. and by the Bureau of Plant Industry. We also beg to acknowledge the courtesy of information freely and voluntarily furnished by many of the mill owners and by the American Pulp and Paper Association. as well as tse American Publishers Association. and the chairman of its committee on paper. While your committee does not feel that it has exhausted the subject. it can only say it las (lone as well as Its members knew how. Your committee beg leave to state that unless otherwise directed by the House it will continue and complete the work of publishing and indexing the tabulations prepared and the evidence taken by the committee. All of which Is respectfully submitted."},{"1":"1908","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. the Washington Post January 16th. relative to its House poll of strength for a Democratic nominee for President. says: In the Alabama delegation 5 voted for Bryan. 2 for Johnson. and 1 for Culberson.

It is interesting to note. in view of the effort of Republicans and some Democrats to show a wane in the popularity of Mr. Bryan. that in 1900 he polled a greater vote than in 1896 in the very States where his critics say he has no popularity. le polled more votes in 1900 than in 1896 in the following States: Connecticut. by more than 17.000. Delaware. by more than 5.000. Idaho. by about 6.000. Illinois. by about 39.000. Indiana. by about 4.000. Kentucky. by about 18.000. Maine. by about 2.000. Maryland. by about 18.000. Massachusetts. by about 51.000. New Jersey. by about 30.000. New Hampshire. by about 14.000. New York. by about 127.000. Bryan held his own in his own State. receiving about 1.800 less in 1900 than in 1896. he held his.own in North Dakota. Ohio. and his greatest falling off was in the Southern States. They say he is a twicedefeated candidate and no longer draws. But have we not heard of the jewel in the toads head of defeat? As for me. give me defeat with a man rather than victory with a counterfeit on humanitys baser metal! He has not lost all who has another throw. and he is not a defeated archer who has another arrow in his quiver! I o our brother Democrats who may cast an eye to the limelight for new and dazzling stars to supplant Mr. Bryan. I commend a prudent observance of the proverb: -Iasty climbers have sudden falls. The flower of the morningglory is born with the rising and dies with the setting sun! ButThe gathering orange stain Upon the edge of yonder western peak Reflects the sunsets of a thousand years! And the gentlemen opposite. who have gratuitously intruded their bumpers of discord into the Democratic love feast on this side. I admonish to bear the ills they have and trip it lightly over the span of thin ice whereon they tread! To employ a. scriptural term. Mr. Bryan is a man who  is become as one of us. A man who has borne himself beyond the promise of his yearsdoing in the figure of a lamb the -11 feats of a lion! A man who In the American Congress made two speeches that built for him a monument that cast its shadow across the continent. A man who spoke his party platform into being. and himself foremost in his partys choicefirst in his partys gift! A man who twice bore the commission of his party for the Presidency and polled more votes than any othet Democrat. living or dead. Indeed. in the minds of thousands there is an abiding conviction that. like Tilden in 1S76. he was elected in 1896. but. forsooth. Tilden was deposed under the mockery of law (8 to 7). and Bryan unhorsed by pernicious alternatives to the electorate and purchase of electors. in defiance of law! A man who entered the arena of the national Democratic convention of 2904. himself not a candidate. but the champion of a platform of principles. and lost. but emerged from the ordeal. in the judgment of that convention. a Titan more powerful than beforestronger and bigger. perhaps. than any other man in itthe matchless triumph of ardent conviction and compelling force! Stern as Jackson. astute as Clay. and like Clay he would rather be right than President! With the opportunity afforded in such a station he might verify the assertion of the ancient Plato: That every state will be relieved of its calamities when by the favor of fortune great power unites with wisdom and justice in one man. That he would be great in the greatest office of the Government more than half the country has registered its conviction at the polls. But that he is great without it the whole country knows! Hence it is not conclusive that political preferment of any character could exalt him to heights where. as orator and thinker. he has exalted himself. A man. however. in whose hands the people would look on public office as a public trust. in whom labor finds a friend. liberty a champion. civic order an apostle. the country a patriot. and God a servant in His vineyardone of the noblest types of clean. honest. selfcontrolling man under the stars! God gave us men. The time demands Strong minds. great hearts. true faith. and willing hands. Men whom the lust of office does not kill. Men whom the spoils of office can not buy. Men who possess opinions and a willMen who have honormen who will not lie. Men who can stand before a demagogue And damn his treacherous flatteries without winking. Tall men. sun crowned. who live above the fog In public duty and in private thinking! Ending as I began. I declare my firm belief in the wisdom of the Democratic convention to nominate the great commoner by acclamation. If elected the country will have a President and no more than a President. If not electedin the light of the current half century of our political historyit will. with two honorable exceptions from the East. have been demonstrated that no Democrat from other section than the South has or can be elected. and for the futureif both the man and the place must be consideredwe shall turn again to the mother of States and of men not only for candidates. but for Presidents.

If that authority is to be extended or if this bill extends that authority. as is claimed by the gentlemen who are advocating it. then we are embarking upon a field of investigation the boundaries of which no man can contemplate. the end of which no man can see. the cost of which no man knowsnot even the Department itselfand the results of which the Federal Government is powerless to deal with by the enactment of corrective legislation. When before the committee in the last session of Congress the Bureau of Labor was asked what the probable expense would be. and the answer was that it would run up into the millions. that $200.000 would only provide for the beginning of the investigation. It would take a long series of years to complete it. The value of these statistics therefore would be far less. because of the magnitude of the investigation and the time consumed in making it. Whereas every State in the Union can make this investigation as to employment of women within the State in a very short time. and those who are interested in it would then have the benefit of that information before the conditions surrounding the employment of women have changed."},{"1":"1906","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I -am opposed to any modification whatever of the limitations imposed upon the hours of labor of labdrers and mechanics in the public service. whether that labor be the labor of American laborers or of alien laborers. I believe in the eighthour law. I believe it is a humane law. and I do not propose to be humane only to Americans and inhumane to aliens. If there is a place in Gods world where the eighthour law ought to prevail. it is on the Isthmus of Panama. where labor is exceedingly distressing. where the heat of the sun is such as to make it almost Impossible to labor during certain hours of the day. I do not believe that in that climate any man ought to be called upon to work between the hours of 12 and 3. and if we apply the eighthour law to that locality the laborers will be called upon to work from 7 until 12. a period of five hours. and from 3 until 6. a period of three hours. making a total of eight. and I think that is all any man ought to be called on to work in that climate. I believe the work will be more economically and efficiently done if we attend to the nourishment. the recreation. and the rest of the men engaged in that locality. whether they come from this country or whether they come from Santo Domingo or Martinique. I believe you will get more out of an eighthour day in that locality than you will get out of a tenhour day. that if a man is called upon to work there for ten hours he will really do only eight hours work. and that in practical efficiency the eighthour day will accomplish as much as the tenhour day.

Now. what is the basis of this claim? The basis of this claim is that some one did not get a full recompense for his or her interest in a piece of land in the city of San Francisco some fifty years ago No one claims thht there Was any labor value upon that land. No one claims that one days energy had been expended by ahyone in the production of wealth and that wealth- created by labor had been taken by the people of the. United States in this way. Nothing of that kind. A ground rent had been created there in the city of San Francisco by the people then residing in San Francisco. That ground rent has been enormously increased since that time. It is not the result of individual human effort. The people who have the title to that land. or who claim title to that onesixth of a 20foot strip. did not create any of that: land value. Nor did those from whom they claim to inherit it create one dollar more of that land value than any of the rest of the people of San Francisco. and the scores of thousands of dollars of value that may have been added since that time to that land is the direct result of increase in population. of increase in invention. of improvements in government. of improvements: in transportation and exchangein other words. all of the things which we call civilization. Now. because the people of this country were so foolish fifty years ago as not to see the wisdom. and justice of taking. in taxation. that value which they had created. therefore we wha now constitute the people of the United States are called upon to go down into our pockets. the pockets of the peoplewe call it taking from the Treasury. but it Is delving down into the pockets of the people--and take out money to recompense these individuals for a claim that they have no justification for in. morals. If the single tax had been in operation in the United States at that time this.claim would never have arisen. could never have come before Congress. because there would be no margin of ground rent to sell. The people would. by taxation. have taken every year the value of the rental. the annual value of the land. into the public. treasury . and it would make no difference to Mrs. Jones or Mrs.. Smith. or whatever the name of the lady may be. whether she owned a onesixth interest or not. because she would have nomargin of rent to sell and therefore would not be able to robpresent day laborfor ground rent is a tax upon the laborer of today and not upon his predecessor of a decade or more ago.. and is paid out of wealth created now. from day to day.

It is the policy that should be put into operation nowthe quicker the betterand when once that is done you remove �385: all such claims as this from the State courts and the courts of the United States. you clear up litigation all over the country. By thus reducing litigation you reduce the number of lawyers. and you turn the energy of those lawyers who come into this House and argue in favor of claims of this kind. in which. of course. they are not interested. into useful channels. turn them toward useful avocations. instead of having them use their brains and energy in endeavoring to convince us that there is justice in a claim which has no moral justification whatever."},{"1":"1903","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I certainlr do not want to do that.

I desire to address the Senate briefly upon this question. which seems to me to be one of the most important that we have to consider during this session and one of the most necessary to be enacted. . Mr. President. in every country its statesmen. political economists and men of letters are writing up the results of the nineteenth century. Each nation in the Old World finds in these statements causes for intense satisfaction. Each is able to make an exhibit of progress and development which gratifies the national pride and makes the people believe they are in the front rank at the commencement of the new century. While the rivalries and jealousies and war of contending figures and estimates among themselves continue. they are unanimous in granting to the United States the lead in almost everything which goes to make up the power and greatness. the advancement and development of any country. From 5.000.000 of population in 1800 we are 77.000.000 in 1900. From having little rank in agriculture and none whatever in manufactures. our productions now enable this enormous population to live far better than did our forefathers one hundred years ago. and the surplus of our farms and factories is entering the markets and succeeding in competition all over the world. For a hundred years the debtor nation. we enter upon the twentieth century a banker for all the governments of Europe. We have changed the continent which was a wilderness beyond the fringe of settlements on the Atlantic coast. to great cities. thriving villages. prosperous farms and active industries on the plains and in the mountains from the Atlantic to the Pacific. and from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Circle. Our railway lines. covering the country with a network of steel. in connection with transportation facilities on the inland lakes. rivers and canals. have given to us an internal commerce greater than that of all the interchanges of all the nations of theearth by rail and water. In length of lines we number nearly onehalf the mileage of the railways of the world. There is everywhere an earnest search for the factors which produced these astonishing results. We freely admit that natural advantages were essential to our political and industrial victories. but natural advantages lie dormant unless the motive power and creative genius exist which shall utilize their opportunities. Our virgin soil. our climatic conditions and the limitless wealth in earth and forest and in mountain were all here. and had been for ages. Distance and isolation from European paternalism gave exceptional opportunities for the growth of civil and religious liberty. for the growth of that individualism in thought and action which has created millions of architects contributing to their countrys greatness. But no unprejudiced observer can fail. upon careful study. to be convinced that the United States of today owes nearly all that it is to the wisdom of Washington. Hamilton and Jefferson in the initial legislation which they conceived for developing American industries and American industrial independence by the policy of protection. In the one hundred years there have been a few deviations from this beginning. each one of them followed by panic. industrial paralysis and general distress. Since the close of the civil war in 1865. except for the experiment under the Wilson bill of 1893. the policy of the fathers has been the practice of the country. In this thirtyfive years we have witnessed the most remarkable part of our countrys growth. The development of our resources has furnished ample opportunities for the enterprise of our people. and for the useful employment of their wealth. and necessitated the borrowing of large amounts of foreign capital. We have been so absorbed in production that we have neglected utterly the equally important question. if we are to be a world power. with all which that means. of our position upon the ocean. In other words. our development and growth have been onesided. We have crowded upon our rails. our lakes. our rivers and our canals an output from every avenue of production which must find markets or produce stagnation and distress beyond our dreams. without any provision. so far as our Government or our people or our flag is concerned. for its carriage beyond our own seaboard. The farm. the factory and the mine have filled the warehouses and the docks of our Atlantic and Pacific coasts with their contributions to national wealth. employment and the happiness of our people. and left their transportation to Europe. to Asia. to Africa. to South America. and to Australia. to the greed of foreign shipowners. to the protection of foreign flags and to the hazards of foreign wars. A general collision. which is often predicted in the European newspapers. among the great powers of Europe. in the mad haste of their navies and armies to outstrip each other in the acquisition of spheres of influence in Asia and Africa. would act upon the United States. who might be simply a spectator of the conflict. as an embargo upon our coast. We would be shut up within ourselves as absolutely as if the navies of the world were blockading our ports. Outside the material advantages of owning and operating our own merchant marine under our own flag. it is humiliating. not only to our pride. but also to our selfrespect. that we should thus. upon the ocean. have the industry. capital. labor and living of our people dependent upon the whims. the jealousies and the animosities of the sovereigns and the cabinets of Europe. Now. to return to a brief investigation of why a people who showed such marked genius for the sea at their beginnings should have developed in such a marvelous way upon the land and surrendered their position upon the ocean to countries as insignificant in population and power. compared with ourselves. as Norway. with 2.000.000 of people. and Belgium. with 6.000.000. In 1807. with a population of 7.000.000. the United States had a larger registered tonnage for the foreign trade than in 1901. with 77.000.000 of people. In 1852 the United States was foremost among maritime nations. and now is the least. We constructed at that time a greater tonnage than Great Britain or any other nation. while in 1898 we built of oceangoing steam vessels a tonnage of 16.382. against Germany of 130.667 and England of 1.301.325. There is but one line. of 4 ships. carrying the American flag and having an American registry between United States and Europe. There are not 10 American ships in the Pacific trade available for the development of the Philippines and the commerce we expect in the Orient. It requires about 5.000.000 tons of shipping for the transportation of our foreign commerce. valued last year at about two thousand millions of dollars. Of that 5.000.000 tons of shipping the United States has only about 350.000 tons in the foreign and deepsea trade. There is but one answer to the question of this almost inconceivable discrepancy between progress on the land and on the sea. and that is that our statesmanship has neglected 1901.. the ocean and permitted our own commerce to slip out of our hands. Washington. Jefferson and Hamilton and other patriots devised the same system of protection of our merchant fleet as they did for the development of our industries. In fact. they passed the bill to promote commerce upon the ocean before they did the famous tariff law of Washingtons Administration. It was under the operation of tonnage charges in favor of American vessels and the discriminating duties for goods carried in American bottoms that we carried ninetyone per cent of our commerce in 1828 against 8 per cent of our commerce in 1900. Reciprocal commercial treaties with foreign nations gradually swept away every vestige of the protective features adopted during Washingtons Administration. We were still able to maintain ourselves so long as wooden ships held the ocean. Our virgin forests beside the shipyard. the genius of our naval constructors. and the inventive faculty of our naval designers enabled us to overcome the great difference in expense in operation and building resulting from the higher wages paid to American mechanics and seamen. The American clipper ship became mistress of the seas and the pride of the country. The patriotic addresses and speeches in Congress of the orators and statesmen of that period are full of glowing rhetoric and burning periods upon the supremacy of the American flag upon all the seas of the globe. The most fervid imagination upon the platform or in legislative halls has been unable to conjure a figure upon that subject for our country in twentyfive years. The advent of iron steamships at once gave Great Britain the advantage. She had cheaper iron. cheaper labor. cheaper operations. and cheaper maintenance. Great insurance companies discriminated against the wooden ship. various vexatious tonnage duties discriminated against the American ship. steel. iron or wood. and the United States was out of the race. But the American marine did not die without a struggle. People like those interested in the Collins Line said to the Government. IMake conditions equal. and we will keep the American flag upon the sea. The subsidy was granted in the way of mail contracts. and the Collins Line successfully competed with the subsidized lines of Great Britain. They soon in competition brought freight rates onethird below the subsidized English Cmard Line. which before monopolized the business. But Congress yielded to the cry of free tradeto the literary campaign of the foreign shipowners and to the prejudices which were aroused against the fostering by the Government of any industry. The subsidy or mail advantages were withdrawn. the Collins Line went into bankruptcy. its ships were sold. and the United States folded its flag and retired from the sea. What was the result? The English line restored freight charges to the full rates from which they had been reduced by 33 per cent by the competition of the Collins line. The United States saved the subsidy which had been paid to the Collins line of a few hundred thousands of dollars a year. but the farmer. the merchant and the manufacturer of the United States had to spend millions. of dollars a year in the way of increased freight rates because of that miserable surrender. Happily for us the enemies of the American merchant marine have never been able to repeal the protection which was granted to vessels in our coasting trade. Under our laws foreign ships were excluded from our domestic commerce. The result has been that the construction of steamships for our coasting trade has kept alive the few shipyards which we have. The business has increased. As profits grew rivalry led to competing lines. until now we have the best coastwise fleet. performing better service and at better rates than the coasting vessels of any other nation. In addition to that. they have stimulated along the coast a commerce and a trade which otherwise would have lain dormant until the railway reached them. But for this preserved remnant of a wise policy. the United States. with 3.000 miles of coast and innumerable harbors on the Atlantic and hundreds of miles on the Gulf and Caribbean Sea. and a thousand miles or more on the Pacific. would have been as isolated from the element upon which it should be supreme as Tartary or Tibet. The question which is far above politics or partisan considerations. which is purely patriotic. and upon which. except as to methods. there can not possibly be any division of opinion. is. How can our merchant marine be built up? As a member of the Committee on Commerce. I have listened to the testimony and taken some part in the examination of the witnesses. They included the best talent and the most experience which we have upon this subject. The witnesses were those who are interested in foreign trade and those who are not. They were shipbuilders. shipowners. business men and farmers. When their testimony is sifted. from the mass of fact and figures which they presented. a few controlling principles for our government are deduced. There was no suggestion which was not taken up and exhaustively considered. In connection with the merchant marine every nation. for its own defense and its own development. must have abundant shipyards. equipped with every modern appliance and up to date with all the advance of modern invention and discovery.. The suggestion which has attracted most attention and held it for the longest time has been free shipsin other words. the liberty of purchase and entry upon American registry of ships built anywhere in the world. There never has been. and there never will be. a better or more eloquent presentation of that phase of this question than was given here day before yesterday by the distinguished Senator from Missouri in his speech. which is upon our desks in the RECORD this morning. We have in that speech all there is that is persuasive or that is possible to be put upon that side. We have fought out this question in our protective policies so triumphantly that the argument need not be restated now. The policy advocated by the distinguished Senator from Missouri. turned from the ocean onto the land. would have taken away the protective principle from our industries at the beginning. and we would be. upon the land. dependent upon foreign nations for everything we produce. except agriculture. just as we are upon the sea. dependent upon foreign nations for our transportation. But outside of the manifest policy of our Government in the protection of its industries and by protection developing them in excellence and cheapness for successful competition with foreign rivals. come elements which are fatal to the freeship policy. The three essentials for a successful merchant marine are cheaper cost of construction. of operation. and of maintenance. The testimony showed that the cost of construction. the cost of operation and the cost or maintenance are all much higher for steamships built in American shipyards and run under the American flag. and all of them. in the aggregate. at least twentyfive per cent higher than the same charges in Great Britain. and from thirty to forty per cent higher than under the Belgian or Norwegian flags. The purchase of foreign ships leaves out entirely the growth of our shipbuilding and the employment of our American labor. Frequent trials by our most experienced shipowners have proved that with the additional cost of operation and of maintenance under the American flag over the British. or. still greater. over the German. Belgian. or Norwegian. it is impossible to use the free ship under American registry. The additional cost under the American flag is all due to laborhigher wages in the shipyard. higher wages on shipboard. and better living for the crew. Surely no American Senator or Congressman desires to legislate to change these conditions by reducing American labor to European standards. Discriminating duties have been suggested by which there would be a heavier duty charged upon goods coming into our ports in foreign ships than those coming in under the American flag. To accomplish this we would have to abrogate about fifty treaties with foreign powers. It has been demonstrated. as in the case of France recently. that no nation can successfully impose discriminating duties without retaliation. The French Government was forced to repeal within a year its effort at discriminating duties. No nation can submit to retaliation which is a seller more largely than a buyer. Either discriminating duties on imports or bounties for export would lead to European nations retaliating upon the things which we have to sell them. in a way to give advantage and stimulate production in Russia. in Egypt. in India and in Asia against our wheat and our cotton. All nations are agreed that their merchant marine can be built up only by bounties. The bounties paid last year by the different maritime nations were $26.000.000 in round numbers. against $l.000.000in round numbers by the United States. German statesmen discovered that if the Empire was to find a market for its growing surplus it must have its own ships. Withinthepastfew years the German Government has been increasing directly its subsidies. has indirectly been giving rebates to the steamships over the State railways and has lent every possible Government encouragement to the enlargement of German shipyards and the construction and operation of German steamships. The result has been that Germany has stepped into the second place among maritime nations. although she has so little coast and so few ports. The advance of Japan by the same processes has been almost incredible. in fact so great that she is now reaching out for the control of the commerce of the Pacific. The amount proposed for annual subsidy under this bill is $9.000.000 a year. As the ships receiving the subsidy have to carry the mails free. we can deduct the present mail subsidy. and so the amount is reduced to about $7.750.000 a year. The outcry against this sum as being enormously in excess of any benefits that can be derived from it can only be accounted for on the ground that it is promoted by the literary bureaus of foreign lines. We paid last year for pensions $145.000.000. This sum is the annual expression in money of the gratitude of the country to those who have fought its battles and won its victories. Six per cent upon this sum would carry the American flag. for which these men fought. upon American ships. loaded with the products of the American farm and factory. to every country on the globe. The River and Harbor Bill this year. as it passed the House. carries $00.000.000. of which onequarter is for local pride and local sportsmen and threequarters. or $45.000.000. to improve American facilities for foreign ships. We appropriate over $100.000.000 for the Army and $77.000.000 for the Navy. and 4J per cent upon this would carry the American flag upon American merchant vessels. laden with the products of American industry. upon a mission of commerce. peace and civilization all over the world. The bill creates no favors. it fosters no interests. but itlays down universal rules by which the capital and enterprise of the people can demand their share of this subsidy. It is restricted to no class of vessels. but is given upon a scale adjusted after most careful consideration to every kind and every tonnage of steamship. to the sailing ships and to the fostering and encouragement of our fisheries. which are the nurseries of our seamen. Its purpose is to give to each class of vessels the amount. and only the amount. necessary to equalize the cost of construction. operation and maintenance of that class of vessels with the cost of construction. operation and maintenance of similar ships sailing under foreign flags. Of the three principal objectionsraised against the bill. the first is that the existing lines will get all the money. Of the $9.000.000 per annum. the amount which the American Line can earn is $1.100.000. being the sum which passed the Senate in the original postal subsidy bill. but which was changed in the House. The amount which can be received by the ships of that company and all other 21knot steamers hereafter built combined can not exceed $2.000.000 a year That leaves $7.000.000 for the purposes which have been so eloquently argued by my friend from Georgia . the lowerspeed freight ships. Certainly the Americans who have risked their money and given their brains and experience to this badly handicapped struggle for an American merchant marine ought not to be punished for their efforts. It would not be a good policy to withdraw from them their present mail privileges. which are a form of subsidy. deny them theprivilegesof this subsidy. drive them under foreign flags and then say: We will have no merchant marine until new ships can be constructed. which will require some years. The testimony conclusively showed that even under the present mail contracts the four fast ships of the International Navigation Company are run at a loss. If under this subsidy they are run at a large profit. with money in our country commanding lesser rates than anywhere else. with our capital active and seeking employment. there will be immediately placed with our shipyards orders for competing lines. The next objection is to highspeed vessels. It is charged that they are not essential to the development of American trade with foreign countries. It has not been the characteristic of the American people to yield to each other. much less to foreigners. on a question of speed. It is not poetry nor sentiment which inspires Germany to build the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse in order to beat the record of the llajestic. and to expend three and a half millions of dollars to build the Deutschland to excel in speed the Campania. or which leads the most prudent of all investors. the French. to struggle so desperately to construct steamships which may equal. if not excel. the British and the German in quickness of passage across the Atlantic. In transportation speed is desired. It is the gauge by which peoples judge the maritime skill. genius and enterprise of other nations. No American has been abroad and no American has read the record of ocean voyages who has not had comfort when our little fleet bore the palm. or felt mortified and annoyed when this little spark of maritime life was extinguished by superior enterprise and ambition among Germans or English. Then these highspeed vessels are of use commercially. apart from the advertisement which they give. in the carriage of the manufactured products of the farm and the factory. and of perishable goods. England. Germany. and France have their own reason for giving large subsidies for these great ocean greyhounds. It is that they may have them for auxiliary war ships in time of war. They are as necessary to the navy as the cruisers and battle ships. These old maritime nations have discovered that by a comparatively small expenditure in the way of subsidies they have always available a large fleet of flying cruisers and transports maintained at private expense and promoting the commerce of their country. The next objection is that the bill does not give sufficient encouragement to the tramp steamer. in other words. to the slow. or 11knot or 12knot steamship. Figures show that the excess of compensation under this billto the 12knot steamship over the cost and handling of coal on account of difference in speed is greater than for the highspeed steamer. It costs eight times as much to run a 21knot steamer as it does a 12knot steamer. Neither the highspeed steamer nor the tramp can find business except upon established routes. where commerce and intercommunication in trade are fixed. It is the middleclass steamer of from 14 to 17 knots speed which builds up commerce. It carries few passengers. Its main cargo is freightcereals from the farm and the heavy machinery from the factory. These vessels will be required to build up the commerce between San Francisco and Hongkong and Yokohama. between American ports and ports of South America. between American ports and the numberless ports in different parts of the globe which now never see the American flag and know nothing of the products of the United States. The tramp would not load with wheat. for instance. and go to a port where they did not eat it. and so the tramp never loads except to take the surplus of What is marketable abroad. and which the regular lines upon established courses have not been able to absorb. We have had a commission in Europe for five years teaching the people the food value of our corn and its appetizing possibilities under the suggestion of the American cook. After the middleclass vessel. which receives the largest compensation over cost of operation under this bill. has created a steady and remunerative trade between an American and foreign port. then will come the demand for the swift passenger and mail boat and for the cheap tramp. We must not forget in this discussion the fact which it is almost impossible for an American to comprehend. that while the sea power is acknowledged now by all statesmen to be the controlling element in the worlds affairs. we must build ours up from the bottom. We have no ships. we have totally inadequate shipyards. we have no routes of commerce. we have no banking facilities in foreign ports. we have few agents in foreign countries for promoting the sale and advocating the merits of American productions. Whatever facilities and opportunities in these directions are granted to us come through the hands and by the agencies of countries who are our commercial rivals and daily becoming more jealous of our commercial growth and more inimical to our commercial power. The subsidy under this bill covers only about onequarter of the cost of maintenance and operation for any class of vessels. Therefore every ship which derives benefits from the measure must hustle for cargo and succeed in getting it. or make its voyage at a loss. The subsidy works automatically in the promotion of an American marine. If by experience the compensation proves so large that there is an undue profit. immediately American capital puts more ships in commission and enlarges the merchant marine. If our merchant marine. by reason of its prosperity. grows beyond the amount which is appropriated. then it is distributed pro rata. with a diminishing compensation to each of the beneficiaries. It was found. on investigation. that Americans whose business education and experience had been in ocean transportation. after struggling vainly to live under the American flag and American registry. handicapped by the excessive cost as against the European flag and registry. rather than retire from business purchased ships abroad and are sailing them under the Belgian and other flags. There will be available of this class of vessels now running and under contract about 300.000 tons. but an amendment has been accepted limiting the privilege to 200.000. This will be an immediate addition of that amount to our American merchant marine. It will enable these Americans who have experience to work under the American flag. and we will get the advantage of their commercial and transportation skill for the purposes of promoting the increase of the American merchant marine and the enlargement of American commerce. They can come in with their ships. however. only on half the compensation which is allowed to the American ships now sailing under the American flag. or hereafter to be built in American shipyards. and before that onehalf compensation can be secured they must build an equal amount of tonnage in American shipyards. by American labor. to be sailed under the American flag. It is estimated that there is paid by American producers to foreign shipowners in freight charges at least $175.000.000 a year. Four per cent upon this would give us an American merchant marine and the expenditure of the greater part of this money in our own country. Political economists and statisticians in foreign lands do not hesitate to say that there is no country in the world which could stand this drain of $175.000.000 paid to foreigners. to be expended in foreign countries and for foreign labor. except the United States. It is estimated that if our tonnage was carried in American bottoms. and the money paid to American ships. and American shipyards enlarged to meet the demands of American construction. there would be direct employment given to nearly 200.000 men. The indirect employmentin the steel mills to the makers of the plates and frames. in machine shops to the makers of the machinery. in the iron oremines to the delvers for the ore. and in the coal mines to the laborers in coalwould be equally great. if not greater. while the farmer. upon the wellknown principle that the proximity of the market for his produce and the saving of transportation add to his profit. would have these additional markets at home for the products which now are carried great distances and transported abroad at his expense before he can receive the benefits of his harvest. Every transportation man. indeed every business man. knows that the infallible test of any enterprise is the confidence which it inspires among bankers and investors. With money so plenty that it commands. upon giltedge securities for permanent investment. only 8 per cent. and in temporary loans averages but 2. capital In the hands of enterprising. energetic. and venturesome Americans is always seeking remunerative work. In London. Paris. and Berlin the bankers are eager for the bonds of the English. the French. and the German lines as security for loans. while the investing public are equally anxious to secure an interest in those enterprises. It is almost impossible. as I know from having seen those securities come before the finance committees of institutions. for the American shipowner to secure. at any rate of interest. a loan upon his securities. They must be backedup. outside of their intrinsic merit. by abundant personal indorsement. If there was any profit in- the shipping business. money would flow into shipyards and the sailing of ships as freely as it now does into the extension of railroads and telegraph lines. into the opening of mines. and into the establishment or enlargement of industrial plants in every department of production. The condition of transportation companies is more easily ascertained than that of any other corporation. and this is especially true of carriers upon the ocean. Capitalists who are seeking remunerative employment for their money have always before them. when considering ocean transportation. the cost of steamships. of maintenance. of operations. and of terminal facilities at both ends of the route. The customhouse reveals the cargo. the price current for freight in the shipping lists reveals the freight charges. Let the route show 10 per cent. with a possibility of development. and instantly it will be invaded by rival lines. The whole history of transportation in the United States is the story of constantly reducing rates upon railroads. this constant reduction going. not to the stockholders or bondholders of the railroads. but to the farmers and the manufacturers in the reduction of freight charges. American railways started with charges per ton per mile equal to those of foreign countries. and now they are less than onethird of those charges. The same lawthe inevitable law of profit promoting competing opportunitieswill act upon the ocean. The struggle for business will stimulate business at the same time that the bid for business decreases the rates. In a few years the farmers of the country will have the benefit of this decrease in lower freights upon the ocean. as they now have it in this diminished cost of carriage upon the rail. without which no farmer could raise and have carried to the seaboard his harvests from the great Western or Northwestern States. To promote the sale of American products in the East. where they are unknown. and in other continents where they are known. there is all the difference in the world between foreign and Amer ican influences upon the foreign market. The America captain and the officers of American ships would be advance agents wherever they landed for the goods which they carry. With the American merchant marine will come the American banker in the central ports of the world. and beside the American banker will be the live. hustling. and invincible American agent for the sale of American products. Almost at the hour which marked the exit of the nineteenth and the entrance of the twentieth century the United States found its position changed. both in its relation to the rest of the world and in its internal conditions. We suddenly discovered. by the unexpected results of an unexpected war. that we had a place and had responsibilities second to none among nations. We awoke to the fact. which has been clear to all Europe in their affairs and to their peoples for many years. inspiring them with struggle and terror. that we were upon the eve of an industrial crisis. Great productiveness has its perils as well as its advantages. Our surplus exported last year amounted to about $1.500.000.000. and will constantly increase. Any check upon its markets abroad or its facilities for reaching them must cause at once suspension of both enterprise and employment. We have coming to the front every year from our schools millions of youths who must of necessity join our industrial army. Every measure or enterprise or employment of capital which takes care of them is a lessing to the workers already in the field. as well as to those recruits who are adding to our national power and wealth. As I have said before. with our merchant marine. our shipyards and our ships and their contributing industries will enlist hundreds of thousands of them. but the other hundreds of thousands must be cared for by finding profitable sale for that which they produce. Nations in all centuries have warred with each other upon questions of territory or dynasty. but national jealousies. friendships. and enmities are measured now by commercial rivalries or alliances. Partnerships for the promotion of business are impossible among different nations and alien peoples. and therefore the industrial war will be more acute each year. Already we have the echoes of it in the speech of the Austrian statesman advising a European alliance against us. in the predictions of the great French economist. M. Leroy Beaulieu. of the menace we are to industrial Europe. and in the utterances within a few days of Lord Rosebery and Mr. Chamberlain in their warnings to the British manufacturers and British producers to the effect that the United States menaces their position and growth atd may dethrone them from the markets which Great Britain now occupies. While we wereisolated geographically. diplomatically. and commercially. we could have sentimental relations. useful for international compliment and laudatory addresses on festive occasions. but now we have no friends. National sentiment of enmity or friendship speedily makes its way to citizens or subjects. The officers of foreign ships. the bankers and agents. also foreigners. who now conduct our export business will grow more and more hostile with advancing years in their feelings. and feelings are reflected in actions. With the construction of the Nicaragua Canal. which will be completed within the next few years. the necessity for an auxiliary fleet and a merchant marine becomes still greater. Whether we look at this question as a matter of national defense in time of war or consider it as one of the factors in the solution of our industrial problems as they arise from time to time. or sum up the possibilities for the American farm and factory and mine in the wants present and potential of the millions in the Orient. the beneficent influence of this measure becomes more real. The distinguished Senator from Maine has given to the perfection of this bill his great ability. his vast experience. and years of study and labor. He has done it absolutely unselfishly in the public interest. Since the bill has been before the committee in the last session every criticism upon it. whether it appeared in the form of an editorial in the friendly or hostile newspapers or in a communication. signed or anonymous. to the press or in letters addressed to the committee. has been taken up and seriously considered. It has led to many modifications of the different sections. From all the information which I have been able to gather I approve of the bill as it stands. but so far as I amindividually concerned I shall be glad to hear any argument. any suggestion. or any amendment which improves the bill or which removes what can be established as a just criticism upon any of its provisions. But what New York wants. with her commanding financial. commercial. and industrial interests. what the country needs. and needs now. is a merchant marine. and the principles of this bill are the only practical methods in sight for the accomplishment of that purpose. We are not interested as to who of our fellowcitizens gets this money if they earn it. but we are deeply concerned that somebody shall get it who will construct shipyards and build and navigate American ships. Those of us who have passed middle life remember as boys the pride with which we used to recite upon the school platform the great speech of Daniel Webster about the American flag seen in every port and the American ship upon every ocean. That inspiring effort of our greatest of Congressional orators no longer appears in the American schoolbook. The American schoolboy knows. if he finds it in an old volume in the library. that it relates to a glorious period of his countrys history. He does not understand why he should be deprived of the privilege. in which his father took such patriotic interest. of exulting in the proud preeminence of the American ship and the Stars and Stripes upon all the waters of the earth. Today the American makes the circuit of the globe. He sails into the harbors of Europe. of Asia. of Africa. and of South America. amidst the abundant shipping which fills those ports. He passes upon the different seas the argosies of commerce. carrying the products of his own and other countries. The flags of all nations fly from the mastheads of these steamers. except one. He sees nowhere the Stars and Stripes. He finds the merchants and the peoples of foreign lands familiar with every emblem but our own. If he wishes to address a letter home it goes from South America through Liverpool. from China through London. from the East through the mails and under the flag of every country but his own. Under this bill. as new lines are established between our ports and lands across the Atlantic or the Pacific they must carry free American mail. With the enactment of this measure five years will witness a wonderful change in the relations of the United States to ocean transportation. Long before the limited period of the subsidy has passed we shall have returned again to the jubilant and patriotic feeling of Daniel Webster. We can again proudly boast that our ships are upon every sea. our flag in every port. and the name and fame of our country respected by all nations. and that the products and the goods of the United States are in successful competition in every market of the world with our rivals in production. trade. and manufactures."},{"1":"1900","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"He was recalled at his own request. because he had been there a long time in a climate which breaks men down. carrying upon his shoulders a burden of responsibility. military and civil. and performing an amount of labor. prodigious in its character. which would break any man down.

There has never been a national convention for twenty years of either of the great parties. nor of new ones. which has not pledged in its convention the enactment of such a measure. We have in this House observed seven consecutive measures projected. and yet events occurring intermediately have inevitably prevented these measures either from becoming law. or when such. from receiving the recognition of the administrative officers. The AttorneyGeneral of the United States. in a late opinion brought to the attention of the public. has given out that the late eighthour law is practically suspended in its operation upon Government work. This upon the theory of emergency which justifies the suspension. With that opinion at this time I have no expression of dissent. I do. however. call the attention of the House to the bill passed by this House at the last session. that it still lingers in the Senate. in another branch of this legislative body. not yet passed. sleeping because of neglect. With the construction of the AttorneyGeneral. which renders the old law practically nugatory and vitiates it as far as its effects or application is concerned. with the new law suspended in its passage. the country is confronted with the fact. demonstrated by the remarks qf the two gentlemen I have referred to. that we are to do without an eighthour law which has been the expression of both Houses and the desire of all humane people and the intention of this honorable House. Worse is it to admit today. sir. that there is an absolute failure of realization by all of those mostly interested. those burdened toilers whose interest it was the intention of this House to subserve. Mr. Speaker. this House. with the best spirit. in many votes indifferent to partisanship. found it agreeable to give that bill an almost unanimous vote. I can not but call attention to the fairminded men of the House. to the Speaker. and the country. so far as my voice may reach it. that I am impressed with the absolute injustice of longer letting that eighthour bill remain suspended and longer deceiving the army of workmen by promises never fulfilled. What is it which ever induces the laborer to trust those who ever deceive? Why is he always the greatest object of solicitude during political campaigns. yet ever forgotten and ever ignoredyea. ever betrayed and oppressedin the day when his righteous demands should be complied with and his honest needs be satisfied? Mr. Speaker. a million men are interested in having their hours of labor shortened to the actual necessities of their toil. so that they may not only attend to the needs of their families. but cultivate social intercourse with them and look after the education of their children and their spiritual welfare. Such considerations as these appeal essentially to humane men. They call into operation a principle which is not only recognized today in the passage of this brief measure. but which will. I trust. prompt us. in the remaining hours of our service in this body. to do everything in our power to further the passage of a general eighthour law. And if as members of this body we can bring any influence to bear upon the coordinate branch of Congress. we should not hesitate to do so in behalf of the interests to which I have referred. and as a matter of just humanity as well as of deserved right."},{"1":"1898","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President.

It is very true. as stated by the Senator from New Hampshire. that I urged a pension of $50 to the widow of Gen. John D. Stevenson. of my State. a most gallant and distinguished officer in the Federal Army who was brevetted for gallantry. He was a brevet majorgeneral when he died. His widow was 80 years old at the time of the application. absolutely indigent. and dependent upon the labor of her daughter for her support. Congress had repeatedly given $50 a month to brigadiergenerals who had not performed onetenth the service of General Stevenson. and had given $50 to widows who were in affluent circumstances. and I simply asked that the same rule should be applied to the widow of this old political opponent of mine. but always my personal friend. The House of Representatives refused to give more than $30. and I considered it an outrage then and do consider it so now. although it may violate the rule that you shall say nothing about the parliamentary action of the coordinate branch of Congress. That was the extent of my offending and no more. I have advocated with some energy. to my recollection. two pension bills since I have been a member of the Senate. now nearly twenty years. The one was a pension to the widow of Francis P. Blair. with whom I had no amicable relations for some years before the war. but whom I supported afterwards for the United States Senate and to whom I became warmly attached personally after hostilities ceased. When it was proposed to give $100 a month to the widow of General Logan. a majorgeneral and a very gallant soldier. formerly a member of this body. I offered an amendment giving $100 to the widow of Francis P. Blair. also a majorgeneral and formerly a member of this body. and to whom. I assert deliberately. the cause of the Union was more indebted than to any other man except Lincoln and possibly Grant. because he had held Missouri so that her military strength could not be given to the Confederacy and prevented complications that might have changed the result of that struggle. I have done this. and I would. do it again. but that does not affect this question and does not affect my action now. I am now simply assailing abuses in a holy system. as it should be. Eliminate the abuses. and you then give the proper status to the generosity and sympathy of the American people toward the men who really fought. I am not surprised at what the Senator from Kansas said about espionage. That is the old argument we have heard here before when it was recommended that the pension list be published. It is an offensive wordespionage and spying. Mr. President. if there be any offense in that regard. let it be settled with the Commissioner of Pensions. He makes the recom- mendation. I will not undertake to give other reasons than those he gives in his report. His idea is that if the lists are published in the respective vicinities. it will bring to the knowledge of the Bureau facts which otherwise would not come to light. The Commissioner of Pensions assumes. what every intelligent man knows to be true. that there are men upon the pension list who are not entitled to pensions under any law and whosenames should be eliminated. and as a matter of course when information comes to the Bureau which shows that they are not entitled to pensions. it is a benefaction to the taxpayers of the United States. and calling it espionage and spying and the argument that it is in the interest of the pension agents do not at all affect the real reason which the Commissioner gives and which we know exists. It was said that this publication in 1883 benefited the pension agents and increased the number of pensions. Let me ask the Senator from Colorado how it happened that after that practice was discontinued the pension list continued to increase from year to year. showing that it was not that publication which caused the increase of applications and of pensions that were granted?"},{"1":"1897","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"My purpose. Mr. President. on the present sad occasion is briefly to express my great personal esteem and my high admiration for a great leader in the public councils of our country. whose life added luster to American character and illustrated the possibilities in American political life. It can not be too often noted and emphasized that there is no insurmountable bar to preeminence in the politics of our country when to personal traits of exalted character there are added incorruptible integrity. firm resolution. and positive courage. When these high qualities are graced with kindliness of disposition. urbanity in intercourse. and a high sense of.justice and fair dealing toward adversaries. we have that truly American character which was illustrated in the public life of the late CHARLES FREDERICK CRISP. of Georgia. His early schooling was obtained in the camp. upon the march. and in the very forefront of the battle. It was amidst the hardships. restraints. and sacrifices incident to four years of civil conflict that he laid fast and sure the foundation of selfreliance. indomitable resolution. and high purpose. which in a few years brought him forward as one qualified to lead and to shape the course of political affairs. His promotion was rapid. Admitted to the bar in 1866. he was raised to the bench in 1877. and from that high position was elected to the House of Representatives in 1882. There in committees. on the floor in debate. and in earnest work. he so impressed his political -associates that in the Fiftysecond Congress his party elected him Speaker of the Housethe most exalted position within the gift of the House and second only to the Presidency. in point of power. in our system of Government. These accomplished results illustrate not only the high character and attainments of Judge CRISP. but they emphasize the possibilities of popular government. whose highest honors are at all times open to the free competition of those who are worthy to fill them. The public life of Judge CRISP illustrates the truth of the remark that nothing is denied to welldirected labor. and nothing is obtained without it. Leadership in the House exacts the most constant and assiduous labor from those who aspire to its high emnprize. and can not be purchased at a lesser price. His administration of the duties of the Speakership. during periods of intense excitement and amid the conflicts of contending interests. left not a sting among his partys adversaries nor failed to bring intensest satisfaction to his supporters. He was preeminently fair. considerate. just. and impartial. and left the wellearned reputation of a great Speaker. A like career on this floor was frustrated by the rude hand of Death immediately after the people of Georgia had expressed their purpose to elect him to the Senate. There must have been in such a career a dominating principle to which thought and action were at all times subordinated. We shall not improve occasions like this if we fail to eliminate the motive and the principle which made the public career of Judge CRISP so worthy of study and so full of noble example. He was a partisan in the purest sense of that word. He had satisfied his conscience that more substantial good. more positive progress was possible to the country from the principles. measures. and organization of the political party to which he was attached than was possible from any other organization. Hence his advocacy. as well as his opposition. was directed at all times to the triumph before the people of the principles and measures of his party. But that partisanship was destitute of every unworthy motive. free from all asperity. and unattended with epithet. innuendo. or aspersion. Those who differed from him listened to his earnest advocacy confident that it was inspired by sincerity and prompted by a sense of high duty. If to party he gave up what was meant for mankind. it was because he identified his party with all that was best and safest for the general welfare of the people. the progress of the country. and the advancement of her civilization. By disposition. as well as from conviction. he was a conservative of that form of government and that distribution of its functions which under the Federal Constitution can alone render permanent the blessings of popular government. At the same time. he was a pronounced radical in his conviction that all power emanates from the people. and that the administration. of government can never be safe and successful unless it be conformable to the wishes and opinions of the people as expressed by their representatives. and that the regular. orderly. and authentic expression of public opinion was obligatory at all times upon the legislative and the executive departments of the Government. Such exalted principles qualify and modify partisanship into patriotism and teach the lesson that intensity of advocacy is at all times compatible with a just consideration for the convictions of an adversary. That was the preeminent characteristic of the political career of Judge CRISP. In the most excited and embittered contests over measures like those for the repeal of the election laws. or the different phases of the tariff discussion. he exhibited the highest qualities of leadership. but at the same time the fullest recognition of the same earnestness of conviction in his opponents. Without the brilliancy of oratory or the graces of rhetoric. his very earnestness and the manifest sincerity of his character became persuasive and convincing. and made him a natural leader and his party willing and enthusiastic followers. There was in his personality every element which made association pleasant and agreeable. With warmhearted geniality he won the affections. while his dignity of bearing impressed all who came within its influence. But there was no compromise of principle within his nature. what conscience approved. expediency could not compromise. It was that full and complete subordination of expediency to principle that carried into the Speakership the integrity of the judge and clothed the politician with the ermine of justice. It was natural that such a character should impress the people far beyond the borders of Georgia. hence his popularity was as widespread as his party. and in every State he won the respect and confidence alike of Democrats and Republicans. Citizensof every party recognized the purity and sincerity of that Ihopes for our beloved country when uttered by him upon being elected Speaker. No review of his public and private character would do justice to our departed friend which did not emphasize that unselfish devotion to duty which declined the appointment to the Senate by the governor of Georgia because he was more useful to his party at that time in the House. The seat in the Senate was the goal of all his hopes. the crown of his ambition. But the opportunity of his life came at a moment when duty to his party demanded its declension. He was equal to the sacrifice and set aside his personal promotion for the good of his party. There is a deep sadness in the fact that after such unselfish devotion to duty death should have robbed him of his reward. when tendered by the suffrages of the people of that great State of which he was a noble citizen and an honored Representative. My acquaintance with him was close and intimate. my confidence in his judgment. discretion. and ability was full and complete. He measured up to every occasion. and never was a flaw or crevice found in that armor of principle. integrity. and zeal for our beloved country. which enveloped him like a garment of praise."},{"1":"1896","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. the question involved in this amendment is one of more than passing importance. The Indian tribes of the United States assumed a different relation to the Government. or the Government assumed a different relation to the tribes. after the close of the civil war. In 1870. under what became generally known as the peace policy of General Grafit. a system of general education was attempted in connection with the work of Indian civilization. Thereafter the work of reducing Indian reservations from year to year to smaller compass progressed steadily. agencies were established upon reservations of certain definite and prescribed limits. army posts were established in the Indian country with a view to keeping the Indians within the limits of the reservations. It being manifest that the work of herding the Indians with the Army and confining them in idleness upon reservations would be interminable and fruitless unless accompanied by some process which would lead to their civilization. the General Government in 1870 issued an invitation to the Christian people of the country to cooperate with the Government in this work which seemed so important and so nearly allied to the plain demands of humanity. The invitation did not go out to the representatives of Mohammedan civilization. nor did the invitation extend to those who believe in the peculiar form of worship prevalent throughout India. It proceeded from the Executive of the nation in various ways to the people who believed in the methods of Christian civilization. without reference to church or creed. So nicely. so cordially. so handsomely. did the Christian spirit of thenation respond. that in 1873 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in his annual report to the Secretary of the Interior used this language: The question of the civilization of Indians reduced to its last analysis is twofold: First. whether the Government is willing to make sufficient appropriation to teach barbarous men how to live in a civilized way. and second. whether the expenditure of such an appropriation can be fairly made through the administration of persons fitted to become their teachers. Without suitable provision for the necessary expenditures. the best efforts of the best men will be comparatively futile. and with the most abundant provision that the resources of the nation can make. nothing will be accomplished worthy of the effort unless there can be found persons ready and fitted to go to these Indians. in the spirit of kindness and Christian love. with a faith in God. and a faith in man strong enough to sustain them amidst the degradation and perversities of barbarism. and cheer them on in the full conviction that no being made in Gods image is incapable of improvement. No effort for lifting the poor and degraded can succeed which is not guided by the enthusiasm which comes from this faith. The agent and his employees will not give full work without it. and the Indian will not thirowv off his suspicion and wake out of his indolence until he feels this touch of human sympathy. For this reason the Government is specially to be congratulated on the response which the Christian people of the country have made to the proposition of the President that they should take a certain supervision of Governnent labor for the Indians by nominating agents and furnishing employees suitable to represent the Government in its beneficent efforts with these tribes. as well as in sending missionaries and teachers for religious labor among them. Every report of the Indian Commissioner and of the various Commissioners from that time up to 1889 is in perfect harmony and accord with the theory and principle set forth in what I have just read from the Commissioners report of 1873. In 1889 the Commissioner of Indian Affairs concluded that it would be wise to give to the blanket Indians of the plains a higher form of education. and he mentioned. among other things. as alnost indispensable a knowledge of electricity and general philosophical propositions that should be given to this breechclout fellow in order to bring him into the pale of civilization in its highest and best aspect. Thereafter. in 1894. Congress seems to have determined upon a departure from the Indian policy established under the Administration of General Grant in 1870. Good reasons may be asserted in support of this departure. The work of Christian civilization had been steadily progressing and the time had probably approached when the Government school could be substituted for the Christian mission. Barbarism had been supplanted by a certain degree of civilization. Through the agency of this Christian endeavor. in which the people of all denominations participated. we had in some sections of the country witnessed the gratifying result of Indians whose parents had been savages accepting and discharging the responsibilities of American citizenship. That period having arrived. in the judgment of the Government it seemed eminently proper that a system of national education should be supplied which would endure through time and be at the disposal of these new citizens as they came into the enjoyment of the birthright of American citizenship. But the Government was confronted with the necessity of acting in good faith with the people who had undertaken the work of assisting in this civilizing process. From the pockets of charity all over this broad land. from Jew and from Gentile. there had been buildings erected. educational institutions established and partially maintained throughout the years that had passed. In conformity with this invitation Christian men had preceded the armies of the Republiiinto the midst of the regions where the savage prevailed and made it possible to conquer and invade without the aid or the necessity for bloodshed. Therefore. in view of the vast energy of the Christian people of the country. invested in obedience to the request of the Government. it appeared to fairminded and just men that this new departure should be made with due regard for the kindly impulses of those who had pioneered the ways of civilization. Instantly to cut off all Government support to pioneer missions would not only involve injustice to the kindly spirited people who had erected them. but a gross and glaring injustice. involving evident principles of inhumanity to the unfortunate children who. after meager education. would thus be thrown out upon the prairies or in the woods to mingle again in savage life. The Secretary of the Interior in the report for 1894 manifestly partook of this humane and just judgment which commended itself to impartial men. regardless of their political affiliations or their religious inclinations. I find in the report of the Secretary for 1894 the following statement: The contract schools are now the subject of general discussion. I agree fully with those who oppose the use of public money for the support of sectarian schools. But this question should be consideredpractically. The schools have grown up. M)oney has been invested in their construction at a time xvhen they were recognized as wise instrumentalities for the accomplishment of good. I do not think it proper to allow the intense feeling of opposition to sectarian education which is showing itself all over the land to induce the Department to disregard existiiig conditions. We need the schools now. or else we need a large appropriation to build schools to take their place. It would scarcely be just to abolish them entirelyto abandon instantly a policy so long recognized. My own suggestion is that they should be decreased at the rate of not less than 20 per cent a year. Thins. in a few years more. they would cease to exist. and duriuis this tim the Bureau would gradually be prepared to do without them. while they might gather strength to continue without Government aid. This is the policy wvhich is now controlling the Department. and unless it is changed by legislation it wvill be continued. The decrease in the appropriation for the present fiscal year is 20 per cent. It is now proposed by the provisions of the bill absolutely to disregard moral or legal obligations to the generous. humane. and kindhearted people over this country who continued this system throughout a period extending for nearly a quarter of a century. Further still. it is proposed absolutely to deprive of any possibility of education in any form under Government auspices or Government aid in the neighborhood of 4.000 Indian children who have been for a series of years carefully educated and looked after in contract schools. At the Cur dAlene Reservation in the State of Idaho there is no Government school. There is not even a Government shed into which the children could be driven after the Government. had abandoned them in the manner proposed by the bill. The same is true of the Flatied Agency in the State of Montana. tI e Tongue River Agency in the same State. the Turtle Mountain Reservation in the State of North Dakota. and the Puyallup Reservationin the State of Washington. Those agencies have an aggregate of 2.139 pupils. for whom the Government can not in the very nature of things make any provision. So the passage of the bill in its present form would ivolve. as I suggestte yesterday. one of two thingseither the abandonment by the United States of its duties to those wards of the Government. of its duty to human civilization. and their return to the ways of barbarism. from which we have been endeavoring turough various ways and agencies to drag them. or it would leave upon charity a burden which properly belongs to the Government. I submit that as to those agencies where the Government has no facilities whatever for schools. the bill as it stands is inequitable and unjust to the Indian tribe� to whom we owe certain definite obliga tions. But it is suggested that an appropriation of $100.000 is made in the bill for the purchase of additional buildings which may now be in existence. In reply to that it is quite sufficient to refer to the last report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. whereby it is made to appear that if the Government schools. the contract schools. and the charity schools receiving no Government aid have their capacity taxed to the utmost. not to exceed 60 per cent of the Indian pupils can be provided for. If all the facilities now existing only accommodate an enrollment of 60 per cent of the pupils. if it is to require a million and a half dollars to supply the necessary educational facilities to accommodate all. I ask in the name of reason how between now and the 1st day of next July you are going to provide the necessary facilities with the paltry sum of $100.000? The amendment proposes to continue the policy outlined by the Secretary of the Interior in his report for 1894. to continue to diminish from year to year the aid to contract schools until the year 1899. and in the meantime the Secretary of the Interior is directed to provide facilities for the education of the Indian children independent of contract schools. This humane policy regarding not only the duties of the Government to the Indians. but likewise its apparent obligation to the good Christian people throughout this country who have assisted in Indian civilization. is sought to be abandoned. and in the abandonment of the policy we propose to abandon the Indians. to abandon those children. and let them out of the schools to resume the blanket. to return to th Indian tepee. to fish and hunt for a living. without any educatiohial advantages. I do not think that this proposed policy is in accordance with the dictates of honesty or humanity. It is suggested that because some of the contract schools were inaugurated and have been partially maintained under denominational control therefore some injury will follow to the Indian chilaren committed to their care. This suggestion comes from men who know least about the Indian. I do not know of any form of Christianity which can be injected into a North American Indian to the detriment of the Indian. No creed has been sufficiently vicious to injuriously affect the savages whom we have corralled upon the reservations. While upon the floor on this subject I call attention to the fact that it is proposed to strike down the Lincoln Institution and the Hampton School. I presume because of certain clauses in the constitution of the one or its organic act. and in the reports of the superintendent of the other. Here is the seriously objectionable feature urged against the Lincoln Institution. It was incorporated under an act of the legislature of Pennsylvania. approved May 9. 1866. Section 3 of that act provides: The affairs and concerns of the said Lincoln Institution shall be conducted by a board of managers consisting of 30 ladies and a board of council consisting of 30 gentlemen. of which board the bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the diocese together with the rectors of the churches which shall be represented in the board of managers shall be ex officio members. Section 4 provides thatApplicants may be admitted without regard to their religious belief. but the inmates shall. in all cases. have respect for the faith of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States. and submit to the religious exercises o the ousehold. which shall always be in accordance with the belief of that church. and all children received under 12 years of age shall be trained in that faith. How can it injuriously affect an Indian. the son or daughter of a savage. to be instructed in some form of religion. and particularly the religion taught by the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States? If taken there under the age of 12 I should say that the doctrines of that church ought to be taught to a young Indian as regularly as the A B Cs. and for this reason: That church teaches a doctrine which is the unit of modern civilizationrespect for parents. respect for the marriage relation. and in thus providing for the establishment of respect for the home you destroy some of the most vicious elements that have led to the continued barbarous condition of the Indians. Again. it is proposed to strike down the Hampton Home in Virginia."},{"1":"1895","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"And also to Kansas. Now. what was the reason that forced the Government of the. United States to. take these people from the interior of that Territory and carry them sometimes a distance of 200 miles with their witnesses. or the witnesses against them. at public expense for the purpose of trying a certain class. of. crimes punishable by hard labor or by death? What was the occasion for it? Well. there were: some reasons for that course which may have: been in existence at the time we. resorted to it and mayhave been somewhat persuasive if notsubstantial for a course of that kin But at the time that system was adopted very few white men comparatively were in the Territory. and it was a matter of impossibility. as was then supposed. to get good. honest. and fair juries for the trial of men for their lives and upon penitentiary accusations. So we went off to the neighboring States. to Kansas. to Texas. to Arkansas . and attached the Indian Territory in certain boundaries which were marked to these various outside courts in order that offenders against the laws of the United States might be taken to these places and tried before juries of the different States assembled in the district courts of the United States. ir. Dawes in the report refers to a process which has been going onforseveral years amongst all those Indian tribesby which the white population has been continually invited into the Indian country in great numbers. particularly the farming population. There! is another population that has gone in there. traders and speculators. and still another. criminals against public justice in all parts of the United States. who have made a rendezvous of the Indian Territory because the extradition laws that obtain there. if there are any at all. are entirely ineffectual. But the main body of the population that has been drawn into the Indian country amongst the white classes has been assembled there by the employment on the part of the Indians of those persons to go upon their places as faimers. upon some contract or understanding with the possessors of the farms. the Indian government charging to the Indian landlord a license tax (I believe $10 a year is the tax usually imposed there) for the privilege of hiring a white man to come into the Territory and work upon his farm. In this way there has been. of course. a very large importaton of white men intd that country and for very good reasons. They were not intruders. they were not refugees from justice. They were men who went there under a lawful contract which the Government of the United States recognized through: its agents as being a proper contract. When they got there with their families they settled down upon the different holdings where the Indians were residing. and after they had been there for a year and made some little improvement. putting up a cabin. or opening a truck patch. or something of. that. kind. planting a little orchard. perhaps.. they wanted to stay another and another. and they have become fixtures in that country. They are really permanent occupants of that country. When the Indians come to us with complaints about intruders. they do not include that class of people. They include only the men who go there otherwise than under engagements of employment from them or engagements with the railroad companies or the companies that are there cutting timber or. mining coal. Thus. Mr. President. the Indian. policy of playing landlord instead of going upon his farm and working it has really drawn into that country a mass of white people who are absolutely uncontrollable. Who would think of undertaking to go. into the Indian Territory with an army or with policemen or marshals and expel all of those white men from that country? You can not conceive of such a thing being possible- As fast as you get them beyond the borderthere being no law against their going into the Territorythey flock back again. The fact is that it is a moral and physical impossibility to free that country of the presence of the white people. We can not select between those who are intruders and those who. are not. and at the. bidding of the Indians. say. I will pick this man to stay and that man to. go. The Indian government or the Indian people can not make a selection of that kind. That. they must all go or they must all stay is the result of the situation. Under such circumstances how is justice to be administered among the men who are innocently. legally. and properly in the Indian Territory? What instrumentalities of government and what right. too. have our people. under the Constitution of the United States. in that country? They have not gone! there to expose themselves to Indian judges. for we have never permitted the Indian courts to take any jurisdiction or cognizance of them. They went there for the purpose of serving their own interests under contracts and agreements with the Indians. whichwere considered to be entirely legitimate. to which neither the Indians nor the Government ever objpcted. If we should consider only the necessities of the better part of the white people who are in that Territory we would not hesitate. of course. finding them in any part of the United States. and saying that the Constitution and the laws of the.United States should attend them in this Territory. for it is a Territory of the United States. and that we should there exercise our right and our duty as prescribed in the. Constitution of the country to make all laws necessary for the disposal and government and control of the territory of the United States. That does not mean territory the. title of which is in the Government of the United States by any means. It means territory that is included within our political boundaries. It means that portion of the domain of the United States. over which the Constitution prevails. It makes no difference what may be the nature of the title of the Indian to his land. no man in this country can have such a title to a tract of land. no corporation. no body of citizenship. no tribe of Indians can have such a title to a tract of land as to oust the eminent domain of the United States even in respect of the actual allodium. the actual title. I need not remind Senators that that has been decided in the Supreme Court of the United States in the railroad- cases. where the Indians made the question and brought it to the Supreme Court of the United States whether Congress had the right to grant the right of condemnation to any more than the two roads that were to cross each other in the Cherokee country. as prescribed in the treaty of 1866. That question came up and was settled. So. as to the very inherent right of the Government itself in the land. it has been decided that we possess it as a sovereignty. We can go and condemn the Indian lands to public uses of the United States just as well as my land in Alabama can be condemned to the public uses of that State. Their property. I care not how sacred we may call the title. is subjected to all the public control that mine is. Yet I am a citizen of a sovereign State of this country. and these men are mere occupants of territory. Now. we have a still further control over every body of men who are assembled in the United States within our limits. whether upon our lands or upon the lands of somebody else. whether upon the lands of the Government or lands in private ownership. whether in a city. a county. or a State. more particularly where there is no intervention of State sovereignty to prohibit or to restrain our powers. When we find a set of men or a community in a territory in the occupancy of a region of country which we have deeded to them. it makes no difference how solemn and sacred may be the character of the deed. our political power over that community remains in the Government of the United States. The Supreme Court of the United States also decided upon that in the Georgia case. They said that these are not sovereignties at all. they are mere dependent tribal governments. and that the laws of the United States enacted in pursuance of the Constitution that do not disturb some actually vested right prevail to the exclusion of all other laws that may oppose them. That is a very important point. It shows that the right of civil government -in the hands of the Government of the United States extends through all of its borders. and that it can be interrupted only to the extent of some personal vested right in some individual or by some constitutional provision that restrains the operation and powers of the Federal Government within the States. The provision empowering the Congress of the United States to regulate the disposal of the Territories of the United States has reference not merely to the public lands contained within the territorial limits. but also all matters relating to human government. It covers the whole subject. That has been frequently decided. In fact. we scarcely pass a law in regard to any Indian tribe at all that does not include that provision. We hold tribes to their reservations where we make grants of land to them. from which they may take estates in severalty. leaving another part as communal land. We say to these people.  You shall not sell your land. you shall not mortgage it for twenty years. We say to them. You shall keep upon the reservation. you shall not go abroad from that reservation without a license from some officer of the Government. the agent. or someone else. you shall not buy any intoxicating drinks. no man shall go among you to trade with you. to traffic with you about the earnings of your labor. unless he has a license from the Government of the United States. And yet you will own the land. You are locked up upon the lands that you own by the powers of the Government of the United States. and you are required to remain there because there is no right that stands against the power of the Government of the United States to require you to do that thing. So when government was given to the Congress of the United States by these provisions of the Constitution it means plenary government. It does not mean government with the consent of the Indians. it does not mean a power that the Congress of the United States can abdicate at its pleasure. It does not mean a power that the Congress of the United States can transfer into an Indian legislature. It means power to be exercised here. absolutely and completely exercised in thiu Chamber and in the other House. and through the assistance of the President. Mr. President. I grant you that we have a great manyprovisions upon our statute book which have resulted from the necessities of the situation. in which we have not come down to the exercise of our actual power. but have made agreements with these Indian tribes. beginning with the first treaty that was made in New England and coming down to the present time. suited to the circumstances and conditions that were then present. never. however. yielding the sovereign power of the white people of this country into the hands of the Indian. The sovereignty which was established over this country by the men who first planted their feet upon the shores of Massachusetts was a sovereignty which has ripened from time to time into such higher degrees of authority as it was able to take to itself. and it has never been upset. ithas never been admitted away. it has never been surrendered. and can not be surrendered under the Constitution of the United States. because Congress can not abdicate its power to govern. according to the full measure of its jurisdiction. all people in the United States. wherever the Constitution extends. who are subject to the authority of this Government. We commenced making treaties with them. colonial establishments in the United States. using the name of the British Crown. made treaties with them. But even those treaties were not with sovereign. separate. and independent powers. they were not made by the Parliament of Great Britain. they were made by the colonies. I do not know of any British colony in the world which has a right to make a treaty with a sovereign power. nor do I remember in the history of Great Britain and of her colonies any instance of that kind. Perhaps there may be some here who are wiser than I am in historyand there are many. I knowwho can cite me to an instance in which this has been done. The colonies of Great Britain in the United States. the fourteen original colonies as they were. including Canada. made their own treaties with the respective Indian tribes. and sometimes there was serious complaint by one colony that a treaty had been made by another to its disadvantage. but enough appears in the history of this country to show that these treaties were not made with independent and sovereign powers. but that they were made in the nature of contracts or agreements for the purpose of tiding over and getting rid of circumstances which surrounded the people at the time and which made these agreements necessary. Look back over your own book of treaties with the Indians. You have two volumes of them here. a large number of treaties made with a great number of different tribes and on different occasions. Although they were formerly brought before the Senate of the United States for ratification by a vote of twothirds. they are not treaties which are promulgated by an exchange of ratifications. The terms of all these Indian treaties were and are that they shall take effect when they were ratified by a vote of the Senate. which. under our Constitution. means a twothirds vote. but with no exchange of ratifications. no formalities. I refer to this. Mr. President. for the purpose of showing the wisdom of that very provident actI think it was of 1867. if I have the date right. we all remember the act. whether I quote it correctly by date or notin which the Congress of the United States determined by an act of law that there should hereafter be no more treaties made with Indian tribes. That merely took jurisdiction away from the Senate of the United States to ratify and confirm one of these Indian agreements. that was all. We took it away from the Senate and transferred it into the hands of Congress. and that is the whole effect of it. We have gone on and made a great many agreements since that time. and perhaps more than before. but they come here to this body and find their way into bills. such as we have here today. which ratify and confirm these agreements. There is one of them ratified in this very bill we are now discussing. not by a vote of the Senate under the treatymaking power. but by the legislative power. Now. we ask ourselves the question. so far as we are concerned. have those treaties which have been heretofore ratified been a part of the supreme law of the land in the same sense that a treaty ratified between the United States and Great Britain or France is a part of the supreme law of the land after ratifications have been exchanged and the treaty promulgated? Surely not. They stand upon an entirely different basis. When Congress passed the act it did not take away from the Senate of the United States a part of its constitutional power to ratify a treaty. it merely determined that these agreements. reaching back to the first one which was made in that form. depended for their sanction solely upon acts of Congress. and not upon acts of the Executive making a treaty through his agents with the Indian tribes. We must stand in this generation of men and justify our conduct upon the Constitution of the United States. and whenever it is necessary for the preservation of life. liberty. and law that we should act in respect to these various Indian agreements. even in contravention of the guardianship which we have assumed over the Indians. the responsibilities which attend it and the benign spirit of justice and mercy which has always followed it. stand here and justify us in taking ground. all the ground that is necessary. for the purpose of preserving the lives of these people in the Indian country. We have the power. and we can not abdicate it. we can not throw it away. there is no authority to do it. We must exercise it. or else we must take the responsibility and the blame of allowing crime to go unpunished. because we want to pay some unnecessary deference to a condition of law. as it is called. in those countries which estops and forbids us from doing justice to our own people. to our own civilization. and to our own country. I maintain that there is no such impediment at all. All the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States which define in any respect whatsoever the nature of the government of an Indian tribe show that they never had the capacity to make a treaty with us. that they never were possessed of any sovereign or independent status that we should even recognize without destroying our own authority as a people. without permitting them to set up an imperium in imperio. where they would be absolutely independent of us. That is exactly the pretense which is being encouraged here day by day by our weak course in dealing with these subjects. I call it  a weak course. because it is a course which pays deference to a sentiment and an opinion. instead of to truth. to justice. to right. and to correct dealing. We yield to sentiment merely. when we ought to exercise in all justice and in all mercy and with all proper strength the strong right arm of the law. I have not by any means exhausted the subject. Mr. President. I have merely touched upon the margin. but I have gone over this to show that in the event some one should find. or think that he could find. any treaties which we have formulated and signed with the Five Tribes and with this fragmentary Quapaw Agency or bunch of IndiansI will call them that. for that is the only way to describe themif he thinks that he can find some engagement of ours which shuts us out from the exercise of our sovereign powers as a Government in that Territory. I think when he comes to consider the nature of the engagements thus made and the tribes with which they were made. he will realize two propositions. The first is settled by the Supreme Court of the United States. that we can repeal any treaty by an act of Congress as to every purpose of it and every effect of it which does not confer a vested right. which is protected by other provisions of the Constitution. and the next would be that these engagements with the Indians are not in themselves anything more than temporary agreements for the purpose of providing as well as we could for them and ourselves. dealing with a people who were savages. progressing into civilization. but who. at the time we were dealing with them did not have a proper conception of what was their duty to the civilization of this age and to the great Government under which we live. We have a character of court there which we have established by law. which I will merely advert to. Senators will all remember about those courts. They are called Indian courts. They exist in almost every tribe in the United States. An agent appointed by the Government of the United States will assemble to his assistance two or three chiefs or headmen in a particular agency where he may be. and they will sit in judgment in their own way and pass sentences. to be approved ouly by the agent. not reaching to life. not reaching to capital punishment. but they pass sentences upon Indians for a great many minor offenses. the definition of which is taken from the Indian traditions and Indian laws. We take their laws and their traditions in these little piepoudre courts. and we administer them through an agent. associating with him two or three Indians. whom he himself selects. They execute these laws among the Indians. They might be called the first outbudding of justice. and yet to the extent of the penalties they impose upon the Indians. it is just as much and effectually a law as if it was enacted by the Congress of the United States or through th epower of any State government. That is one class of Indian courts we have in that country. which exist almost everywhere. That is not the class of courts which exists among the Five Civilized Tribes. That class of courts does exist amongst the Indians of the Quapaw Agency. and there are quite a considerable number of Indians there. some eight or nine tribes. They are the richest Indians in the world. They have more property per capita. I suppose. than any people in the world. I think that as an entire community they may be considered as the wealthiest people in the world. and yet they have not a law. no legislature. no judges. or anything of the kind. They associate sometimes with the agent and sometimes by themselves in the trial of questions of right and agreement between two members of their own tribe. When they come to administer the law we pay respect to it. we do not interfere with it. they enforce it. and therefore they enforce it under our authority. That system prevails now in that part of this country to which I propose to bring the laws of the United States and the judges of the United States. Then we will goand I have remarked before that I shall not go over that ground in detailto the lowest grade of Indians. the Seminoles. who have no written law. They have a code of laws. but it is not written. unless. perhaps. a few items of it may be written down for the purpose of more convenient promulgation. They have. for all. some very enlightened men in the Seminole country. they are rather a strong body of Indians. a very intelligent people. too. and very warlike in their disposition. We then go to the Creeks. who have a little higher range of information. not civilization. They have the laws which I have described. a few written statutes. a few written original or elementary propositions. and they have their judges and their courts. We then go to the Chickasaws and Choctaws. and we find a still better development. and perhaps in the Cherokee country yet a better development than there is among the Chickasaws and Choctaws by their system of tribal government. and particularly in the judicial department. They have been in operation. through the aid of the white people. protected by the Government of the United States. not interfered with by the intruders. as they are called. since 1836 or 1837. down to the present time. and. instead of haying built up permanently and established a government there that is capable of taking care of human life and property. they are degenerating from time to time. from day to day. a degeneracy not caused by the evil influence of white men upon them. but it is because they have found that a great many of them can live by speculation. by land grabbing. by their wits. by playing landlord and having white men hired to work for them. and they can go off on the tipple. and indulge in gambling. and in all those sports of which the Indian is so fond. They are being demoralized by their very opportunities and their wealth. until we have had to take hold of them. as I observed before. by creating tribunals entirely outside of the country to deal with them in their crimes committed against white people or crimes committed by white people against them. After emigrating from Alabama. Mississippi. Florida. Georgia. and Tennessee to the country west of the Mississippi River. these Five Tribes. of which I am speaking now particularly. established the governments about which I have been talking. When the civil war came on they participated in that civil war. taking sides .in it as they chose. according to their convictions. The nations were divided against themselves upon that question. and no one of the nations went wholly or bodily either in favor of the Confederate or the Union cause. After that war was over there came a reconstruction amongst them. That reconstruction involved two questions. The first was what the Indians would be willing to do. what they would agree to do in respect of the renewal of their loyalty to the Government of the United States. and the second was. what they would do with the colored population amongst them. whom they had largely and chiefly owned as slaves. for the Creeks. the Cherokees. the Choctaws. the Chickasaws. and the Seminoles were all slaveowning tribes. They did not have any compunction at all about the putting of the negro into bondage. The negro question was treated in these various treaties separately. that is to say. it was put into such shape as suited the Government of the United States. and the Indians were willing to agree to it. in respect of their becoming citizens of the tribe of which they had formerly been slaves. and also in respect of their political rights and place in the different Territories and the different tribal lands which they might occupy. Negroes abounded in the Creek country more than they did in any other in proportion to the number of the population. In the treaty of 1866 between the Creek Indians and the Government of the United States is article 10. which provides: The Creeks agree to such legislation as Congress and the President of the United States may deem necessary for the better administration of justice and the protection of the rights of person and property within the Indian Territory: Provided. however. (That) said legislation shall not in any manner interfere with or annul their present tribal organizations rights. laws. privileges. and customs. The Creeks also agree that a general council. consisting of delegates elected by each nation or tribe lawfully resident within the Indian Territory. may be annually convened in said Territory. which council shall be organized in such manner and possess such powers as are hereinafter described. I have read the latter part of that tenth article for the purpose of calling the attention of the Senate to a common consent among all of these Five Tribes to a Territorial government. The generalcouncil which is spoken of here had never existed. had never even been in contemplation. so far as we have any historical information on the subject. prior to the time of the making of these treaties. They were all made in and about the same time. the same year. and perhaps in almost the same month."},{"1":"1894","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. my remarks on this occasion will be brief. and perhaps I should not have spoken at all but for my abiding interest in the progressive enrichment of the ational Statuary Hall. i new Hampshire must be heartily congratulated upon her admirable selection of.the historic characters she has chosen to commemorate. The Granite State justly claims much in presenting Webster and Stark as her sons. but they will be greeted with equal homage and affection by the whole nation. p Bostion critic oce stated that The principal wealth of ew Hampshire is great men and water power. but instead of keeping them herself she squanders them on Massachusetts. and Webster was one of those free gifts. The critic should have added that no State can better afford o permit another State to replevy what rightly belongs it it than Massachusetts. The number of American statesmen and heroes already represented in that superb and venerated hall. with the long list of worthies sure to find a place there. but still held in reserve by States embarrassed by co large a number entitled to selection or by worthies not yet fully ripe. arb sufficient to give abundant assurance that this lare assemblage of statues will be of unrivalled public interest. a distinctive honor to the several States. and wholly worthy of the Republic. The majestic form of Daniel Webster has been so frequently presnted in bronze and marble. and his life and character so often portrayed by those who best knew his intellectual endowments. and were best qualified to appreciate him as a lawyer and as an orat r. or as a a tae and Cabinet minister. that for me it is a dubious task to a a word to ehat has been more fity spoken long ago. or that will be by others here today. Probably only a small number of those present today ever saw or heard Mr. Webster speak in either branch of Congress. but no man who ever looked upon him would fail to discover that he was a man of no common mold. and it would be safe to say that. in the presence of any sea of upturned faces of Americans. his intellectual primacy would not be contested. It was my fortune to listen to a political speech of M[r. Webster in 1840. at Baltimore. the same year at Orford. N. H.. and years after in Faneuil Hall. Again. being in Boston. and learning thatan important patent case was to be on trial in the United States districat court. where Mfr. Choate was the counsel on one side and Mr. Webster on the other. I lost no time in securing a seat in the courthouse. Different in manner asfnight be supposed that of Achilles and Ulysses would be. both greatly interested me.-as both appeared to be exerting their utmost professional skill to win the case. To me the treat seemed worth a journey across the continent. I was in Washington in 1836.1840.1848. and 1852. and of course saw Mr. Webster. but never heard him speak at any length in the Senate. I may. however. be pardoned for mentioning one or two occurrences that came under my observation more than forty years ago. though of little importance. and will trench very little upon your time. On one of these early Washington visits I was present at an allnight session of the Senate in the old Senate Chamber. As the hours grew late all got tired. and Mir. Webster bent his head over his desk. with his face pillowed on his hands. while another Senator in a rambling speech. and suddenly enthused with rapturous admiration for Mr. Webster. pronounced him The statesman! the historianl the philosopher! the poet! -when Mr. Webster. halfway raising his head. in a gruff voice ejaculated. Enoughl enough! Senator Butler of South Carolina evidently thought so too. but had some difficulty in persuading the jubilant member to take his seat. A day or two in advance of the meeting of the Whig national convention in Baltimore in 1852. to which I was a delegate. to nominate a Presidential candidate. I visited Washington. and was invited. with others. by Mr. Webster. then Secretary of State. to dinner. As it was not my intention to support Mr. Webster in the convention the invitation -was rather regretted. but being told by a friend that such an invitation here from the President or the Secretary of State was never to be declined. it was accepted. There were about a dozen at the table. Mrs. Webster being the only lady. Mr. Webster appeared in his blue coat with gilt buttons. light buff vest. low shoes. and white silk half hose. and led the conversation most happily. whether grave or gay. Upon leaving the diningroom the gentlemen all retuned to the drawingroom. and there Mr. Webster was so gracious and attractive in general and special conversation as to quickly place everyone at his ease. especially as he did not even allude to the coming convention. By way of inquiry as to the preparation of his speeches. I ventured to say I had heard it statdd that among the passages often quoted one had been conceived by him many years prior to utterance. and referred to his picturesque description of the power of England. Whose morming drumbeat. following the sun and keeping company with the hours. circles the earth with the con= tinuons and unbroken strain of the martial airs of England. He promptly replied. As a mere fact. it is true that. while visiting Quebec several years before the speech of 1884. one morning I arose early. as is my wont. and walked out up on the ramp arts of the city. where I soon heard the morning drumbeat. It.then occurred to me that this. a little later. would be repeated at MKontreal. then at Toronto. again in Columbia. and so on round the worid. adding. Oh. I never pretended to be one of the inspired geniuses. I bring forth nothing without labor. If not precisely at the time. ithas cost labor at sometime. When I left his residence. then on D street NW.. Mr. Webster seemed to have grown greater to me. ind. unlike some socalled great men.-who. as you get nearer to them. become slender. if not mediocre. he appeared like a Doric temple. to loom up more grandly the nearer approached. The next day. however. I did not vote in his favor at the convention. the speech of March 7. 1850. being insurmountable. butl ever felt glad..proud- that Daniel Webster was born. lived. and died an American. I"},{"1":"1893","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I also present a preamble and resolutions recently passed by the State Horticultural Society of Oregon. As the resolutions refer to a subject of very great importance to the people of the Pacific coast generally. and especially to the people of California. Oregon. and Idaho. I beg the -Senate to permit me to cite the petition a little more at length than usual. It is in regard to the prune industry on the Pacific coast. The resolutions aver that this industry has already become one of very great importance on the Pacific coast and can attain immense proportions as soon as the trees now planted shall fully bear fruit. the product being equal to 150.000.000 pounds per annum in California and about half as much more in Oregon .and Washington. They recite that the national result of such production will be to cause prices to rule low from home competition. so that the grower can not expect more than fair wages for labor and rent for the capital invested. and that the prunegrower suffers from distrust that the duty now collected by the Government will be removed and thus subject him to ruinous foreign competition. The petitioners present these facts to the consideration of the Congress of the United States and memorialize Congress and the President of the United States that the present duty on prune importations shall be sustained for the following reasons. briefly stated: First. That such protection will encourage an industry of great importance to both producer and consumer. Second. That our cured prunes. under such protection. are acquiring an excellence of a high order that will increase if the industry is fostered. Third. That our dried product is far more cleanly and healthful than The common foreign prune. Fourth. That the law of supply and demand must regulate prices on the fair basis of the needs of both producer and consumer in the home market of the future. The petitioners further state that they fully believe the result of encouragement of the prune industry will be much greater skill in producing and curing prunes and in developing new varieties. and that the Pacific coast will soon be able to export very largely of a superior quality of such product for the best trade of England as well as to the Americas and Asia. I move that the petition be referred to the Committee on Finance."},{"1":"1892","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"This statement was made in 1887. and the increase has been even greater since than before. Now. lot us see how Great Britain increased her output of cotton yarn. To continue the quotation: The growth between these Indian mills and the farther East is thirteenfold in eleven years. and in our case it has diminished from 29.000.000 to 26.000.000 pounds. Mr. President. the cottongrowers of the South can see where their market for cotton has gone. Great Britain ought. in the nature of things. to increase equally with India. India increased thirteenfold. Great Britain lost from 29.000.000 pounds to 26.000.000 pounds. It would be a very proper thing to inquire whether there is anything in the productive power of the Bombay mills to account for this change. Of course the fact is that they have a cheaper rate of labor. That is what I call the attention of the American wheatgrower to. Theforeign producer has cheaper labor than the American wheatgrower. whether he does the labor with his own hands or hires his neighbors sons to do it for him. But when you take the cost of mills or of working expenses and effective labor. add when you take what is actually paid for labor. a pound of yarn costs more today there than the same pound does here. How is it that the cheaper producer is being displaced by the dearer producer ? That is what he asks. It is clear when we sell a bale of yarn. and we sell It in Shanghai or Hongkong. at a dollarsay. worth 4s. 6d.He sells it for silver in Chinawhen exchanged into gold money it comes down to 3s. Id. That explains how the dearer producer is driving the cheaper roducer out of the market. If the Senator from Delaware who oes me the honor to listen does not understand that system of finance I will give him an opportunity to look at this article. and I think when he has completed the investigation he will thoroughly understand it."},{"1":"1891","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I shall vote for this bill because I believe that the laborers who worked at a certain scale of labor are entitled to be paid according to the law which the Government enacted to regulate the times of their labor. AsI understand this matter. the Congress of the United States. which had the right to do it. made eight hours the yardstick of a days labor. and after getting ten hours. instead of eight. have not paid for the labor they obtained according to the measure which they themselves provided. I simply call attention to the fact that when there were creditors of this Government who bought bonds of the Government at sixty or seventy cents upon the dollar. with a law declaring that they might be payable in coin or legaltender notes. this Government has not only paid debts in coin which were payable in paper. but has devised the regulations of its Treasury and its acts of Congress so as to make coin 1 mean gold. and. in addition to that. has gone into the market at a time when it was attempting to enhance the price of its bonds and paid premiums of 20 per cent. upon them. and at times as much as 25 and 28 per cent. in addition in gold. and yet manyof the same persons who obtained and carried out this policy now object to paying the laborer according to the contract which the Government made. I can not be a party to any such repudiation of the obligations of this Government. and shall therefore vote for this bill. Mr. President. while I am awarethat thebillis notinthebestshape. it is in the best shape that the friends of the measure can get it. and I believe it will result in men being paid what was fairly due to them according to the law in such case made and provided."},{"1":"1890","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I regret exceedingly that my friend from Veimont has not read this report.

The statement in the reportI am simply referring to Mr. Wrights reportis that a steelrail manufacturer. taking the material from the time he begins to use it until the time he turns it out as a steel rail. pays in the first mill $1.54 a ton to labor. That does not include a few cents paid to superintendence. etc. The raw material of his labor is steel ingots in the first place. He begins with them. There are oil and fuel and other things which enter into the composition to make it up. I have just called the attention to what amount of labor was involved in the production of a ton of steel ingots that comes from the ore. and that shows that a ton of steel ingots paid about $1.92 for labor."},{"1":"1889","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I should say so. I do not know whether he ever worked in a mill or not. I have not that knowledge. He gives the names of the manufacturers and everybody from whom he obtained the inibrmation.

So the cost of manufacturing a pound of wool in England is 5.59 cents greater than it is in the United States. In .England the wages of weavers in woolen mills (mo.stly girls) are from 12 to 15 shillings per week. scarcely more than onehalf the earnings of the American weaver in the same goods. but the English weaver tends one loom only. and the American tends two. The output of the American weaver is about 300 yards per weekthe output of the English weaver per week is 105 yards. making the average cost for weaving American goods 2.65 cents per yard. and for I English weaver 2.56 cents peryard. English cost of weaving per pound. 6.07 cents. Massachusetts cost. 6.90 cents. The small difference is due to difference in Width of the cloth. the English article being 54 inches in width and the American article 50 inches in width. All. this plainly shows that if we had free wool we could produce woolen cloth at 64.31 cents per pound which would cost in England 69.90 cents per pound to produce. I think there is nothing wanting to the demonstration that we could exceed the world in the production of woolen goods with free wool. and even with a different duty levied upon wool. the manufacturing interests of this country would take a great start forward and would be able to furnish goods much cheaper and give more employment to labor. The manufacturers. the woolen people. who apppeared before the Finance Committee gave some testimony that I regard as very valuable concerning the present method of levying duties and the present du4es which are levied upon the raw wools that are imported into this coun. try.

There is no doubt much truth in what the gentleman from New York has said of the gloomy prospects now lowering over this country and the financial distress everywhere to be found. but is it not true. sir. that we must look to other causes than the one that he suggests? The comparatively meager appropriations in this bill. $15.000.000 though they may be. will have but little effect in lightening distress or bringing relief to the people of this country. We must look to other and higher causes. and may we not find some cause for these difficulties the people suffer from in the fact that the people are afraid of those who are now dominant over themafraid of the party now in power? Is it not true that there has been so much of promise and so little of performance upon the part of the Democratic party that the people look to the future with distrust and foreboding? Mr. Chairman. just to enumerate afew of the pledges that have been made to the people: In the first days of the present administration we were told by gentlemen here. my colleague most notably among the number. that now a new era was to begin. Heretofore. we were told. this Government had been run in the interest of men of wealth and the interest of the great monopolies. but now the people were to be considered in all of their interests. and as a proof of this he called our attention to the fact that the President was sympathizing with the settlers upon the frontier who were standing around the Territory of Oklahoma. but who had been kept out by a wicked Republican President. and he assured us that now the monopoliststhe cattle barons who had gone into the Territory under the rule of the Republican partywere to be turned out instanter and the settlers were to be at once allowed to go in. But a few days ago my colleague. with humiliating confession on his lips. was compelled to say to this House that all of those loudsounding promises and professions were untrue. that the same classes were infesting that Territory now--on the day he spokethat infested it a year ago. and that the same settlers were still standing upon the outside looking over into the land of promise which the Presidential order kept them from entering. while the cattle syndicates fattened and grew insolent on all that was good in the land. Again. Mr. Chairman. may it not be possible that the people are fearful that their currency is to be disturbed? My colleague aided in the election of this administration. and he told us at that time how we were all to be benefited. how all our people were to be made happy when the administration came into power. He told us thatthen his pet theories about the enlargement of the volume of currency would be put into operation. that the Democratic party much more completely sympathized with him and his party than did the Republican party. But. instead of that being true. even before the President had taken his seat he terribly disturbed all such prophecies by recommending that the silver element of our currency should be stricken down and that silver coinage should cease. Not content with that. in the very first report made by his Secretary of the Treasury the Secretary recommended that the greenbacks should be retired. destroying at once nearly six hundred millions of our currency. Then immediately after that. almost upon the very day of the meeting of Congress. in comes the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. MonBisON) with a proposition to disturb all the labor initerests of the country. No man knows where that will end. no man can tell where this disturbance is to cease. no man can forecast the future or the business operations of the future or his relations to them with the slightest degree of certainty. These gentlemen are content simply to produce change. to produce revolution in finance and in business. and under that fear of change the public mind is disturbed. The business enterprises of the country can not be carried on without capital. Those who have eapital are distrustful of the promises of the majority party and are distrustful of their proposed measures and policies. Men who have money are afraid to embark in business enterprises. knowing .that theadministrationis committed to the destruction of more than onethird of the entire circulation of the country. Others are afraid to engage in manufactures. because the tariff tinkers are abroad in the land. They can not tell when this party of tariff reform are to end their labors. or what manufacturing enterprises are to be stricken down. Hence. from this fear and distrust. the money by the millions of dollars is hoarded. is not permitted to go into use. and as a result business interests. manufacturing interests languish. the fire dies in the furnace and the forge. the factory and the mill is tenantless. while their late occupants are in the streets and the highways. swelling the ranks of the army of tramps that exist in this country today. largely because the Democratic party sits in the seat of power. and because the people are so distrustful of the manner in which. and the purposes for which. that power will be used."},{"1":"1885","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"I think that my friend. the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations. is mistaken. I think they represented to him that they expected and hoped to raise $800.000. that they had over $500.000 subscribed and they expected to increase it to $800.000. The fact is they had over $600.000 subscribed and $584.000 have bfeu actually paid. I repeat. they were In good faith when they asked for this loan. I thought they were too sanguine. I never dreamed when I advocated the loan that they would be able to repay it to the Treasury. I believe they were in good faith in thinking that they could pay it. or some portion of it. anticipating as they did that the receipts would be large. and that the whole world would flock to visit the exposition. Situated as it is. at one of the extremities of the Union. almost as remote as if it were in a foreign country. with a sparse population in the adjoining States. and one illy prepared to bear traveling or other expenses. I never dreamed that it would be selfsustaining. but I thought that it would be honestly mapaged. that it would pay its current expenses. and that what was realized beyond the current expenseswould go into the Treasury to the credit of the loan. and that the exposition would be a great and beneficial enterprise which would repay a bundredfold to the people of this country the paltry amount which was borrowed from the Treasury to carry it on and make it a success. Mr. President. I wish for a moment to indulge in some comparisons between this exposition and the one held at Philadelphia. There are represented inthis exposition fortysix States and Territories and twentyone foreign governments. 9The total space occupied in Philadelphia by the State exhibitions was 21.711 square feet. in New Orleans it is 327.198 square feet. It will be observed from the above that the actual area of space for exhibits at New Orleans is more than fifteen times that of the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. The area of the official buildings in Philadelphia was 2.505.789 square feet. in New Orleans it covers 2.726.305 square feet. The principal buildings at the international exhibition in New Orleans cover 2.370.855 square feet. in Philadelphia they covered 2.044.542 square feet. in London in 1862. 1.400.000 square feet. in Paris in 1878. 456.923 square feet. in Vienna in 1873. 430.500 square feet. and in the small bt brilliant exposition in Atlanta in 1881. 107.520 square feetless than onetwentieth that occupied by the New Orleans Exposition. and occupied and filled by actual exhibits. Now let me give a comparison of the cost of the various buildings erected by the management at New Orleans and Philadelphia. The buildings in Philadelphia cost $5.242.295. in New Orleans $989.211. or less than onefifth of that amount. Mr. President. much has been said %bout the improvements of the ground. My friend from New Jersey called attention to a fact. stated also in argument in another place. that the city of New Orleans subscribed but $100.000 to the exposition. and that $140.803 had been expended in the improvement of the public park of that city. in which the exposition is being held. and he called attention to what he said was an injustice that New Orleans should receive back from the improvement of her public par] a larger sum than she subscribed to the exposition. The improvement of the grounds upon which an exposition of this kind is to be held is as legitimate an expenditure as the erection of the necessary buildings. Let me call attention to the difference between the amount expended in the improvement of this unoccupied and waste space of ground called by courtesy a park. in which the exposition is held in New Orleans. and the immense amount expended on the beautiful Fairmount Park. opposite the city where the Senator resides and in sight of his home. At New Orleans the cost of the park improvement was $140.803. in Philadelphia. $922.782. Now. Mr. President. the city of New Orleans. he says. derives the benefit resulting from this improvement. Can it be taken away? This money is expended for grass plots. for gravel walks. for pavements. for grading. for cementing. for drainingall for the purpose of making this park beautiful and useful for this exposition. Can it be taken up and given to the Government? Do the Government needs require this park to be reduced to its original condition. that of a morass or wilderness. where all this work would be destroyed? Does the gentleman ask that. and was that done with Fairmount Park in 1876? Again. a large portion of the expenditure for the improvement of this park was for a wharf. This park is on the Mississippi River. The most convenient mode of reaching the fair is by steamboat running from New Orleans some six miles up to the park.. A great many of the exhibits lve been carried that way. Boats coming down the river land their passengers and freight there. It was necessary for that purpose to build a wharf. and the expense of building that wharf forms part of the amount which has been expended in the improvement of the park. Now. Mr. President. I will come to the whole cost of this exposition. and first I will ask my friend the Senator from Connecticut . who was the president of the Philadelphia Centennial. what was the whole cost of that exposition?"},{"1":"1884","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I regret the absence of the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations . I learn. however. he isnecessarily detained. and will be absent perhaps for some time to come. his father having died a day or two ago. In the absence of the chairman of that committee. as I am one of the oldest members upon it. I desire to state. the reasons as briefly as I can why I object to the adoption of the rule as proposed. I shall speak of it as though all the other motions and notices were now before the Senate. so as to avoid ipeating what I may desire to say as each one of them is respectively called up. On the day we adjourned before the holidays I retained the floor to. state my objection then to the single proposition as to the District of Columbia. As preliminary to what I desire to say now. and as part of my remarks. perhaps I had better read what I stated then. I said: Mr. President. I happento be a member of the Committee on Appropriations. and have been for a good xMhilc.and as such I assure you that personally I carenothing about the District appropriation bill. The Senator from Tennesseer . now the acting President of the Seate. struck the real point that as been put by every committee to the Committee on Appropriations when it insists that it ought to be allowed to look over those matters. He asked thequestion if the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations thought thatother committees and other gentlemen on other committees were not as competent to do that work as they were. The Committee on PostOffices and PostRoad have demanded jurisdiction over postoffice matters. and have pat the saine question. the chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs has asked the same question. and done it in the same way. and so the Senator from Kansas tells us. we did not understand all about that sewer. We were told by the Naval Committee: You do not as members of the Appropriations Committec understand. anythingabout the steel vessels we ought to build.and thlthousand thingsthat we learn on ourcommittce. Sothechairmanofrti Committee on PostOffice. and PostRoads tells us: Our intereourge with the PostOffice Deprfrtment has. given us information that you geis lemen can not have.  so say the Military Committee. so say all. This is the beginningof a raid on the Appropriations Cornmaittee that ifallowed to proceed can not be resisted. because each committee will claim that it has. special knowledge and special information that the Committee on Appropriations does not have and can not have. because of the intimate relations of the various committees with the different Departments. and itiwill end in abolishing the Committee on Appropriations suhstantially. Perhaps that may be a goodthing to do. It is a good way to get money out of the Treasury. there is no. doubt about that. Each committee of the Senate very properly is constituted so as to be the adviser of the particular Department whose interests are committed to its care. The Committee on the District of Columbia is composed of as good men as any other committee. for we are all alike good-. and it isa rule that the men representing the Slates and districts nearest to the District of Columbia are alwaysas a matter of right placed upon that committee. Why? Because they are supposed to be the special friends of the District. At that point an interruption was had. and I consented to yield the floor for a motion to adjourn. which was very soon made. Following that line of thought. I desire to say now that if anyone of these committees. the Committee on the District of Columbia or the Committee on Agriculture for example. ought to have the appropriation bills relative to the matters they are expected to recommend legislation about referred to them. the Senate will find it very difficult to determine that the Committee on PostOffices and PostRoads. the Committee on Military Affairs. the Committee on Naval Affairs. the Committee on Pensions. indeed all the other committees dealing with any particular subject or class of subjects. shall not also have the appropriation bills relative to. the particular matters in which they are concerned referred to them. because it must be admitted. and is admittedby each member of the Appropriation Committee. that the accurate knowledge necessary to pags lawsbearing upon their respective Departments or matters specially committed tothe charge of these committees is more familiar to them in ther aggregate than it can be to the Appropriations Committee as a whole. But it is just for that reason that supervision over the money sought to. be appropriated should be had by a committee not connected with any of these matters. As I said before. in selecting committees to attend to the interests of the different Departmentsgentlemen are selected because of their special knowledge of and intimacy with the matters referred to them and the confidence of the heads of Departments in them. The gentlemen of the Senate who are on the Military Committee are. most of them at least men who have been soldiers. The Senator from Illinois [Mr. LOGAN is the chairman of that committee. The gentlemen who have charge of* other special matters are men who know more than other people about the special matters referred to them. The District of Columbia Committee. as I said. is always represented in large part by persons who are supposed to be specially friendly to the people and the interests of this District. and itis so now. You will observe in looking over the list of committees that the Senator from Maryland is a member of the Committee of the District of Columbia. and the Senator from Virginia is also a member of that committee. Turning to the House. which follows the same rule. Representative BARBOUR. who is from the adjoining district of Alexandria. is the chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia. and Representative MCCOMIAS. of Maryland. from the other adjoining district. is also a member of thatcommittee. and so with each of them. properly. I repeat. The Secretary of State ought to have the men who are in accordance mith his views and who ar8 his personal friends to consult with in relation to our foreign affairs and the confirmation of his subordinates. So ought the Secretary of the Navy. so ought the Secretary of War. so ought the PostmasterGeneral. so ought the people of the District. so ought all of them. It is the duty of these committees to frame such laws as in their judgment will best promote the interests of their respective Departments. and when they do attend to that vell they find a great deal of work to do. But if they are to make the appropriatiois also to carry out the laws they frame. then there is no supervision over their acts by any other body of men in the Senate. I insist that it is not wise legislation to vest any committee with absolute power as to the laws necessary and at the same time as to the amount of money necessary to carry those laws into effect. The theory and practice of the Government has always been that when committees frame and pass laws the amounts to be appropriated to carry out the laws which have been framed and passed in the interest of the respective departments which they specially represent shall go before another body of men not specially connected with any of the departments of the Government and be carefully considered there. The Committee on Appropriations originates no bills. frames no laws. and has no appointments referred to it. I am speaking of it as acting under the rules. for I have no doubt those rules have been violated time and again. very frequently by amendments offered by other committees. much more ftequently than by the action of that committee itself. Under the Lulcs it can frame no law. it must make appropriations in accordance with existing laws that have been framed by the other committec and passed by Congress. It has to keep a record of all the appropriations and all the items of all the appropriations that have been passed. so that they can be seen by any Senator. who chooses to look over them. at once. and that committee has done so. as the books now on my desk will show to any one who cares to look at them. How is the Committee on Apppropriations composed? I looked over the list of committees just now. and this is the condition exhibited: The Senator from Iowa . our chairman. is also a member of the Committee on Finance. Whatever questions come up in reference to internal revenue and the necessities of that branch of the service. he. as a member of the Appropriations Committee. is entirely familiar with them and can give the committee all the information requisite. I also am a member of the Committeeon Finance. and can aid him in furnishing the necessary information relative to that branch of the public service. which is very important. The Senator from Illinois is the next member of the Committee on Appropriations. he is chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs. When any matter of appropriation comes up before the Committee on Appropriations relative to the Army. can any one be better qualified to advise as to what is necessary than the chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs? The Senator from Massachusetts is chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs. and is a member of the Committee on Appropriations. Heis thoroughly posted as to all maters relating to Indian affairs. and can advise the committee as to the necessities of that great interest. The Senator from Maine . who is also a member of the Committee on Appropriations. is perhaps the best informed man in the Senate as to all matters relative to naval affairs. The interests of the Navy will never suffer while he is a member of the Committee on Appropriations. The Senator from Kansas is a distih.guished member of the Committee on Agriculture. and is also the chah man of the Committee on Public Lands. If anything pertaining to agriculture is before the Committee on Appropriations we have all the in1i rmation the Committee on Agriculture can give us in the person of the Senator from Kansas. The Senator from Missouri . who is a member of the Committee on Appropriations. is also a member of the Committee on Military Affairs and of the Committee on the Improvement of the Mississippi River and its Tributaries. He is known to be extremely careful and well informed in all matters relating to any subject intrusted to his charge. Another of our members. the Senator from North Carolina . is now a member and was. while the Democracy were in power here. chairman of the Committee on Commerce and also of the Committee on the Potomac Flats Improvement of Washington. The Senator from Florida . also a member of the Committee on Appropriations. is upon the Committee on Patents and the Committee on Education and Labor. Therefore the nine men composiug the Committee on Appropriations are in on6 form or other representatives of a large majority of the other special interests that have to be cared for. I do not believe that the effort to take cognizance by special committee of the appropriations relative to the District of Columbia or to the Agricultural Department. or the Military or Navy. or any other department of the Government. is based upon the idea that the Committee on Appropriations are too extiavagant in their appropriations for any of those things. or that it is now proposed to take any bill away from us for the purpose of curtailing extravagance or economizing expenditures in any of the different departments of the Goverfiment. I think if this movement succeeds that the reverse will be found to be the fact. I think the history of legislation in these halls will show that wherever amendments have been moved to appropriation bills as they cme from the Committee on Appropiations by gentlemen representing any other of the great interests of the Government. whether military or naval or the District of Columbia or anything else. it has generally been asking an addition to an increase of appropriation over what the Committee on Appropriations had seen fit to allow. and I predict now that if this move issuccessful. and the Committee on Appropriations is abolished. as it will virtually be if all these motions carrybecause I suppose if one shall carry all willthe result will be increased appropriations and a want of harmony. instead of strict economy and a thorough knowledge of all that has been done. and we shall have hereafter a good deal of extravagance in the management of our public affairs. I called just now on the clerk of the committee to bring in all the books that I knew he had carefully prepared. in which every item of every appropriation made since 1870 in every bill is carefully collated. They are so kept that any member of the Senate can go into the room of the Committee on Appropriations and in five minutes can look and see what has been done for the last thirteen years at leasthow much further back I do not know. but since 1870 I do know. for I have examined carefullyevery item of every appropriation bill made outside of the river and harbor bills. he can ascertain any fact he seeks to know in a moment by the books kept by the secretary or clerk of the Committee on Appropriations. and I have the books now before me. so .that any gentleman can verify my statement by looking at them. Surely that of itself is a great convenience. If it is taken from the Committee on Appropriations and the appropriation bills referred to the different committees. such books as I have lying before me now. invaluable for the purposes of information. never can be made up or preserved. Allow me to refer to the action of the immediate representatives of the people on this question. The House of Representatives. through its Committee on Rules. two or three years ago. in revising their rules. not only left all general bills with the Appropriations Committee. but endeavored to place the river and harbor bill in charge of the Committee on Appropriations. after first referring it to the Committe on Commerce. The Committee on Rules made their report in 1879 on the 19th of December. It was a distinguished committee. one that had often considered all the matters connected with appropriations. It was composed of the then Speaker. Mr. RANDALL. Mr. Stephens. of Georgia."},{"1":"1883","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"The debate this evening has taken a pretty wide range. and I suppose because the committee have asked the privilege of reconsidering some part of this bill which they have reported here. and Senators on both sides of the Chamber think it a good time to express some opinions through which perhaps. if the committee may not be enlightened. their attention may be called to various propositions thai havebeen debated. In the course of this debate the Senatorfrom Massachusetts has taken the ground that the people of the South had been somewhat derelict or delinquent in not having more largely engaged in manufactures. I mu aware that that argument and that challenge has been brought to the attention of the Southern people and of the country for a number of years. and as a full answer to all the iniquities of the tariff system we have been asked the question. Why have you not engaged in manufactures. and why have you not availed yourselves of your free right to benefit by the protective features of the tariff laws ? That is a question which addresses itself as forcibly to the West as it does to the South. It addresses itself also to the condition of the people of this country. and the condition that they have occupied since its first organization as a government. It is to be answered in many ways. any one of which is entirely satisfactory. The first proposition that I desire to advance in answer to the honorable Senator from Massachusetts is this: Every man in the world desires to be the masterof his own business. Hence farming. and particularly farming on a small scale. is very attractive to men of small means and particularly to those who have to live by their own manual labor. A man rejoices in a home with his family around him. with his own forest trees from which to gather his timber. his wood. his fencing. whatever he may need. with his cattle browsing upon his own grounds. with a brook that belongs to him meandering through his own land and turning his own mill. if he is able to own one. ind all the blessings which belong to what is termed an independent condition in life concenter in the pursuit of agriculture. particularly in a small way. This is the real invitation that we extend. and which we have done so profitably for the increase of our population. to foreign countries. and which induces such an enormous influx of people into this land. They come here in order that they may have the opportunity once for all. or once at least in life. of being the masters of their own time. of their own families. of their own business. of their own production. and of their own profits. The people of the South and of the West belong to that class of independent men who go and have gone to these new countries to seek opportunities for the rearing of families in the land. This class of people have not been willing to subordinate themselves in the condition of laborers under taskmasters. they have sought a freer course and cur-. rent of employment than is to be found in the manufactures of New England or of Old England or of Germany or of France. It may be safely said that in ninety cases out of every hundred those people find themselves engaged as operatives in manufacturing establishments who have no other means of subsistence. There is not a man or a woman today in a manufacturing establishment in the United States. unless it may be one who is very highly skilled. and who therefore is enabled to earn extraordinary profits from a days work. who would not freely abandon that manner of employment for the sake of being engaged in pursuits that are more congenial to the tastes of human nature. That is one answer to it. There is another answer. sir. which relates to the employment of capital. The reason why manuihetures have sprung up and prospered in New England is because that is an old and thrifty country. it had an early start in moneymaking and moneysaving. it accumulated capital through the thrift anrd industry of its people. which I think is entirely honorable to them. and having a sterile.barren country in which to operate. which did not yield in fact much fruit in the way of agricultural returns. they found it necessary to engage in fisheries. where they demanded and received from us large bounties directly given by the Federal Government. in banking. where they had the control forn long series of years of the finances of the country. and still hold that control. in manufactures. where capital was present to employ labor and put it at its own price into its service. There was another class of capitalists in this country who. from the first foundation of this Government until the year 1860. were men who also controlled large masses of people. They were the slaveholders. We held our slaves in the South by the tenure of the Constitution by a title of personal property. whereas the men in the North held their operatives by the title of the necessities under which they were to serve in classes of business that were not congenial to their natures. The capitalists in the Northern States were enabled to employ men by compulsion. as you may say. arising out of necessity. the capitalists of the Southern States were enabled to employ men who were slaves and who were held in bondage by the law. The capitalists of the Southern States did not have material in the people that they owned out of which to build up important manufactures. A negro is a very poor operative in any kind of skilled labor. any kind of delicate work. any kind of work out of which profit can be made in the manufacture of nice light cotton goods. fine silks. fine hats. fine cutlery. or any of the other beautiful descriptions of goods which are yielded by the genius and skill of the people who are employed in the Northern manufactories. and therefore. finding ourselves the owners as capitalists of a large mass of labor that was not capable of being converted into that quality which made manufacturing profitable. we sought agriculture. we went into the field. When Whitney made his cottongin invention and put that great staple upon the world we devoted our time to raising cotton for the supply of the nations. We also raised sugar. we also cut trees and made turpentine and shipstores. but we engaged very little in manufacturing. because the people whose labor we controlled. not more powerfully and more completely and thoroughly than the New England man controlled the labor that was dependent upon him. was not so well adapted to it. The people whose labor we controlled we could not use in these descriptionsofwork. otherwise long since Massachusettswould have been clamoring to be protected against Southern industry and Southern genius. If the people whomthe capitalists of the South owned and controlled had been persons of equal talent and skill and taste with those who were owned and controlled through the law of necessity by the Northern capitalists. you would have seen the South doing thatwhich she very soon will accomplish. outstripping all of you in manufactures. and that too without the necessity of a highprotective tariff or a tariff discriminating in favor of established industries under the pitiful plea thadt they are still infants. though they are 100 years old. These are some of the reasons why it is that we of the South have not gone into the manufacturing business. We have paid all the time out of our treasurehouse. we have yielded bounties to the gentlemen who have controlled white labor. and it has been because of our sympathy for the very people out of whom they derived their enormous earnings more than anything else that we have yielded to a system which from the beginning down to this time has been always one of inequality and injustice."},{"1":"1882","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"ii. speaking of labor in England. says: As a general mile. the labor of the women and children is required in order to eke our the subsistence of lhefainily.

I shall proceed to do so. The Commissioner of Pensions asks for additional legislation for the purpose of preventing and detecting fraud. and a bill (No. 406) has been introduced at his suggestion and is now offered as an amendment to the pension appropriation bill. This bill provides for the appointment of a lawyer and a surgeon in each congressionaldistrict in the United States. There are two hundred and ninetyeight congressional districts. and the bill asks to create five hundred and eightyfour Federal officers. It provides that in each district the lawyer and the surgeon shall disagree ija politics. In other words. that if a republican lawyer shall be appoind a democratic surgeon shall be appointed to watch him. and if a democatic lawyer is appointed a republican surgeon shall stand gtard. These examiners and surgeons are to take declarations and testimony of applicants for pensions and witnesses. They must visit each county or city in their respective districts at least three times a year. In addition to this they must visit such places as the Commissioner of Pensions may direct. In case a pensioner or witness is sick. the examiner and surgeon must visit him. The third section of the bill provides the Commissioner may dispense with the services of these lawyers and surgeons whenever he may desire. The next section provides for a board of surgeons. and the followlug seetion~provides that the declaration for pensions or bounty land may he made precisely as it now is. The seventh section makes the Commissioner supreme. and the eighth provides for the appointment of akind of surgeongeneral for the Pension Bureau with a salary of - $2.500 per annnm. Time presumption is that this surgeongeneral is to have the final say upon the question of disability in each case. You must not forget that this additional legislation is asked on the . ground that there is not sufficient law at present to make it possible for the Commissioner of Pensions to prevent fraud. I will call your attention to the law as it now stands. and you can then determine - whether any more legislation is absolutely necessaty for the discovery of fraud. Section 4744 Revised Statutes is as follows: The Commissioner of Pensions is authorized to detail. from time to time. clerks in his office to investigate suspected attempts at fraud on the Government through and by virtue of the provisions of the pension laws. and to aid in prosecuting any pornon so offending. with such additional compensation as is customary in cases of special service. anti any person so detailed shall have the power to administer oaths and take affidavits in the course of any such investigation. It will be seen that this section authorizes the Commissioner of Pensions to send. if necessary. all the clerks in his office anywhere in the country to investigate any suspected claim. and report to him. Section 4471 is as follows: . In nl cases of application for the payment of pensions to invalid pensioners to the 4th day of September of an odd yeor. the certificate of an examiuing surgeon daly appointed by tie Commissioner of Pensions. or of a surgeon of the Army or Navy. stating the coatinuance of the disability for which the ponsion was originally granted. describing it. and the degree of such disability at the time of making the certificate. shall be required to accompany the rouchersannd a duplicate thereof shall be filed in the office of the Commissioner of Pensions. tnd if in a case of continued disability it shall be stated at a degree below that for which the pension was originally granted or was last paid. the pensioner shall only ho peit icr the quarter then dne atthe rain stated in the certificate. lBnt whore the pension wa9 originally granted for a disab ility in consequence of the loss of a limb or other essential portion of the body. or for other cause which cannot either in whole or In part be removed. or when a disability is certifict by competent examining surgeons to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Pensions to have become perma nent in a degree equal to the whole rate of pension. the above certificate shall not be necessary to entitlo the pensioner to payment. The next section. No. 4772. authorizes the Commissioner of Pensions to have a pensioner examined just as often as he desires. it is as follows: Nothing in the preceding section shall be construed to prevent the Commissioner of Pensions from requiring a more frequent examination. if. in his judgment. it is necessary. Section No. 4773 is as follows: * The biennial certificate of two unappointed civil surgeons shall not be accepted in any case. except upon satisfactory evidence that an examination by a commissioned or duly appointed surgeon is impracticable. The Senate will see that by this section. although the pensioner haq been examined by two civil surgeons. the Commissioner is not bound to take their certificate unless he has satisfactory evidence that the examination could not be made by a duly appointed surgeon. and even then. under previous sections. he has the right to have the pensioner examined j nst as often as he may suspect that an examination may disclose anything of benefit to the United States. Section 4774 is as follows: The Commisetoncrof Pensions is authorized to organize. at his discretion. boards of examining surgeons. not to exceed three members. and each member of a board thus organized who is actually present and makes. in connection with other members or member. an ordered or periodical examination. shall be entitled to the fee of $1. on the receipt of a proper certificate of such examination by the Commlssioner of Pensions. It is plain that under this section the Commissioner of Pensions has already the right to organize. at his discretion. a board of examining surgeons consisting of three members. and he can have every pensioner examined as often as he plesses by such board. under the law as it now is. The next section. 4775. is as follows: Examining snrgeons duly appointed by the Commissioner of Pensins.and snch other qualified surgeons as may be employed in the Pension Office. may be required by bin.. from time to time. as he deems for the interests of the Government. to make special examinations of pensioners. or applicants for pensions. and each examinations shall have precedence over previous examinations. whether spgcial or biennial. but when injustice is alleoed to have been done by an examination so ordered. the Commissioner of Pensions may. at his discretion. select a hoard of three duly appointed examining surgeons. who shall meet at a place to ho desinated bybin. end hall roviewouch canosas maybe ordered before them on appeal from aiy special examination. and the decieton of such beard shalt be final on the question s. submitted thereto. provided thoCnamissioner approve the sae. The copensation of each of such surgeons shalt ho $1. and shall ha paid oat of any appropriations made for the payment of penions. in the some manneras the odinary foes of appointed surgeos are or may be .aahriezod to be paid. By this section the Commissioner of Pensions can have all the snrgoons ho wants. and. whenever he deems it to the interest o the Government. h can require them to make a special examination of any pensioner. or of any appliant for pension. and such examination shall have precedence over all others. and if any injustice is alleged to have been done the Commissioner may. at his discretion. select another board of examining surgeons for the purpose of reviwin g nil cases tat may he laid before it. but the decision even of this court is nOt final unerss it is approved by the Com issioner. Section No. 4777 is as followso: The Commissioner of Pensions is empowered to appoint. at his discretion. civil srgeons to make the periodical examinati e pensioners which are or may be reqitred by law. ind to examine applicants for pensions where lie desmo an examination by a surgeon appointed by him ncesary and the feo for each examinations ani the reqisite certificates thereof. in duplicate including postage on each snare transmitted to pension agents. shall be $i. which shall hopaidh by the agent for paying pensions in the district within which the pensioner or claimaant. reeldIce. eat of any money appropriated for the payment of pensions. uder each regen--taions an the (enimissior at Pensions may prescribe. This section authorizes the Commissioner of Pensions to appoint all the civil surgeons ho may want for the purpose of having the applicants examined whenever and wherever he deems an examination necessary. You will see that under the section already quoted the Commissioner of Pensions has ample authority to do anything he pleases so far as the examination of pensioners is concerned. Every suspicion ho may entertain can be at once verified by any number of surgeons and any number of special agents. At the present time ho has at least forty special gents constantly traveling for the purpoe of finding evidence of some fraud in some pension claim. The whole hsiness of the office is transacted upon the idea that every application is a fraud. that all affidavits are untrue. nd that as a matter of fact. very few people wecre disabled in the lute war. Iu addition to the sections I have already called your attention to. there ntc others of equal importance. Sections 1h4 is as follows : .ny head of aflepartment or imrean in which nottes aganst thoUnited Sites is properly pending may aply to any jdge or clerk of any houri of the United States in any State. District or Territory. to issue a subtena for anoy witness being within the jurisdiction af ach court. to cPI ear at a time and piaco in the subpnna sated. before any officer athorized to tako depositions to oused in the courts of the United States. therm to give full and true answers to such written interrogatories and crossintern Mtoris as Insy he submitted with the application. or to be orally examined and crossexamined upon the subject of such claim. By this section the Secretary of the Interior. or the Commissioner of Pensions if he is the head of a bureau. may apply to any judge or -clerk of any court of the United States. in any District. Territory or State. to issue a subpeena for any witness within the jurisdiction of such court. commanding the witness to appear before any officer authorized to take depositions. and to answer all interrogatories that may be submitted to such witness i and this he has a right to do whenever he suspects that any claim against the United States is fraudulent. And section 186 provides for the punishment of any witmess who. when snbponaed. will not testify. In order to see how difficult it is to perpetrate a fraud upon the Pension Bureau. allow me to tell you what a man has to do to get it. First. he has to make an application. and this application has to state his name. age. height. occupation. color of hair. color of eyes. where and when he enlisted. in what company. who were his officers. when. where. and for what reason he was discharged. if he was wounded when and where. the extent of his wound. and. in fact. a full description of himself. of his wound or malady. This must be sworn to before a court of record. and in addition. the applicant has to be identifiedty two witnesses. Second. There must be the affidavit of a commissioned officer that the affidavits set forth in the application are true. and if there is no commissioned officer the applicant must produce two of his comrades to swear that such affidavits are true. and they must state their means of knowledge. The application is then sent to the Pension Bureau. The next step is to have it referred to the War Department for the purpose of seeing. first. whether the name of the applicant is on the rolls of the War Department. whether he enlisted at the time he stated. and whether he was discharged at the time stated . whether he was borneon therolls at the time he is stated to have been wounded. and whether. according to the daily reports he was on hand. The same test is made with regard to his two comrades. If he has ever signed the payrolls. that signature is compared with the signatureto his application. Inthe same way his comrades are tested. and in the same way their signatures are compared. and the records must show that the comrades were there at the time. If all this is satisfactory and everything appears to be right. the claimant is then examined by a surgeon of the Pension Office. and then. as a rule. there is a second examination before a hoard of three surgeons. Not satisfied yet. still suspecting a fraud. the applicant is required to produce the affidavit of his family physician. if he ever had one. or of some physician who has been acquainted with him. showing the condition of the claimant from the time of his discharge from the Army to the time of his application for a pension not only. but his then condition. If he never had a family physician. then he must prove all these facts by his neighbors. If. after all this has been done. the Commissioner of Pensions still suspects that it is not all right. he can then send one of his special agents to examine the applicant and report on his case. If that report is all right and the Commissioner still has a suspicion. he can write to the postmaster in regard not only to the Claimants condition as to bodily health. but as to his moral character and as to the moral character of the witnesses. If not then satisfied he can order the applicant before a special board of surgeons to be appointed by himself. We must also remember that if. after all this has been done. and the applicants claim has been allowed and his name put on the roll as a pensioner of the United States. at any time thereafter. whenever a suspicion works itself into the brain of the Commissioner. he can order this pensioner tobe reexamined. and can send another special agent. or as many as he may desire. to examine his case. It seems to me that the Commissioner of Pensions has power enough already. and it is hard to see the necessity of five hundred and eightyfour additional Federal officers. If any considerable number of frauds have been perpetrated upon the Pension Office. wilh all the power already in the hands of the Commissioner that I have shown to exist. it is not the fault of the law. I have not time now to describe all that an applicant has to do if she happens to be a widow with several children. The amount of -evidence it takes to substantiate a marriage. a birth. or a death. is something absolutely amazing. Every possible and conceivable objection is made. and every flaw is found. so that. as a matter of fact. the greatest misfortune a widow has to contend with after the death of her husband is the prosecution of her claim for a pension. Another reason. however. urged for the passage of this bill. is the alleged dishonesty of the pension agents who practice before the Commissioner tnder the law as it now is. Every one of them is entirely and absolutely under the control of the Commissioner himself and the Secretary of the Interior. The Commissioner complains that they practice frauds. and put op jobs on him to the extent of millions of dollars per annum. Hehas all the power that legislation can give him to detect the guilty and have them punished. He has also the power to stop the practice of any pension agent upon even a suspicion of his integrity. Suppose the judge of a court with a hundred lawyers practicing before him should loudly accuse them. or some of them. of corruption in his court. of forging papers. suborning witnesses. falsifying records. suppressing testimony. and packing juries. and yet .should disbar none of the alleged culprits. though with full power to do so. What heed would be given to his charges except in so far as they affected himself. The Commissioner of Pensions has plenary power now. under the law. to strike the name of any attorney or agent from his rolls. shut him out from the Department. prosecute. hunt him down with criminal prosecution. andput him in thepenitentiary for his offenses if he has committed any. Let him execute the laws rather than ask for additional legislation. Sir. the object of this bill seems to be to cast suspicion on all pension claims. Like the pamphlets and letters of the Commissioner. it appears to be saturated with the idea that a pensioner is always ready and willing to commit a fraud on the Government. and that a pension. when he gets it. is a gratuity. I deny this assumption from beginning to end. The pensioners and applicants for pensions are as honest as other men. and have given quite as much evidence of friendship for the Government as those who asperse them. Nor do I regard the payment of his pension as a charity. it is the payment of a debt. A pensioner is a creditor. not a pauper. When the Government pays him his pension it does not bestow alms. it discharges an honest obligation. It is the fulfillment of a contract between the Government and the soldier. The soldier has complied with his part of the contract on the fields of war in hardships. weariness. and pain. His wounds are his vouchers. and such evidence is sufficient for me. Others may take care of the illustrious and the fortunate. They may even create new offices for them and grant them highsoundingtitles. but while I have the honor to represent a State upon this floor I shall keep the contract with the wounded. torn. and shattered of the rank and file."},{"1":"1880","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I only want to say one word invindication of the truth of history as to congressional legislation upon this subject. The Senator from Connecticut has expressed his regret that this side of the Chamber did not four years ago inaugurate this policy which some of our friends are now contending for. I want to say to that Senator that the poliey of doing nothing except appropriating merely enough money to prevent our fortifications from going to ruin was adopted just four years ago. when the other end of the Capitol announcedthepolicybefore the country of saving$40.OiO 000 as they said they were going to save. when they went to workand cut down everything everywhere. without rhyme or reason. for the purpose of making a showing on paper of saving $40.000.000. and afterward came in and made up avery large proportion of it by deficiency bills. I know that for several years I have. as a member of the Committee on Appropriations struggled to have some appropriations made for harbor defenses. i did not believe inthe policy of merely preventing them from rotting down. But I sayto the Senators on the other side that it has been utterly impossible to do it. because appropnations for this purpose would count in the appropriation bills.and theywould fail at the other end of the Capitol to show a large saving upon former appropriations. And hence thepolicy has been adopted and pursued to leave our harbors utterly defenseless. as they have been left for the last few years. I am tory glad to seethat a new spirit is taking possession of some of our friends on that subject. and I for one am ready to cooperate with them to the best of my ability in making the necessary appropriations for arming these forts to some extent. I protested against this four years ago from this very place where I am now speaking. I attempted to show then that it was bad economy. that instead of suspending all these works at a time when the appeal made by the Senator from Pennsylvania could not be made that everything was high priced. but at a time when the labor of the country was .prostate when iron was almost worthless. when it would be not only a beneAt to the country to make these appropriations but a benefit to the people to have the work to do. the true course was to go on with these works. But that was refusedbecause itwas believed it would swell the aggregate of appropriations. and consequently these defenses were left unprovided for."},{"1":"1879","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"ir. Chairman. we have passed through the ordeal of a most exciting debate upon the Army appropriation bill. the spirit of which cannot. I think. be commended save as it may be viewed from the most ultrapartisan standpoint. I had hoped that in the resent discussion gentlemen might see the propriety suggested by a igh orler of patriotism of viewing the issues presented in the bill under consideration as Americans. citizens of a great country. having a common destiny. cherishing a profound respect for its beneficent institutions. and earnestly laboring to still further perfect and perpetuato them. Much has been said of the prerogative of the States. and infringements upon their rights forcibly and eloquently deprecatedall of which is wise and proper. inasmuch as the functions of government in each separate Commonwealth are important and not to be ignored. All sovereignty legitimately attached to them should of right be recognized. for they compose our glorious Union. whose stability and authority are most desirable. whose life is endeared to the good men of all parties who revere their Government and are not less sensitive to the nations requirements and its duties than they are to the rights of the States. This admitted. and I think there are few. if any. who will question the truth of the proposition. a solemn duty rests with us to secure to every individual invested with the proud insignia of citizenship immunity from interference or intimidation. whether these attacks are to be resisted in Pennsylvania or New York. Massachusetts or South Carolina. I know. sir. that good. sincere men. who pray for peace and harmony throughout our country. feel that we should remit this whole matter to the people themselves. that they are responsible for the injustice and violence complained of. and they can. if they will. purify the politics of the nation and banish the thugs whose infamies on election day are a reproach and disgrace to the age. I wish it were possible to reduce this theory to practice. it would be much more in accord with the spirit of our institutions. but. sir. nll such attempts. I fear. will prove lut as the dreams of the idealist until the demagogue shall have been excluded from caucus and convention and the patriot be recognized as the true exponent of the peoples will. When a new order of things shall have been reached. the millennium proclaimed and accepted. authority may be dispensed with. as antagonisms and interests of a selfish and ignoble character will have disappeared. I submit that repression of the most criminal ehaxacter affecting the freedom of elections. invading the sacred precincts of a free franchise and designedto strike down the manhood of the country. degrading the people to a condition of helotism. cannot be doubted if we accept as true the statement of the republicans as to the number and character of outrages in the Southern States more in accord with the barbarism of Patagonia than the civilization of any State of this Republic. Nor is the picture less repulsive. less hideous or more assuring. when. sketched by the democratic artist in its somber shading. is portrayed similar crimes. and the charges are directly and. positively made. deliberately preferred. that fraud. treachery. the most ile political and mercenary appliances. are sought to be effectively used by the opposite party to stamp out overwhelming democratic majoritics. Where there is so much smoke there must be some fire.: for. sir. it would be derogatory to the character of the prominent gentlemen of both parties to this controversy. indulging in these severe charges and countercharges. to assume they are made to order. manufactured merely for political effect. Mr. Chairman. I look upon these developments as being of the most serious character. boding but little promise of hope for the future of our country. freighted with consequences that may eventuate in the destruction of civil liberty in America. The mere assertion that frauds were perpetrated. the bare suspicion that any party in our political life is base enough to meditate such a revolting crime. so impious as to place its sacrilegious hands upon this ark of the covenant of American liberty. should excite the condemnation and unsparing censure of men yet free whose first duty is to country. not party. who. when its life is endangered. its integrity assailed. its authority questioned. accept the great responsibility of stepping to the front in its defense. whose mission it is to preserve the rarest jewel of earth. this Republic. that its brilliancy may ciallenge the admiration of the less fortunate of other lands subjected to the unfeeling domination of despots. It is. sir. a grave question agitating the minds of many good and true men today whether this nation can exist and that fall measure of liberty be secured to the people so fondly cherished by the patriotic founders of our Government unless a more scrupulous regard for the rights of all and a higher and purer estimate be placed upon the purity of the ballotbox. It is quite common in these latter days to hear utterances that to some seem strangely out of place. sentiments thoroughly at variance with that good. oldfashioned doctrine that the voice of the people is the voice of God in the political order. a truth that should ever inspire the humblest in the land with a lofty patriotism. an idea that invests the toiler unless convicted of crime with the proud decoration of citizenship. the franchise of which should not be coerced or enfeebled by the stratagems of professional politicians. Strange and impossible as it may seem. the advance guard of special privilege is occasionally heard in this fair land. its bugle blast sounds down with manhood suffrage . the wisdom of the fathers is doubted. their simplicity pitied. and men of some pretension and culture. if not eminence. are found advocating restrictions and qualifications whose imposition is intended to disfranchise the many and erect upon the ruins of political equality an intolerable. soulabhorring aristocracy. Against this treason now somewhat popular. this innovation wholly unAmerican. I desire to enter my humble protest. imbued with that feeling. impelled by that motive. I do not hesitate to declare upon. this floor that I believe any measure. whether intended or not to impair the efficiency of supervisors of election. that denies to them proper facilities to alike prevent illegal vothig and all attempts at the intimidation of citizens legally entitled to vote. is a very grave mistake and should not be entered upon in obedience to the whims. and caprices of partisan interest and necessity. Gentlemen canbest servetheir country byplacing safeguards around. the ballotbox that will tend to purify the approaches to this sanetuary of time people. they will thus fortify with renewed hope the devotees of free government who yet hesitate to admit that we are incapable of the exercise of sufficient virtue to preserve intact and perpetuate the priceless heritage of popular government. Mr. Chairman. I suppose it is claimed that any interference such as I believe to be necessary upon the part of the Federal Government is unconstitutional. arbitrary. and dangerous to the independence of the several States. Whether we have sufficient reason to dread the exercise of this power I will not discuss. but this much I sincerely believ d: that it should be the duty of the National Government to step in between the oppressor and the oppressed and protect the voter in all his constitutional rights independent of partisan considerations. for. sir. the stability and permanency of this Union depend upon the free and unconstrained ballot of the masses. I sincerely regret. sir. that the majority inthis House did not see proper to present these repealing clauses as separate measures. For some of them I could cheerfully vote if so presented. because I am persuaded. they serve while on the statutebook but to irritate thepeople and revivo the discords. and bad passions of the past. 1 desire to vote for this appropriation bill. a measure of such magnitude and importance as not to be overestimated. which simply means. as I understand it. providing for the support of our governmental system. A very grave responsibility is forced upon us. and I seriously question the propriety of a policywhether pursued by democrats or republicans. I care notthat compels us either to vote against an appropriation bill because of an objectionable feature. such as we fear is embodied in the proposed legislation. that if adopted will render wholly powerless supervisors of election. and thus leave the individual voter subject to the outrage and abuses gentlemen complain of. and a repetition of which Congress should sedulously guard against at this time. There are some gentlemen upon this foor who are willing to vote for the repeal or abolition of the jurors test oath aud providc for such modilication as would secure protection and freedom to every voter by preventing excesses of partisan officials. and these measures. sir. should have been presented to us upon their merits. enabling us to assume the responsibility of voting for or against them untrammeled by the danger of defeating an appropriation bill. I trust. sir. it is not yet too late to avoid the conflict so much talked of between Congress and the President. and so trusting and believing. I hope this committee may so amend this bill as to avoid a deadlock that if precipitated must prove disastrous to the whole country. Much of the time devoted to partisan appeals could have been utilized for the enacting of measures of relief that would be hailed as a promise of a bright future for the depressed industry and discouraged bor of this nation. a duty upon our part so plain and imperative that to longer trifle with it must arouse the indignation of an outraged people. I trust this extraordinary session of the Fortysixth Congress may wisely determine upon a policy tending to abolish the widespread want and suffering now so bitterly complained of. anoliorating the condition of the toilers whose homes are forfeited to exacting capital. whose labor is degraded. whose poverty is pronounced -a crime punishable by imprisonment in some portions of our country. This spirit of relief breathed into the nations laws would enkindle a devotion now dormant in the breasts of those tortured by pangs born of neglect. worthy of grave consideration here. and cannot be safely postponed to some future time. Promises of congressional relief do not buy bread. Some measures of a substantial character should be secured. and. sir. the sooner the better."},{"1":"1878","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I cannot yield. I say thatwhich has brought distress upon the people of this country more than anything else is the practice of extravagant appropriations and excessive taxes which are imposed upon the people. It is proposed now to expend a large amount of money. an amount beyond the revenues of the Government. for the purpose of erecting public buildings in this country. If that is the tree mode of bringing about relief to the distressed people of this country. then I will have to study in some school of political economy that I have never heretofore had the fortune to study in. Now. this is a question of revenue. The Secretary of the Treasury. in his annual report which I hold in my hand. has informed us that unless this Congress reduces the appropriations $11.000.000 below the estimates. we will not have a sufficient amount of money with which to meet those appropriations. Only a few days ago I saw a statement from the First Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. to the effect that in the five months of this year ending with the month of May there has been a falling off in the revenues of the country of nearly $10.000.000 as compared with the amount received during the corresponding period of last year. Now. if this House is to make appropriations for the amounts necessary to complete all the public buildings that are in course of construction in this country in order to give relief to labor. if that is the way to give relief (to which proposition I do not yield my assent) then we must find some new articles upon which to levy taxes in order to obtain the revenue with which to pay for the public buildings."},{"1":"1877","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I object. I desire to say a single word as to the duties of one of the assistant librarians. I refer to the assistant librarian who has charge of the law library. The importance of his labor must be familiar to anybody who has occasion to examine the books in his department. HIe is required to purchase books for that library. both those published in the United States and those published in foreign countries. He is required to systematically arrange and classify those books so that those who desire to examine them may have speedy and satisfactory access to them. he is required to bave a familiarity with the law in order to render assistance to members of Congress who have occasion to visit the library.

This is called reciprocity. And though it is asserted that such a treaty has been sanctioned by some of the first statesmen of the country. still it is a fact that until now no Congress has ever been reckless enough to give it legislative approval. and I trust this will not. It was proposed in 1867168. when it was examined at the Treasury under the direction of Secretary MeCulloch and in the Senate. The result of all the investigation was so decidedly in opposition. it was abandoned. Senators Fessenden and Grimes were earnest and outspoken in their opposition. both going to the extent of stating that the very idea of coupling the term reciprocity with the treaty was a fraud and an imposition. With whom is it proposed to enter into a reciprocity treaty ? With a group of islands two thousand miles distant from our nearest port. containing a population of 56.000. (less than many agricultural counties in the United States.) and rapidly decreasing. Of this 51.000 are natives. all so little inclined to labor that. though there is comparatively little business on the islands. Chineselabor haste be imported. The climate of the islands discourages work. little clothing is needed. no substantial houses. and little food beyond the peculiar agricultural products of the islands. Wages of natives when employed. $9 per month with and $11 without food. Of the whole population only 4.772 are returned as plantation laborers. and of these about onethird are Chiuese. The only product of the islands of any importance is MAR H 6. sugar. but in the cultivation of this the natives are so little interested that it is said no sugar plantation is owned or worked. as propricetor. by any native. Trade therefore with the islands does not increase and. as the quantity of arable land is very limited. from natural causes. cannot increase. This is shown remarkably by the fact that the total exports of the domestic products of the United States to the islands in 1860. under a low tariff and a low range of prices for what we had to sell. amounted to only $637.453 gold. while in 1874. fifteen years after. it was only $623.280 currency. During the same time there has been no material increase in the import of the products of other countries. In short. the whole product of the United States which the population of the Sandwich Islands have. on an average. been able to consume during the last fifteen years is less than the total value of the annual farm product of the warravaged county of Fairfax. Virginia. the county opposite the Capitol. And the entire value of products of all countries imported into the islands for 1873 ($1.155.422) was only about onefourth the value of the farm product of a single county (Adams.) in Illinois. ($4.654.000.) and with about the same population. (56.362.) A treaty from a commercial point of view by the United States with the Sandwich Islands is not so important as a treaty with any good. thriving agricultural county in almost any State would be. provided the county was located beyond the territory of the United States. Who. then. on the islands wants the treaty? The sugar interest. The sugarcane is indigenous to the islands. and yields more sugar to the acre than in any other country. 5.000 pounds. or two and a half tons. being an ordinary product. rising often to 8.000 pounds. and in some instances to 12.000 pounds. The average yield in Louisiana is from 500 to 2.000 pounds per acre. The foreign population of the islands is about 5.000. (onethird Chinese.) but of this number less than forty own and work the sugar estates. Practically the treaty is to be made for the benefit of these forty people. That sugar production has been profitable under more favorable conditions than exist elsewhere on the face of the globe is proved by the fact that the annual inorease of the island product has been very great. 1.444.271 pounds exported in 1860 and about 28.000.000 pounds in 1875. Mr. Nordhoff says. page 60. in his book on the Sandwich Islands: There are few legitimate branches of business in the world that could be managed as slovenly as sugarmaking in the islands and show such profits. and that sugarplanting can be carried on in the islands at a fair and satisfactory profit whenever skill and personal attention are given and due economy enforced. But. of course. as everywhere else. there is a desire on the part of those sugarpeople to make more money and to make business poorly managed profitable. And this they propose to do by asking the United States to admit the sugar product of the islands free of duty into our market without being subject to our taxes. The duties imposed on the import of such sugars as the Sandwich Islands are likely to send to the United States will be about two and a half cents per pound. which will be equivalont to a bounty of about 50 per cent. on the average market price at Honolulu. The import of sugar to the United States from these islands in 1875 was 8.944 tons. or. in round numbers. 17.888.000 pounds. on which. if the treaty had been in existence. a bounty would have accrued of about $400.000. while for this year the Secretary of the Treasury gives the import of sugar. without the treaty. at 24.850.438 pounds. which. were the treaty in force. would give the planters of these islands a bounty of $543.603. to be taken from our reveuue. Any business that guarantees 50 per cent. profit over and above a fair profit that now accrues independently. (for it is reasonable to suppose that the sugar product of the island would rot increase year by year under existing circumstances unless it was profitable.) is certain to increase just as fast as it possibly can. We may look with certainty. therefore. from the conclusion of this treaty. that the islands will send us the first year after ratification every pound of sugar they can spare over their own requirements for consumption. and continue to do so. not sending a pound to any other country. that the sugar product will increase to the utmost extent possible. and that we shall have an import equal to their entire sugar export. not less than 30.000.000 pounds. in 1875. on which a bounty would accrue of two and onehalf cents per pound. or $615.000. The area of arable land in the islands is limited. The Sandwich Islands commissioners think the product cannot be increased beyond 50.000.000 pounds per annum. Senator BooTm states on authority of California experts that the product can be pushed to 135.000.000 pounds per aunun. Mr. Nordhoff says there is room for about seventyfive to eighty more plantations on the scale now common. or about three times as many as now exist. It is therefore reasonable to assume that an import of at least 50.000.000 pounds. on which the United States would give a bounty and suffer a reduction of revenue from sugar to the extent of $1.200.000. may be anticipated. Can we afford to buy trade with. any country at any such rate? Can we not buy the markets of the world on such a basis? England. only a little farther distant from our Atlantic than these islands are from our Pacific coast. would certainly sell us hers at such a cost. What would we have to sell after paying such a bounty? At present the total trade of the islands with all foreign countries is less than $1.400.000 ($1.155.000 in 1873) per sunum. if we should get ib all we should. on the basis of the Treasury estimate of this fiscal year of the sugar import. pay $543.603 for it. If the sugar product and export of the islands increase but the lowest rate that can be anticipated. we should pay to these few planters. who are not Sandwich Islanders. a dollar for thie privilege of selling merchandise of the value of another dollar. or $1.200.000 on sugar alone for the privilege of selling and cxpotting to them $1.400.000 wortiof goods. Any counting asto the value of th profits of this export trade will show that we shall pay about five dollars for one to be received. This is reciprocity niostly on one side. and financiering with a vengeance. Can the nation. overborne and weighed down with taxation. afford to make a free gift of its revenues to a few people who pay no taxes to sustain our Government? What is it pretended that the islands can give us in return ? Their trade. But it has been shown that it does not amount to anything. and never can. of importance. Not as much as the trade of one good county or fourthrate city of the country. There is a log an imposing list of things mentioned in this treaty. which the Sandwich Islands will agree to take of us free of duty. Brick. for example. they took none in 1873. windowglass. fifteen boxes from the United States and one from somewhere else. machinery of all kinds. $14.000 worth about the cost of one good steamengine and boiler. iron and steel. J255.15 worth. paper. $700 worth. fancy goods and millinery. $4.458. agricultural implements. they took $5.562. They took more than $100.000 worth of clothing. about oneeleventh of their whole import : but clothing is not one of the things made free by the treaty. They took about $55.000 worth of liquors apd spirits. onetwentieth of their whole imports. but liquor and spirits are not to be on the free list. And so also are not furniture. carriages. other than agrlcultural. glass. crockery. paints. &c. The list of things to be admitted free is an imposing one. but an examination will show that it contains but little other than those things which the islands must take of us now because we can supply thoe cheaper than other nations. and a great many things like furs. rice. sugar. fruits. tallow. hides. oysters. fish. eggs. shrubs. trees. vegetables. &e.. which the islands supply themselves with. or do not want or could not be sent from the United States by reason of natural causes. The list of reciprocal goods bears the impress of humbug on its face. Will the Clerk read what was said of this treaty by a New England Senator when it was under consideration in the Senate?"},{"1":"1875","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I move to insert as an additional.section the following: That all corporations working mines of geld and silver. unpatented. on the public domain. producing over 1100.000 per annum. shall pay a tax of 5 pr cent. on their net yield. to be collected under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury shnall prescrihe. The Government is in a very unfortunate condition when is met with the necessity of taxing the labor of the country. The labor of a country should not. as a principle of government. ever be burdened. but should be let loose and invited to new fields of enterprise. The principle upon which the Government of the United States can tax a commodity produced by the labor of the country in any section of the Union. while it may not be in violation of the Constitution itself. certainly is in antagonism to the spirit of that instrument. The principle once recognized. gives into the power of a section of the country at any time to suppress and destroy the prosperity of an antagonistic section. or a section whose products may not be in accord with the sentiments of the majority. The principle of taxing cotton. for example. at the close of the war. one that the Government of the United States resorted to. underlies today the total wreck of fotune. the poverty. and I may say the disorder that exists in the Southern States. The Government of the United States undertook to tax all cotton produced in the United States. Cotton was only produced in certain States. It was the great staple of those States. �hat tax. which was levied by the Government. reduced the cotton States to the point of starvation. and it was not until the Governinent of the United States discovered that the people were absolutely in danger of starvation that they withdrew front their statutebook that most pernicious law taxing cotton. Now. you tax tobacco. yon tax whisky. -you follow the poor man in his toil. who cultivates the tobaccostalk. and you tax his labor. You go by the door of the rich. you leave the man whose income amounts to millions. having repealed. under the demands of public sentiment. the law taxing incomes. and say to him.  We will not tax you. You go and find the man who toils in the tobaccofield. and speak to him. saying.  Here the tax shall rest. It then. you cau go and follow the man who toils in the tobaccofield. if you can go andfind the plowman who turns the soil on the prairies of Illinois. and tax thus indirectly his corn. I point you to another field in which your investigations might flud a source of taxation. It is upon the public domain. worked by wealthy corporations. who are realizing millions from the public domain. who are exhausting the mines. and who are payilog nothing to the Government of the United States. Tlhere is a commodity that you may tax which does not tax the consumer. There you may tax what is produced from the soil. for lie digs the treasures from the soil. and it is from the soil of the nation. He brings up his millions. It is the product of the earth . it is the property of the nation. My amendment goes by the poor man who. with his own pick and shovel. is ther:e endeavoring to find for himself a fortune. It leaves the encouragement that exists today properly to the enterprise of mining. It touches no man who in his private capacity is toiling for the gold in the mines of Nevada and in the mines of California. Itonly goes to the wealthy corporations. It goes to the men of strength. it goes to the soulless corporation that digs up its millions. and says. Pay over to the Government of the United States 5 per cent. ofyonur net earnings. if your products shall be over $100.000 a year. If not $100.000 a year. the hand of the Government does not touch you. It still holds out the encouragement. it still speaks to the enterprising ininer. and says Go on. go oi. in accumulating your fortune. Mr. President. if this amendment be adopted it will bring into the Treasury of the United States at least $3.000.000 by way of revenue. The Cometoek lode alone. within the last twelve months. turned nlp. as the result of. combinatioa. as the wealth of corporations. front the public domain twenty millions of the precious treasure. Other corporations are extended over the country there. and this source of revenue will bring front the rich. It will bring from the strong. it will not tax the consumer. but will put $3.000.000 in your Treasury. How can you meet the man who toils in the cornfields. who toils in the tobaccofield. who by the sweat of his brow cultivates that which produces the staple that you tax. when you have passed by the mining corporations upon the public domain and have refused to tax them I I know the fact that the masses of men who are agriculturists are patient. They willendure. They are not so jealousof their rights as are the commercial interests of the country. They are patient. they will bear burdens. Burden after burden you may pile on themi. but there is a maximum of outrage and oppression that you cannt go beyond . there is a maxinmum that yon cannot overstep. In this tax that you levy now upon the tobacco and whisky. and a tax indirectly upon corn. you are about to go. in my humble opinion. above the maximum. above the line of safety. The principle is one that is dangerous. Suppose you were to levy a tax which would prohibit altogether the cultivation of tobacco. Yen can do it. If you can tax tobacco twentyfour cents a pond you can tax it twentyfour dollars a pound. If you cai tax tobacco. you can tax cotton. If you can tax cotton. you can tax rice. you can tax corn. and thus it is that you assert here a principle by which one section in this country can destroy and impoverish another."},{"1":"1874","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"If the Senator who has charge of this bill deems it his duty to proceed with it today I shall not make any opposition. but I would suggest to him. in view of the remarks he made yesterdayand no one could put theta betterthe desirableness of giving al hour to the Calendar and going on with unobjeeted eales. whereby we not only render justice to a great many parties. but save of the labor of committees which will be lost if we lose the present oppostunity.

I submit it.. however. entirely to the pleasure of the Senator from Vermont. 1 shall not oppose his motion."},{"1":"1873","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Air. President. I did not think. when this discussion commenced. that I would say a word. but having listened and reflected for several days. I feel called upon to state a few reasons for the votes I shall give in this case. I feel as much as any one the responsibility of those votes and of what I shall say. and in the outset I beg leave to remark that I feel bound by the Constitution of the United States. and the laws made in pursuance thereof. and the laws of the various States not in conflict therewith. The Constitution has made us jadges. and my idea of tme duty of ajudge has always been that he was bound by the law. that he could not look behind constitutions and laws. he could not say there were principles lying deeper than the constitutions and laws that were written. and exercise a diceretion in a ease where the law had pointed out the road. I have mistaken the duty of judges if they are at liberty to enact laws. find facts. render judlgment. and carry that judgmuent into execution when there is a road pointed out bylaws enacted for their guidance. The very law by which we exist as a body says wc shall judge of the election of members of the Senate. The ]angnago is. that each House shall judge of the election. &c.. but judgingof the election is the only point to which I now desire to call attention. Each htouse shall judge of tme election of its members. Under what laws must they judge ? I undertake to say that the character of jurisdiction conferred upon the House and upon the Senate is the same. The Senate are equally judges of the election with the House. and in determining the question they are governed by the same principles. If. in thu same language. a court is given jurisdictiou of commuon law and in equity. or is given jurisdiction of a dozen different things. the judge. when he comes to determine each particular case. must be governed by the law of that case. In the first place the Constitution declares that the members of the House of Represent.atives shall be elected by the same body of electors that elect the most numerous branch of the State legislature. Ioes anybody doubt that the State has the duthority to pass a law saying who shall vote for the most numerous branch of the State logislature? � Does anybody pretend that the lower House can go behind such a law I In many of the States it is provided that aliens who have declared their intention to become citizens may vote. Is not the House of Representatives. in judging of the election of member from such States. bound by that law ? In every State. I think. it is provided that votes procured by briberyshall not be counted. Can the House of Representatives go behind that law and count bribed votes? No. Suppose a State should become so degraded and immoral as to pass a law that votes should be counted notwithstanding the parties had been bribed. and Congress. having concurrent juris. diction to legislate as to the manner of the election. had passed n law on the subject. and that the State law was the only law on the. subject. would not that bind the lower House in determining the question. if they were disposed to be governed by the law ? Is it not within the jurisdiction of the States to pass such a law? If it is. it is not in the jurisdiction of any other body unless there be concur. rent jurisdiction. and if there be concurrent jurisdiction. and if Congress and the State shall concur in saying that a bribed vote shall be counted. what can the House of Representatives say? Would they not be bound by that law? Everybody must admit that they would le bound by such a law. and that they must administer it as they find it. Now comes the case of a Senator. which is precisely similar. I find that in the constitutioiv of the State of Kansas ii is provided thatEach house stall be the judge Of the election. cetura. anl qualifications of its own members. Is anybody prepared to say that that provision of the constitution of Kansas is in conflict with the Constitution of the United States I Is anybody prepared to say that any part of that jurisdiction given to each house of that legislature to judge of the qualifications of its own members has been conferred by the Constitution of the United States upon Congress. or the Senate. or anybody else ? Is not that an exclusive jurisdiction. to judge of the election and qualifications of its own members? Must it not be respected ? Sueh a provision is in every State constitution in the United States. It was in the State constitutions before the Federal Government was formed . it was in the State constitutions at the time the Government was formed. chat each house of the legislature should have that power. It is coutained in the constitution of every State which has been admitted since the formation of the Government. We have furthermore the tenth amendmont to the Constitution. which says that the powers which have not been expressly granted to theUnited States are reserved to the States or to the people. This was a promineit provision. a prominent power retained in these State constitutions which has been recognized from the foundation of the Government. Then will you say that each house of a Slate legislature shall no longer exorcise that power ? If each house of the legislature of Kansas has the right to judge of the election and qealifications of its members. what follows? It will be remembered that the judgment of a legislative body upon the election and qualification of its members is a continuing judgment. because it is provided in this very constitution that when a member ceases to have the right to act he may be expelled. If he has committed such acts as disqualify him. it is provided in the same constitution that he may be expelled. But. while he is there. it is the j udgment of the house that he has the right to be there and has the right to act. and that judgment is conclusive. If. in any law.i anyreport made to Congress or either House until this case came here. if anywhere in any written document or speech it can be found that the jurisdiction of each house of a Statelegislature todetermine the qualifications of its own members has been questioned. I should like to see it. It seems to me that the preposition is too near an axiom to need demonstration . and yet the report of the committee in this case seeks to question it. It says. notwithstandiug the two houses of the Kansaslegislature declare that their members who voted for CALDwiar were competent to sit there and were members. notwithstanding their judgment upon that point. the Senate can come in and say they were not competent to sit and act. Mr. President. there are a great many bad things in this world. there are a great many sins in the world. there are a great many wrongs in the world. but we cannot cure them all in one investigation. nor can the Senate take jurisdiction of everything in one investigation. nor can the Senate. for the purpose of getting at a wrong. or supposed wrong. afford to ride over the written law. which we are each sworn to respect. We have no mere. right to say that a member of the Kansas legislature was disqualified from voting. or that. if lie did vote. his vote shall not be counted. than we have to abolish the State of Kansas. The continuing act of that legislature in keeping him there is a declaration which it makes. and which it has the right to make. the same as the declaration that the Senate makes in keeping. CAr.uwvnL here. CALDWEL has a right to vote. Nobody has a right to question it. We are the exclusive judges. Suppose the House of Representatives should atteumpt to investigate the seats of members here. or suppose the Kansas legislature should do so. there is just as much authority for the Kansas legislature to investigate our right to vote hero as there is for us to investigate the right of a member to vote in the Kansas legislature. The States were made before the Constitution. They had that right then. and it has never been taken away from thien. If we can judge of the right of members of the legislature to vote. they can judge of our right by the same authority. We can do some things in judging of this election. What can we do ?. We can judge whether there is a State there that is entitled to elect a Senator. we cai count the votrs. ani Res if they were cast. we can ascertain the fact whether there was an army surrounding the legislature. and whether there was any election bold there. We cnr do nll those things. but when we come to say that we can doternine the right of a member of the legislature to sit there and vote. and have his vote counted. we are exceedinguoar jurisdiction. just as much as the legislature of Kansas would be exceeding its jurisdiction if it attempted to investigate our right to vote hero. I do not think. therefore. if this matter is to be discussed und decided upon law. that there can be a question that every member of the Kansas legislature who is decided by that legislature to be qualified and have the right to sit in that legislature. has the right to vote there. I do not think that question can be involved in any obscurity whatever. It is plain law. and when I have plain law I do not want to look to unwritten law. I am too fearful of my own ability. when the law is written. when constitutions are framed. when I air sworn to obey them. to look to sce unwritten law. or to enact a new law. and become reformer while arn judqe. I will not go over the precedents of this subject. The ease of Potter against Robbins. read by the Senator from New York. where all the best talent of the country concurred in the opinion that this was a question ont of our jurisdiction and within the jurisdiction of the State legislature. is the highest possible authority. will not refer to that case. because it has been already laid before the Senate. I will not revert to what was said in the report in that case. There are two reports subsequent to that. one that I believe I had the honor to submit from the Judiciary Comrittee. in which the former Senator from Illinois (M1r. Trumboll) concurred. in which the doctrine was laid down that each house of a State legislature was the exclusive judge of this question. I will not referto authorities on this subject. because there is no authority against that doctrine. There is no law for this assumption. and be who undertakes to say that we shall assume jurisdiction. undertakes to say that we shall make constitutions and laws. I would rather preserve what we have than take the chances of making more without authority to do so. I will not be a party to the making of law when I am called upon. under oath. to administer law. He who denies that each house of a State legislature has the right to judge of the election and qualifications of its own members and their authority to vote. assumes ai authority to make law. I concur with the Senator from New Jersey. [Mr. FRasLIaaucUYScJ ] that of all the organizations in the United States. we are the least fitted for the trial of such a case as thisfor the trial of a Senator for bribery. Our organization is least suited to such a case. While the Senator froe New Jersey was speaking I was reminded of the history of the English Parliamntn in dealing with this same question . and although the Senator subsequently informed me that lie had not read that history. and did not have it it mind. still the tenor of lig remarks seemed enforced by the legislative enactments and judicial decisions in England so clearly that it seemed as if he must be familiar with that whole history. They commenced. in the first place. as we are now commencing. without written law as to investigations of this kind. The lower House of Parliament then found that committees wore so illy organized for the purpose of performing this duty. that they undertook to regulate the subject by law. and they passed various statutes on the mode of parliamentary inquiry. and almost all their laws were intonded to confine the investigations to something like legal rules. Whatever you may say of England. Englishmen aire in favor of fair play. and they hate to convict a man unless he has had a fair hearing. They tried this committee business for centuries. they anicaded their laws. they amended their rules . they changed thorne oe way and another. attempting to get at something that would approxiiate atria wherein the accused rnd the aceitser could meet face to face. wherein the triers could see the witnesses and knoxv the facts. and. after celrturies of effort. in 186S. the English Parliament arrived at a conclusion that committees were act the proper tribunals to try these questions. I hold in my hand an act of Parliament which refers these matters to the courts. On the f1et of July. 1868. Parliament passed an act to increase the number of the judges of the courts of coinnrn law. ard to allow the judges thenselvesof the courts of Exchequer and Common Pleas to select of their nruror certain persons before whorn those cases should be tried. Thei it goes on to provide that the person acirsed shall have a trial. givirng the form. &e. . and. anrig tir most important. that the charges shall be specilied. and notice shall he givue to hinr. and the party bringig the charge Ahall give �1t.000 bail to make good that chlrge. In ordor that there may riot he shm charges brought. the party is required to give a bond of �t.000 that his complaint is made in good faith. Thei it is brought before the judge in open court. and the judge reserves questions of law that arise on the admissibility of evidence. which may be taken by writ of error to the court of Qncens Bench. so that the highest lawofficers ofthe government may determine whether the questions are admissiblo or not. Then a report is made to Parliament. and Parliament acts upon that report. It may reject it if it chooses. but it has the fact found. and the party accused is protected by all the forms of law. and the accuser has all the forms and machinery of judicial proceeding to prosecute his inquiry. which I say is jest anl right. That is what they caime to after centuries of investigation. Here we have a report. the first one of the hind that has ever been made in the Senate. which I regret that every member of the Senate has not read. and every lawyer in the country has not read. Let the lawyers of this country read that report. andif they do not say amun to the remarks of the Senator from New Jersey. I am listaken in the judgment of the legal profession. If this report does not demonstrate and illustrate the inefficiency and the inadequacy of a committee to protect the rights of a citizen and to investigate a question of this kind with any degree of fairness. illustration is impossible. the imagination of man cannot illustrate it. The bearsay. the scandal. the irrelevant matter. the spleen. and hate breathing through this report in one incoherent mass. without index or reference. are laid before us. with no knowledge of the previous character of the witnesses. except as exhibited here. and we are asked to judge of these facts. What more I We are asked to pronotnee judgment upon Lts whicl have not been declared illegal. that have not been made crimes. I call the attention of Senators to this fact : that we are about to legislate as to what is illegal and what are crimes. and to pronounce acts to be sowithout any authority for so doing. England felt this difficulty. It is not a new question there. but Parliament never went beyond what had been denounced by law as crime in dealing with these questions. The American Senate has never yet pronounced a judgment beyond the statute. We find in Parliament that from time to time they have increased the) number of acts which shall be regarded as bribery. First. the statute is directed against bribery. as we understand it. or the promise of any valuable thing or any office. Secondly. it is directed against giving any meat or drink or entertainiant of any kind to a voter. that is declared illegal and immoral by the statute. Parliament never undertook to pronounce judgment upon a case of that kind. upon the abstract question of morals. until there was a law that preceded it. One thing may be said in praise of the English government and those who have followed in the course of the common law. that they want the law to precede their judgment. and they want to follow the law. Before they would say that it was improper to give meat or drink or entertainment to voters for the purpose of procuring their votes. they placed it in an act of Parliament. Thirdly. they provide that no force. or violence. or restraint. or threat. or intimidation shall be used. Then they go on and provide against another thing. which you might not think was so bad. They provide agairst furnishing any inhabitant of any city. town. or place with a cockade. or mark of distinctio. or any refrsheinot. on the day of nomination or polling the vote. or of any appointment on such account. or on account of any cheering. bands of music. flags or banners. They prohibit these by act of Parliament. Those things are now regarded in England as immoral. things not to be done. They were so regarded before. but they passed a statute against thea before they would take any action punishing for their commission. . Is not that the fair way ? Is there not sonse sense in that! They do more. They also appoint officers to see that thecandidato only expends what he may legitimately. but they never punish him for experditures for purposes that have not by law been declared to be crimes. I think the history of the English procedure is most instructive. We are called upon hero to pass upon the quality of the act of using money at an election. Let us look at that for a moment. and I view it in the light of the English statute. It is perfectly safe. where we have got a statute declaring the use of money a crime. to fillow it . but. when we have got no statute. there will be as much differeirce of opinion as there are men as to how much money may be used. and when it uray be used. and in what mancer. It is undoubtedly true that money is improperly used in elections. When you contnence to use money to influlenice votes it is very hard to draw the distinction. Itmay be said that it is proper in the first place to hire persons to go cutaid canvass the voters and bring3ou a listof them. totildout how each pe proposes to vote. so as to bring influence to bear upon hinm. It may be said that it is proper to get up torchlight processions. and pay money for thom. The English statute holds that it is not. It may be proper for you to treat your friends. or give them sroney to treat themselves. and let them have a good time. The English statute says it is not. but it is done all over this country. It nray be proper to hire friends to go and make speeches and inflnuence votes in that way. Soie Inay thiule that proper. and it is done freqgnctly. It Rlay be 1roper. if you have got money enough. to buy the wholo press of your State. and derountco every otlrer irron who presumes to be a candidate as a rascal. and blacken his character and praise yourself through the columns of a bought. press. and thereby cripple and destroy the opposition. and ride into power s the popular favorite. That has been done. and will be done again. very likely. Now. I submit. is iot that act of the same character as tire act of buyirg off a candidate. when you buy up all the press. buy rip all the workers in the State in primaries. and go through that way ? If yen do not buy thein all off and only bay oils. te moral quallity of the tralsnetion is lhe same. It seems to rue there is too munch money used in elections everywhere. I think I see eiough in this ease in Kausas to call upon es to say that there should be a remndy. What is the remedy? What should be done? Is there any remedy for this evil? Yes. there is a. renteldy. and tait is in calling tire attentior of the country to it. and baiug a hetter state of public opituion on the subject. There is a remerdy in providirg statutes against it the same as England has adopted. Congress is not left witbont a re medy Cougress may regulate the manner of conducting senatorial elections just as it may regulate the manner of conducting a congressional election. I have in my hand an act which denounces as a crime any inter. ference with congressional elections or any bribery therein. Under the same language that gives as power to regulate the manner of senatorial elections. I undertake to say that Congress may pass laws denouncing bribery in senatorial elections. and may punish the hriber and the bribeo. They have undoubted power to do that. I think the time has arrived. judging from the condition of Kansas. which I shall alnde to presently. for us to take action in. a proper way. But those facts do not call upon us to violate the Constitution . they do not call upon us to destroy what we have that is good . they do not call upon us to pass from mere judges. and become lawmakers. and disregard our obligations to the Constitution asd the laws. I undertake to say that it is barbarous for us. as judges. to denonnce acts as bribery that are not qo declared by the statute. There are some remedies in this case. Why have they not been resorted to in Kansas? I hold in my hand a statute of Kansas pointed against bribery. It is a welldrawn act. I will not read it. It is the usual act against bribery. If Mr. CALDWELL has been gmilty of bribery. why has ha not been indicted there? Has he no enemiesI Has there been no effort to produce this book of evidence? Has there not been industry exhibited here--such industry as I never saw before ? Why did they not resort to the remedies of the law which were before them? Why did they not go before the grand jury that had the right to consider this matter? Why come here? If they had followed the constitutional mode. and Mr. CALDWIELL had been so unquestionably gailty as some Senators here assert. would there have been any difficalty during these two long years in having that record here ? Then we have already existing laws in Kansas against bribery. If need be. they nay pass more. Congress may pass its laws against bribery. The courts are open to try such a question. and if the record of conviction comes hero. there is no Senator who would hesitatc for one moment to expelMr. CALDwELL. Let them bring the record of conviction here. let theta do something analogous to what the English Parliament requires to be done in England before we are called upon to vote in a case like this. I am speaking now of expulsion . but both these propositions run upon the theory that something must be done. and done now. because here is a ease that demoralices tile people. Senators. this question of trying a loan on evidence is a serious business. I pat the questois. Has every Senator read this testimony? Does every Senator know anything about it? Is every Senator satisfied upon the particular facts? Is this case proved for any purpose beyond a reasonable doubt? Would yon not feel better satistied if it had been tried by a court and jury. and brought here in the usual forni. and we had the record of that trial and conviction? If it wetre your own case. would yen not prefer to have a fair trial by a court ? Are we to try a man upon such testimony as this ? If you do. ois your oaths you have got to find afirmatively that Mr. CALDIeT. is guilty before you undertake to expel him. you must find that affirinatively from the facts as here reported. Now. what are the facts? I wish to call the attention of the Senate for a few moments to them. I do think this is the most remarkable case that has ever come before us. The committee. after discussing the contract with Carney. and referring to the testimony of Mr. Spriggs. who appears to be the principal witness. say: The testimony of Mr. Spriggs is very full. and shows that the canvass of Mr. CAIMWELL was thorougmly corpt. ans that nioeoy was the chief argalnst relicd upon.

It seems to me that is enough. without going any further. to raise a dolb. and a pretty substantial doubt. when three nemibers of your committee dissent from the finding. But w are mnot left to that doubt. It is necessary to inquire who a fow of these men are amid ]low they came hero. and I wish to take up a few of these leading witnesscs. so thst the Senate can form semetihing of an idna of their notives. I want to show the Senate that they Camiot fsrns a sufficies. idea oil this testimony to do justice. lint I propose to refer to it so that they can form something of an idea. Who is Mr. Carney 9 Mr. Carney is the man who received the $15.000. Mr. Carney was t leading mnil in Kansas. He had been gsveroor of the State. Io was a prominent maln there. He was the recipient of the money under the bargaiu that makes my friend from New Jersey shudder to think of. and that makes his vote hang in the balance whether ti will not vote to expel Mr. CALDEsrL for that act. although the act has not been denounced by any statute on the books. It is an act so crimsiual per or that the Senate is deliberating now whether it will not expel Mr. CALDwELL for it. although there was no statute to male it crinsinal . an aet which we are now discussing as to whether it is not so bad that we will expel Mr. CALDWELL for being a party to it. Mr. Carney was a party to that act. and lie was the recipient of the money. There may be sio differeice between the briber and the bribeo in law. bat everybody knows there is in the estimation of society. A mani who will sell himself for paltry gold is itater than tie mati who buys him. So society believes. In law. the crime is the same. but in grade of morals everybody klows that a mats who will receive money lor doing a dirty thing is lower in the estimation of all men than the man who pays it. I am not referrilig to the buying of an ignorant mas. but to the bnying of a uton like Carney. who had been governor of his State. What else did Mr. Carney 1o? tie not only took this $15.000. but he wet. to Topeka. The headquarters of the lobby there were in his room. He was fautiliar with every transaction. and testifies about them in great detail. He does not tell you thit lie protested agaiist the proceedings. Ois the contrary. lie was the head and front. bite leading friend of CALWitEL in the affair. If this act be criminal. then the statements of Mr. Carney. without regard to it. should be taken with soudeslegree of allawiance. If there was wholesale bribery of the legislature. the statements of the mas in whoso riom it was done should be taken with some degree of allowance. The law has guartLed against that kind of testinmony and the law is a safe guide to fellow. It is one of the fundamental prisciples of law that this kind of testimony shall be taken with great caution. I asl flow discussing it ott the hypaothesis that the report is true. that these nets were criminal. that there wits bribery. or that the acts were so tterly disgraefnsl that We are called upon to pronounce tise law in advance sipon them. Ir that is so. Carney is the bead and front of the whole of them. Greenleaf on Evidence lays down a rule like this: lt hers. also. as we have before remarked in regard to admissions. the evieence of verbal cnfessions of gist is to be received with great catais. For. besides the danger of mistake. teom itile tsinals]resio of witnesses. the nsisso of words. the faihiro of the party to express his cwn measning. and the isnfirisity isf iuenOsy. it should be recolleted that the miund of the prisoner hisnself is oppressed by thie calamity of his situation. nd that be is otten infloenestl by msoties of hope or fear to sms e all untrue coifession. That is in regard to the confession of a criminal. It is not the quotation I intended to read. but it is applicahle to ttis case. becase it is all made out by the cosfession of CALDWE:LL. detailed to ts by Carucy. That is the substantial prt of it Now let is look at the next witness. anid the one who is put in the foreground in this report. and that is Spriggs. Who is Spriggs 7 Spriggs was a friend of Carneys. asnd when Carney swore that CALDWELL was a good muan to make Senator. Spriggs reechoed the sante thing. Spriggs was then for tin. He went to Topeka to work for him. He as a meiber of the committee avhicli it was said wits formed. ail lie swears that lie par isipated in the whole thing as a friend of Carneys. or at tim esolicitatio of Carie3y. and heljsed to make the light. bet when Carney turis aglinst CAT.w tsDsELL aln Olies here to denounce hiun. Spriggs does the samte thing. lie appears simply as the shadow of Carney. Spriggs goes on to say that it was after Carney had invited him to do so. asnd? after consultation with and at the request of Governor Carnoy. that he supportd CALDWEiL. So that in reality there was but one ain. Spriggs and Carney ire Corney alosne. They ar one. Now we come to Sidney Clarke. the prosecutor in this case. The important part that Sidney Clarke has phayedi in this transaction is illustrated by the committee. They say this: Air. Clarke was unwilling to admit that aie hal siade an agreement to transfer his ftionds to Mr. CALDnIoL is consideration of tbhe lattera promise to pay this moneyThat is. $15.000 to be paid to secure the friends of Mr. Clarkeisat tkling all the testiiony together. the eemmittee have ao doubt tsat the trans. notion setweon him asnd Mr. Clarke wass lnse hs n stated. Air. CALuWtaLLoS sub. setuint refusal to paty ytis musa toi Mr. Clarke toes not rolies ethe .hriater of the transaetion. aind very probably resultol in tbo exposure of Mr. CALoiaLL and the institution of this examination. The committee themselves say. and there is more testimony to supbort that allegation than any otler. that this in vestigatio is brouglit here becasase C xDWIs. reassed imt 1tpay Clarce $15.000. That is the way it came lre. That is the way chic exposure cause out. Do yonwani a bsetter cimmnctary upon the character of Clarke than that I Could I say anything as severe of Clarke as this committee has done I Is it possible that a matns who has been a meuiber of Congress. and hsts bsteen rocognizd as mess ]ltuoralo gentleman. and has ben truetel by his Sttte. shounlI be infilenocet l b such ia tlise? The conUuiittUeU fim. and tle toStinotiy siosvs. that lie instigatel this investigation beCause Air. CALDWELL wonld not stand this blackmaiIl. What does Mr. Clarke say with regard to it ? He sa V that after the decision of his friends had boon made that he was not to be a candilate. that lie could iotsuceeldr. CALDWELL proposed to pay Isis expenses. and he indignaatly refused . that he made ue such arrangeenint. that lie had no power to make any arrangement to help CALDWELL. that his friends left him and he had none. but that he told CALDWELL that Stevens was a friend of his. and that Stevens and CALDWELL had some arrangement. le admits that lie came here and attempted to collect money under that arrangement. and finally admits that he was to have the money himself. That is the testimony. Clarke swears in the first place that he had no contract with CALDWELL. but had it fixed up by a gobetween. and because CALDWELL would not come out with $15.000. we have this prosecution. These are the three leading men in the transaction. There is one otherAnthony. Let us look at Anthony Anthony was a lifelong enemy. as he himself admits. of CALDWELL. What does Anthony say ? That he had conversation with CALDWELL about supporting him. Anthony was a newspaper man. and he says that CALDWELL offered for his support to pay him after the election $5.000. that he refused to take the $5.000 on tick. but if CALnwELL had paid him the $5.000 he would have supported him. He says lIe was willing to negotiate for $5.000 to support CALDWELL.. So that. in slang languag. he was on the sell. and wanted $5.000. and would have supported CALDWILL for that amount. There you can see the malignity of this man. It is a mistake to say that Anthony corroborates the statement of Carney as to the transaction with Buyers. The report says that Anthony testified that CALDWELL admitted to him that he had agreed to paty Bayers $2.500. and that Carney stated the same thing. Carney does state that. Anthony does not state it. Anthony. in an angry conversation with CALDWELL. told him that he had raised the price of Buyers on him by telling Buyers his vote was worth $.000 and insisting that Buyers should demand $5.000. and all the evidence shows is that CALDWELL denied that lie hal raised the price on him. from which Anthony inferred and testified that the price was $3.000not $2.500. but $3.000because CALDWELL denied what he said. that he bad raised the price on him. aud thou he said that the prite was what Byers stated to him3.000. That was the admsission of CATnwins. and that ii s Pu In as a couroboratlug circumstance to sustain Carney upon the only point on which he is not contralicted. Oil every other cue lie is contradicted. This testimony comes to us in this way. The men who testified to it were a part of the lobby. If there was money distributed. they were the men who distributed it. who saw it and knew it. and were of the transaction. They implicate a largo nnuber of persons iiu this transaction . men that we have no means of knowing hew they stand. They deny it. It is Paid by the committee that the parties inculpated deny it. tere are A. B. aud C. stating that they were a part of the corrupt transaction. that they were lobbying. that money was used. that they were engaged in this fight. that they wore helping it through. all except Anthony. lie did not engage in it. but was willing to do so for $5.000. All these men. we know from the testimony. were engaged in these transactions. They accuse CALDWELTr andi maity otlhers. and Mr. CALDWELL and the others deny the accusations. and but a bare majority of your committee believe them. Now. can yon say in this condition of things that a case has been made for the action of this Senate for expulsion T I do not believe there is a Senator who can say that upon this question of bribery Mr. CALDWELL has had a fair tria. I do. not believe there is a Soitor here who will cot admit that this book is fall of hearsay asd irrelevant testimony. I do not believe there is a Senator here who will pretend that as to any particular ease the facts have been developed so that he understaids them. asd. remark. bribery must le proved. it cannot be presumed. I do not believe there is a Senator here who can suy it is roved ill a single instance. It is simply aseued without proof. I do not believe in establishing a precedent whereby a question of this kind. that is so peculiarly within the jurisdiction of a court and jury to find the facts. where all parties can be heard. should be brought here and be disposed of on hearsay testimony. and bronght here by men who were engaged in the transaction atni got madl because they did not get more money. and who then undertake to unseat this man for that reason. There is testimony in this record that Governor Carney threatened to insert Mr. CALDWELL for grievaucos. There is rauch feeling on his part. There is testimony in this record with regard to Clarke that ho caime here to get $15.000. and the committee report that because lie ilid not get it. he instigated these proceedings. He appears as a witness in iany places in this record. There is testimony in this record that every puominunt witness on whom any reliance is placed was a uore parliceps crissdii if there was crime. and is now testifying against his associates. That is the condition of things. I do not say that that should exonerate CALDWELL. but I do Sty that it is a case that should be tried by a jury who know the parties. I could judge of this better if I were a Kansas man. I should like to hear the Senator from Kausas who is not implicated in the matter give us some Statemenut as to the charactor of these men. I hope we shall hertr framn hint. so that we call judge oftheir credibility if any Senator is inclined to veto upon this evi ince. Remember. Senators. if you vote to expel this man. or put him out in any way. you must vote aliruatively on the facts here presuted. I undertake to say that there is no finding. in the record. except in the case of the transaction with Carney. upoi which a fairminded nin can say that he is satisfied. All this illustrastes the wisdom of the position of issy friend from New Jersey. [Mr. FaaLrNwnuysN.] that we should not seek for jurisdiction in such notters. we sioi not sock for iuvestigations. that we should confine ourselves to the duty which the Constitution has imposed. that we should not seek to enlarge our jurisdiction to do a thing that we are doing so badly. It the length of time that we have spout in this case. if it were before a court and jury. with the witnesses before them. so that the jury could see theis. there would have been more of the merits of the case developed in one day than we have developed altogether. This money transaction in connection with the election is certainly very bad. it certainly calls for the action of Kansas. it is certainly imumoral. it calls for the action of the legislature to pass further laws. and I believe it calls for a law of Conguss. it calls for public opinion to stop it. and it calls for laws to stop other acts in regard to the use of tooney in elections. it calls for a stop being put to the extravagant use of money for any purpose. I say that too much money is used in America. toe much is collected. too much is ceontribnted. We are too apt to say that Mr. A.T. Stewart or some other great merchant has contributed largely to carry the party through a canspaign. We are too much inclined to praise them for thes6 things. The highest men in the country contribute money to carry elections. and their names are ostentatiously paraded in the public press as benefactors. There is too much said in favor of that practice. and net enongh against it. Money will be used while public opinion tolerates it. while the press lands those who contribute largely. and while it is the road to power. Can you be surprised. while the high tid the low mark this out as the road to power. that a merchant inexperieced in politics. who has been a business man all his life. .vho sees that these largo sums are contributed. aud that those who contribute them receive praise. should think that money may be used. and so fall into the trap I Let those who are wiser. those who have had more experience in politics. than CALDWELL. cease to collect money. and to use money at pfimary elections. which is worse than using it on Carney. because there you deal with a different class of men and corrupt them. I do not think Carney himself was much worse after this transaction than before. lie undorstood the act very well. But I say buying up the people. using large conts of money by which to corrupt the masses. is worse than this Carney transaction. In some respects this matter of Carneys is not so bad. If he had any chance of being elected to the Senate. CALDWItLL has half redeemed himself even with money by keeping Carney out. Buying off rival candidates will never preventagood man from coiing to the Senate. lnt you have made. and your pablie press makes. an ostentatious parade of the use of musony. Yon edl for it in your political commuittees. nd you use it to carry eleetiots. and I say the tiase has coit when it should be stopped. There is no use in making a Scaperoat Of CALDWELl. or any particular mats about the business. rhe whole system of sitg money should be stepped. Do as the Euglish Parliament did when they foend that the use of money was demoralizing. Did they punish a mn for it because it was demoralizing ? No. they passed a law agaitst it. denouncing it as a crime. and then punished a mait if he violated that law. They passed no ex post facto law. While the use of money is sanctioned in general eleetious. ambitions men will use it and it is no worse to use $40.000 or $50.000 than $10.000 or $5.000 or $.OO. if it accomplishes the same purpose and gets a man into the Seiate. No matter whether it is used outside of what is denounced as bribery by the lawit is no matter where you use it if it accomplishes that same purpose. Use it on the press. and you will be regarded as a groat patriot. be lauded every morning. and hoar your editors praise you. and be happy. and say you are virtons. Use it tn the masses. and pay workers to go around and sing your praises. pay it to eloquent orators. and send them forth for the purpose of bringing votes to you. and no complaint is made. I do not meatn to say. nor htis the English law said. that there may not be proper uses of money. that expenses rsay not be paid. and there shenld be sonic understanlding about it. I do not say that you may not contribtte to men who are giving their time to elections to pay their expenee whln they stake canpaigns. But the idea thatmoney may be used in any way. tat it may be used on the press in any way. that it may be used on workers in ait election. that i. tay be used oil primaries. and that Iunidreds of thousands of dollars may be used in a campaign. and that it must be used. and that men who do not contribute are mean. is to be condemned. Anybody that does not think such practices will produce just such a case as this of Mr. CALI)W..LL does not know the American people. Public sentiment nust be changed on this question . but there is no use in breaking down the laws of the cos try . thereis lio tise it inaking another Counstitution . there is no necessity to .ay we Will not obey the law as it. is written. At the next sossies of Congress we usay pass a law against bribery. Lot that be discussed and pissed. and it will have this effect. and let the press proclaim gainst the use of muony at all in elections. Let those who are strong snd popular in their States and have been honored by their constituents stand up and say that they will not contribute ntd that money sli ll not be contributed to their election. and that they will not have an election if iiotey is used. Let an effort i.0 made in the right direction. Bat to accomplish this you do not wrslsi to convict %s man on doubtful testimony. you do not want to convict a man by the nssertions of coconspirators that he has committed a crime. and that upon hearsay which is denied by a large numnber of citizens. and you cannot tell who is the most trustworthy. Do not convict a man for using nency in the same line atd where there is no moral distinction between what he has done and what others have done. hut do as has been done since the common law has been in force: if there is an evil that is likely to demoralize tho country. proclaim against it. legislate against it. and then enforce your laws. and you cal then act as honest judges. men who can say. We have administered the law. What Senator here. upon hearsay testimony that he never heard. that isreported in this book. full of spleen and malice and selfishness and spite. what Senator. I say. can take up that book ans say. Upon that I will pronounce judgment upon this man. I will convict this man because polities are getting too corrupt? What Senator can say that andreeonnilot jto his conscience? I tell you. fellowSenators. that CaLDwELL hasonTy done in a little exaggerated degree what is too prevalent in this country. I believe that the American people are going to be waked up to this question of using nmoney in elections. I believe it must and will be stopped. I believe the time will coe when it will be regarded improper for a candidate for the high place which we occupy to pay so much attention to primaries and pay so nmch attention to conventions. to pay so much attention to details. to make so many promises of appointments to office. to hold out so many indceemonte. I believe the time will come when such menus and the use of money will be condemned. I think that the CALDWELL case will not be without its good effect. 1 think the malice of Clarke and the vengeance of Carney will do something to clear the atmosphere. but I do not believe it will make us pass the resolution of this committee in violation of the plain law. I do not believe it will make us pass a resolution of expulsion upon doubtful. hearsay evidence. when we read in the Constitution that no man shall be convicted without due process of law. We remember that a fair trial has heen the pride of our race from time immemorial. that a fair trial is the boast of Americans . that we have pisrvidoi for it in our Constitution. that States put the principle in their constitutions. Shall aSeuator of the United States be denied a fair trial ? Shall henot be confronted with his accusers. the jury that are to pass apon the facts ? May not that jury sen the witnesses ? Must he be tried on dopositions? I say that fair trials are the boast of our free institutions. Let ts preserve that. it is usefil. let us preserve asystem of fair play and fair trial. It is useful. IftKansa believes this man guilty of bribery. she has it in her power to scud us a record at the next session upon which there will be no doubt. But what do the committee say ? They say this man was as mitch sinned against as sinning. What! a man who is to bc branded as a felon. and expelled from this presence. and carry the mark of Cain through all his life. as much sinned against as sinuing ? I waut to vote against a man who has sinned more than he has been sinned against. I want to vote against a man that has sinned more against the laws and the Government of the United States than he has been sinned against. If lie is a criminal. if he has committed bribery. why talk .about sinning against him ? Why talk of sinning against a mati with sifficient intelligence to hold a place in these halls. nr to get here? .Why talk about sinning against him if he is guilty enough to expel from this presenee? If I am called upon to vote oni the question of expellin any man from these halls. I will obey the laws and my own conscience. 1 will not. by any outside pressure or influence. voto to expel a man that I am not satisfied beyond a reasouable don bt is guilty of the offense. I think the rule suggested by the Senator from New Jersey was admirable. I think the question of expulsion should never be considered except upon a record of conviction. or the notorious fact of committing an offense upon which there could be ino doubt. I think that oneor theother should occur. and that we should not usurp jurisdiction in a doubtful ease when we do not havethe witnesses betore us. where there is nothing like a fair trial . where not half the Senators have read the testimony. I tried to read it twice. I cannot judge of it as I would if I saw a single witness. I know that it has embarrassed the committee. it has divided them as nearly equal as they could be. This is not the case for such a sacrifice. I believe. as alawyer. that before any court. upon this testimony. with twelve honest men in the box. I care not what their feelings might be when they entered the jurybox. they would acquit. I would tudertake to defend npon this testiniony. there would not be musch of it in. I ktow. because most of it would not be admitted. but for what legal testimony could get in before a jury. I do nob believe they would be called upon to leave the box. 1 have had some little experience in trials by jury. I have acted as prosecutor. and I have defended. but never in my life did I hear a proposition like this advanced as in the case of Spriggss testimony. He is called to prove the declarations of T. J. Anderson. The foundation is laid by asking if Anderson was a frioind of CALDWnEL. The witness testifies that Anderson was a friend of CALDWELL. Then they go on and allow hint to say what this other person. Audersot. CALDWELLs friend. said. these statements are allowed to be given in evideeeconversations between third parties. with whom CAnsWELL had no connection. The fact that he ic a friend of CALDWELL is sufficient to make his declarations evidence. Threefourths of the whole book is front declarations received from aten who qualifled themselves to testify by swearing that the declarations they were going to detail were made by a friend of CALIDWELL: It utay be cvll to look at a single Case. If I can turn to Spriggss case. I think it will illustrate the whole matter: a Question. Now. Mtr. Sprigge. state to the committee what you know. if anything. in regard to tie use of nioly. or other coit means. on the part of Mr. CALeWiIa. to proeure his electdon. Aner. rsonilly. I dont know anything directly of my own knowledge. Question. Lot us see how. whe you come to it. What do you know about it ? Answer. All t know is what other men told me who talkedabout it. Question. Whom did you have conversations with in regard to it ? Answer. I hald conversations with quite a number of etenwith George Smith. that these other geontlemen have testified about. and Len. T. Smith. Question. What was the onverosation with Georgo Smith abot I Answer. It was in regard to the elecctio of Mr. ALDwem. Question. Was it in regard to the use of money I That is not leading. of course ! Answer. Yes. sir. some of it was. Question. in what capacity was George Smith there? Answer. George Smith was there working for the election of Mr. CALDWeL. Question. Was he a prominent friend of Mr. CAe.nwoc.LI Answer. He was a very active friend. I will say. Questie. Was he recognized there as one of Mr. CAlnWuEr active friends ? Answer. Yes. sir. t1. CAisIMA. Now it will be for the committee to say whetmer a foundation is laid for introducing Mr. Georgo Sinitm statements. taken in connection with what has beta said before. The e0uestion being put. the committee eoncurred that the statoment should be They got a heap of testimony it that way. He was known as an active friEld Of CALnWreL. Where does this come from ? Prom SpriggsCarneys mat Spriggswho was a friend of OALDWELL when Carney was. and an enemy 0fCALDWELL when Carney was. Do you want that for a precedent to try a mail by ? Do you want men to come here. and have one loafer swear that he heard another loafer say somethingif they be loafers. I do not say they are. Some of themn showed themselves to be pretty rough characters. There is Carson. who figures largely in the report. He got a thousand dollars to give another man. antd put it in Ise own pocket ! Such non have conversations among themselves of which Mr. CALDWELL knows nothing. yet lie is to be hold responsible for such idle or vicious talk. The idea of the Setate being competent to try any such proceeding as this is stterly out f the question. you cannot got at the truth of it. You violate law and your own conscience by trying to get at it in any way. and it will degrade you to put this mni suit in this way when every soul in Kansas knows he is a better man than any one of his persecutors."}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
