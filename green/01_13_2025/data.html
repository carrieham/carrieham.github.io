I thank my good friend. Congressman Joyce for leading the Special Order this evening. Mr. Speaker. over the last 3 years. we have seen the Biden administration oppose American energy production at every turn. Bidens most recent announcement not only undermines our energy sector. but also endangers our allies overseas. Since Putin began his invasion of Ukraine. our European allies have raced to transition away from Russian energy by importing clean American LNG. The administrations shortsighted. dangerous decision accomplishes one thing and one thing only: empowering Russia. Claiming that this decision is based solely on protecting the environment is just absurd. Because of natural gas. the United States has reduced its own emissions more than any country in the world over the last 20 years. The Presidents ban on new LNG export projects is not an environmental decision. it is a political decision. Rather than holding countries like China and Russia accountable. President Biden would rather appease climate activists who are determined to ban fossil fuels at all costs. This latest announcement hurts producers here in America. in Ohio. the thousands of men and women working to keep our lights on every day. and throttles investment in clean American energy. Simply put. by freezing LNG export permits. the President is putting election year politics ahead of the interests of American workers. consumers. and allies abroad."},{"1":"2023","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I rise today to highlight one of the crises that we are facing in our country. and it is obvious to so many--except. unfortunately. so many in this House--that we have a crisis at our southern border. We have not only seen over 4.7 million people cross illegally. many of whom are claiming asylum despite not qualifying for asylum. but we are also seeing record levels of fentanyl killing so many Americans each and every single day. We must take a stand to secure our border to stop this flow of illegal drugs. to stop this mass illegal migration. When you talk about the number of 4.7 million. when you think about the number of people who have actually evaded our government. who have evaded any interaction with our law enforcement and CBP agents. you are talking about 1.2 million people. That is more than twice the size of Staten Island. the borough in New York City I represent. It is outrageous to think that we would have individuals entering our country illegally. and we dont know what their intentions are. where they are coming from. why they are here. That is what scares me the most as an individual who represents the city of New York. We know that 98 suspected terrorists on our terrorist watch list crossed the border last fiscal year. and we know. so far this year. there have been another 38. That should be alarming to every single person in this country. We must know who is entering our country and what their intentions are. To allow this amount of people to evade law enforcement. to evade any interaction with our government. is a very dangerous action on behalf of this administration. House Republicans believe that Secretary Mayorkas has completely abdicated his responsibility to keep our country secure. and we will be moving forward with hearings to expose what he is doing. I do believe at the end of the day it warrants him being impeached and removed from his position. Also. I highlight how the Federal Governments lack of action at the border. coupled with my State legislatures and Governors horrible actions in New York. have led to what we are seeing now in terms of a rise in crime. First of all. New York is dealing with major actions in terms of crime. car thefts. people being released. In fact. I just read yesterday that. in my district. a 20-year-old guy who has been stealing cars is being released right back onto the streets. It has been about three times. The first time he was arrested. it was for 20 counts of car theft. Lets now look at what we are doing here. When I went down to Federal Plaza and met with our ICE officials. they are saying that New York City is not cooperating with any detainer requests for people who are criminals. That means they either were convicted of a crime in their home country or were convicted of a crime here. It is the worst of the worst in society that ICE is trying to remove from our country. and our local officials wont cooperate. I think it is outrageous that the city of New York continues to harbor people who are not only in this country illegally but are committing crimes on top of it. Just the other day. New York City residents found out that they are paying to house. paying to feed. paying to provide services to individuals who were shoplifting in our State. Think about that. Not only are they crossing into our country illegally. but after committing crimes. they were released back onto the street thanks to our States ridiculous bail law. and on top of it. the taxpayers of the city of New York are paying to house and feed them. How does that make any sense. and how is that in the best interests of our citizens? I am the daughter of immigrants. I understand and appreciate the aspirations of the American Dream. We need to work together to address what is happening at our border. We need to work together to ensure that those legitimate asylum seekers are not getting stuck in the bureaucracy and the red tape because of those individuals who are here claiming asylum when they dont qualify. We have to work on our visa system to ensure that we address the labor shortage. We should have more visas. employee-sponsored visas. and family-sponsored immigration. as well. I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure our border. Lets impose some common sense."},{"1":"2022","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Madam Speaker. I thank the gentleman for yielding. and I thank him for his leadership on a very important subcommittee of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. the Railroads. Pipelines. and Hazardous Materials Subcommittee. which is the subcommittee of jurisdiction for the legislation that we are considering today. Madam Speaker. I thank the chairman of the full committee. Chairman Peter DeFazio of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. for his outstanding leadership for over 30 years in the Congress of the United States. He has been a champion for Americas working families. He has been a person about the future. We have been blessed by his leadership. I commend Chairman Jim McGovern of the Rules Committee for steering this urgent and necessary legislation to the floor in such an expeditious and effective manner. Madam Speaker. under President Joe Biden. we have had the most pro- union administration in history. Indeed. he chose a Labor Secretary in Secretary Marty Walsh who has deep personal roots in organized labor. joining the Laborers Union 223 at age 21. eventually rising to serve as the head of the Boston Building Trades before he became mayor of Boston. { Together. the White House. the administration. and the Congress. we have proudly stood with working people. Under President Biden and our pro-union Democratic majority. we were able to protect pensions. promote the PRO Act for collective bargaining and create good-paying. Davis-Bacon jobs in the infrastructure bill and the CHIPS and science law and additional legislation. because we believe that the middle class is the backbone of our democracy. and we believe that the middle class has a union label on it. Madam Speaker. today. we are here to safeguard the financial security of Americas families. to protect the American economy as it continues to recover. and avert a devastating nationwide rail shutdown. We all know that for too long the railroads have made obscene profits on the backs of workers. Selling out to Wall Street and its outrageous precision scheduled railroading. they have slashed jobs. increased hours. and cut corners on safety. while demanding more and more from the workers. Rather than reinvesting their profits into the workers. over the past decade they have given $150 billion in handouts to their corporate executives and wealthiest investors. It is just not right. That is why relentless labor leaders like Dennis Pierce and Jeremy Ferguson. whom I saw close up and watched them fight for their union members. among others--alongside our pro-union President Joe Biden and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh. as I referenced--fought furiously to negotiate a fairer deal for railroad workers. Thanks to their months of determined leadership. the tentative agreement that was reached has secured important advances: A 24 percent pay raise and a $5.000 bonus. no changes in copays. deductibles. and coinsurance costs. and protecting the two-man crew--protecting the two-man. very important. But we know much more needs to be done for railroad workers. It is outrageous that every developed country in the world has paid sick leave except the United States of America. No one should be at risk of losing his or her job by staying home when sick. needing to see a doctor. or getting lifesaving surgery. So it is progress that the agreement provides some time off for routine. preventative. and emergency medical care. But what we need is paid sick leave for railroad workers and for every American. I hear this every place I go. not just with the railroads. But these railroad workers. they are very skilled. Their work is challenging. has some danger. They need to have these very talented workers. and yet. they are willing to let them go if they miss a few days of work because of having to get a checkup or something. Going to see a proctologist is not a reason why people would take a day off. They do that because they have to. So today. the House will take two important actions. First. we will pass shutdown-averting legislation to adopt the tentative agreement. as negotiated by the railroad companies and labor leaders. and again. with the administration at the table. Then we will have a separate. up-or-down vote to add 7 days of paid sick leave to the tentative agreement. It had always been our intention to do. We are doing it on the same day because of the end of session. Doing so fulfills our authority and responsibility under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution: To ensure the uninterrupted operation of critical transportation services. that is our responsibility as we fight for a fairer future for our workers. Let me be clear: A nationwide rail shutdown would be catastrophic. A shutdown would grind our economy to a halt. and every family would feel the strain. As many as 765.000 workers. including many union members. would lose their jobs in just the first 2 weeks. Experts project it would cost the economy up to $2 billion a day and raise prices on consumer products. Families wouldnt be able to buy groceries or lifesaving medications because it would be even more expensive. and perishable goods would spoil before reaching shelves. That is why so many Members are saying we have got to avert a shutdown because we have got to get produce to market in our farm communities. Communities wouldnt be able to get chlorine to keep their water safe and clean. and small businesses wouldnt be able to get their products to market. many of them. as I say. farmers. Time is of the essence. We must act now. I urge a strong. bipartisan yes vote on both adopting the tentative agreement and securing additional paid sick leave. In doing so. we will give our families and businesses confidence that the American economy will remain resilient and strong. and we move to enhance the dignity and the economic security of many hardworking Americans who keep our Nation on the move. Our Nations hopes. really. are riding on this vote. I urge a very strong yes on both bills and both votes."},{"1":"2021","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Madam Speaker. I thank the gentleman from the great State of New York for his leadership. In such a short period of time. what he has demonstrated to all of us about being a leader. I applaud him for this. I am pleased to join with my colleagues in the Progressive Caucus as we continue to advocate for President Bidens American Families Plan and investing in the care economy. That means things like funding for high-quality. affordable childcare. including universal pre-K. making sure that childcare costs do not exceed 7 percent of income for working families. ensuring that childcare workers. who are largely women and people of color. have a $15 minimum wage--let me repeat that--ensuring that childcare workers. who are largely women and people of color. have a $15 minimum wage. and meaningful investments in Medicare home and community-based services. which would help workers in the home care industry. Everyone would like to say they are pro-family and pro-children. This is the chance to prove it. Earlier this month. I joined with SEIU members in Philadelphia to rally for passing $400 billion for caregiving. I told them funding for childcare and other caregiving is essential. since we actually want people to be able to go back to work. We started this year off big and bold with $1.9 trillion in the American Rescue Plan. That was a big step in the right direction. It was a down payment. The American people voted into office a Democratic President. a Democratic Senate. and a Democratic House. As we promise to build back better. they expect us to do more than just reset the calendar to February 2020. The old normal wasnt so great for millions of Americans. including many Philadelphians I represent. They deserve better than the old normal. The American Families Plan would do a lot to deliver on our promise. Lets get it done. Again. I thank Mr. Bowman for his leadership and the importance of this leadership and all the members of the Progressive Caucus demonstrating how we are going to lead the charge."},{"1":"2020","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. finally. on Veterans Day. tomorrow. we will all proudly observe Veterans Day. a chance to honor our veterans-- heroes who come from every walk of life. every color and creed. joined by a common love of country and an uncommon love for their fellow Americans. This week. we say again thank you. thank you. thank you to every veteran for their service. Like so many things this year. Veterans Day will be different. We cannot come together as we would normally do. We hold in our thoughts and prayers the veterans across the United States whose lives have been touched by this awful disease. and we give special thanks to many veterans who work as teachers. healthcare workers. doctors. nurses. and community leaders--the very heroes. in a different sense. who are keeping our communities going during these tough times. We in the Senate have a solemn responsibility to make sure they continue to get the help they need. Finally. it is always a little different when we observe a Veterans Day in the aftermath of an election. We must never forget our freedoms--to speak freely. to assemble peaceably. to choose our leaders. and forge our destiny--have been secured. time and time again. by the sacrifice of Americans who have worn the uniform. I yield the floor."},{"1":"2019","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. I rise to speak on U.S. national defense. In the last couple of years. we have made tremendous progress in strengthening our military and have effectively realigned our global posture and strategy. Under the new national defense strategy. the United States has rightfully recognized the return to great power competition. where our priorities have shifted from low-intensity conflict to posturing against peer and near-peer adversaries. Over the last 17 years of combat in the Middle East. U.S. dominance and deterrence against great power competitors have diminished. Meanwhile. nations like China and Russia have undertaken extraordinary military modernization efforts while engaging in unprecedented and destabilizing aggression. We have seen Russian intrusions in cyberspace. the illegal annexation of Crimea. information attacks on Western democratic institutions. and the spread of lies. half-truths. and slander in order to sow division and chaos between the United States and other partners. These gray-zone activities. which are actions below the level that would provoke an armed conflict. have gone mainly unchecked by the United States. which has set a troubling precedent and only serve to encourage further provocation. From China. we see these gray-zone techniques manifested in their land reclamation in the South China Sea. the construction of their first foreign military installations in Djibouti. and the continuing theft of intellectual property and trade secrets in critical security areas. They have also greatly undermined our supply chain through the Made in China 2025 initiative. which seeks to ensure that the United States and others remain reliant on the Chinese industrial base. Above all. the United States is threatened by Russias and Chinas advances in emerging technology. This includes hypersonic weapons. artificial intelligence. space capabilities. quantum computing. and directed energy. Without significant resources and focus. we will lose our technological superiority in these very areas. and both U.S. national security and the global order will be in serious jeopardy. Building off of our successes from the last 2 years. Congress and the executive branch must remain committed to investing in research. development. rapid acquisition. and the deployment of capabilities that provide for deterrence in line with the threats of the 21st century. Just as we rose to the challenge in the two World Wars. the Cold War. and following the attacks on September 11. 2001. we must. once again. evaluate our current posture and chart a course that best protects our national security and our interests. While the national defense strategy correctly prioritizes a return to great power competition. we still have great national security threats in the low-intensity domain. particularly in the Middle East and in North Africa. The success of our missions in Iraq. Afghanistan. Syria. and Africa are important. They can be seen in our ability to prevent extremist groups from projecting attacks into the U.S. homeland. Through the heroic and dedicated service of our men and women in uniform. we have put unyielding pressure on foreign terrorists and. in turn. we have prevented another massive attack like we saw on 9/11. While we have seen tremendous battlefield success against groups like the Islamic State. counterterrorism and stability operations require a sustained commitment of presence and resources in order to consolidate gains and promote good governance and the rule of law. In the absence of the latter. ungoverned spaces quickly transform into breeding grounds for terror groups. and that is why we are in Iraq. That is why we are in Afghanistan. and that is why we should remain in Syria. We must do that until our objectives are met. Balancing our approach toward both low- and high-intensity threats will require us to rely on our allies and our partners more than we have had to rely on them in the past decades. as we have a limited supply of resources for our national defense. However. if we are able to leverage the resources of our friends. we will assume less risk as we move to more resources toward countering great power threats. Likewise. as we seek to bolster our defense posture toward peer competitors. we will greatly benefit from increased contributions and commitments from our allies and our partners. That means insisting that our treaty allies contribute their fair share to the international security burden and also ensuring that our allies and partners are investing in weapons systems and military platforms that interoperate with ours while effectively deterring our common adversaries. We cannot and should not abandon those who share our values of democracy and freedom but. rather. work with them to increase defense contributions and build necessary capabilities and capacities. Unlike Russia and China. our network of allies and friends. who have stood shoulder to shoulder with us in the defense of freedom and democratic values. are a source of great strength. as well as an integral part of promoting global security. I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to once again acknowledge the most detrimental adversary of our national defense. that is. poor fiscal policy. As then-Secretary Mattis stated when he announced the National Defense Strategy. continuing resolutions and sequestration have hindered our security more than any foe. These wasteful applications of taxpayer dollars prevent long-term planning. stymie research and development. delay critical procurement. and prevent necessary training and readiness investments. What we do in this Chamber has consequences that reverberate far beyond Washington. When we fail to do our job. we put our warfighters at higher risk and cripple our strategic posture. ultimately endangering our national security. That is why I have come to the floor today to urge bipartisanship and collaboration amongst both Houses of Congress on defense spending policy. The political climate of today will assuredly prevent progress in some areas of Congresss work. but I encourage my colleagues to set those differences aside when we consider policies and appropriations for our national defense. We have a lot of work ahead in order to protect our security and interests. but I am confident we can come together to solve these issues of critical importance. Mr. President. I yield the floor."},{"1":"2018","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of my bill. H.R. 4528. a bill to make technical changes to certain marine fish conservation statutes. Mr. Speaker. I thank Chairman Bishop--and. Mr. Speaker. I did ask my third cousin. he is in support. too--as well as Ranking Member Grijalva for all of their collaboration and support on this important bill. H.R. 4528 makes technical amendments to two marine fish conservation statutes. the Billfish Conservation Act of 2012 and the Shark Conservation Act of 2010. First. the bill amends the Billfish Conservation Act of 2012. It clarifies that the exemption from marlin and billfish fishing in Hawaii and Pacific insular areas. as is tradition. can only be sold locally. More specifically. it clarifies these fish cannot be sold to the other 49 States. This strikes a balance between preserving traditional cultural fishing in these areas and the overall intent to prevent large-scale commercial fishing of these billfish. Second. it clarifies that. under the Shark Conservation Act of 2010. there is no language in the Shark Conservation Act that alters existing authority of the Secretary of Commerce to manage Atlantic highly migratory species under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. It also cleans up language in the Shark Conservation Act by removing an expired offset. The main goal of this is to ensure protection against shark finning. H.R. 4528 will fix confusion within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to allow rulemaking to go forward for the Atlantic smooth dogfish. a type of shark. This bill has support from both the sportsmen-anglers communities and conservation groups. Again. I thank the Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for working with me on this. Without their support. this legislation would not be on the floor today. Mr. Speaker.

I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker. as chairman of the House Small Business Committee. a day does not go by without me hearing from our Nations job creators. From inspiring accounts that are driven by their work ethic to stories of sacrifice all in the name of growing their company. the Nations small businesses are the true lifeblood of the American economy. { With over 29 million small businesses operating in the United States. they are responsible for two out of every three new jobs created in this country. However. their full potential is being held back by heavy-handed regulations and uncertainty. Unfortunately. their inability to access capital continues to prevent job creation and expansion. As a way to increase access to capital. the Small Business Administration jump-starts and enhances the flow of venture and private equity capital through the Small Business Investment Company program. also known as the SBIC program. Created in the 1958 Small Business Investment Act. the program utilizes a privately owned and SBA licensed model to increase access to capital. With over 300 SBICs operating in the country and more than $24 billion of capital under management. the program in fiscal year 2015 invested more than $5.4 billion in approximately 1.000 small businesses. In 2015. I introduced a SBIC bill that focused on increasing the family of funds limit. Similar to my 2015 legislation that was signed into law. the bill we have before us today concentrates on the individual leverage limit. Currently set at $150 million. the individual limit determines how much capital can be deployed by a SBIC that has only one fund under management. To better utilize this program and allow an increase in capital to small businesses. H.R. 2333--the bill that we are considering here this afternoon--increases the individual leverage limit to $175 million. I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight). the chairman of our Subcommittee on Contracting and Workforce. for his leadership on this issue. With access to capital being such a critical need for small business expansion and job creation. an increase in the individual leverage limit could deliver the needed capital that the next great American company is searching for. This bill has broad bipartisan support and was favorably passed out of committee unanimously. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on H.R. 2333. Mr. Speaker. I thank Ms. Judy Chu. who is here this afternoon. I believe. on behalf of Ms. Velazquez. who is the ranking member. We have a very strong bipartisan working committee. It is one of those in Congress that I think can be a model for other committees in how the two parties can actually work together and push forward with policies that are good for the country overall.

As the chairman of the Republican Study Committees Budget and Spending Task Force. Mr. WOODALL has brought this budget called Back to Basics. and that is really what we are here to talk about right now. Madam Chair. what are those basics we should get back to? I think they are the basic fundamentals that our Founding Fathers laid out when they created this great Nation. It is still the greatest nation in the history of the world. but it is a nation with serious challenges. If you look at our economy. our economy is struggling in many ways because of policies coming out of Washington. because of Washingtons failure to confront those challenges. People across this country are ready to confront those challenges. They are looking to us to finally start laying out a vision that says we are going to start living within our means. that we are going to do the things that families across this Nation do every single year. and that is finally getting back to fiscal discipline. When my friend on the other sideI guess the person who is tasked with coming and opposing budgets that balanceuses terms like draconianMadam Chair. I will tell you what is draconian. What is draconian is to deny the opportunity to our children and grandchildren that we enjoy today. something that every single generation in the history of our country has. One of the pure definitions of the American Dream is that every generation in our Nations history. since George Washington led us through that Revolution. has had better opportunities than those that we enjoy today. yet most people in this country recognize. if we dont get our fiscal house in order. our childrenmy 7- and 4yearolds. whom my wife drove to school this morningwont have those same opportunities. and they all deserve the opportunities that we enjoy. So how do we do it? How do we get back to basics? We do it by having really good. strong. bold policybold policy that says we ought to live within our means. Our budget balances by year 4. In 2018. we have a balanced Federal budget. If you compare that with President Obamas budget. he has got a budget that has over $1 trillion in new taxes. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle say: oh. you need to stick more taxes on all of these businesses. If anybody is making a profit in America. it seems like they want to put a bullseye on him. If one happens to be successful and make a profit and create jobs in this country. that is somehow a bad thing. If you take their approach in their budgetsin all of their budgetsthey have over $1 trillion in new taxes. President Obama has nearly $2 trillion in new taxes. so you would think: okay. all of those new taxes must be what get you to balance. In fact. Madam Chair. all of those new taxes just get you more despair. This Presidents budget never. ever gets to balance. but he has all of those tax increases that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about. In our budget. we dont have any new tax increases. What we have is good. smart fiscal discipline policy that says lets get our economy moving again and lets believe in the American people. By not raising taxes and by getting our economy moving. you actually get to balance in 4 short years and start creating surpluses. so we can pay back that debt. as my friend from Georgia talked about. so that we dont have to send all of those interest payments to other countries and to other priorities. Lets set those priorities in America. How do we do this? How do we actually get back to balance in such a short period of time? Number one. we save Medicare from bankruptcy. just as PAUL RYAN does in the House Republican budget that came out of the Budget Committee. We share many of those same principles that get us to fiscal responsibility by saving Medicare. by not letting it go bankrupt. as our colleagues on the other side do and as the Presidents own budget does. The Presidents own budget allows Medicare to go bankrupt. We dont think that is responsible. so we take care of those who paid into a system over their lifetimes. We also invoke smart policy. If you start with health care. in our bill. we actually repeal the Presidents health care law and replace it with the American Health Care Reform Act. a bill that actually puts patients back in charge of their health care and that allows us to. again. have families be in charge of those decisions and to lower costs. It is good. smart policy. We will talk more about it. but this is the right path to getting our economy back on track."},{"1":"2013","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Madam President. I appreciate the Senator from Texas coming here. engaging. and I appreciate the fact that he is making a point. But I am trying to make a point which I think is very compelling. Within a few daysDecember 281.3 million Americans will lose their extended Federal unemployment insurance benefits. It will be a tremendous trauma to those families. and it will be a huge impact for our economy going forward. I have renewed my request for a full 1year extension. and it has been objected to. I recognize that. But. I believe it is urgent we extend unemployment insurance benefits. I also have been working closely with my Republican colleague. Senator HELLER. on a bipartisan basis to introduce a bill to extend these benefits for 3 months. giving us the opportunity to go and take a more deliberate and careful review of the program and also to provide for a mechanism to extend the benefits for a full year. I am very pleased we are beginning to build bipartisan support for this initiative for at least 3 months. It does reflect the fact that my colleagues from all across the country are recognizing the huge impact of this loss of benefits. This is not a problem that is restricted to a particular area of the country. Nevada has the highest rate in terms of unemployment numbers. Rhode Island trails behind. but not by much. We are at over 9 percent. But you have States with high unemployment throughout the country: Michigan at 9 percent. Illinois at 8.9 percent. Kentucky at 8.4 percent. Georgia at 8.1 percent. Arizona at 8.2 percent. These are States that have significant issues with respect to unemployment and need the continuation of this program to protect their families and also to provide stimulus for their local economies. We have at this point in many of these places two unemployed workers for every available job. So this is not just a question of: The jobs are there. Just go get it. The job is not there. Also. we recognizeI think we all recognizethe skill sets that are increasingly in demand are some of the skill sets that mature workerspeople who have been working for 20 years. who have been every day of their lives going to the office or going to the mill or going to the plant are now competing with 20yearolds who have sophisticated information technology skills and other skills in a climate where manufacturing is becoming sophisticated. Every sort of enterprise seems to be much more sophisticated and demanding a higher level of skills than years ago. So this is a very difficult time for workers out of a job. and I believe in this difficult period of time we need to extend these benefits. There is extensive research on unemployment insurance and the labor markets that also supports the point that people who are on unemployment insurance want to go back to work. This is a very sort of pragmatic insight. In Rhode Island. for example. the average benefit is $354 a week. For most workers. that is a fraction of what they were gaining in their job. They would love to be called back to work. They would love to find a job that fits their skills that is close to the pay they had or maybe less. But no one is getting this help and socking away a lot of money on their UI benefits. Indeed. a recent report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers looks at the economic tradeoffs that are being faced. In their words: In choosing the optimal unemployment insurance policy. policymakers must weigh competing costs and benefits. On the one hand. some argue that extending benefits may dull the incentives for unemployed workers to exert effort to search for another job. leading to increased unemployment the socalled moral hazard effect. But on the other hand. providing benefits gives families income that can in the limit keep them from poverty but more generally can help them to finance a longer job search that might ultimately result in a job better matched with their talents. resulting in higher overall labor market productivity.... These are important aspects that have to be considered. I think the consensus of many in Congress is that this program is not only necessary and essential. but it also does not significantly inhibit the willingness. the ability. the desire of people to get back to work. Raj Chetty is a noted economist who studies these issues. He concludes: Nearly a dozen economic studies have analyzed this question by comparing unemployment rates in states that have extended unemployment benefits with those in states that do not . . . . These studies have uniformly found that a 10week extension in unemployment benefits raises the average amount of time people spend out of work by at most one week. This simple. unassailable finding implies that policy makers can extend unemployment benefits to provide assistance to those out of work without substantially increasing unemployment rates. That is the conclusion of a very well respected economist who has been looking at that issue for several years. Once again. from the Council of Economic Advisers report: Finally. while economists have found only small disincentive effects of UT extensions. recent research shows that the effect of UT on job search behavior is even smaller in recessions as the moral hazard effect shrinks when jobs are scarce. Lets get back to common sense. There are roughly two workers for every job. The benefits UI beneficiaries receive are a fraction of what they would get in the workplace. They want to get back into the workplace. The jobs are just not there. Frankly. we have not done enough. I would suggest. to put those jobs in place. We have to do more. But in the interim. we have to make sure these families have some benefits and some protection. I am quite willing to work with my colleagues if there are changes that should be made. could be made. But we are facing this deadline. Unless we moveand I am disappointed we have not moved today1.3 million people on December 28 lose their benefits. The checks will cease going out the following week. and our economy will take a hit next year of 200.000 jobs. about a 0.2percent growth shrinkage in GDP. We can avoid that by moving today or moving tomorrow. certainly moving as soon as we get back. to make sure these benefits are in place. With that. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum."},{"1":"2012","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I rise to speak in support of the farm bill which is now before the Senate. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. I worked. together with my fellow committee members. on a bipartisan basis to put forward what we believe is a sound farm bill for this country. We passed the bill out of committee on a strong bipartisan vote. 16 to 5. So it comes to the Senate floor for deliberation. The bill is entitled The Agriculture. Reform. Food and Jobs Act of 2012. I would like to begin with just a simple question. Why is the farm bill so important? Why is the farm bill so important? I think the first chart I have sums it up. This is the most important point I will make today. I am going to begin and I am going to conclude my comments with it as well. U.S. farmers and ranchers provide the highest quality. lowest cost food supply in the world. Our farmers and ranchers today provide the highest quality. lowest cost food supply in the world. Not only do they provide the highest quality. lowest cost food supply in the world. but in the history of the world. That is vitally important to every single American. So when we pass a farm policy that supports our network of farmers and ranchers throughout this great country. we are doing something that makes a fundamental difference every day for every American and for millions of people beyond our borders. There are other aspects to the farm bill that are very important as well. For example. we have a tremendous number of jobs in farming and ranching across this countryevery State in this country. throughout our heartland and beyond. There are not just direct jobs in farming and ranching but there are indirect jobs. from food processing to retail. to transportation. to marketingyou name it. We could say it is an incredible jobs bill. which it is. There is no question about it. When we provide a good. sound. solid farm program for our farmers and ranchers. we are also very much passing a jobs bill as well. We can also talk about it in terms of a favorable balance of trade. The United States has a deficit in its trade balance. but agriculture has a positive balance of trade. We export millions in food products all over the world to feed hungry people. and it generates a positive return for this country in a big way. We can talk about it in terms of national security. Think about how important good farm policy is for national security. We produce not only the food we need. but far more than the food we need for our citizens. we provide food for many citizens in other countries as well. Think about the national security implications if we had to depend on other countries for our food supplymaybe even countries that dont necessarily share our interests or values. which is currently the case with energy. We certainly dont want to be in that situation when it comes to feeding our people. So it is truly an issue of national security. We want to be in the position to make sure we have farmers and ranchers who will supply not only the food we need in this country but food that people consume in many countries throughout the world. For all those reasons this is an incredibly important bill. It is not just incredibly important to farmers and ranchers. it is incredibly important for every single one of usfor all those reasons and more. The second point I want to make is this farm bill is costeffective. It is not only costeffective. but we provide real savings to help to reduce the deficit and the debt. It provides strong support to our farmers and ranchers. but it does it the right way. It does it in a way where we provide savings that will go to reduce the deficit and debt. Our farmers and ranchers are stepping up and not only doing an amazing job for this country in terms of what they do in food supply and job creation. but they are helping meet the challenge of our deficit and debt as well. The second chart is an example of what I am talking about in terms of the farm program being costeffective. I will use this and several other charts to go into the actual numbers to show that the farm programparticularly this bill we have craftedis not only costeffective. but it provides real savings as well. At the same time. it provides enhanced support for our farmers and ranchers throughout the country. Looking at the chart. if you think of the total Federal budget as this cornfield. the portion that goes to the farm bill would be similar to this ear of corn out of the cornfield. If you think of the total cornfield as the Federal budget. the farm bill would be about one ear of corn. The portion of the farm bill that goes to farmers and ranchers to support what they do would be one kernel of corn out of the entire cornfield. To put those numbers into perspectiveand these are analyzed numbersyou are talking about Federal spending of about $3.7 trillion. in that range. You are talking about a farm bill that. on an annualized basis. is about $100 billion. So it is $100 billion out of $3.7 trillion. Then if you talk about the portion that actually goes to support farmers and ranchers and support that network. you are talking about less than $20 billion out of $3.7 trillion. That is why I use this frame of reference. If we go to the next chart. we will go into some of the numbers and how that funding is broken out in the farm bill itself. This pie chart shows the CBO scoring. Of course with any legislation you need the CBO scoring that shows the actual cost. We try to do that in a consistent way across all of the legislation we pass. CBO uses a 10year scoring period. On that basis. this entire pie. the farm program score. over a 10year period is $960 billion. Of that. almost $800 billion is nutrition programs. Almost 80 percent goes to nutrition. I mean by that. primarily SNAP. nutritional assistance payments. or food stamps. So nutrition programs comprise 80 percent of the total cost in the farm bill. Only about 20 percent actually goes for farming and ranching. for farm programs. and for conservation. So in the scoring. that is only about $200 billion. We know the bill is not a 10year bill. it is a 5year bill. So the actual cost is $480 billion. or half of the score. That means approximately $400 billion goes for nutrition programs. food stamps. and so forth. and less than $100 billion goes for farm programs and conservation programs. So we are talking about an annual cost of this farm programa program that supports farmers and ranchers who feed this country and much of the worldof about $20 billionactually less. Lets go to the next chart on how the program actually provides savings. how farmers and ranchers are providing real savings for deficit reduction in this country. This bill saves more than $23 billion-$23.6 billion is the savings generated by this farm bill. $15 billion comes from the farm programs themselves. $6 billion comes from conservation programs. only about $4 billion comes out of nutrition programs. So 80 percent of the cost in the bill is nutrition programs. which is $400 billion over 5 years. Only $4 billion comes out of the nutrition programs. close to $20 billion comes out of the agriculture portion of the bill. Going back to my prior chart. if you go back to the crop insurance provisions and commodity. which comprise the farm support network. that is about $150 billion in the CBO scoring. Remember. I said $15 billion comes out of that $150 billion. My point is that 10percent reduction. So farmers and ranchers are stepping up in the farm bill and saying. OK. we are going to help meet the deficit and the debt challenge. They are. in essence. taking 10 percent less. Think about that. if throughout all aspects of the Federal budget everybody stepped up the way farmers and ranchers are in this legislation and said. OK. here is a 10percent reduction we are going to take to help get the deficit under control and the debt under control. My point is. very clearly. in this legislation we have real savings. and that savings is being provided by our farmers and ranchers. At the same timethis is my third point. and it is very importantthis farm bill provides the kinds of support our farmers and ranchers need by providing the risk management tools our farmers need. This farm bill provides strong support for our farmers and ranchers. and it does it the right way. It does it right. with sound risk management tools. What are those risk management tools? I have them here on the chart. It enhances crop insurance. Second. a new Agriculture Risk Coverageor ARCProgram. It includes also reauthorization of the nonetcost sugar program. It improves and extends the livestock disaster assistance program. These are the kinds of risk management tools our farmers and ranchers have asked for. They are costeffective and a marketbased approach. They provide the sound. solid safety net our farmers and producers need to continue to produce the food supply for this country. I will go into more detail on the next chart on crop insurance. As I travel around the State. and as myself and others who are members of the Ag Committee travel the country. one thing our farmers and ranchers say to us over and over again is that they want enhancements to crop insurance. We worked on the safety net for our farmers. and as we worked on the tools for them. they said the heart of the farm bill needs to be enhanced crop insurance. That is exactly what we have done with this legislation. That is the heart of the bill. Enhanced crop insurance involves a number of things. First. farmers can buy individual crop insurance. and do buy it. at whatever level they deem appropriate. They look at their farm operation and decide how much crop insurance they are going to buy to cover that farm operation. But as they insure at higher levels. the cost to buy that insurance gets more and more expensive. One of the things we tried to do in terms of enhancing crop insurance is figure out how we can help insure at a higher level at an affordable price. That is one of the new innovations. It is called the supplemental coverage option. or SCO. It enables farmers to insure or cover their farming operation at a higher level. but still at an affordable price. The way it works is. the farmer buys his normal. individual. crop insurance that he would normally purchase. But then. in addition. on a countywide basis. he can buy supplemental coverage. with the supplemental coverage option. on top of his existing insurance. If he typically insures up to. say. 60. 65. or maybe a 70percent level. he can buy additional insurance on top of his regular policy at a reasonable premium. His regular policy is an individual. farmbased policy. and this is a countybased policy that provides additional coverage at a reduced rateagain. management tools on a marketbased approach to cover their farming operation. The second innovation on the next chart is a program called Agriculture Risk Coverage. or ARC. Very often. farmersobviously. one of the challenges they face is due to weather. When they face weather challenges. oftentimes we can get in a wet cycle or a dry cycle. So the problem they have with weather may not be limited to one year. You may have a number of years where they face real weather challenges. In addition. what may happen is that it may trigger losses in their farming operation that are not severe enough to trigger their regular crop insurance. but still cause them losses. You can have repetitive or shallow losses. Over time. those can make an incredible difference in terms of farmers being able to continue in farming and continue their operation. We add shallow loss coverage. or the agriculture risk coverage. to help them protect against these repetitive losses. which they often face due to weather conditions. That is the agriculture risk coverage. It covers between 11 and 21 percent of historical revenue. How do you calculate that percentage? That is a 5year averagethe last 5year averagebased on price and yield. the revenue they generate on their farming operation. You take out the high year and the low year. and you average the other three. The way it works is. when you have a year where the farmers crop insurance may not trigger. they still have help when they have a loss. but a loss that may not trigger on their crop insurance. In other cases. it works with their crop insurance to make sure they are adequately covered so they can continue their farming operation. Again. an enhanced risk management tool. costeffective. focused on a marketbased approach to make sure our farmers and ranchers have the coverage they need to continue their operation. One other point I want to make in wrapping up is that this bill also continues strong support for agricultural research. Agricultural research is making a tremendous difference for our farmers in terms of what they are doing to increase productivity. Obviously. we all know technology has done amazing things to help productivity. But at the same time. agricultural research has made an incredible difference in not only food productionproductivity when it comes to food productionbut energy production as well. So that is it. That is how this legislation works. It provides strong support to our farmers and ranchers. It provides that support on a costeffective basis. The bill emphasizes a marketbased approach. focused on crop insurance. which is exactly what producers have told us they want. At the same time. this legislation provides real savings-$23.6 billionto help reduce the Federal deficit and the debt. It is bipartisan. and it received strong committee support. I know some of our southern friends are still looking for more help with price protection. and we are working with them. It is likely the House Agriculture Committee will seek to do more in that area as well. But this is legislation that we need to move forward. This is legislation that supports our farmers and our ranchers the right way as they continue to provideand I am going to go back to my very first chartsupport our farmers and ranchers as they provide the highest quality and the lowest cost food supply for every single American. As I said. this is where I started my comments. and this is where I will conclude. When we are talking about a farm bill. we are talking about something that is important to every single Americanevery single American. We do it the right way here. and I ask all of my fellow Senators on both sides of the aislewe worked together in a great bipartisan way in the committeeto work together in a great bipartisan way on the Senate floor and pass this bill.

And the question is. how do we address the first priority to get Americans back to work and address that spending problem weve got? Now. if the gentleman says we have to pay for what we buy. I certainly agree with that. We ought to just be buying less as a government because the money doesnt belong to the government. it belongs to the people. And if we want more people to get back to work. we should allow them to keep more of their money so that they can create jobs. And thats really where the fundamental disagreement has been over the last couple of weeks. It certainly was what put the Biden talks into abeyance because there was a lot of good work that was done by both sides of the aisle in those talks. And I still believe that the product of those talks will prove to be the basis upon which we can arrive at an appropriate resolution of the challenge before us around the debt ceiling. But why these talks ended was that your side insisted that we raise taxes. And I would say to the gentleman. raising taxes is. as he would put it. paying for what we buy. And Im saying lets stop buying so much and let the people decide what it is they want to do with their money."},{"1":"2010","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chair.

Mr. Speaker. there is no greater priority for the Federal Government than the defense of our Nation. and the Defense Authorization bill is a vehicle for setting military priorities for our country. This bill also has jurisdiction over the Nations defense nuclear waste cleanup program administered by the Department of Energy. The Environmental Management program within the Department is responsible for cleaning up the waste of our Nations nuclear weapons production sites. production sites like Hanford. in my district. that secured our Nations victory in World War II and In the Cold War. As a result of that work. these sites are now contaminated with massive volumes of radioactive and hazardous waste. The Federal Government has a legal obligation to clean up these sites. As this bill. Mr. Speaker. has moved through the process. there have been several proposals by both Democrats and Republicans to move specific military projects by reducing the authorization for nuclear waste funding. Mr. Speaker. lets be clear on what these proposals are really about. Its about setting our Nations defense priorities and not a judgment on the merits of cleaning up our nuclear waste sites. The nuclear cleanup program is being used as a piggy bank for these priorities since. Mr. Speaker. its the only sizable source of funds within this bill that doesnt directly fund our troops or equipment. Now. Mr. Speaker. I know why nuclear cleanup is being used by both parties as a piggy bank. I absolutely dont support those actions. and I will vote against those actions. but in doing so. I want to be clear that it is in the appropriations process where cleanup money becomes real. Insufficient funding in the appropriations process would have real and serious consequences on cleaning up these sites. The cleanup program simply cannot sustain continued appropriation reductions without jeopardizing progress. breaking legally binding commitments to States. and increasing longterm costs to taxpayers. Mr. Speaker. for 15 years I have worked in a bipartisan way to raise awareness of the Federal Governments cleanup obligation and to remind my colleagues again that the effort at these sites helped us win both World War II and the Cold War. I will continue to stand up for cleanup where needed. In doing so. I am determined that the effort to promote cleanup be a bipartisan effort. With that.

Mr. Speaker. disagree. and perhaps they might be interested in calling (202) 2243121 and in just saying. Speaker PELOSI. at least allow a vote. As. supposedly. the most Democratic institution in the history of mankind. at least allow the voices of the people to be heard. and let there be a vote. In speaking of voices to be beard. Mr. Speaker. as one of the great voices in this institution. I want to yield now to the gentleman from Texas ."},{"1":"2007","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. the House voted on a measure that would require public sector employees at the State and local level to set up a system of monopoly bargaining. H.R. 980. the Public Safety EmployerEmployee Cooperation Act. is wellintended. as are most bills that come before this body. Yet its effects would be profoundly negative. both on fire and police departments nationwide and on the way Congress operates with respect to our most fundamental allegiance. the Federal Constitution. As we all know. the tenth amendment to the Constitution states. The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution. nor prohibited by it to the States. are reserved for the States respectively. or to the people. Yet with H.R. 980. Congress is plainly overriding carefully crafted State labor laws with a single stroke. This bill dictates to States how they must deal with unionization issues. which is a serious abridgement of the role of Congress envisioned by our Founders. We took an oath here. Madam Speakeran oath to uphold a Constitution that does not give us the power to ride roughshod over States whenever it strikes our fancy. Moreover. the practical effect of this legislation would be disastrous. As the International Chiefs of Police have noted. By mandating a onesize fits all approach to labormanagement relations. H.R. 980 ignores the fact that every jurisdiction has unique needs and therefore requires the freedom to manage its public safety workforce in the manner that they have determined to be the most effective. Worse yet. H.R. 980 would give the Federal Labor Relations Board the responsibility of overseeing labormanagement laws in virtually every jurisdiction in the Nation. from municipalities to counties to States. Not only is Congress extending its meddling arms into matters reserved by the Constitution for the States. but now. some of my friends across the aisle want to cut funding for the only Federal agency that reviews union abuses. As John Fund put it in the Wall Street Journal. The new Democratic Congress has finally found a government agency whose budget it wants to cut: an obscure Labor Department office that monitors the compliance of unions with federal law. Allow me to quote Mr. Fund at some length: In the past six years. the Office of Labor Management Standards. or OLMS. has helped secure the convictions of 775 corrupt union officials and courtordered restitution to union members of over $70 million in dues. The House is set to vote Thursday on a proposal to chop 20% from the OLMS budget. Every other Labor Department enforcement agency is due for a budget increase. and overall the Congress has added 5935 million to the Bush administrations budget request for Labor. The only office the Democrats want to cut back is the one engaged in union oversight . . . GOP Rep. John Kline of Minnesota will offer an amendment Thursday to restore $3 million of the $11 million planned cutback in OLMSs budget. so its budget would merely be restored to its 2007 level. Whatever sums are spent on union disclosure reports appear to be a good investment. Unions held $22 billion in assets in 2005. and youd think that a modest enforcement budget. representing less than 0.003% of that amount shouldnt be the only target for cuts by budget appropriators. Mr. Speaker. allowing workers to determine whether or not they wish to join unions is consistent with the American principle of personal freedom and selfdetermination. A Federal law concerning public sector union membership that would render State laws irrelevant is unconstitutional. reckless. and unnecessary. And reducing funding for the one Federal agency that pursues notorious union corruption is incomprehensible in its own rightbut especially coming from a new majority that heralds its own allegiance to the highest ethical standards. These things must not be allowed. These are matters of liberty and justice for all we must not take lightly."},{"1":"2006","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself as much time as I may consumed. Mr. Chairman. thank you for the opportunity to offer this amendment to H.R. 5682. the United States and India Nuclear Cooperation Promotion Act of 2006. The purpose of this amendment is to provide Congress with the ability to assess. to the extent possible. whether U.S. civilian nuclear cooperation with India may potentially contribute to growth in Indias military fissile material production. The amendment is straightforward. It simply calls for a report each year to ensure that the United States is not unintentionally complicit in the growth of Indias nuclear weapons capabilities. First of all. let me express my appreciation to Chairman HYDE and Ranking Member LANTOS and the House International Relations Committee staff for their efforts to address a wide variety of concerns expressed by members of the International Relations Committee. Given the global significance of this potential agreement. I believe it is important to remain diligent in the conduct of our oversight responsibilities. Mr. Chairman. civil nuclear cooperation with India is a bilateral initiative with wideranging multilateral implications. The nonproliferation. energy and environmental objectives of this proposed agreement with India are laudable. and the Committee on International Relations has emphasized the need to ensure that such an agreement would not result in unintended consequences which may undermine Its purpose and directly or indirectly result in boosting Indias military nuclear capabilities. It is my expectation that the International Relations Committee will avail itself of this opportunity to hold as many hearings as necessary to examine the content of this report and the potential implications for the U.S. compliance with Article I of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons as referenced in the bill. This is particularly important in light of the recent news regarding the discovery of a reactor project which would enable Pakistan to make many more nuclear weapons each year. This news highlights very real concerns about a potential arms race in South Asia. It is up to Congress to ensure that any U.S.-India civil nuclear agreement remains just that. a civil nuclear agreement which will have no impact on the production of nuclear weapons. Mr. Chairman. I understand that Chairman HYDE and Ranking Member LANTOS are in support of this amendment. and I am grateful for their support. Mr. Chairman. I yield to the gentleman from California."},{"1":"2005","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I ask you to join me in supporting the best interests of our Nation by passing DRCAFTA. I support CAFTA because it is deeply in our national interest. and it is a progrowth. projob vote. In the past I have seen the way free trade has revolutionized south Texas. bringing jobs. prosperity and growth to a part of the country that used to be economically underserved. DRCAFTA will perpetuate that growth. opening export markets to our American farmers and businesses. thereby creating jobs in farming. manufacturing and industry here at home. When NAFTA was signed in 1993. there were four Presidents. Clinton. Bush. Carter. and Ford. present at the signing. We have a long history of bipartisan cooperation when it comes to the benefits of free trade. I hope to see that tradition continue. American farmers currently face deep tariffs when exporting their goods to Central America. while 99 percent of the CAFTA agricultural products come into the United States duty free. This is a oneway street that needs to be redrawn into a twoway street. a twoway street of fair trade. American farmers are struggling against an unfair international trading system. and they are at risk of failing. CAFTA levels that playing field. According to the American Farm Bureau. CAFTA would expand U.S. farm exports by $1.5 billion per year. CAFTA is also going to bring major gains to U.S. manufacturing. The National Association of Manufacturers recently re51. Pt. 13 18009 ported that as a direct result of DRCAFTA. U.S. manufacturers stand to gain approximately 12.000 new job opportunities for American workers. CAFTA will also create tremendous job opportunities for the 13.000 American small businesses that are currently already exporting to those Central America countries. The economic opportunities created by DRCAFTA will bring new jobs and the possibility of a middleclass life to millions of Central Americans who are currently living in poverty. If we create economic opportunities in those countries. fewer will be forced to flee to the United States out of economic desperation. The prosperity created by CAFTA will act as the foundation for more a stable and democratic future for Central America. Mr. Speaker. trade has the power to change the world. Out of all the policy instruments that we have here in Washington. few have as much power to change lives. bring hope. and draw people together in a rising tide of prosperity as our ability to promote free and fair trade. I am a supporter of DRCAFTA because I think it is not only as a smart policy of the United States. but also it is a way to change our whole atmosphere for the better."},{"1":"2004","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I want to talk a little bit more about the housing issue. As our economy was going through an unprecedented decline. we saw housing stay up. That was the one part of our economy that actually sustained us. It was a pleasure for me to be able to work with the President on the American Dream Downpayment Act. to allow for young people in all areas of the country to begin to be able to make that downpayment on that first home. In studying what was happening in the last several years. even though we had dropped interest rates and it was easier to qualify for loans. there were a lot of people who should have but did not own their own homes. Historically the barrier was that downpayment. So the American Dream Downpayment Act provides a way for families who run up to this barrier. where they look at their rental rates they are paying that are exactly the same as what their mortgage payment would be. this provides them an opportunity to get past this downpayment barrier in order to own a home. It is working. It is going to work. As it moves forwardit is just getting startedit is going to do even more to create home ownership. I am proud of this President. I am proud of his economic policies. I am proud to be able to work with him in a partnership in cutting taxes and encouraging the economy to grow. As a small businessman. I know how that works. If anything affects a job. or growth. it is when taxes get too high and rules and regulations take over your business. As a small businessman.. I have had to suffer through down economies. I have had to lay people off because our small business was not doing very well because of a down economy. It is not fun. But we always recovered and after we recovered we were more productive and we were more efficient and we generally provided a better service. I think that has happened in this country. I think a lot of companies have taken the downturn and streamlined their operations. improved their services. The bottom line is that we are going to have more jobs in this country. Our economy is going to continue to grow. The bottom line is the consumers in this country are going to be better served. This President has done the right thing for America. It is unfortunate that. in an election year such as this. the political rhetoric gets so negative because it really does not reflect what has been going on. To repeat. unemployment rates have dropped to 5.6 percent. The gross domestic product is growing at phenomenal rates. Job growth is happening. It is occurring today. Other countries have looked at what we have done in America to create jobs. and they are updating. Competition is going to be tough in the international market. and we need to be prepared to compete. Trade restrictions is not the way to do it. We historically have been able to compete throughout the international community without trade restrictions. In fact. the trade agreements we pass actually make it possible for the United States to cut down the trade tariffs that are applied against American products. One of the things that gets thrown out here is the trade deficit. The trade deficit has been the worst in this country during the Depression and during the recession we had at the end of the Carter years in the 1970s. When our economy goes down. trade deficits get better. When our economy goes up. trade deficits change because consumers are buying more goods. When you have them buying more goods. it creates more jobs. I dont see where the trade issue is one that really reflects what is happening in the economy. I shared these issues with you this morning because that is really what is happening in the economy. Employment is rising. unemployment rates continue to fall. gross domestic product and productivity continue to grow strong and at a sustainable rate. business activity continues to strengthen. consumer confidence and spending grows. the Fed is holding interests rates at a steady 1 percent. and the housing market looks really good. It has been good for a while and continues to look good. When you compare the dollar to the yen or to the euro. its value is going down. which is good for exports. It is good for business. It means we will be able to move our products overseas. I think it looks good. I am proud of this President. He has the right solution. and it is working. I yield the floor."},{"1":"2003","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"recognized Mr. Delaney in a chapter of his book entitled We Know What to Do. I would like to read a short excerpt from that chapter this evening. I have taken a few editorial liberties for the sake of clarity for this tribute. Of Reverend Delaney Mr. ALEXANDER wrote: If you roll back the Federal Government. then who is going to do what needs to be done? Henry Delaney. thats who. He already has. He has reminded us how to confront the drug plague and shut down crack houses. He did it with faith and commerce and mostly private funding. He has achieved dramatic results without millions in Federal aid and without trampling anyones rights. Henry moved to one of the poorest sections of Savannah. Georgia. in 1989. It is fair to say that a lesser person would have been daunted by what Reverend Delaney found in Savannah. He moved into a house on 32nd Street that had been boarded up and occupied by crack addicts. He inherited a ramshackle church whose property was about to be foreclosed on by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. His congregation consisted of 216 members. many of whom were afraid to attend church because of the drug dealers who overran the area. Reverend Delaney quickly went to work to improve the situation. He sought loans so he could start buying up the houses where the drug dealers lived. He bought five of them on one side of the street and eight in the next block. He kicked out the drug dealers and he started moving in pastors. His wife Ethel helped him repair the church and Members of the congregation pitched in to renovate the houses. With every house they overhauled. they expanded their drugfree zone. The church activities expanded and membership leaped to 3.000 members. Delaney now has 16 ministers of the gospel. all of whom live within two blocks of his church. His converts includes some of the very drug dealers that he evicted. One was shot 16 times when he was caught in a crossfire from a drug deal gone bad at a car wash. He had a miraculous recovery and now he never misses a Sunday morning service. They say that no one in the congregation sings Amazing Grace with more feeling. Reverend Delaney is educating innercity kids in Savannah who otherwise would not be in school. who would drop out and be rejected or be expelled. Ethel Delaney. meanwhile. opened the Saint Pauls Community Cultural Center. or what she calls a Christian charm school for girls. Since they dont accept Federal money. both schools instill a heavy dose of discipline and religion. Henry also runs a homeless shelter for young men who are recovering drug addicts and recent parolees from prison. helping them find jobs and keeping them clean from drugs. What is different is the evangelistic fervor Reverend Delaney brings to this task. Many of these fellas have gone through the 28day detox programs. but within 4 or 5 days. they are back at it. So every week. Monday. Wednesday and Friday. he keeps them busy with evening worship. On Tuesday. they have Bible study. On Sunday they attend church regularly. So far it has worked very well. He calls his shelter the Hallelujah House. This is how you have to conduct a war against drugs. using a series of trenches. It starts in the family. If you fail there. you have to take them off the streets. and you have to reassemble them at the workplace. Of all the uphill battles he and his wife wage. Henry is most perplexed by the Nations failure to focus consistently on the drug issue. His is a voice from the inner city of Savannah that we should be listening to. In the 1970s. when national voices suggested that marijuana was cool and drugs were okay. kids used drugs. In the early 1980s. when national leadership and some of the media said it wasnt okay. drug use began to decrease. L 1800 Simply put. it is virtually impossible for people like Henry and Ethel Delaney to succeed if the streets of Savannah are awash with cocaine and crack. Keeping drugs out of the country is a matter of Federal law enforcement and foreign policy. Of course. those local efforts depend on men like Henry Delaney. We need to learn from Henry Delaney and use his example to inspire others to achieve the same success in their communities. So while there is no shortage of experts on national drug policy. it is probably time we started paying attention to the real experts like Reverend Delaney. He now has 60 preachers affiliated with his church. not all of them ordained. but his goal is to keep buying up the crack houses. moving in his ministers. and pushing out the drug dealers a block at a time until they are on the other side of the county line. Mr. Speaker. we need more Henry Delaneys in this world."},{"1":"2002","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I may consume. and I thank my colleague for yielding me the customary half hour. Mr. Speaker. I rise in opposition to this rule. The measure leaves unprotected a provision of the underlying bill authored by my colleague. the gentleman from Virginia . The unprotected provision withholds the release of $590.000. the amount the Joint Committee on Taxation requested above its fiscal 2002 budget until the Joint Committee releases its Report on Expatriates. My colleagues may remember this report. It was requested by one of our former chairs. Mr. Archer. in 1999. to study the scope and the impact of wealthy U.S. taxpayers who renounce their citizenship to avoid paying their U.S. taxes. In the wake of recent corporate scandals and in the wake of assertions by members of the majority leadership that corporations moving their corporations abroad do it only to avoid taxes. which was the fault of our Tax Code and not of the corporations. the report has taken on an added importance. Earlier this year. the Wall Street Journal ran a story suggesting the report was largely completed. But despite repeated requests. the report has yet to be released. Last night. the Committee on Rules could easily have removed this potential roadblock to obtaining this report. but it chose not to. Mr. Speaker. this. unfortunately. has become a pattern with the majority leadership. Reports in recent days have suggested that the majority leadership is joining forces with corporations who abuse tax avoidance schemes in an effort to kill our attempts to close major tax loopholes. with the help of the Treasury. Specifically. the GOP leadership attempted earlier this week to strip out a provision passed by Democrats in the Committee on Appropriations that would prohibit government contracts from being issued to companies that have reincorporated overseas specifically to avoid paying taxes. Accenture. formerly Andersen Consulting. is spearheading a lobbying campaign. as their $43 million contract with the IRS could be affected. Accenture recently moved its headquarters to Bermuda to avoid paying U.S. taxes. The amendment to curtail this practice is the first in a campaign by the Committee on Appropriations to force the majority to confront corporate wrongdoing. worker pension raids by executives. and stockholder deception. It is my hope that the majority will stop blocking the efforts to address these reform efforts. In other respects. however. the underlying bill is noncontroversial and provides funds for all aspects of operating the House of Representatives. including staff and committee salaries and expenses. mail and security. It also covers congressional agencies such as the Library of Congress. the General Accounting Office. and the Botanical Gardens. I would like to highlight the bills provisions designed to improve Capitol Police recruitment and retention. Since September 11. the hours and pressures of protecting staff and Members and the visiting public have increased -dramatically. It is imperative that we take steps to ensure that the Capitol Police have the resources to maintain this level of commitment. With this in mind. the bill contains a 5 percent merit pay raise for Capitol Police officers. as well as a 4.1 percent costofliving increase. I would also note that the measure provides language clarifying the structure of the Capitol Police Board and authorizing the Chief of Police to appoint an executive director of the board. Moreover. it authorizes the chief to hire officers at a rate higher than the minimum rate associated with that position. The bill also includes language authorizing the Capitol Police to run their own payroll services as opposed to having the House and Senate pay some of the officers out of their systems. We owe it to law enforcement to ensure that they and their families are provided for in this new and uncertain environment. We also owe it to the thousands of visitors to the Capitol each year so that they have confidence that they are being protected to the utmost of our ability. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time."},{"1":"2001","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I rise to support this legislation. It is vitally important legislation. In representing the Chicago area. we are seeing tens of thousands of layoffs. I have families every day that tell me about their needs. their struggle to pay their high energy home heating bills. They are struggling to pay off their credit card bills. They are seeing their neighbors lose their jobs. And President Bush. as we know. inherited a weakening economy. and he is proposing that we move quickly to fix it and put some money back into the economy and protect jobs and help people pay off their bills. This legislation will provide real money for real people. I am pleased to point out and thank the leadership of the gentleman from California . This tax relief is retroactive. which means it will be effective this year. giving taxpayers. every taxpayer who pays taxes. the opportunity to have some extra money. That is a fine point about this bill. It is not targeted so that people are excluded or divided. It means if you pay taxes this rate reduction benefits everyone. It provides real money for real people. Mr. Speaker. I would note for a married couple with two kids. a combined income of $75.000. a machinist and schoolteacher. it will provide $1.600 in tax relief once fully phased in. $400 this year."},{"1":"2000","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Speaker. as has been stated before. we sought an open rule. The Committee on Rules decided to give us the open rule. The law says that a percentage of that money. up to 8 percent for PittmanRobertson and up to 6 percent for DingellJohnson. can be used for administration expenses. We have found out. though. that the maximum percentage was used in 1998. $31 million was used for administration purposes. Throughout the 1990s. the percentage escalated from 2 percent or 3 percent all the way to the maximum. which is 14 percent. Our yearlong oversight project examined exactly how the $31 million was supposedly used to administer the important conservation acts. We found out. through the oversight. some very alarming things. Mr. Speaker. I suggest respectfully. in fact. we found out that the money was spent not as the law said it shall be spent. not for administrative purposes. The bill I bring to the House today is designed to make sure that not one dime of wildlife or sport fishing conservation trust funds are misspent again. We have been as accommodating as possible to concerns about adequate levels of funding for program administration. and with the open rule we want to be receptive to other ideas about how to make the conservation funds run more effectively. The bill was developed during a 7month process with 14 wildlife and fish sport groups representing each State. These groups conceptualized the solutions based on the oversight work of the Committee on Resources. We held three oversight investigative meetings. and we had suggestions from those findings. and this bill is a result of those. The law as exists today does not authorize those expenditures which occurred. but rather than argue over that point. we focused on solutions which are in the bill that I bring to the Committee on Rules today. My cosponsor and I decided to fix the loopholes that the Fish and Wildlife Service point to when they try to justify their expenditure of administration of trust funds. This bill caps the amount of administrative expenditures at $10 million. We spell out exactly what expenses are authorized to administer the program. We add reporting and auditing requirements. We create a transparent multipleState grant program where $5 million of the funds were improperly used for unauthorized costs. We use some of the savings to enhance hunter safety and education. We create an associate director of Fish and Wildlife. and sport fish trust funds to raise the profile of these important conservation activities and look out for the conservation trust funds. These are solutions of the PittmanRobertson. DingellJohnson acts. two acts that are vital to the conservation and restoration of wildlife and sport fishing in the country. I have asked for only one amendment today under the rule that increases the level of funding from $10 million to $14 million. with a total level of funding of $19 million. We did this to ensure a transition period for 3 years during which there would be a slight reduction in staffing levels that manage that trust fund. My amendment takes the authorized level down from 120 employees in 2001 to 100 employees in 2003. That adjusts the level upward thereafter based on the Consumer Price Index. The amendment makes other technical changes to make sure that the bill conforms with other parts of the underlying PittmanRobertson. DingellJohnson acts that are not amended. Other than that. we think we have a good bill. Overall. this is a good bill and should be passed and voted on by all my colleagues."},{"1":"1999","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. in November. representatives from across the global arrive in Seattle to negotiate changes in the international trade agreements of the World Trade Organization. the WTO. Trade has worked well for our country. We sell 30 percent of our agricultural products to foreign trading partners. In fact in Pennsylvania. my home State. $16 billion of farm products are exported annually. Our country relies on its ability to trade. And while I generally support free trade. I also insist upon fair trade. If other countries can produce products cheaper than we can without abusing its workers and without breaking international trade laws. so be it. They have every right to access our markets. But a successful global economy depends upon a level playing field. Everyone must play by the same rules: Rules against illegal subsidies. rules against illegal dumping. and rules against discrimination. Unfortunately. there have been a number of recent trade violations that our country has had to respond to. They include illegal steel dumping. bans on U.S. beef and bananas and other products. Our airlines and aviation manufacturers have been discriminated against and the Congress continues to deal with these inequities and justifiably so. Fortunately. we can respond to these violations because we have strong American antidumping and antisubsidy laws. These laws conform to the WTO laws and provide our only means to fight this illegal trade. They are our trading Bill of Rights. Without them we would be defenseless. Yet. the WTO agenda in Seattle includes an item that might strip away these very rights. That is. denying our ability to deal with these illegal trade activities. Mr. Speaker for this reason. the House must bring House Resolution 298 to the floor. We must let the world know that we will not stand for foreign interference with our trade laws. Our country is the bedrock of global trade. We should not permit our trading partners to strip away our rights to free trade. We must insist that the WTO provide language that protects us against unfair trade and illegal dumping. Mr. Speaker. I support the ViscloskyNey resolution. House Resolution 298."},{"1":"1998","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I would like to just briefly explain to my colleagues what I have attempted to do. Yesterday. I sent to the desk an amendment which would have transferred the $35 million that is appropriated in the foreign operations appropriations bill that is before us now. and reallocated that money from the currently earmarked Korean- Peninsula Energy Development Organization to the antiterrorist portion of funding contained within this bill. I did so because of the disturbing news that have been reported on by the New York Times and other organizations relative to violations. apparent violations of the agreement that we entered into with North Korea to freeze their nuclear development program. The New York Times--and I will recount some of that in a momentpointed out that U.S. intelligence agencies have detected a huge. secret. underground complex in North Korea that they believe is the centerpiece of an effort to revive the countrys frozen nuclear weapons program. Members will remember that in return for a freeze on that program. the United States entered into an agreement with North Korea to provide certain items for humanitarian assistance. food aid. oil for energy production. as well as a commitment to put together a consortium which would build two lightwater nuclear reactors to supply energy. but that could not be used for the purpose of developing material which might be used for weapons of mass destruction. The Times report cites a senior administration official saying. and I quote: The North had not yet technically violated the Agreed Framework because there is no evidence that Pyongyang has begun pouring cement for a new reactor or a reprocessing plant... Nevertheless. an unidentified official has said it is a serious development. to say nothing of it is an incredibly stupid move. because it endangers both the nuclear accord and humanitarian aid to North Korea. The Washington Post stated that the site that was discovered is huge. that some 15.000 reported North Koreans are at work on this underground cavern. and this comes only 6 months after the President of the United States has certified that North Korea is complying with the provisions of the Agreed Framework. That certification is what is necessary in order for these funds to be released. My amendment sought to take a portion of those funds. transfer it to the antiterrorism section of this bill in recognition of the fact that this Presidential certification was no longer relevant. now that the agreement had been violated. I am willing to withdraw that amendment in light of the fact that Senator MCCAiN has offered an amendment adding language to the certification process so that the President. in addition to other items that he has to certify. will have to certify that North Korea is not engaged in a violation of the agreement. The exact wording is pursuing the acquisition or development of nuclear capability other than the lightwater reactors referred to in the agreement. I would have voted against the McCain amendment. or for the motion to table had we not been able to work out language which I could now add to the amendment of the Senator from Texas which would add further conditions to this certification. The bottom line is. I think the certification has turned into an empty process. It is a process by which the socalled host country. in this case North Korea. essentially tells us everything is OK. and then we. on the basis of that. go ahead and certify. The term certification is not defined. but yet if we look at the use of the term that is used in the agreement that we have with the Peoples Republic of China regarding nuclear nonproliferation. it simply says that the President certifies to the Congress that the Republic of China has provided clear and convincing evidence that they are in compliance with the agreement. And so the burden of proof is on the country which we are trying to determine whether or not they have violated the agreement. rather than on our ability to verify the fact that they have or have not complied with the agreement. President Reagan used to say trust but verify. Well. this is trust but not verify. And so what I am attempting to do with this modification. which goes to an amendment offered by the Senator from Texas. is to say that not less than 45 days prior to the Presidents certification as provided for in this bill. the Director of Central Intelligence will provide for review and consideration by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. House International Relations Committee. House National Security Committee. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. and Senate Appropriations Committee as well as the Senate Armed Services Committee. all relevant information bearing on North Koreas compliance with the provisions of this amendment. That gives us the opportunity in Congress to determine whether or not the certification is a legitimate certification. That gives us the information to determine whether or not North Korea is in full compliance with what they agreed to do. So I think this language is important. One last thing. I am withdrawing my amendment. partly because I believe the other body will take action on some deferral of this money and that this item can be handled in conference. It is clear that without that assurance we may get bogged down here in this process. and I dont want to hold up this appropriation. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for agreeing to this modification. I particularly thank the Senator from Texas for allowing me to make this modification to her amendment. which will then become part of the bill. I think this is a serious problem. If the New York Times report is substantiated. if it is correct. even remotely correct. it is a clear and direct violation of the promise and agreement made by North Korea to freeze its nuclear development capabilities. If that is the case. it is clear that this is a breach of promise which requires very serious reaction and response by the United States. The President of the United States and the Secretary of State have certified to us directly that there are no violations. Yet. we now receive this particular information. I have quotes here from the President of the United States and from the Secretary of State which have led us to believe that everything is in compliance. Yet. we now receive this report. So it is the credibility of the certification process that is at stake here. and I would say it is the credibility of this administration in evaluating the intelligence. Therefore. it is necessary that. at the very least. the Congress have access to all relevant intelligence regarding this particular agreement so in the future we can verify it. in addition to the trust that is placed by this administration on the word of North Korea. Mr. President. testifying before the House Subcommittee on Foreign Operations. Committee on Appropriations on March 4. 1998. Secretary Albright stated: Our request this year Includes $35 million for the Korean Energy Development Organization. The Agreed Framework has succeeded in freezing North Koreas dangerous nuclear program. On May 8. 1998. James Foley. Department of State said: We. of course. closely monitor the Agreed Framework. We are. until now. satisfied that the DPRK has indeed met its obligations to the present. On May 13. 1998. Jamie Rubin said: We are confident that North Korea has not violated the acrosstheboard freeze on Its nuclear activities . . . and the Agreed Framework is alive and well. On July 8. 1998. Secretary Albright testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that: The Peoples Republic of China has consistently supported the Agreed Framework that has frozen North Koreas dangerous nuclear weapons program. ... On July 19. 1998. Jamie Rubin. Department of State. responding to .a GAO report alleging North Korea was blocking inspections at sites covered by the Agreed Framework said: We have frozen and stopped the North Korean nuclear program from moving in a direction that would have threatened the world. The freeze is still being monitored and we believe it is still in effect. Less than 1 month later on August 17. 1998. the New York Times broke the following story: U.S. Intelligence Agencies have detected a huge secret underground complex in North Korea that they believe is the centerpiece of an effort to revive the countrys frozen nuclear weapons program. according to officials who have been briefed on the intelligence information. The finding also follows a string of provocations by the north. including missile sales to Pakistan and the incursion of a small North Korean submarine carrying nine commandos off the South Korean coast this year. And what was the administrations reaction? According to the same New York Times article: A senior administration official said the north had not yet technically violated ... the Agreed Framework. because there is no evidence that Pyongy Ang has begun pouring cement for a new reactor or reprocessing plant.... The article continues: But spy satellites have extensively photographed a huge work site 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon. the nuclear center. where. until the 1994 accord. the north Is believed to have created enough plutonium to build six or more bombs. Thousands of North Korean workers are swarming around the new site. burrowing into the mountainside. American officials said. And if that is not enough. Mondays test flight of the Taepo Dong1 over Japan demonstrates that North Korea has mastered the technology of delivering a nuclear warhead. Yesterdays New York Times reported the following: Gary Milhollin of the Wisconsin project on nuclear arms control . .. said the missile test was a clear sign of North Koreas Intent to develop nuclear weapons. despite its 1994 agreement with the United States to stop in exchange for western assistance. Milhollin said a twostage missile was too costly to construct simply for delivering conventional weapons. -It means they plan to put a nuclear warhead on It or export It to somebody who will. he said. The missile makes no sense otherwise. In short. this administration has negotiated an accord in 1994 that we cannot and do not even attempt to monitor and verify. As we have just been reminded this week by the resignation of a key U.S. arms inspector in Iraq. William Ritter. The illusion of arms control is more dangerous than no arms control at all. Yet that is precisely where we are left. An illusion that the administration refuses to define as such. Certifications that are meaningless. Ronald Reagan reminded us to trust. but verify. The North Koreans insist by their reluctance to admit inspectors that we will not verify as a basic term of the agreement. So we are left simply with trust. Trust the North Korean regime which has just launched long range missiles over our allies. Trust of the administration. Trust that has been frivolously squandered and badly eroded. Again. I thank the participants in this for accepting this modification of the amendment."},{"1":"1997","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. the Senator from West Virginia has long been concerned and interested in international trade.

It is not the case that the Senator from West Virginia. myself. and others. who believe that fast track is inappropriate and our trade strategy has not worked believe we should put walls around our country or restrict international trade. I think we ought to expand it. I say this to those folks who talk about fast track: If you want to be fast about something. do something fast. put on your Speedo trunks and do something quickly. and start to quickly solve the trade problems we have. I can cite a dozen of them that undercut American jobs and American producers. workers. and farmers. If you want to be fast about something. lets be fast about starting to solve a few of these problems. Just demonstrate that you can solve one. it doesnt have to be all of them. Demonstrate that this country has the nerve and will to stand up and say to other countries: If our market is open to you. then your market has to be open to us. We pledge to you that we will be involved in fair trade with you. We demand and insist that you be involved with fair trade practices with us. If not. this country has the will and the nerve to take action. That is all I ask. If you want to be fast. dont come around here with fast track. come around with fast action to solve trade problems.

I want to thank the gentleman from New York and the gentleman from Pennsylvania for being fair to all concerns. But I would like to say this: that there are many of us who did not join this committee for cerebral stimulation. Mr. Speaker. this Nation must improve its infrastructure and I believe that there is much more that we can and should be doing. and I think that public works is most important. It will help to put people to work in our country. and improve the quality of life. Specifically I want to thank the committee for three projects that will be happening in my district. First. the Army Corps to plan and assist with a regional water system for our valley. absolutely necessary. to make improvements to the Gerard Lake and in fact make repairs at that spillway. and finally. the environmental dredging program for the Mahoning River that cuts right through the city of Youngstown from the Beaver River on up through all that old steel mill property that has been polluted for years. This will help to clean up the city of Youngstown. So I am hoping that in the future all this business of being afraid of earmarks. being afraid of pork barrels. keep this in mind. These are taxpayer dollars that come from our communities. put back into our communities. and I would hope that our venerable leader. the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. OBERSTARJ. will continue to push hard for the inclusion of these projects for both Democrats and Republicans. I also want to say that the gentleman from Pennsylvania has been a war horse as well. and without these two fellows specifically.

I object. Let me indicate. of course. that the appropriations bill originates in the House. This does not have any standing in any event. but it would have standing if done in the way I prescribed because it would be attached to the bill. It would go to the House. I want to make the record very clear because I think sometimes people fail to understand why certain things happen. The LaborHHS appropriations was reported. and it has been on the Senate calendar since September 15. Senator HATFIELD. chairman of the Appropriations Committee. has been prepared every day since that timealong with Senator SPECTER. chairman of the subcommitteeprepared to bring that bill to the floor. and so has. I might add. the Senator from Iowa. Senator HARKIN. the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee. The leadership on the Democratic side. because of striker replacement--in other words. If we repeal the Presidents Executive orderwill not let us bring the bill up. They are not willing to take their chances in a debate and are not willing to try to strike that provision on the Senate floor. So we have been stymied. So I would say to all of the people at the Labor Department. Mr. Reich. Secretary of Labor. and the Secretary of HHS. and others who are nonessentialthey are not nonessentialbut the nonessential workers who will not be going to work tomorrow. to just take a look at the recorddo not listen to the pressand take a look at the facts. The facts are that since September 15 that bill has been on the calendar. We have tried to get it up three or four times by unanimous consent. That has been objected to by my colleagues on the other side. We have had two cloture votes. We failed on cloture votes because of striker replacement. We failed along partyline votes. We only have 53 Republicans. We need 60 to shut off debate. and we will have another cloture vote on Tuesday. So what I suggestand we want to keep the Government open until the 22is to bring that bill up. pass it by unanimous consent. and add a 5day additional continuing resolution to it so the Government will be open until December 22. which will be next Friday at midnight. It seemed to me that was a good way to dispose of two items that are still here that should have been disposed of weeks and weeks and weeks ago. And I regret that because of one provision. because of the Presidents allegiance to the organized labor leaders--not the working peoplebecause of his allegiance to the labor leaders and all the money they pump into the Democratic Party. that because of this one little provision that deals only with an Executive order made by the President. we are going to keep 150.000 workers from their jobs tomorrow and maybe the rest of the week and a lot of other things. funding for NIH. a lot of other programs. including the LowEnergy Assistance Program in the Labor. HHS appropriations bill. So the public ought to know that when the labor leaders speak. my colleagues listen. They will not let this bill come up because the labor leaders are opposed to one provisionone provision. I know it is difficult for the media to print the facts and report the facts. but these are the facts. Do not take my word for it. It is all in the Where is the calendar that will show how long it has been on it. to make certain I have it right? I think it is Reported by the committee September 15. So it has been around September to October. October to November. November to December. It has been around 3 months. 90some days. and we cannot pass it because my colleagues on the other side will not let us pass It because of one provisionone provision and we could have opened up the Government. The Speaker said if we would get consent to do this. he would try to pass it tomorrow. So we have made an effort again. I hope in good faith. We tried before to bring this bill up. Let me also include in the RECORD. because I know I read today in the Washington Post how the tourists were frustrated and there may be some in thethe zoo is closed but the Senate is open. That ought to tell you something. I know what it tells you. But we are here. The bears are resting. In any event. maybe it ought to be the other way around. Close this up and open the zoo. If you cannot get into the zoo. this may be the next best choice. We wrote the President yesterday. We suggested to the President that he ought to sign the three bills that have been on his deskCommerce. Justice. State. the Judiciary. which employs 194.000 Federal workers. the Interior bill. which employs 103.800 workers. and the VAHUD bill. which employs 293.000 workers. Now. that is a total of 620.900 workers. All these bills have been on the Presidents desk. With all the stories today about the parks being closed and people came all the way here. it is an unfortunate thing that they came back here to see certain sights and participate in some of the holiday period festivities and all the buildings are closed. The President can take care of that with a stroke of the pen. He can do it right now. It is a little late for the weekend. But they would be open tomorrow morning. The bill is there. Mr. President. All you have to do is sign it. sign the other bills. and a lot of people will go back to work. So. again. I would like to include in the RECORD the list of the bills. If he would sign these bills. it covers the following agencies: Justice. Commerce. the Judiciary. State. Small Business. USIA. the Interior. Indian Health. Forestry. Energy. NASA. National Science Foundation. Veterans. Housing and Urban Development. EPA. In all these different agencies. people would be back to work. and we think that is important. So I would like to include that information along with a copy of the letter that the Speaker and I sent to the President yesterday indicating that we hoped that he would sign those bills. We also advised the President we could pass the DC appropriations bill tomorrow evening. We hope we can get consent to deem that passed In the Senate after it passes the House. And we also suggested to the President. I might add. the Labor. HHS bill and pointed out to the President that we have made repeated efforts to bring up the Labor. Health and Human Services. and Education appropriations bill but the Senate Democrats have prevented the bill from moving forward. We asked for the Presidents help. We asked him yesterday to help us get the bill passed so that we can send it to him for his consideration and another 150.000 workers could continue working. So I ask unanimous consent that those be printed in the RECORD."},{"1":"1994","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. the time of decision about whether or not to renew mostfavorednation [MFN] status for China is upon us. Although the Secretary of State has until June 3 to make his recommendation to President Clinton. all bets are that lie will make the call in the next week just after Members leave town and just before his Dday trip to Europe. I stand before this body and the Nation today to urge President Clinton to stand behind his Executive order and revoke MFN in light of the new crackdown in China against religious and political dissent. No one disputes that the Presidents Executive order was clear. and no one disputes that there has been overall. significant regression instead of progress in human rights in China. Let us look at recent evidence. Only a week ago correspondent Lena Sun of the Post reported thatChina amended its public order law to broaden the already extensive powers of the police to detain and restrict the activities of democracy and labor activist as well as religious and national minority groups * new regulations essentially give authorities the right to detain anyone they regard as a threat to the socialist system. New regulations include: First. carrying out activities under the name of a social organization without registration. Second. organizing activities of superstitious sects and secret societies to disrupt public order. Third. disturbing public order and damaging peoples health through religious activities. Fourth. stirring up conflicts between nationalities. hurting their unity and inciting separation of nationalities. Fifth. fabricating or distorting facts. spreading rumors or otherwise disrupting public order. or doing harm to the public interest through other means. About the same time these regulations came out. some Tibetan nuns received longer prison stays for singing patriotic songs while in detention. Then last Thursday. Human Rights Watch/Asia released a new report citing almost 500 previously unknown prisoners of conscience jailed for their involvement in the Tiananmen Square demonstration. Further. this seminal report details the charade ICRC prison inspection that was later canceled by Beijing. Inmates were allowed their first showers in a year. sick prisoners with unattractive appearances were moved. and window glass was partially installed in windows normally covered in paper. Yes. we are grateful for the release of some prominent Tiananmen leaders like Wang Juntao and Chun Ziming. but they are a drop in the bucket as China continues to arrest many more activists. On the categories in which the President stated we must see overall. significant progress. we are clearly seeing overall. significant regressionleaving the administration claiming new Chinese promises to talks on Red Cross visits and talks about not jamming Voice of America broadcasts as purported progress in the categories that follow the two must do conditions. The two must do conditions for MFN renewal are: First. progress on resolving outstanding emigration cases. and. second. progress on tightening the 1991 Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] on prohibition of forced labor exports from China. The Chinese have helped resolve limited emigration cases. In spite of the muchlauded progress on the MOU. the Chinese have only agreed to make a toothless agreement a bit less weakleaving themselves plenty of turnaround time to sanitize prison labor camps before allowing visits by United States officials. I know some guys in Pyongyang and Baghdad who would love to sign up for that kind of inspection regime. Harry Wu just returned from a covert trip to China in which he visited 26 prisons. bringing back fresh evidence that the Chinese knowingly violate both the letter and the spirit of their agreement not to export forced labor products into China. He even implicated two U.S. companies which the prison factory officials admitted to be importers of their slave labor products. Purported progress on the MOU is clearly a sham. Many are urging the Clinton administration to cave in and to set up some ineffectual alternatives to revoking MFN like a new SineUnited States human rights commission and voluntary Sullivan Principles for United States businesses in China. Mr. Speaker. with all due respect. I submit that the new commission would only provide one more layer of bureaucracy for Chinese grandstanding and stalling. And the Sullivan Principles would clearly be voluntary because no U.S. business wants such restrictions in their dealbrokering with Beijing. Let us face it. trade is the only leverage that carries any true weight with the Chinese regime which is bolstered by our dollarswhich make up almost 40 percent of their export market. And. in answer to the reply that MFN pressure has not achieved our desired result. I say that we have to date not revoked MFN. The lack of progress is probably due to mixed signals and idle threats the Chinese do not believe well carry out. I believe the real question is whether or not well honestly call Beijings bluff and do the morally right thing: revoke MFN in light of continued Chinese repression. If we do not. I believe we will not only let many in China down who are hoping we will stand firm for democracy. but only lose our credibility with the dictators of Beijing and the entire region. The message is: make our commitments seem too painful to carry out. and we will cave. I close with a letter from the U.S. Catholic Conference which speaks more eloquently than I on this question: 0 This symbol represents the time of day during the [louse proceedings. e.g.. 0 1407 is 2:07 p.m. Matter set in this typelace indicates words inserted or appended. rather than spoken. by a Member of the House on the floor."},{"1":"1993","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"the bill. please. My friend and I are of the same generation. We are the Lindbergh generation. literally. and we use we too often. We. he says. have given away our rights. That law was passed in 1974. How many of us were here in 1974? Can one Congress bind a subsequent Congress 29 years later? Are you saying those who were here 29 years ago gave away rights of new Senators here to represent a State? What am I hearing? I do not believe my ears. I wonder if people have read the bill. The section I am trying to eliminate says. Subtitle D. Implementation of N A FTA-N A FTA- Supplemental Agreements. And yet the testimony of the administration is they are not part of NAFTA. they are not trade agreements. Agreements Relating to Labor and Environment. What do we do? We start first off. we authorize money to be appropriated to such agencies the President may designate. $20 million for a commission we had nothing to do with. The Senator just said it is not created by law. It is inferred that the Presidents authority to negotiate those agreements gave him the authority to create new functions of Government. new trilateral functions of Government. paid for by the taxpayers of the United States. If you go through it. it has the Agreement on Environmental Cooperation. It gives again $5 million to go ahead with that. And it talks about the Agreement on Border and Environmental Operation Commission. again. that is $5 million to go ahead with it. North American Development Bank and related provisions. We obligate the United States to participate in a new bank with taxpayers money with no authority of the Congress. Let me repeat that. a bank. the North American Development Bank. But. as the Senator from Rhode Island says. it is not in this bill. What is in the bill is legislation that has nothing to do with NAFTA. It implements two side agreements that were negotiated after negotiating time for trade agreements expired. But what are we doing? We may subscribe on behalf of the United States to 150.000 shares of the capital stock of the bank. I cannot believe it. That bank was created by an Executive agreement with no authority of anybody. and we are to approve it. approve money to put it up. I just do not understand it. Exemption from securities laws for certain securities issued by the Bank. They are exempt from the laws that apply to everybody else. You just go buy 150.000 shares. It does not say how much you can pay for them but that is another matter. Community Adjustment Investment Program. The President can enter into another agreement now. This time we authorize him to enter into an agreement with a bank that he created. I tell you. I do not think people are reading this bill. I am just trying to do what anyone would do that has read this bill. If this were a budget act. I would make a point of order it should not be in this bill. I would offer a motion to strike and my motion would not be ruled out of order by the Chair. That is all there is to it. There are only 16 Senators here today who were Members of this body in 1974. Let me repeat that. 16 Senators voted on the 1974 bill. and my friend from Rhode Island says we waived our rights. As a matter of fact. I voted against the 1988 trade bill which granted the President the authority to negotiate NAFTA under the fast track."},{"1":"1992","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. while the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee is on the floor I would like to express my appreciation for. again. his achievements in carrying out a very difficult. arduous bill and especially for his continued support as we address the difficult personnel issues that affect our Armed Forces. As you all know. we are forcing thousands of young men and women to leave the military. I appreciate the concern and commitment on the part of the chairman in trying to ease the transmission and burden we are placing on these young men and women. I would also like to express my appreciation to the distinguished chairman of the defense appropriations subcommittee and the ranking member. Senator STEVENS. Senator INOUYE and Senator STEVENS worked very hard on this bill and I think they have shaped a very difficult compromise that in policy areas I am fully supportive of. I also rise again though. this year. Mr. President. to strongly oppose many of the addons. unauthorized and authorized. to this bill which we can frankly no longer afford. I find them. again. totally unacceptable. I also want to admit from the start that I am not without sin in casting the first stone. All of us have had to accept legislation that contains items we wish had not been added to our bills. Further. all of us have to fight hard for our State and constituent interests. If we do not. the end result Is inevitably to see our programs lose funding. regardless of their merit. and addons and pork take their place. There is no man or woman in this body who can point the finger at others in innocence. In fact. it is one of our key functions to fight for the interests of the constituents we serve. I do not believe. however. that we should close out this years defense debate without at least some review of the problems we have created for our Nations defense. I do not believe that we should ignore the fact we have created a new case for the line item veto. for restraint in disrupting the Presidents defense budget. and for eliminating the pork we insert into the defense buiget. We are in the process of making draconian cuts in defense spending. We are cutting spending on procurement in ways that threaten our defense industrial base. We are cutting spending on operations and maintenance in ways which threaten to recreate a hollow Army. a hollow Navy. a hollow Marine Corps. and a hollow Air Force. We are cutting force levels to a point which threatens our ability to fight another Desert Storm in a world that still has its tyrants and aggressors. We are also cutting defense at a time when we face a major recession. We are forcing millions of Americans to find new jobs--Americans who won the cold war and many of whom fought in Desert Storm. Every time we put $35.000 into any area that does not reflect a legitimate high priority need. we take a job away from an American who earned it and give it to someone who did not. Let me repeat this point. Mr. President. There is no such thing as a free lunch and there is no such thing as free pork. Every dollar any Senator or Congressman moves out of the Presidents defense budget request contributes to costing some American his or her job. Every time these dollars total up to $35.000. they cost an entire Job. All of us tend to conveniently forget this when we make claims to our constituents. We all list what we added. but we never list what we took away. None of us go home and state what our net Impact was on our States and districts. Quite frankly. most of us do not even know at the end of our deliberations whether we produced a net increase in jobs or spending unless we focus almost solely on pork and forget our Nations security needs. I believe that we need to remind ourselves of these facts before we finish our debates on this years defense bills. I believe that we must lay the ground work for a searching examination of the addons we have made to the Presidents defense budget request. I believe that we should lay the ground work for open Government and for media review of what we have done."},{"1":"1991","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Let me state in my 2 minutes. my problem is we have to finally get specific as to how that is to be done. It behooves me. and it behooves you. to get specific. It is the pain that comes in paying for these things that is the real problem. I recognize the legitimacy of the argument that this tax has added to problems created by the recession for the boating industry. the aircraft Industry. and the other affected industries--the serious loss of jobs and the problems that result therefrom. We will be giving this consideration In the Finance Committee. The question Is whether we can do it this quickly at this late date with the controversy that will arise over raising the funds to pay for it. That is my problem. That is my concern. I share with the Senator the concerns of the unemployed that have resulted from this. The problems in the econ-: omy have grown far beyond what was anticipated when the luxury tax was enacted. We had no idea we would be dealing with these kinds of economic conditions. with a recession that would be so deep or last so long. And. of course. conventional economic wisdom Is that sales of luxury goods are not pricesensitive. There is a CRS study showing that is true In the boat Industry. So. the major factor here. whether you are talking about boats. airplanes or other luxury goods in this recession. People do not by new boats when they are in a recession. They do not look on that as a necessity. They dont buy used boats either. and sales of used boats are also down. Thats one factor that tells you this recession has been the major cause of Job losses in these industries. As I said. this terrible recession was never anticipated when the luxury tax was passed. But coupling that increased tax with a recession has led to concern about hitting these industries when they are down. Thats why the tax issue must be address. When we do that. again let me emphasize that. we need to look at the repealing the entire tax. not Just the boat tax."},{"1":"1990","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"My staff will research that.

I want the record to show that I intended to vote no."},{"1":"1988","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. the Family Welfare Reform Act represents an important opportunity to lift countless Americans from the quagmire of welfare dependency. It is an important step forward in increasing the effectiveness of our Nations welfare system. However. I am concerned about the effectiveness of S. 1511 in meeting certain needs in rural areas. Under current law. a potential welfare recipient is excluded from receiving AFDC if he or she owns a car with an asset value of more than $1.500. However. that same person could be eligible to receive food stamps if his or her car has a fair market value of under $4.500. And it looks as though the food stamp criteria may be raised to $5.500. Mr. President. I do not believe that it is either sensible or fair to use two different criteria for those in need of benefits. Nor do I believe that it is sensible or fair to force someone owning a car that may be worth $1.750 to sell it in order to draw those benefits. Mr. President. this situation wreaks havoc on rural areas. In my own State of North Dakota. people often must drive long distances to reach a job. And if someone is forced to sell their car to draw AFDC and subsequently finds a job that is unaccessible except by car. theyre out of luck. That simply makes no sense. The ideal solution would be to use identical criteria for both food stamp and AFDC eligibility. There is no justification for two different standards regarding the value of a recipients automobile. The food stamp criteria are more reasonable than the current AFDC standards. While I would prefer creating identical standards for food stamps and AFDC. according to CBO. using the food stamp standard could cost as much as $500 million over 5 years. Consequently. until the Finance Committee reached its compromise with the administration. I had intended to offer an amendment that would provide for a 5year demonstration project. The amendmentidentical to a provision in the Housepassed billwould have enabled up to five States to use the food stamp criteria instead of the AFDC critria on automobile valuation when determining welfare eligibility. However. I understand that the cost of the compromise reached between the committee and the administration would create difficulty for the committee in accepting my amendment. Therefore. in deference to my friends Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator BErrsEN. as well as the rest of the committee. I will not offer my amendment. However. I would urge my colleagues on the committee to strongly consider the merits of this provision during their conference with the House. Mr. President. this demonstration would allow us to test the value of using identical criteria. It also would enable us to determine the actual cost of such a change. and whether or not it would be advisable to use identical criteria on a national scale. It would enable us to better determine the effect of such a change on the welfare system. And under this amendment. poor families in rural areaswho often must drive long distances to reach a jobwould have better chances of locating and holding on to jobs that enable them to permanently leave the welfare rolls. This provision. as it is included in the Housepassed bill. represents a small first step toward the solution of a much larger problem. I urge my colleagues to take this into account in conference."},{"1":"1987","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I thank the Senator from Louisiana for yielding 5 minutes. Mr. President. I rise in opposition to the proposed amendment which would strike the current sugar drawback provisions in S. 1420. I do it because the Domino sugar bag which I have sitting in my office was manufactured in my own State. Here today. but it might be gone tomorrow. To Marylanders. we have the Domino sugar sign standing in the Baltimore harbor. For the last few months it has served as a picturesque backdrop to the Baltimore harbor for the movie Tin Men. But behind the logo is 650 jobs just in the Baltimore communityjobs that could go down the drain if this amendment passes. But it is not only the 650 constituents of my State that I am worried about. I am concerned about the future of Americas sugar refining industry as a whole. America has already lost 7.000 jobs and 8 of 22 refineries because refiners have too little sugar to refine. Now. with the proposal to deny the refiners access to Customs drawback. we are in danger of losing even more jobs and perhaps the whole domestic refining industry. We hear a lot about high tech. but you know we have to pay attention to low techthose ordinary jobs that provide Americas industrial infrastructure. That is what the sugar refining industry doesmaking products by Americans to be consumed by Americans or exported. The sugar drawback provisions in this bill will allow U.S. sugar refiners a rebate on the duty they paid on sugar they have imported into the United States. refined in U.S. plants and then exported for sale on the world market. Without this drawback provision. U.S. sugar refiners will not be able to afford to import sugar and refine it in the United States. This means that we will have less work port cities like Baltimore. New York. New Orleans. This will also further damage an already depressed maritime industry having a negative multiplier effect in our community. If we lost it. it will mean that we will lose more jobs. Finally. this amendment has foreign policy implications. It will hurt American allies like the Philippines who are struggling to achieve democracy in the Pacific rim. The Philippines has already been damaged by their lack of access to United States refiners as a result of U.S. agricultural policy. The drawback provision in S. 1420 still guarantees U.S. sugar growers their market in the United States. while at the same time allowing U.S. refiners to export business for the foreign markets. It is a sensible. costeffective provision that opens up our refineries to international commerce while not reducing the U.S. market for U.S. producers. If we pass this amendment. we may force refineries to close in coastal cities throughout the country. Not only will this hurt the refiners. but it will also hurt the U.S. sugar growers who have no place to go to have their products refined. So. Mr. President. I urge the defeat of this amendment. because it is bad national policy. it is bad economic policy. it is bad foreign policy. and it is bad policy for plain. ordinary Americans. I yield back such time as I might not have consumed."},{"1":"1986","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. there are two reasons why this amendment should be rejected: First. it will kill immigration reform. and second. it is wrong and it is unfair. It is a killer amendment. Mr. Chairman. What are we going to do if this amendment passes. send in INS to round everybody up. a massive deportation? I thought under this bill they were supposed to do something else at the border. Legalization is just. humane and necessary. in the traditions of this country. It will eliminate the underclass that exists right now. It will allow 5. 7. 9. 3 million people to come out of bondage. people who are not criminals. as some of my colleagues have said. but have been contributing to this society. have been taking jobs that we do not want. We have been recruiting them. All of a sudden. to lower the hammer. that is wrong. and it is against the traditions of this country. Mr. Chairman. I submit someone mentioned the Statue of Liberty.

Mr. Chairman. the fact is that. one. we cannot educate this House at this point as to the respective intricacies of certain business endeavors such as manufacturing. agriculture. retailer. or whatever. The fact is that this bill. as it is written. imposes a burden on an agricultural worker because a farmer. for example. would hire an individual in this field for a period of time. Then that work terminates. Then he has to rehire him when he moves to the next field or next crop 1 week or 2 weeks hence. Under this legislation. he would have to do the paperwork every 2 or 3 weeks for the same worker. Agriculture is not asking for special privileges. This amendment is simply aimed at streamlining the verification process so that we do not burden an employer with the onus of unnecessary. repetitive verification of the same employee to satisfy the technical requirement of the law. This process in no way affects employer sanctions. It changes nothing except that it reduces the paperwork for the farmer and for the identification process for the prospective employee."},{"1":"1983","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I support the Pryor amendment and am pleased to be a cosponsor. As Senator PRYOR has indicated in his statement today and in a statement he made several weeks ago. the program administered through FEMA run by the Emergency Food and Shelter National Board has been successful in providing meals for the hungry and shelter for the homeless. The private charitable organizations who chose to involve themselves in this program deserve our highest commendation. The programs were established in hundreds of cities and towns across this country quickly and the money was allocated efficiently. The administrative costs were remarkably small for a program of this magnitude. Now. however. these organizations have distributed all the money appropriated to them for this emergency program. Moreover. as millions of poor Americans face another winter. threatened by a lack of food. heat. or even a home. we see that virtually all of the money distributed by these charities has been spent. These organizations report that less than 20 percent of the money originally appropriated remains for use this winter. They believe that an additional $40 million will go a long way toward continuing the effective work that they and thousands of local organizations have done for the last few months with these Federal moneys. With energy and food costs continuing to rise and unemployment remaining above 9 percent despite the promised economic recovery. I do not see how this body can refuse to provide additional funds to these organizations. I know in my own State of Massachusetts. private charities have used this money to help thousands of poor residents. In Lynn. for example. the Salvation Army spent $18.000 providing 31.000 meals and $6.700 providing 870 nights of shelter. The Lazarus house in Lawrence spent $25.000 and provided 5.000 meals and 1.500 nights of shelter. The InterChurch Council in New Bedford spent $3.950 and provided 7.000 meals. In addition. this organization spent $9.200 to provide 1.640 nights of shelter. These are only a few of the many examples that I could provide. In the State as a whole. just over $350.000 were expended to provide almost 200.000 meals. almost $150.000 were spent providing 12.000 nights of lodging. Less than 1 percent of the funds distributed to Massachusetts were spent on administrative costs. I am convinced that these statistics are the hallmark of a remarkably successful program. The private charitable organizations which have participated in this program have repeatedly emphasized that it is not their intent to make this a permanent program. It is an emergency program and. as such. should only be temporary. They believe. however. as do I. that this Nation faces a severe challenge in meeting the needs of the poor for food and shelter. They believe. as do I. that our Government must look very carefully at these problems and strive to devise a permanent solution. Next month. I shall hold a series of forums around the country to examine the resurgent threat that hunger poses to the citizens of this Nation. I hope to make a series of proposals to address these problems at the conclusion of my meetings around this country. In the meantime. I believe this program will continue to help address the problem in the short term. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to continue the support we first demonstrated for these private charities in the jobs bills.*"},{"1":"1982","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. this morning when the Chiles amendment was voted on I was necessarily absent. I had to take my young daughter to a hospital. and everything is fine with my daughter. but I missed the vote. And having said this and begging the Senates indulgence for being so personal on a matter I would not have mentioned that except the vote this morning was of great importance and interest to me and I regretted deeply missing it. I wish at this point. although I am not asking unanimous consent to be recorded but to have it recorded in the record had I been here I would have voted and spoken on behalf of the Chiles amendment. Mr. President. as the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee and the chairman of the Democratic Task Force on Crime. I support Senator CHILES amendment which would relieve Federal law enforcement agencies of a budget freeze at current level appropriations through 1985. A freeze in this area would undoubtedly mean a reduction in personnel for labor intense agencies like the U.S. attorneys. FBI. Drug Enforcement Administration. and Customs. I need not spend a lot of time explaining how the Federal law enforcement agencies are already losing ground against drug traffickers and organized crime. Today we have 8 percent fewer Federal Bureau of Investigation agents than we did in 1975. Drug Enforcement Administration has 11 percent fewer personnel than it did in 1979. The U.S. Attorneys. which are screening out over 50 percent of their cases partially because they are understaffed. have 101 fewer positions and State and local assistance funds for law enforcement have been cut by 75 percent since 1980. Since 1975 violent crime in America has gone up 33 percent and the drug trafficking business is estimated to be a $85 billion a year business. This budget proposal will increase national defense by over $100 billion in the next 3 years. I cannot believe that this body does not believe it essential to spend onehalf a percent of that figure on improving domestic defense. Other than the economy there is no other issue our constituents are more concerned about than crime. Last year we worked in a bipartisan manner in blocking administration cuts that would have eliminated 434 positions in the Drug Enforcement Administration. 340 agents in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. froze undercover investigations. froze personnel in the U.S. Attorneys Officewhich was already 14 percent understaffedand eliminated all State and local drug task force programs. Again. in a bipartisan manner last month. we voted not to subject law enforcement agencies to a budget freeze when the first budget resolution was voted out of this Chamber of Congress. Just as it was clear to this body then. it should be clear now: We cannot afford to make budget cuts to law enforcement programs. Mr. President. the crimes of burglary and robbery alone cost this Nation more than $8 billion in property lost or damaged a year. This does not include such things as the increase in the price of goods to pay for security and insurance. But the real cost of crime is the physical and mental anguish that victims. family members. and friends suffer for every crime that occurs. There are no statistics or dollar figures that can put in perspective the damage and hurt that occurs when you or a family member or friend are a victim of crime. It is time to stop the rhetoric on the crime issue and spend the money so that we at least give our law enforcement people the tools necessary to do the job. As you well know. criminals are not cutting budgets. If a greater commitment to specific law enforcement. prosecution. judicial and correction agencies is necessary. then we must face that fact and make the commitment. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment."},{"1":"1981","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. President. I compliment the distinguished Senator from Alabama for bringing this amendment to the floor. It does highlight the importance of the forestry incentive program. which is very helpful in our efforts to restore and develop our forestry resources throughout the country. It is an important program. Unfortunately. Mr. President. there was. as everyone knows. a great deal of pressure to reduce the funding levels in every account across the board. The subcommittee looked very carefully at how we might try to reduce the budgetary impact of the programs funded in this legislation. For instance. no increase over last year was granted for the agricultural conservation program. Cuts were made in the waterbank program and the emergency conservation program. The rural clean water program was terminated. Under these severe budget constraints facing the committee. throughout the bill. there is an effort to reduce spending and get our budget policies under control in an effort to promote economic development. It would be extremely difficult. Mr. President. to justify. then. support for the amendment as presented. because it would mean a significant increase over and above last years funding level for this program. as important as it is in the State of Mississippi and Alabama and all other States in the country. I am wondering whether the Senator would be agreeable to modifying his amendment to raise the funding level to last years level. This would be a significant increase in funding to the amount of $12.5 million. It is not all the Senator is seeking. but it is an increase. and this Senator would be willing to recommend that the amendment be accepted if that change could be made."},{"1":"1980","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I would like to offer congratulations to two special people from Alabama who have contributed much to the development of their community and State. I recently had the pleasure of attending their 50th wedding anniversary. Barrett Clinton Shelton and Suzanne Jones were married 50 years ago in the First Presbyterian Church in Decatur. Ala.. and have since added benefits to their community and State. The Sheltons. Sr.. were honored by their children and their spouses. Mr. and Mrs. Barrett Shelton. Jr.. and Mr. and Mrs. Steve Shirley in Decatur. where some 300 distinguished guests from Alabama and other States came to celebrate the golden wedding anniversary. Barrett Shelton has been a true leader in the Tennessee Valley. or the Valley. as we refer to it. and his newspaper. the Decatur Daily. has reflected that outlook. The newspaper was founded in 1912 by Barretts father. W. R. Shelton. but in 1924. while Barrett was a student at Washington and Lee University. he was called home to take over as editor and publisher. Over the years. he has championed many causes. but none made him more proud than seeing the development of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Barrett Shelton was a strong force in Alabama for that development. and had the foresight to realize that it would mean industry to the Valley and would stop outmigration of workers. His reason was that he was more interested in jobs than cheap power rates. Here in Washington. former Congressman Bob Jones of Scottsboro. was known as Mr. TVA. and. in the Valley. Barrett Shelton was Mr. TVA. There are numerous other community and State projects to attribute to the Sheltons. but it might best be said that they have done an outstanding job in raising a family. a newspaper. and a community."},{"1":"1979","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"for their help in making this intention clearer. I would like to add to what I understand the subcommittees intention is in amending title XII. The amendment would change section 1203 so that States may choose one of two agreements with the Secretary. Option 1 is the same as the Education and Labor Committees version of section 1203. Option 2 encompassed in the amendment proposed today and adopted by the committee. eliminates the requirement that States designate an agency responsible for statewide planning. eliminates the requirement that States describe the relationship among the planning efforts of the various State entities. eliminates the requirement that the States involve institutions in the statewide planning process. and prohibits Federal planning funds to States which elect option 2. If title I of the bill is funded. this would mean about $60.000 for each State. Frankly. I think our whole country would be better served if we could amend title XII out of the bill altogether. The Congress should not pass legislation unless the intent is clear and unmistakable. and unless all the people who will be affected by it understand it. Based upon contacts I have had with college and university officials. there are many unanswered questions about title XII. Let me refer you now to the current law. Current law is clear. States that want to plan and that want Federal money to do it with. have to form a State commission (better known as a 1202 commission) that is representative of all institutions. the public. and the State. North Carolina and Wisconsin said No thank you but the other States said yes. and that is fine. Title XII in the original committee bill would change everything. It gets rid of the old law and the 1202 commissions. and says that States wishing planning money must first make detailed agreements with the Secretary. And why? No one can tell me. The committee report says: The intent is to permit the States to draw together and coordinate these (postsecondary) functions in a manner most appropriate to each State. Personally. I think it is unnecessary for the Congress to pass six full pages of legislation to permit the States to do what they are allowed to do anyway. Mr. Chairman. North Carolina says No thank you. but your States (except Wisconsin) already get Federal planning money. I remind my colleagues that if title XII is six pages long there will be at least 60 pages of regulations telling your States what they have to do to get what they have already got. Sections 1202 and 1203 of the current law passed in 1972. The colleges and universities did not like it then and the administration did not like it either. Secretary Weinberger of HEW refused to write regulations for it. But our States and their universities have adjusted and they are talking to each other in their 1202 commissions. I say to my colleagues. I am fearful that title XII. even as amended. rocks the boat when things are just getting settled. Current law seems to be working. No one seems to know what title XII is supposed to do. However. due to the lateness of the hour and the fact that this matter will be addressed again by the conferees. I want to once -again thank my colleagues. the chairman of the subcommittee. Mr. FORD. and the ranking minority member."},{"1":"1978","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. history or what has happened in the past. on many occasions provides us with a clear path to the future.

The first issue is to clear the air that the bill we consider today is a complete package of new and novel solutions to labor management problems. The second issue is a look back at the 1977 socalled Labor Law Reform Act to provide a further indepth understanding of the legislation before us today."},{"1":"1977","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman. it has been said many times that fools walk in where angels fear to tread. I never knew there were so many angels among so many fools. Mr. Chairman. this is not a new role for me. I have taken this kind of position for about 18 years. not including time in the State senate. and in all those years there were many loudly disclaiming and very few proclaiming that we needed salary increases. Mr. Chairman. I can honestly say that I know Members who never voted for a salary increase and never refused one. I do not believe on going ahead on somebody elses prayers. I figure that if I cannot pray for myself. then I will go to hell where I belong. Mr. Chairman. I believe the time has come when we should face up to the issue. As far as I am concerned. very frankly. I do not need it as much as I did when I led the fight to take care of a family when my salary was $1.500 a year. Mr. Chairman. this is the most responsible job in the United States of America for untrained. nonprofessional experts in a field in which persons obtain training and become professionals in this body if they stay long enough. We are the common run of America. or. at least. we were until a few years ago. We are the men and women of the many streets. of the valleys. of the hills. of the alleys. of the highclass districts and the lower class districts that populate this great Nation. and have done so since its beginning. Somehow we have been able to mold an organization representing all the people. and over the last 200 years we forged ahead greater distances in less space of time than have any other organized peoples on the face of the Earth. Mr. Chairman. there are many here I know personally who need every nickel they can get. but they are faced with a decision to make. They will serve just a few terms. if that. They have now left their connections which they had before they came here. and they should have a right to expect something because of this cost of living. this great inflation which attacks all of us in our lifetime. They should expect some security because all costs. the cost of business and the cost of labor. are rising. However. so long as we have those who will take the money and not stand up to vote for it. those deserving and needing it most will have to vote with them. Mr. Chairman. perhaps I lose the most by voting the way I have over all the years. but somehow or other. is it not strange that the same persons who voted for me for 47 years just voted for me again? Mr. Chairman. if I felt we needed something to give courage to men and women to stand up to the reality of life. why does it seem so important that a person. for instance. making $12.000 a year was just suddenly brought into Government just the other day with no specific training for the new position and the new title? One person I knew was in attendance at the Committee on House Administration. sitting there over 3 or 4 years. This .person I refer to making $12.000 a year was brought into Government. into the executive branch. last week at a salary of $52.000 a year. Mr. Chairman. it has been said by a wiser man than I. a much wiser man. that when a man talks. few listen and fewer hear him. That is the problem. This is a very serious matter. Do we have the love of all so great within us that we would rather be elected and serve in this body and stand up for that which we should stand up for? Mr. Chairman. the cost of living has gone up for the families of every Member of this House. as it has for everyone else around here. everyone sitting here or standing on this floor."},{"1":"1976","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. as we began this debate the gentleman from Texas made mention of the veto power in the Federalist papers and made a big todo about the fact that during the Washington. Adams. and Jefferson administrations there were probably only two or three vetoes registered during those years. Of course. if one wants to play the numbers game on vetoes. I could mention the more than 600 vetoes that were registered through Franklin Roosevelts tenure as President or even during the 80th Congress when Harry Truman was presiding there were 76 vetoes as I recall in one Congress. I submit the President is on good ground in the numbers of vetoes he has cast against what he considers to be illadvised legislation adopted by a Democraticdominated Congress. The Democrat Party has dominated the Congress during all of my 20 years here and has been noted for its profligate spending. The only checkrein the country has had on this reckless spending is the power of the President to veto. Since last year we have 31/2 million more people employed than at the same time last year. Why? Because of what has happened in the recovery of the economy through private enterprise. Moreover we are going to put an additional 21/2 million more people to work practically all through private enterprise. What has the President saved by the taxpayers by those 51 or 52 vetoes? He saved $13 billion of Federal spending. That is what can actually be traced to those vetoes. As I listened to the majority leader he condemns the vetoes on the one hand and on the other hand takes credit for the recovery. I should point out the Presidents vetoes have been sustained on the key propositions. so if there is any credit to be given for the recovery it is to be given to the policies of the administration in hanging in there and having confidence in the private enterprise system to do the job. The gentleman from Washington said that this is a centerpiece of the Democratic Partys program to put people to work. If it is the centerpiece and we have got 7 million people unemployed and we are going to put at most 250.000 people to work. how can the gentleman say then that this is the answer to the problem of unemployment? I do not see the gentlewoman from Texas on the floor or the Senator from Ohio . both of whom gave keynote addresses at the Democratic Convention. Oh. I have watched them. I listened to them very carefully and heard them admonish your delegates. Let us not overpromise what we cannot deliver. I could not help remark at the time. what an indictment they were making against your side over what you have been doing for the last several years. overpromising time and again what you cannot deliver. I submit that in this bill that is what the problem is. This bill will cost the taxpayers $4 billion we do not have. To spend $25.000 of Federal money for every job supposedly to be created by this legislation is ridiculous. I submit that for a fraction of that perjob cost we can provide millions of additional jobs with a simple tax credit for private industry to create meaningful. productive jobs of long lasting character."},{"1":"1975","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. the Federal Employees Political Activities Act. H.R. 8617. should be enacted.. We are experiencing a new awareness of the adverse consequences of governmental overregulation today. The Hatch Act is another excellent example of a good idea carried entirely too far. This is another case for deregulation. for maximizing personal freedoms by cutting back the scope of Government controls. focusing them more directly on the actual problem areas. With the shrinking public participation in our electoral process and with mounting distrust and disapproval of government generally. it is essential that we do everything in our power to encourage citizen participation in our political system. not erect barriers to such public participation. The Hatch Acts heavyhanded restrictions on the exercise of elementary political rights may have been unimportant in 1939 when the Federal work force was much smaller. But a lot of things have changed since New Deal days. Today. the Federal Government employs over 2.8 million of the Nations work force. As frightening as this statistic is to those of us who advocate limited Government. it Is a powerful argument for revising the Hatch Act. No longer can we pretend that the denial of political rights for Federal workers imposes a minor burden on a tiny segment of the population. Would that that was the case. We have had detailed for us the political rights and privileges which have been denied to Federal workers. Another perspective must also be considered. In 1939. the Congress could not even imagine the fantastic growth of Government transfer payments and the monumental growth of grantinaid programs which have created a new class of Government clients with very definite political interests. With the exception of defense contractors. all of these individuals and organizations are free to exercise their special interests through involvement in the political process. Equity demands that Federal employees. with every bit as much at stake. both as individuals and in their capacities associated in private organizations. be granted equal access to the political process. The potential for abuses which prompted enactment of the Hatch Act in 1939 has not disappeared. We must maintain strong safeguards against political intimidation of Federal employees. I believe this bill strikes a reasonable balance between provision of these safeguards and extension of greater political freedom to Federal employees. H.R. 8617 provides prohibitions against employees using their official authority to influence the outcome of an election or coercing someone to participate in political activities. It limits who can solicit contributions and where solicitations can be made. No supervisor can solicit from his employees and no solicitations can be made on Government property or in Government buildings. Federal employees are barred from political activities while on duty. The legislation establishes a threemember board to hear cases of alleged violations. As everyone who has shown an interest in regulatory reform can attest. the status quo is hard to change. It is protected by a virtually impregnable wall of mythology about the horrendous consequences of deregulationeven a partial deregulation as in this case. Opponents of this bill have employed all the emotional arguments generated by this mythology.. The biggest myth of all. however. is that the Hatch Act has produced a politically neutral bureaucracy. The bureaucracy is no political eunuch. It has its biases. And those biases are generally unrelated to which party controls the White House. Those biases are in favor of regulation and more regulation. What we must ask ourselves. then is: Is the cost in individual rights denied to Federal workers worth continuing just to keep the illusion that we have eliminated the problem of political bias in the bureaucracy? The real issue is the need to rebuild public confidence In Government. confidence eroded by a bigspending. inactive Congress and an executive branch ensnared in Its own redtape. The emotional scare tactics of opponents of this bill contribute to our basic problem of Goveminent responding to images. rather than reality."},{"1":"1974","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. on June 26 the House debated and passed H.R. 14883 by an overwhelming vote of 402 to 11. The bill will extend the authorization of the present economic development programs for 2 years. The Senate has now passed the bill and has returned it to the House with amendments. Mr. Speaker. in view of the extensive debate in the House when the bill was passed and in the interest of saving as much time as possible. I see no reason to repeat the explanations of the bill that were givenduring the House debate. In our view. with the exception of three points which will be the subject of amendments which we will offer. the amendmens added by the Senate are germane and reasonable. In short. the bill as passed by the Senate recognizes and supports the positions taken by the House. The difference between the House and Senate bills are not great enough. in our opinion. to justify going to conference with the Senate. I do recommend. however. that the House amend the bill to clear up one important point and two minor ones and return the bill to the Senate for concurrence. I have been in very close touch with the Senate Committee and because of the imperative need to pass this legislation as quickly as possible. I have been assured that the other body will concur with the House action that we are recommending. The amendments added by the Senate to the Housepassed bill do not change the basic thrust of the House billto extend the economic development program for 2 years and lay the groundwork for expanded. more effective economic development and adjustment programs. We were very pleased that amendments were adopted on the floor of the Senate that substituted provisions of the House bill for the only sections of the Senate bill that caused us major concern. The economic development programs were extended for two years. The Public Works Impact program was modified to conform with the House bill and the unemployment assistance authorized in the title IX economic adjustment demonstration program was made optional rather than mandatory. Members will recall that these last two provisions were amendments that were adopted by the House during the floor debate on the bill. The Senate. by adopting these amendments. removed the most important differences between the bills and. in doing so. effectively eliminated any need to go to conference on this bill. There are only three points remaining in the Senatepassed bill which we feel should be clarified to better reflect the sense of the House and the recommendations of the Committee on Public Works. All of these are included in the amendment before the House. The first. and most important. is the level of spending authorized in the bill. The House bill authorized a total of $510 million annually for the next 2 years for programs authorized under the Public Works and Economic Development Act. The other body has increased the total authorization to $895 million for fiscal year 1975 and $945 million for fiscal year 1976. The Public Works Committee has reviewed these authorization levels very carefully and believes the authorization levels in the Senatepassed bill should be reduced to bring them more in line with the capabilities of the agencies administering the program to use the funds wisely and effectively. The amendment we propose would reduce the Senate authorization by $215 million for the first year to a total of $680 million. For the second year we recommend an authorized level of $795 million-$150 million below the Senate authorization. We believe this reduction is a responsible action that reflects the desire of the House to reduce spending authorizations to the most realistic levels. The amendment I recommend be adopted by the House will also clarify two other sections of the bill. One would make it clear that section 302 of the bill would not create a State economic development process that could override or mandate local government or economic development district planning. The other makes it clear that title IX of this bill. the new economic adjustment program. will not replace or supersede the Office of Economic Adjustment in the Department of Defense. These clarifying amendments will eliminate potentially serious conflicts that were of concern to Members on both sides of the aisle. and I want to personally acknowledge the time and effort that three members of the committee. Mr. HARSHA. Mr. HAMMERSCHMIDT. and Mr. RoBERTS. have devoted to working out the difficult compromises that are reflected in these amendments. Mr. Speaker. this bill is truly landmark legislation. A year ago. the administration was committed to the termination of these programs. To their credit and after careful and objective evaluation. they are firmly committed to the development of new. expanded. and more effective economic development and adjustment efforts. This bill. in effect. authorizes a 2year transition period where all parties concernedthe Congress. the administration. all levels of government and the people most concernedwill be working together to not only help the depressed areas of the country that we have today but. more important. to find better ways to prevent future unemployment and human suffering. Todays forecasts of economic conditions can only be characterized as gloomy. The jobless rate today is 5.3 percent and there is virtually unanimous agreement that it is going to climb. Mr. Speaker. we strongly urge the adoption of the amendments we propose to the Senate bill. The authorization for the only programs we have that provide direct help in the creation of jobs in areas of high unemployment should be extended and there is no one that doesnt agree that these efforts should not be allowed to lapse. In the Public Works Committee report on this bill and floor debate when the House passed the bill. we pointed out that this bill is particularly important because it will not only continue the present successful programs but will help provide a transition to any new. more effective economic development and adjustment programs. The committee shares the belief of the administration that the programs of the Economic Development Administration could be made more effective in overcoming or preventing the problems of economic distress. The administration has proposed some major changes in the programs in its proposed Economic Adjustment Act which it believes will result in more comprehensive and effective economic development and adjustment efforts. We agree that some changes proposed appear to be promising. and have provided legislative changes to permit these to be tested on an experimental basis during the next 2 years. In the pending bill. these are reflected primarily in the new title IX. in the changes in title III to improve Economic Development District and State planning capabilities and responsibilities. and in the new emphasis on coordination among local. district. State. and regional offlcials. The committee intends to consider new proposals during the next several months in order to prepare specific additional legislative revisions prior to the expiration of this extension of the act. One field hearing has already been held. and others are planned. on the future economic development legislation and we will be continuing our hearings on the broader question of national public works investment policy and national strategies for better relating public works and economic development to national growth and population distribution. In addition to these hearings. the Public Works Committees Scientific Advisory Committee is making extensive studies of these problems. Our intention. Mr. Speaker. is that this extension bill will authorize a transition period in which we will be experimenting with new approaches and studying possible additional changes for the future. It is our expectation that this will result in programs which will more effectively and efficiently attain the national goal of reducing economic hardship through economic development and adjustment. One change that has been made in the Senatepassed version of H.R. 14883 that should be called to the attention of the House is in the new title IX. During the House debate on this bill. we made it clear that the Public Works Committee considered this as a demonstration program that would be limited to a few typical areas where future unemploymentparticularly those due to Federal actionscould be predicted with some certainty. Our intent is to have a relatively small number of projects where we could try innovative approaches to prevent future unemployment and economic distress in contrast with the more traditional type of Federal assistance that attempts to encourage economic development in areas that are already depressed. Title IX was also designed to test the approaches to economic adjustment suggested by the administration. Even though the Senate version of the bill does not spell out the demonstration aspects of this title as clearly as the bill passed by the House. the committee intends to carefully review and evaluate the administration of the title IX program in order that these objectives are met. One feature of this bill that should be of particular interest to the urban Members of the House is the extension of the title II programsbusiness development loans and guarantees and lease guarantees to redevelopment areas that previously were eligible only for public works grants. This is an important section of the bill which we believe should be implemented as soon as possible. The report of the Committee on Public Works states that: The guarantee of rental payments of leases is designed to increase business development opportunities in distressed areas of our large cities. particularly in special impact areas where vacant buildings are available for the occupancy of new business ventures. It is our intention. however. that these lease guarantees. while concentrated for the most part in urban areas. will not be limited to such areas. Additionally. I believe it Is important that we not limit the Secretary to aiding new ventures but permit him to guarantee leases of existing enterprises where it is deemed necessary. We should also point out that the committee Intends that the Secretary will engage in risk analysis of both the prospective tenant and landlord. that he will be able to take steps to minimize the risk of default. and that he will be able to compel the landlord to comply with his covenants and responsibilities. Lastly. I assume that the Secretary is authorized only to guarantee the payment of rent. and no other covenants of the lessee. The Senate has also amended one of the key features of the Housepassed billthe section 302 planning assistance program. The bill would authorize the Secretary to make grants for economic development planning. These grants can be made to any State. city. or other political subdivision of a State or substate planning and development organizations including economic development districts. This new authority is intended to increase overall State. substate and local government capability for economic development and adjustment planning and to enable changing employment and economic growth patterns to be better reflected in public works investment planning and other governmental decisionmaking. The House action made it clear that we intend that overall State economic development plans shall be prepared cooperatively by the State. its political subdivisions. and any economic development districts located in whole or in part within the State. The Senate rewrote the section to emphasize that the economic development planning authorized by this section should be an important element in a continuing. comprehensive planning process. To resolve any potential conflicts. the House proposed that the Senate bill be amended to make it clear any State economic development planning should incorporate the goals and objectives of local and economic district planning and be a part of a comprehensive planning process. A great deal of concern has been expressed that it might be possible that a disproportionate share of planning funds would be allocated to one class of eligible recipients. for example to States. to the detriment of other eligible applicants for planning funds. Even though both the House and Senate have made clear that this is not what is Intended by this legislation. this might be the result of Inadequate funding and possible misinterpretation of the legislation. The Housepassed bill provided that 60 percent of the funds expended each year for title I would be expended each year for technical assistance under section 301. The Housepassed bill further provided that not more than 20 percent of the remaining 40 percent of funds for planning made available for section 302 each year shall be expended for assistance to States. The Senate bill specifically authorized $15 million annually in grants for State planning. In a colloquy on the floor during the debate. It was stated that it was the Senate committees intention that a proportionate share of the total funds appropriated annually for the title would go to States. To clarify the intent of the committee. we believe that the additional $15 million authorization added by the Senate should be considered as the authorization for funding the State economic development planning program. The remaining $60 million authorizationwhich was the amount authorized in the House billshould be expended in accordance with the language of the Housepassed bill which stated that not less than 60 percent of the funds appropriated shall be expended to carry out section 301 of the title. This section authorizes the technical assistance program which has been particularly helpful to the larger cities and urban areas. The remainder of the authorization should be considered as the authorization for the support of economic development planning by cities. other political subdivisions of a State and substate planning and development organizations including redevelopment areas and economic development districts. If appropriations are less than the authorized amount. they should be allocated propor* tionately. In any case. we feel strongly that neither the technical assistance program or funds for economic development districts should be cut back to provide funds * for the new State economic development planning program. The obvious answer to this potentially damaging conflict is that sufficient funds be appropriated each year to adequately meet all the needs of States. economic development and other substate districts as well as cities and other local units of government. It should also be emphasized that this new economic development and adjustment planning program authorized in section 302 is intended to be a cooperative program and the bill should not be construed to give States a veto power over local or district goals and objectives. * One new section added by the Senate Is section 304 which authorizes a new grant program to States for supplementing or providing firstdollar grants authorized by titles I. II. and IV of the act. These grants can only be applied to projects undertaken in redevelopment areas or districts for projects initiated by local development agencies. This section is intended to allow States to help provide *assistnace to areas unable to meet the local matching requirements on federally assisted EDA projects. The firstdollar provision in section 304 is intended to be used only where locally generated projects are not able to be funded because of Federal budget constraints. In conclusion. Mr. Speaker. we again urge the adoption of the House amendments so that the bill can be returned as quickly as possible to the other body for final action. I include the following:"},{"1":"1973","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. the establishment of a system of national health insurance for all Americans must remain a priority matter on the legislative agenda of Congress. Many of us have differing opinions as to the national resources we should allocate to such a system. how it should operate. and to what extent our present pluralistic method of health service delivery should be expanded. modified. or even changed. We have many pressing questions to be answered before we reach consensus about what would be a reasonable approach to dealing with what is now commonly accepted as an important national need. It will take much concerted time. study and energy before an adequate national health insurance system Is developed. First. we must thoroughly examine all the issues so as to ensure that the final product is an improvementnot a retrogression in the quality and quantityof the services now available. All Americans have the right to quality health care. It is essential that there be no discrimination in the delivery of that care. Equally important is the need to make sure that those who suffer from a particular form of Illness have the same right to treatment as those who suffer from any other type of illness. From a humanitarian standpoint. it would be inequitable to treat those we believe most amenable to effective treatment and exclude those we believe more difficult or more expensive to treat. I specifically refer to mental illness. the Nations No. 1 health problem. Twenty million Americans suffer from some form of mental or emotional illness. Unfortunately. some people still labor under misapprehensions about this kind of illness. They still believe its treatment is so expensive that adequate coverage cannot be included in national health insurance or that effective treatment cannot be rendered. They believe it might be wise from a fiscal standpoint to either exclude the mentally ill from national health insurance altogether or provide only a very limited benefit. This would not realistically deal with this vast national problem. As a consequence of this kind of thinking. some plans for national health insurance introduced in the Congress of the United States provide little or no coverage for mental and emotional illness. The American Psychiatric Association. which represents 21.000 of the 25.000 psychiatrists in the United States. has published a study. entitled Health Insurance and Psychiatric Care: Utilization and Cost. and based upon a variety of health insurance approaches. This study was directed by Louis S. Reed. Ph. D.. a prominent health economist. and coauthored by Mrs. Evelyn S. Myers and Mrs. Patricia L. Scheidemandel. of the staff of the association. The project was advised by a committee of consultants of Blue Cross. Blue Shield. the commercial insurance industry. group and individual prepaid group practice plans. labor organizations. and eminent psychiatrists. The results of this study. the most extensive ever conducted in this field. demonstrate that the cost of providing insurance coverage of mental conditions both in and out of the hospital is relatively lowa few dollars per covered person a year and a relatively small proportion of the cost of coverage for all conditions. The study also noted that health insurance coverage of mental illness. even though it is hemmed in with special restrictions and limitations. is widespread. At the end of 1970. 63 percent of the civilian population80 percent of the total with hospital coverage of general illnesshad some coverage of hospital care for mental illness. and 37 percent of the total population had some coverage of outpatient psychiatric care. this latter represents 85 percent of all those with such coverage for general illness. Not to dwell on statistics. I would like to illustrate the feasibility of covering mental illness by noting that under the largest and probably the most comprehensive plan studied. the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan covering Federal employees. total charges for hospital care of mental conditions in 1969 amounted to approximately $4.13 per person covered per year. equal to 6.3 percent of total charges for all conditions. Inhospital physicians visits averaged 66 cents per person covered. In regard to outpatient care. there were 13 claims per 1.000 population in 1969 for reimbursement of physician charges for mental conditions. Eligible charges amounted to $2.99 per covered person. benefit payments were equal to approximately $2.16 per covered person. Thus. the total benefit payments in this comprehensive plan. which treats mental illness the same as other illness. were less than $7 per covered person. Canada has FederalProvincial programs of hospital and medical insurance covering virtually the entire population. Hospitalization in general hospitals is provided for mental illness on the same basis as for other conditions. and physicians services for mental conditions in and out of hospital are also covered on the same basis as such services for all other conditions. In 1967 hospital discharges and days of care were equal to 3.1 and 4.6 percent. respectively. of the rates for all conditions. Benefit payments for physicians services in and out of the hospitals in 1970 ranged from 43 cents to $2.37 cents per covered person. representing 2 to 4 percent of benefit payments for all conditions. The advances in the treatment of mental illness have made great strides in recent years. The efficacy of the psychoactive drugs. along with the development of community mental health centers and other treatmert resources. has brought about a decline in the resi.dent population of State mental hospital. from 559.000 in 1959 to approximately 275.000 today. But there is no evidence that the incidence of mental illness is declining. there are. in fact. more admissions to State mental hospitals than ever before. The difference is that mental patients in general are being treated more effectively. and the length of stay in psychiatric facilities has been dramatically curtailed. Many former mental patients can resume active roles in the community within a very short period of time. Custodialism for the mental patient and confinement in the wards of State mental hospitals is far less common than formerly. Dr. Alfred Freedman. president of the American Psychiatric Association. pointed out in recent testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor and HEW that in the postWorld War II period. we have witnessed enormous gains in our ability to treat serious mental illness. He referred particularly to the treatment of depressions and schizophrenia. He cited as an example one form of depression from which only 40 percent of individuals formerly improved after 3 years of treatment. Today about 80 percent improve within a very short period of time. And yet many special groups of the mentally ill are receiving little or no care. The first in a recent series of articles by Wayne King on child mental health. in the Washington StarNews. July 30. 1973. stated that 10 percent of all children have sufficient emotional problems to warrant professional attention.. but only a miniscule number are getting. help. Besides the problems of children and adolescents. our society is beset with other serious problems with a psychiatric component: Alcohol and drug abuse and addiction. psychiatric disturbances relating to aging. and to crime and delinquency. and the adjustment problems of the Vietnam veterans. Yet. it is estimated i hat only approximately 3.6 million persons in our country receive any kind of specialized psychiatric treatment annually. Worse yet. it is a fact that mental health services remain least available to those in greatest needthe poor and minority groups. As the American Psychiatric Association has stated in its position statement on national health insurance. which advocates equal coverage for mental illness. health insurance plans that ignore or discriminate against the mental disorders are not only grossly unjust and inadequate. but also anachronistic. in view of the state of the art and the needs that currently exist. Also. they fail to take into account that there is a strong likelihood that covering mental illness will cut down on the utilization of other health services. It is commonly acknowledged that more than 50 percent of patients presenting themzelves to physicians with physical complaints suffer from a mental illness component. The recognition and proper treatment of this illness will often avoid prolonged and expensive laboratory testing in diagnosing the disease and in many cases will cut down on the need for other medical treatment. I heartily endorse the principle advocated by the American Psychiatric Association that national health insurance cover treatment of mental illness in the same way as other illness. This treatment should be allowed to take place in all professionally approved facilities. public or private. that furnish. active treatment for the mentally illall accredited hospitals. community mental health centers. outpatient or ambulatory care facilities. and intermediate care and nursing home facilities. Treatment by private physicians should also be covered to the same extent as for other illnesses. The elaborate system of peer review being developed by the psychiatric profession will insure that the patient receives the most effective available treatment and for no longer than the time needed to reach the therapeutic goal. I urge that all Members of Congress follow this just and rational approach toward the mentally Ill."},{"1":"1972","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman. it is quite evident from the earlier vote what the destiny of this legislation is going to be. but I doubt that very many Members have fully understood or have had explained to them the chronology of events. I would like to talk to the Members a moment about the genesis of this strike. The longshoremens union has been working under two 5year contracts with the Pacific Maritime Association. The second 5year contract. during which there could be no negotiation for additional wages and during which time there was dramatic improvement in the shipping industrys economics. expired on July 1. 1971. There having been no agreement. they went on strike until. on October 6. the provisions of the TaftHartley Act bringing about an 80day coolingoff period were invoked by the President. Many. many weeks before those 100 days expired. a number of Members of this House. deeply concerned. wrote to the President and asked him to immediately invoke the 80day coolingoff period. On December 25. the coolingoff period expired. On January 17. the strike resumed. On January 21. we had a message from the President relating to this matter. I might say parenthetically to my very good friend. the gentleman from Iowa that had the Presidents then pending emergency strike legislation been passed. it would not have applied in this case because there is a third party. the Teamsters. The ad hoc solution. which is proposed by each of these three resolutions before us today. will not have the slightest effect if the east and gulf port workers go down. On January 21. Senators PACKwOOD and JAVITS introduced in the Senate a bill substantially the same as that introduced in the House on January 25. House Joint Resolution 1025. by my friend and colleague. the gentleman from Oregon . On January 27. the Committee on Education and Labor had the matter referred to it. and it was referred to my subcommittee. Before the matter was actually in my hands from my distinguished chairman. the gentleman from Kentucky"},{"1":"1971","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I support the amendment offered by Mr. BOLAND of Massachusetts and long supported by my colleague from Texas . the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs. A time when more and more servicemen are being discharged and therefore becoming eligible for veterans benefits is no time to cut back on the services provided in administering veterans programs. The caseload of all VA offices will undoubtedly increase substantially in the coming months as thousands of veterans readjust to civilian life. They will be seeking Jobs. education. housing and medical care. A lengthy delay in processing the paperwork could severely compromise the value of the programs we in the Congress have created for their benefit. In my own area. in southwest Texas. the VA office in Houston already requires five employees to be assigned fulltime to answering telephone inquiries. the director of that office is seriously concerned with the mounting backlogs and delays in handling veterans problems. The VA Hospital in Houston has done a tremendous Job of caring for veterans in that area. but is always crowded and the staff overworked. I dont think reducing administrative funds is going to help the situation. Adoption of this amendment to restore $7 million of the reduction will enable the VA to carry out its program functions with more expedience and more effectively."},{"1":"1970","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"And that figure is now 11.000 in South Carolina. Georgia was 9.000 in October. But what do we do? We find this national corporate group. ECATEmergency Committee on American Trade. Do you know who the head of that is? President Nixons client. Donald Kendall. of PepsiCola. He heads up the whole shebang. Is anyone interested in importing water. all around the world? There is no problem involved in importing water. I say to the Senator from Louisiana. All they are interested in is expanded markets. and pleasing the particular governments and people where they sell their products. That is good business. I do not fault them for that. But we at least ought to have commonsense enough. in these United States of America. to recognize it. and understand. when they are buying these ads In the New York Times. the Wall Street Journal. and the Washington Post. who is paying for them. and where the pressure is in this U.S. Senate. and the constant caterwauling and cartooning of protectionism. I wish those Senators who really stand for labor would get with labor on this scorewould really get with labor. and I mean the workingman. because he needs a fair chance to compete. When we first started 10 years ago. they said we were noncompetitive. We have the money in research and we have equaled them on design and everything else. But how in heavens name -are you going to compete. not just at the salaried level. when they take their finance and loans through the government wher they manufacture under conditions tha6 would be criminal. on safety measures and on health measures in the United States. when they do not have provision for social security and pensions. unemployment compensation. wages and hours. They do have it to a degree. but not nearly what we have in the United States. which we put into the workingmans pay envelope. How can we compete with it? We do not want to compete with that. and when we say that. they say we are protectionists. I would be glad for my distinguished friend. the Senator from Georgia. to continue. I did not wish to interrupt the seriatum of what he was presenting. We can get into consumers again. and the actual price of cotton textiles. But is it not significant that the very thing. they said. would be so terrible is what 32 countries have already agreed to on the matter of cotton. a longterm arrangement? This is the thing. they say. that is going to start a trade war. This is the thing. they say. that will ruin the country. But this is the thing that President Kennedy called for. in behalf of the United States."},{"1":"1969","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I have recently introduced legislation. H.R. 10841. to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to increase the personal exemption for the taxpayer. his spouse. and dependents from $600 to $1.200. I introduced similar legislation in the last Congress. but. unfortunately. it was not acted upon. The urgency of this legislation increases daily. The evidence is unmistakable. All agree that when the Federal income tax was originally enacted in 1913. Congress sought to leave free and untouched enough income to permit support of a family according to a proper standard of living. The exemptions at that time were set at $3.000 for a single individual and $4.000 for married couples. Since that time. of course. we have had an unhappy combination of two world wars. the cold war. the Korean war. the Vietnam conflict and inflation which has resulted in the personal exemption being reduced to the point that it no longer even remotely relates to the intent of the original income tax law. The present $600 exemption was provided by the Revenue Act of 1948. In the 20 years that have passed since its adoption the cost of living has increased 44.6 percent. The vast majority of the States which have an income tax. and the District of Columbia. allow a personal exemption in excess of the present $600 Federal exemption. At least 10 of the States have personal exemptions equal to $1.200 or above. My own State. Iowa. has a tax credit of $15 per person. which is roughly equal to a $2.300 exemption. It is time for the Federal Government to act. Congress cannot raise its own salaries and be blind to the needs of the rest of the population. The often heard claim that we are presently in the longest period of uninterrupted prosperity the United States has ever known has a hollow ring to those who are barely making ends meet because of the high cost of living. I know the hea:y inroads that have been made in the real purchasing power of the middleand lowerincome taxpayer. State and local taxes have been increasing at a rapid rate. the Federal tax surcharge was made effective April 1. 1968. and social security taxes just went up this January. Inflation. which has been creeping for many years. increased its tempo in 1968 when the cost of living rose 4.2 percent. the largest annual rise in 17 years. The brutal truth is that living costs for millions of our citizens are rising faster than paychecks. The real wages of those in the manufacturing industries. for example. have virtually stood still since 1965 while the cost of living increased 10.3 percent. Prices on everything we buy from automobiles to groceries continue to spiral upward. Bad as these are. they are paled by the relentless increase in the cost of services. Medical costs continue to skyrocket. Auto and appliance repairs. mortgages and services in general are all costing more. For parents of college students the present $600 exemption is even more unrealistic than it is for those with children living at home. The U.S. Office of Education estimates that the average charges for tuition. fees. and room and board for a fulltime resident. undergraduate student in a public 4year institution for the 196869 school year will total $1.114. In a private 4year institution the cost for the year Is estimated to be $2.297. And who today. will argue that a college education is a luxury? Immediate relief is needed. It is my firm conviction that an increase In the personal exemption is the best method to achieve this objective. Those who argue most strongly against an increase in the personal exemption do so in terms of the revenue that will be lost to the Government. They should reassess their thinking to Include considerations of equity. primarily and secondarily. the fact that additional revenue will be generated by the additional funds in the economy generated by the higher personal exemptions. To reduce the impact of the initial revenue loss and also to restrict the benefit of the increased personal exemption to those who need it the most. this legislation provides that the increase in the exemption is to be limited. The increase in the exemption is to decline with the increasing income and eventually disappear at high income levels. Under my bill the increase in personal exemption for the individual will decrease $1 for every $10 his adjusted gross income exceeds $20.000. For a married couple the increase in the personal exemption will begin to diminish at the same rate when their adjusted gross joint income exceeds $40.000. The higher figure for a married couple is not a substantively higher amount but is technically necessary because of the split income provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The Federal income tax system has succeeded because it has generally been based on the abilitytopay principle and is considered to be progressive. However. we have the right to question the fairness of our tax system when it enables special interest groups to pay relatively low taxes or to avoid the payment of taxes altogether. and the bulk of the people are having difficulty making ends meet after paying taxes. If we must have inequity in our tax system. and perfection is impossible to achieve. of course such inequity should be in favor of the average worker and the family which are the backbone of our society. It is my belief that there is no single tax reform more urgent than this proposal. Reform is. of course. needed throughbu? the entire Federal tax structure to remove serious inequities and abuses. I am pleased that the House Ways and Means Committee in recognition of the urgent need for reform has conducted extensive hearings which began on February 18. Overall tax reform is such a tremendous undertaking that enactment of all necessary legislation may well encompass both sessions of the 91st Congress. It is my sincere hope that an increase in the personal exemption will be given the highest priority so that its early passage will be assured."},{"1":"1968","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I applaud the senior Senator from West Virginia--Mr. BYRD of West Virginia reminds me that he is the junior Senator from West Virginia. and I want to correct the RECORD. I admire both Senators from West Virginia very highly. May I say that in recent months my admiration for the junior Senator from West Virginia has steadily increased because of his statesmanship and political courage. The junior Senator from Louisiana can recall those days when not a single member of the West Virginia delegation would dare say anything or vote in any respect that might be misunderstood or misconstrued by some minority elements that might not understand his worthy purposes. The junior Senator from West Virginia has made it clear time and again that. much as his sympathy and heart go out to the less privileged. as one who would stand up and vote for themand may I say that I have never seen a time when the junior Senator from West Virginia failed to vote for money to provide for the underprivileged and needyyet when it comes to the robber or burglar or looter or any criminal element who would undermine this country. he would enforce the Constitution the way it was construed by the Founding Pathersnot in the way it has been decided by those whom we used to call Justices of the United States. but the way the Founding Fathers intended it and the way it was construed for the first 150 years of this great Republic. Mr. President. I have made reference to the fact that a highranking member of the NAACP condemned the junior Senator from Louisiana for saying law violators ought to be shot before they are permitted to escape. I am not talking about a trivial violation. I am talking about a felony. If I had made that statement about some member of the Ku Klux Klan who threw a fire bomb into a Negro church to burn it down. that same member of the NAACP would have applauded me and said the junior Senator from Louisiana was showing great statesmanship. This Senator knows what it is to take a stand and then have every member of white citizens groups and the Ku Klux Klan pass resolutions asking that he be removed from the Senate. He knows what it is to have those who bear prejudice on the other side react against him. But the only way we can ever have law and order. the only way any citizen. be he black or white. or some color in between. or be a member of some other race such as the Oriental race. and the only way we can have peace and prosperity and progress in this country is to see to it that everyone obeys the law. As the senior Senator from North Carolina has been heard to say so ably on the floor on occasion. when we say in this country that a citizen may decide for himself what laws he is going to obey and may decide for himself what laws he is not going to obey. that is the time of anarchy. that is the end of government as we have known it. Mr. President. real freedom cannot exist without government. There are too many people on this planet. and certainly too many in this country. for us to roam around like animals in the jungle. The time has come when we must insist that every citizen obey the law. That applies to Reverend Abernathy. as indeed it applies to every other citizen in this country. It applies to Stokely Carmichael. as indeed it must apply to every citizen of our country. People have asked this Senator how he can get away with what he is doinggoing around the world. appearing on radio and television programs. describing this country as a bunch of assassins and murderers and criminals. including the leaders of our Government. and indeed the country itself. putting our courageous fighting men. by his words. in a position of being pictured as murderers and assassins. How can he get away with it? It is difficult for this Senator to explain how he gets away with it. I know this: He would not be getting away with it in Louisiana. We would find a way to handle him in Louisiana. Rap Brown was born and reared in Baton Rouge. He was removed from that community. taken from one jail and put in another jail. where he can be tried for crime. If Rap Brown wants to try the kind of conduct in Baton Rouge that he tried in Cambridge. Md.. I suggest that he go back to his old hometown and try it. He will be shot. I do not mean he will just be shothe will be shot to death. and that will be the end of his mischiefnot that we want to do it. but our people have made it clear that they believe in oldfashioned law enforcement. That is why we have not had trouble with Rap Brown. So he is directing his activities elsewhere. Mr. President. I hope we are willing to do everything that can be justified to help the less privileged. But the best thing we can do for any of them is to help them to help themselveshelp them to learn a skill. help them to learn to work. help them to qualify for jobs and to earn good pay. That is the oldfashioned kind of welfare that the junior Senator from Louisiana learned about a long time ago. It is the kind of welfare he was taught by his father and his grandfatherthat you should always help someone in need. if you have to give him the shirt off your own back. The kind of welfare this Senator learned about preceded the day when the Federal Government got into the business. It goes back to the days when. in my home. no one ever went away hungry. no matter who he was. no matter what race. If he came and rapped on that door. and said. I am hungry. my mother. my father. my grandfather. or someone would feed him. As a matter of fact. it got to be a kind of standing joke. when my father was a struggling young lawyer. with a flair for politics. Most of the hoboes around town figured he ought to be a soft touch. and they would catch him when he came out of his office building. and say. Can you spare a quarter for a hungry man? So. in selfdefense. he made a deal with a fellow who had a little restaurant. and he would say. when accosted. Go over there and get you some turnip greens and cornbread and some fatback. and any time someone would come around and ask Huey Long for a handout. he would send him over there to be fed. And. may I say. that arrangement just about saved the Long family from bankruptcy. but any time anyone came around and wanted some help. he would be fed and cared for. We were always taught to do what we could to help those who were less privileged. even if it meant considerable sacrifice to oneself. And when it came to asking the Government to do something about it. asking the Government to appropriate money was a very meaningful thought. as far as the junior Senator from Louisiana was concerned. I have fought to amend the social security bill. not just to increase benefits and provide more money. but to say that. with regard to any of the people on welfare. if they want to go to work. they can continue to draw that welfare check and keep every nickel that they make. up to a certain amount. I have offered. supported. and fought for that kind of amendment down through the years. feeling that the highest form of charity is not a mere handout to a hobo. but to help a hobo to be a worthwhile personnot a mere giveaway to someone who is earning no money. but to help that person to be a useful member of society. to be one who carries his own burdens and does his part to help others."},{"1":"1967","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I rise in support of S. 1320. which would provide career status for certain temporary Government employees. The measure has come to the floor with an amendment consisting of substitute text by our Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. As thus amended. the legislation would serve two principal purposes. First. it would enable certain Federal employees who are serving in positions in the competitive service under indefinite or temporary appointments. and who complete at least 3 years of service in such positions without a break in service of more than 30 days. to acquire competitive status and to have their appointments converted to career appointments. Second. It would remove the permanent statutory ceiling on the number of permanent Federal employees. The legislation is clearly designed to correct an inequitable situation. and it has ample precedent in action taken in the past by both Congress and the President. Our committee reports that over twofifths of the 19.140 Federal personnel who in late 1966 were found working in permanent positions without career status. had been working in the same jobs for 3 years or longer. When we consider the multitude of employee benefits of which these temporary employees were deprived because of their lack of career status. the urgency of this legislation becomes at once apparent. I am impressed by the committee statement that this legislation would not be a means of evading the competitive processes of the civil service system. It would only provide what the Chairman of the U.S. Civil Service Commission reportedly has called another onetime cleanup. Similar relief provided in the past would tend to substantiate this view. Mr. Speaker. this legislation deserves our support. and I urge a favorable vote for S. 1320."},{"1":"1966","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. on June 15. 1965. less than 9 months ago. the Senate approved the bill H.R. 8371. the Excise Tax Reduction Act of 1965. The Senate report on this bill set out the various reasons for the measure. The report emphasized that our excise taxes. for the most part. were initially levied as emergency revenueraising measures at the time of the Korean war. World War II. or the depression of the 1930s. As a result. they were not developed on any systematic basis and are often discriminatory in their application to the taxed industries or to the purchasers of the taxed products. The report went on to state: Many of these excises are objectionable in that they are regressive in their impact. absorbing a larger share of the income of lowincome persons than of those with higher incomes. This stems from the fact that lowincome families find it necessary to spend a higher proportion of their incomes for consumption than those with larger incomes. For these and other reasons. I strongly supported the excise tax reduction bill last year. I wanted. and still want. to get rid of these burdensome. regressive. and unfair taxes. CXII326--Part 4 With the enactment of the excise tax bill last year. the Congress set a policy to eliminate insofar as practicable most excise taxes. and to do so -in an orderly and scheduled manner. The enactment of the excise tax provisions of the bill now before us. it seems to me. would constitute a reversal of that policy. I am opposed to this reversal of policy. which we set just last year. with respect to excise taxes. But I recognize. Mr. President. that we must have more revenue to meet the increasing cost of operating various Government programs. including the operations in Vietnam. during the next 2 years. I would not. therefore. wish to move to strike from this bill the provisions to increase excise taxes without offering some substitute provision which would raise at least as much revenue. If it is impossible to substitute a revenueraising provision for the excise tax provisions in the bill. then of course. elimination of the excise tax provision alone will be a subject for consideration. As a matter of fact. we will likely need more revenue than this bill provides for the next few years in order to decrease or eliminate budget deficits. It is surely unwise in times of prosperity to continue to run large budget deficitsor to attempt to hold down bookkeeping deficits by a wild scramble to unload Government assets. or to undertake other feats of sharp pencil legerdemain. We cannot afford to run the risk. under current conditions. of monetizing more of the national debt. In addition. there are sufficient signs that we face a nascent inflation to warrant soaking up funds otherwise available for expenditure in certain areas of the private sector of the economy. It seems to me that the Congress should already be giving serious thought to the best way of using tax policy to dampen down a threatened inflation. I have never been one who believes that the budget should be balanced at all times. In a period of deflation. in a period of economic recession. fiscal policies and budgetary policies can be and should be wisely used to stimulate the economy so as to accomplish worthy social and economic objectives. The investment credit was advocated and adopted by Congress for the purpose of stimulating the economy. It seems to me that an artificial stimulant of the economy is about the last thing we now need. Not only is additional revenue needed to prosecute an expensive and perhaps long conflict in Vietnam. but unless Great Society programs are to be seriously curtailed. as has already been suggested in the budget. additional revenue for those purposes is needed. The amendment I am offering now would move tentatively in this direction. It would raise slightly more revenue than the bill in its present form would provide. and it would apply the restraining hand of fiscal policy selectivity to one relatively small but significant part of the economy. I do not suggest that the amendment I offer will solve our fiscal problem. I do not suggest that the revenue which it would raise over and beyond that promised by the excise tax provisions of the pending bill. for which I have offered my amendment as a substitute. would be significant. But so far as there is a difference. all responsible estimates that I have been able to get from the staff of the Committee on Finance. the Joint Committee on Internal Revenue Taxation. or the Treasury indicate that the amendment I propose would produce more revenue than the provisions in the bill for which I offer my amendment as a substitute. Specifically. my amendment would suspend for 2 years from March 1. 1966. the operation of the investment credit. instead of raising excise tax rates as the bill now provides. Certain adjustments would also be made in the use of carryovers during this 2year period. Suspension of the investment credit. together with a modification of the use of existing carryovers. will produce more revenue than would the reimposition of the excise taxes on automobiles and on telephone service. Suspension of the credit would add $80 million to revenues in the current fiscal. year. while raising excises to their preJanuary level would. as approved by the Finance Committee. produce only an additional $35 million. In fiscal 1967. it is estimated that $1.2 billion would be raised by either procedure. while in fiscal 1968 the investment credit. suspension would add $1.9 billion and the excises only $1.5 billion. So it will be seen that. so far as there is a difference. the revenue would be greater by the amendment I propose than would be the case under the excise tax provisions of the pending bill. In addition to greater revenues. my amendment is clearly preferable from the standpoint of the overall economic effects. as well as on equity considerations. The present outlook for expenditures on fixed investment clearly ralses the threat of inflationary pressures in that sector of the economy. Fixed investment in 1965 was 10.3 percent of gross national product. about the same as it was during the investment boom of 1956 and 1957. The rate of investment at that time could not be sustained. and neither. in my opinion. can the current rate. In 1965. investment in plant and equipment increased 15.4 percent over 1964. Recent surveys show an expected increase in 1966 of 15 percent or more over 1965. and surveys taken at this time of year generally underestimate final expenditures. Extending these projections into 1966. we will have by the end of this calendar year a fixed investment expenditure amounting to some 11 percent of gross national product. This is well above the noninflationary level of 10 percent for a full employment economy. Obviously. in the interest of orderly growth. and to avoid inflationary pressures in an important sector of the economy. expenditures for fixed investment should be slowed. At least. they should not be artificially stimulated. Expenditures should not be halted. but marginal projects should be postponed. Suspension of the credit will not halt projects. such as those associated with defense orders. clearly warranted by demand. . The Finance Committee report on the 1962 Revenue Act. when the investment credit was instituted. gave three specific reasons for the credit: 1. The investment credit would stimulate investment * * * by reducing the net cost of acquiring depreciable assets. which in turn increases the rate of return after taxes arising from their acquisition. 2. The investment credit. by increasing the flow of cash available for Investment. will stimulate investment. 3. The investment credit can be expected to stimulate investments through a reduction in the payoff period for investment in a particular asset. Mr. President. contemplate these reasons upon which. and because of which. Congress enacted the investment credit. Contemplate them in the circumstances in which we found ourselves at that time. Then. study the same reasons in the light of the circumstances now facing the United States and its national economy. The same arguments. I submit. can now be used in reverse to justify suspending the investment credit. We do not need artificial stimulation of the economy now. The inflationary pressures raise too many danger signals for that. Congress should be moving here. not in the timid way which I suggest. but in a far more aggressive and meaningful way. However. this step which I suggest is a meaningful first step toward the use of fiscal and revenue policy to eliminate the artificial stimulus from our economy. Given current conditions. the artificial stimulationto expenditures for fixed investment should be eliminated or. at least. suspended. And it is suspension that I propose. The investment credit should be suspended until such time as conditions warrant a return to stimulation. Another fact which is particularly pertinent today is that production of equipment for fixed investment competes with production of hard goods for defense purposes. Continuation of the investment credit will hamper defense production and increase the cost of defense contracts. It will increase the cost of the war and. if continued. will further increase the cost of living because of the inflationary pressures which artificial stimulation generates. This is particularly true with respect to highly skilled manpower. in which there is already a shortage. Continued artificial stimulation of plant and equipment expenditures can only result in bidding up the price of scarce materials. facilities. and manpower needed for defense production. thus setting off a ripple of inflation which might well become a powerful wave carrying our economy and the cost of living before it. Looking at restraints already at work through Government action. one is struck by the tightmoney policy enforced by the Federal Reserve Board. However one may view this monetary policy. fiscal policy must work with and not against monetary policy if we are to have an effective economic policy. In this instance. the suspension of the investment credit will reinforce the tight money policy of the Federal Reserve Board. On the other hand. a tax policy which works counter to it will but give an excuse to the money managers to tighten the screws even harder. thus giving rise to further undesirable distortions which we have witnessed in the past when monetary policy was misguided. Little more need be said here to support the substitution of this credit suspension for the increase in excises on automobiles and telephone service from the standpoint of equity. The excises bear directly on the consumer and are recognized as regressive taxes. Furthermore. the excise tax increases in this bill affect only one commodity and one servicethe automobile and the telephone. It is difficult to justify singling them out. particularly when they are virtual necessities. Suspension of the investment credit will work no hardship on any particular group. and its effects will be spread broadly. particularly across the corporate sector. Responsible economists are now expressing concern about the possibility of inflation. It is felt by many that substantial tax increases are needed. and now. In the absence of a general tax increase now. selective tax changes in areas where both economic and equity objectives can be furthered would certainly be in order. Suspension of the investment credit Is surely one of the most obvious places to begin. Mr. President. a great many thoughtful citizens and economists have suggested a suspension of investment credit. It is not strange that this is true. because its suspension is so clearly in order. I read from an article in the Wall Street Journal of February 24. 1966. datelined from Washington: Walter Heller. former top economic aid to the administration. suggested temporary suspension of the 7percent investment credit to dampen the capitalspending boom. Mr. Heller. currently a University of Minnesota economist. said the credit might be temporarily limited to increase in investment rather than to investment totals. Treasury Secretary Fowler has strongly opposed tinkering with the tax credit. which lets companies subtract from their tax bills up to 7 percent of the amount they spend on equipment. Mr. Heller was one of a parade of ranking economists who cautioned yesterday that the Government may have to move speedily to fight inflation. although they differed in their choice of weapons. The occasion was a symposium by the HouseSenate Joint Economic Committee on the 20th anniversary of the Employment Act of 1946. which created both the committee and the Presidents Council of Economic Advisers and committed the Government to fostering growth. I digress from the reading of the article. Mr. President. to suggest that I have been informed by a member of the Joint Economic Committee that the committee itself has now concluded to recommend a suspension of the investment credit. I am not prepared officially to make that announcement. but I put it only as I have said. that this report has been given to me since coming to the floor of the Senate today. I hope that the committee has reached such a conclusion. I do not see how it could quite reach any other conclusion. Much more than this needs to be done. as I have said. but surely this is the place to start. Because here is a measure enacted for the avowed purpose of stimulating the economy. At a time when we seek to apply restraints. surely the place to begin is the elimination of artificial stimulation. Where is there a need for artificial stimulation in our economy now? It is about to burst at the seams. and the Nations most thoughtful economists suggest that Congress and the administration should be giving careful thought to a move to counter the inflationary pressures existent in the present wartime economy. I continue to read from the article: Acknowledgement of the possible perils of inflation came from the administration as well as from academic analysts. In a message read at the dinner by Mr. Fowler. President Johnson said. The rapid growth of output which has enabled us to reduce unemployment has placed special and temporary strains on some of our raw material resources. The problems of matching men and jobs during the transition to high employment are more difficult now than they will be after more experience with it. the President said. We will need to watch unfolding events closely. and to remain flexible in our tax and other policies so that we can change quickly if the need should arise. he said. adding that the transition will test our energy and ingenuity and require seeking new ways In which business. labor and Government can cooperate to avoid inflationary wage and price movements. Gardner Ackley. chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. asserted that todays problems for economic policy are more difficult that any we have faced in recent years. because solutions to unemployment and slack are more obvious than answers to problems of sustaining highlevel prosperity."},{"1":"1965","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"During hearings on the bill many outstanding Americans appeared before the committee. One of them who impressed me most was a distinguished and eloquent attorney of Wilmington. Del.. Joseph A. L. Errigo. Mr. Errigo is the national chairman of the Sons of Italy. Mr. Errigo disagreed with me in respect to retaining the National Origins Quota System of the McCarranWalter Act. After my amendment. limiting immigration from the Western Hemisphere.. had been adopted by the subcommittee and approved by the full committee. I received from Mr. Errigo a fine letter endorsing the proposal. With his consent. I quote the following words from the letter: I am writing to congratulate you and to thank you for the excellent position you have taken relative to the immigration bill. Since we have established a ceiling for the rest of the world. it is altogether fitting and proper that we should establish a ceiling for the Western Hemisphere as well. This is in accord with our philosophy of equal justice under law for all. Those of us on the Immigration Subcommittee know Mr. Errigo to be a persistent foe on all he considers to be unjust law. We know him also as a consistent champion of equal application of law. - Mr. Errigo knows we must eliminate the most apparent discrimination of allthat which gives preference to the people of Chile over the people of Italy. and the people of Cuba over the people of France. our historic ally since the time of our independence. Although equal application of the law to all nations was my principal reason for proposing the amendment. there is another reason. There is a growing demand for immigration from our hemispheric neighbors. Immigration from the Western Hemisphere increased by 50 percent in the past decade to our present average of almost 150.000 a year. As Senators know. our own population is also increasing alarmingly. yet 5 percent of the annual additions to our total population comes from Western immigrants. and the percentage is going up. Of all the countries in our hemisphere. demographers tell us that only Mexicos rate of immigrationwhich numbers from 30.000 and 50.000 to the United States each yearwill remain stable. The problem in Canada is so serious. that officials of its Government have considered establishing restrictions to prohibit the great migration to the United States. which like Mexicos has averaged 30.000 to 50.000 a year. Presently. for every professional person who migrates to Canada. two leave. the principal reason being the higher salaries paid in the United States. There is also increasing pressure from the labor force for immigrant passports. this being the product of Canadas greatest domestic problemunemployment. The unemployment rate in Canada has averaged 6 percent in recent years. If we accept the proposition that an increasing professional force generates employment in the labor force. then we must conversely also assume that Canadas problem will worsen and thatmigration to the United States will increase. As my friends who oppose the amendment point out. the majority of hemisphere immigrants come to us from Canada and Mexico. Although it is certainly true that the immigration from these two countries will not decrease. it is also clear that the time is fast approaching when we will receive even more from the other hemispheric countries. The bill should not offend Canada and Mexico. because of the distinction it makes between the Eastern Hemisphere and the Western Hemisphere. The bill provides that no country of the Eastern Hemisphere shall be allowed to send to this country in any one year more than 20.000 immigrants. outside of members of families. The bill places no such limitation upon the various nations of the Western Hemisphere. and for this reason Canada and Mexico can continue to send into this country their immigrants free from any limitation other than the overall hemispheric limitation of 120.000. I spoke a moment ago about the probabilityindeed. I say the certaintythat immigration from South America. Central America. and the Caribbean Islands will increase with the passage of years. Undoubtedly it will become unmanageable unless we place realistic limitations on immigration from the Western Hemisphere. Immigration from South America has increased by a fantastic 230 percent in the last 5 years. and by almost 400 percent in the last 10 years. It is approaching the point where it will double each year. The figures for Central America are almost as high. This is not just a trend. it is a threatened avalanche."},{"1":"1964","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. by way of explanation. I have revised my amendment slightly by excluding from its provisions parts B and C of title I. which relate to workstudy programs and worktraining programs. I explained my reasons for that earlier in the day. The amendment Is now confined to the community action programs and the migratory labor programs. The form in which the amendment is now offered would allow the Senator from Vermont . as I understand from the Parliamentarian. to offer a substitute. which it is his desire and. I believe. very much his right to do. so that it can be voted on first. That action will pose very clearly for the Senate the question whether the Senate wishes to have an absolute prohibition upon the operation of the program in any State unless that State consents and works out a State plan. which is the substitute of the Senator from Vermont . or whether it wishes to take the middle ground of my amendment. which would provide that in cases in which a State wishes to take over the program. is willing to take it over. and is able to take it over. the Administrator is obliged to turn It over to the State. But where the State is passive. the Administrator could move into that State and Inaugurate programs within the State. The provision of my amendment would not be as rigorous a requirement as would the amendment of the Senator from Vermont. yet it would go some of the distance. I believe that the Senate should have a clear choice. and that is the reason I sought to accommodate the substitute which is proposed by the Senator from Vermont. If agreeable to the Senator. I now ask unanimous consent. as was done before. that the Senator from Vermont may proceed to offer his substitute for my amendment without my losing the time which I have still remaining for the discussion of my amendment."},{"1":"1963","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Before the Senator came to the Chamber there was a discussion on this subject. It brought out fully what the Senator has said. I congratulate him on his eloquent and forceful statement. There is one further thing that the unions can do. They can work out some internal problems. For example. the two airline unions combined to settle a grave problem in the airlines industries. as we remember. It may be necessary for the locomotive engineers to combine with the firemen in order to form a practical base for what will happen when some kind of new work rules go into effect in the railroad industry. All of that is within the control of labor. I again congratulate the Senator on his wise words. His credentials as far as labor is concerned are unparalleled. I urge the unions and management to proceed as he has suggested. Management has made a pretty good record. one must say in all frankness. The unions must be careful not to be left behind in terms of public contemplation of them in what is happening now and what is bound to happen in the future. in which they all want to be given recognition by the American people."},{"1":"1962","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"That is different. The Government in that case is acting as a contractor and any businessman knows that protection of jobs and rights under the contract are matters which can. and are. covered by the contract. If a producer chooses to enter a contract. he accepts the risk of cancellation. The gentleman knows that when the Government enters the contract field it is not using sovereign power. It is subject to all of the rules of contract law and as such has all the rights of a contractor. When the Government enters the contract field it acts as does any other contractor and cancellation of contracts is a normal business hazard which exists in all contract fields. When the Government awards a contract to one plant and not to another. the Government has no obligation to the plant which did not get the award. By the same token. it has no obligation to the workers of this plant. Every contract award or cancellation brings with it joys on the one hand and disappointment on the other. Assistance in the case of removal of tariffs can be justified. because this condition arises through Government sovereign action. taken in the public interest. to lower tariffs and thereby take a job away from this man. The sovereign has seen fit to remove a tariff which it placed on an article to protect the job. In all equity and good conscience it must take steps to make the affected workers adjustment to the new competitive conditions created by its own acts as easy as possible under the circumstances. There is a difference. therefore. between the two cases you cite and I believe the approach in the bill is justified by the difference."},{"1":"1961","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"So it seems to me that the bill provides an extra step which must be taken. because if the Secretary then proposes to keep in the wilderness any lands he has now classified as primitive. he must submit that to Congress. and it must stay before Congress for a full sessionfrom the first day to the lastduring which time either House may by resolution overrule him. Therefore. we have taken away from the Secretary some of the power he now has over these areas. But at the same time we are giving him vast new powers. I think it is time that we looked at the whole problem and determined whether Congress should pass initially on these programs. rather than continue in the present situation. That is the position I take. I see no reason for Congress to continue to abdicate its powers even though the abdication may be slightly less than it was before. It is not clear to me what new powers the Secretary of Agriculture would be given. The Secretary of Agriculture presently has the power to classify parts of national forests in certain ways. Barring some action by Congress. that power goes on. How would we give him any more power under this bill?"},{"1":"1960","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Let us go a step further: Under the Senators definition. the prescribed wage is now applied to the employers entire business. not to a certain employee or employees. Under the Fair Labor Standards Act. as amended. the application was to only the particular employees who were found to be engaged in interstate commerce. Let us consider a warehouse business as an example: Let us say that only one man in the warehouse unloads the trucks and moves the merchandise into the bins. Under the old definition. he would be covered by the act. But under the new definition. because that man is engaged in interstate commerce and because there is no question about his being engaged in interstate commerce. the entire firm would be covered by the act. even though many of the employees of the firmsuch as typists and clerks and so forthwould never actually themselves be engaged in an act that could be interpreted as being in interstate commerce. Let us forget about a limitation of $1 or $1.25 or $1.50 or anything else. as regards coverage. Our concern is that under this very broad change from the original act and the act as amendedand I now refer to the definition of activity affecting commerce--it is almost impossible for me to think of a firm that would not be covered by this. outside of the exemptions in the act."},{"1":"1959","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. there have been times when I have criticized the press for what I thought was inaccurate or slanted reporting. Therefore it is with considerable pleasure that I call to the Members attention an Associated Press news item which appeared in the St. Louis PostDispatch on August 9. 1959. which I regard as fair. accurate. and informative reporting. This news item Is headlined in the St. Louis PostDispatch as follows: Lobbeen conducted over the breakfast and dinner tables. in the hallways of the Capitol. and the House Office Buildings. through the mails. and over radio and television networks. Lobbying means. in general. seeking to influence legislation. A constituent who urges his Congressman to vote for or against a bill is lobbying. It is a legal and timehonored practice. In a broad sense. the more prominent lobbyists in the labor battle have been President Eisenhower and George Meany. president of the AFLCIO. Both expressed their views last Thursday nightMr. Eisenhower on radiotelevision networks and Meany on radioon the controversy which the House will decide next week. The President said neither a bill passed by the Senate nor a measure backed by the House Labor Committee would really do the job of curbing labormanagement abuses. He said a good start toward a real labor reform law is to be found in another bill. sponsored by Representative PHIL M. LANDRUM. Democrat. of Georgia. and ROBERT P. GRIFFIN. Republican. of Michigan. Meany described the LandrumGriffin bill as a blunderbuss that would Inflict grievous harm on all unions. The AFICIO has indorsed a third bill. sponsored by Representative JOHN F. SHELLEY. Democrat. of California. an active member of the Teamsters Union and a former president of the California State Federation of Labor. Stanley C. Hope. president of the National Association of Manufacturers. commended Mr. Eisenhower for having fulfilled an obligation to speak out on the critical need for a real labor law reform measure. During House committee hearings on the various bills. representatives of unions. the National Association of Manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce flocked to Capitol Hill. The Teamsters Union. headed by James R. Hoffa. invited groups of Congressmen to a series of breakfasts. The Teamsters followed up with personal visits to congressional offices.

Today. I am pleased to address the Congress on this subject. I am most grateful to you for this opportunity to comment on and make suggestions for easing the economic burden of millions of unemployed Americans and their children during this. a most critical and uncertain. economic depression. I am grateful for this opportunity to review the devastating and disastrous results of this depression in my home State. the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. to comment and to offer a suggestion on the improvement. on an emergency plan basis. of the unemployment compensation title of the Federal Security Act. and to present a bill creating permanently a new title to the Social Security Act. to be known as the General Assistance Act of 1958. to amend the publicassistance provisions of the Social Security Act so as to enable States to establish more adequate general assistance programs. Both the Congress and the Chief Executive have given significant and public recognition to the seriousness of this depression. Both branches have emphasized the imperative necessity of prompt and courageous action to assist and to relieve the pressing economic burdens. even abject poverty and suffering. affecting millions of American families whose breadwinner has been unemployed for long months with the future job picture becoming more dismal and uncertain with each passing day. Another. and totally unanticipated. phenomenon further aggravates the plight of the unemployed workingman and his family. The continued and consistent monthly inflationary rise in the cost of basic necessities of life itselffood. clothing. shelter. fuel. public utilities. and medical servicesconfound. confuse. and create an atmosphere of despair for millions of deprived American families. This depression is national in scope. in intensity. and in responsibility. It has been caused mainly by a deliberated administration policy of fixing high interest rates. tight money. the coddling of bankers and big business by the special tax reduction of 1954. forgetting our average man. and the slashing of the budget and defense contracts by $5.600.000.000 in 1957. Individual States have accepted and discharge more than their maximum share of responsibility. Realestate taxes are approaching the confiscatory stage. and no new avenues of revenue for relief and assistance to the needy unemployed and their dependents are available. For over a decade since World War II the American people have accepted and discharged as a moral and charitable responsibility material assistance and relief of suffering and distress in countless countries all over the world. Can we neglect. or close our eyes. to similar or more acute suffering and distress among millions of our own free American families and their children. placed in such deprivation of basic necessities by forces and conditions they neither understand. nor control? I think not. Mr. Speaker. and my first recommendation is in regard to unemployment compensation. I recommend the extension of unemployment benefits inall States to a period of 39 weeks. the extended period to be financed by the Federal Government on a grant basis out of the general revenue available. My second recommendation is the immediate increase in individual personal incometax exemptions from the $600 figure to $700. In fact. it may be even necessary that we go higher than the $700 i1gure. This would give a spending power of over $3 billion to the lower- and middleclass families of this Nation. and would be of inestimable aid in .stimulating our faltering economy. I also believe. and this is my third recommendation. that we should concentrate on a large publicworks program in which the Federal Government should lead the way in promoting participation by the States. such as road programs. school programs. harbor works. flood control. and water pollution. I also offer. as a fourth suggestion. a permanent arm of assistance for the more than .300.000 families and individuals presently receiving grossly inadequate general assistance payments. The caseloads and expenditures of this category of assistance .are raipdly accelerating. States. counties. and municipal finances have not. cannot. and should not be expected to meet this challenge and financial burden alone. These hundreds of thousands of American families and individuals axe neither blind. disabled. or aged. nor the children dependent because of the death or absence of the father and breadwinner from the home. They are not legally. or technically eligible for oldage assistance. aid to the blind. aid to dependent children. or aid to permanently and totally disabled persons. But they need assistance. Adequate assistance on a standard of decency and dignity which for over two decades now they have not received. with some few scattered and notable exceptions. The Federal Government has a moral and American responsibility to share the cost of financing on an equitable basis the cost of general assistance to the States and municipalities. The Board of Directors of the American Public Welfare Association both in 1956 and 1957 formally set forth a Federal grantinaid for general assistance as the first and most important legislative and assistance objective in the public welfare program. National councils of State and local directors of public welfare have repeatedly passed resolutions urging Federal grantsinaid for general assistance cases. Voluntary national social welfare organizations have recognized this gross weakness in the national Public Welfare System and constantly endorsed a Federal grantinaid for general assistance. My own State of Massachusetts had over 250.000 more unemployed in February 1958 than in February 1957. Unemployment benefit checks increased in July 1957 by over 50 percent more than in July 1956. and by almost 300 percent in February 1958 over July 1957. The first 2 weeks of March 1958 reflected a steady climb in unemployment benefits over February 1958. Thousands of workers in Massachusetts have exhausted these benefits and are now dependent on the inadequate general assistance allowances of cities and towns. From September 1957 to February 1958 the general assistance caseload has increased by 3.000 cases. and the average monthly expenditure has increased by over $220.000 per month. an indicated annual increase of over $21/2 million. Since 1953 national expenditures for general assistance have risen from .$212 million to $276 million for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1957. To this must be added the $188 million spent in fiscal 1957 for aids to permanently and totally disabled persons. a category which did not exist in 1950. The total increase. therefore. over the 1950 expenditures for general assistance is actually $253 million rather than the $65 million in the old generalassistance statistics. The first 8 weeks of 1958 have reflected a steady. and in some States sharp increases in both cases and expenditures over 1957. A recent newspaper survey of industrial areas in Massachusetts disclosed many permanent shutdowns of old established plants. This includes the Ford plant in Somerville. a city of over 100.000 population. where Ford for 27 years had employed in excess of 2.000 workers. Other plants have cut working forces by over 5D percent. while many have established 2. 3 and 4day working weeks. The specific results of the enactment of H. R. 11678 would be multiple. not only would the distressed unemployed and needy receive more adequate assistance. but middleclass and warveteran homeowners would be substantially relieved of mounting anxiety and worry over possible loss of their homes because of annual tax rate increases approaching. or actually xeaching the confiscatory stage. The real estate tax delinquencies now accelerating among fixedsalary whitecollar homeowners would be diminished. Let me illustrate. In my own city of Cambridge. enactment of H. R. 11678. plus implementing State aid to municipalities for general assistance. would mean a reduction in realestate tax of $2.50 to $3 per thousand dollars of assessment. My neighboring city of Somerville would benefit to about the same savings. while the large city of Boston would realize a reduction in tax rate of from $3.50 to $4 per thousand. Real estate tax reduction is imperative to permit families to continue the American way of life and the American tradition and ambition of ownership of land and property. to relieve worry and anxiety for. and to protect the equity of the workingman in his home and property. It is my hope and trust that the Congress will favorably recommend that the Federal Government immediately assume its long overdue national moral and financial responsibility in the public welfare by the enactment of H. R. 11678."},{"1":"1957","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. my amendment increases the amount proposed by the gentleman from Kansas from 5 percent to 7.5 percent. It is the amendment that I spoke of when we were in general debate. Mr. Chairman. I want to state that I .find myself somewhat in the middle here today between the gentleman from .California and the gentleman from Texas and I submit that that might be a pretty good place to be. because I find we are faced with this situation: On the one hand we recognize that to overspend in this area it is going to cause a degree of inflation. yet. on the other hand. if we do not do something. we are neglecting some of our very fine civil servants who are entitled to an increase. And. I have never participated in or known of a labor negotiation yet that did not result in some kind of a compromise. and I am trying to present some kind of a compromise of 7.5 percent. which I think is legitimate. We talk about the salaries being paid in various places. We have had the problem in the Post Office Department of legislating salaries on a nationwide basis. and now we recognize that in some areas we have inequities. and in other areas our postal employees are some of the best paid people in the Nation. If we take the national average of what we pay the schoolteachers with a bachelor of arts degree. we hnd it is $4.220 a year. and if we take the average for the national salary we pay post office employees at the present time. it is $4.390. But. that does not do away with the fact that our employees are entitled to some kind of a salary increase. What are the practical facts? As I said before. I have no assurance that the 7.5 provision will become law. but I believe if it is accompanied by a proper rate bill. it will have a pretty good chance to become law. Now. we can stay here as long as we want. but I say to you that I do not believe that this $546 acrosstheboard increase has any chance of becoming law. Are we going to go through the same thing that we went through 2 years ago. the same experience? It could very well happen that the matter could be disposed of as far as the legislative branch is concerned. it will go to the Executive. it will be vetoed. and we will all be home and congratulating ourselves that we do not have to vote on the question of whether or not to override the veto. Here is my position and I want to make it strictly clear. I intend to support. of course. my 71/2percent amendment. But I will not support the $546 acrosstheboard proposal just on the political pretext that we are going to try to show the postal employees that we are for them. but yet not be able to produce anything as far as their pay envelope is concerned. I wish that you would give serious consideration to this 7I/2percent amendment. I might say that it also carries the same provision as in the amendment of the gentleman from Kansas whereby the Postmaster General. in areas where it is deemed necessary. may start employees not at the first step but at the second or third or fourth. If that provision goes in the bill. there are areas. extremely high cost of living areas where they have all of these problems. where the postal employees could receive an increase of $678 a year more than the starting salary at the present time. That is under the 71.-percent Proposal that I have here. I hope that you will give some consideration to this amendment and that we can reach a reasonable compromise that will have an opportunity to become law. But I still want to say this. that if we have a rate bill. it may be possible that a reasonable pay bill can be approved. I think that the rate bill as reported out of the committee should be increased. We ought to go further than we have with rates. in view of the fact that we have had a supplemental appropriation of well over $100 million. and this bill will cost around $200 million. and the $546 bill will cost $300 million. making our postal deficit about $1.1 billion. while the rate bill will be only $450 millionthat should cause us as responsible Members of this body some genuine concern. We ought to forget politics in this issue. We ought to do what is best for our employees and we ought to do what is best for our constituents. I hope that you will give serious consideration to the amendment that I have offered here."},{"1":"1956","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I am today introducing a bill designed to help meet two of the most critical problems facing our Nation today: The growing shortages in the teaching and science professions. Today. as we cross the threshold into the nuclear era. we must face the fact that our future strength as a nation rests with the children who are now being educated and who will be educated in the next generation. Recent magazine and newspaper articles have focused attention on the critical shortage of teachers. but I seriously doubt if the real implications of this scarcity have been realized. When schools opened in September 1955. the United States Office of Education estimated that there was a shortage of more than 140.000 teachers. The projected figures over the next 10 years give us even greater cause to stop and thinkand act. The Ford Foundation has pointed out that to maintain the present teacherstudent ratio. teaching staffs will have to be increased in the next 10 years more than they have increased over the past 35 years. Colleges and universities will have to add more teachers in the next 15 years than in all previous United States history combined. We will need 1.906.889 new teachers by 1965 to replace those who die or leave the profession. and to meet increased enrollments. If this need is to be met. onehalf of all college graduates expected during the next decade will have to enter the teaching field. In past years. only onefifth of all college graduates have entered this profession. We all know that when there are not enough teachers to go around. something has to give. What gives. of course. is the quality of our teaching. for class sizes become swollen and unqualified teachers must be hired. Today. 35 percent of all public elementary teachers have had less than 4 years of college. and 6 percent have had less than 2 years. There are many factors involved in the teacher shortage. which deserve the fullest consideration and study. Not the least of these is the salary scale. Many semiskilled laborers receive better pay than the men and women who teach our children. The problem is not that the salary scale of the workers is too high. but simply that our teachers receive too little. Small wonder that many of them. especially those with families to raise. find that they must leave the profession if they are to make ends meet. Another factor affecting the scarcity of teachers is that too few of our highschool graduates go on to college at all. More than half of the top quarter in intelligence of our highschoolage youth never go on to college. Surveys indicate that the majority of these students simply cannot afford to continue their education. I submit. Mr. Speaker. that such a waste of good minds is one which our Nation cannot afford. There has been an increase in the number of scholarship programs developed by industry. philanthropic institutions. and the like. Unfortunately. however. they do not meet the demandnor the critical need which faces us today and which bears so directly upon our national life. That is why I feel that Government must act now to help meet the emergency. One of the provisions of my bill would create 50.000 scholarships a year for the next 10 years for students entering the field of education. Before the bogey of Federal control of education is raised. let me point out that this is often only a smokescreen raised by those who are reluctant to act.. We have seen during the administration of the GI bill of rights that Federal financing of a students college education has not resulted in Government control over the policies or curriculum of our colleges and universities. To administer the program of scholarships. there would be created in the Department of Health. Education. and Welfare the position of Director of Scholarships and a Board of 16 drawn from the professional field who would set standards for the recipients of scholarships. making tuition payments direct to the various institutions. and make subsistence payments direct to the qualifying students. Scholarships would be divided on a statewide basis in proportion to the number of high school graduates in each State. Directly related to the teacher shortage is the equally critical shortage in trained personnel in the scientific fields. The reason for this is not difficult to find. Twentythree percent of our Nations public high schools offer no courses in physics and chemistry. During 195455. a total of 7.900 science teachers were needed. but only 3.600 were trained. and of these only 1.700 actually entered the teaching field. According to the National Education Association. the output of science teachers has declined 57 percent from 1950 to 1955. This at a time when science and technology are the very cornerstones of our security and our hope for peacetime prosperity. Yet. how can we expect our young people to become interested in the further study of science when they have been given no chance of becoming acquainted with it. The second provision of my scholarship bill provides for 20.000 undergraduate scholarships a year for 10 years for qualified students in the field of science. The president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. J. R. Killian. Jr.. stated in a recent article for Life magazine that our shortage of scientists has become the best advertised shortage of our time because of the wellknown fact that Russia has been producing more trained scientists than has the United States. Mr. Killian went on to propose a series of national scholarships to meet our emergency needs. He did prefer to have these scholarships financed by private sources. but he also felt that until private funds were available the Federal Government should do something to fill the partial vacuum. I certainly agree with Mr. Killian. Because quality is as important as quantity. my bill also sets up 5.000 postgraduate scholarships a year in the field of science. This should enable some of our gifted students to continue their education rather than face the necessity of having to accept positions after receiving their B. S. degree. Mr. Speaker. we have every reason to be proud of the men and women whom we entrust today with the education of our children. They are doing an extraordinary job under difficult circumstances. But they need helpand the help of tomorrow must be trained today. Similarly. Mr. Speaker. we must face squarely the fact that the scientific demands of our Nation in this highly technological era are falling upon too few shoulders. It may be no exaggeration to say that the outcome of the cold war and Americas continued leadership may well depend upon how squarely we face the challenging task before us. For this reason. I sincerely hope that the House Committee on Education and Labor will consider my proposals as soon as possible. In the life of both people and nations. there comes a time for decision and action. With respect to our future teachers and scientists. that time is now."},{"1":"1955","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"I want to complete what Mr. Straus and the Bureau of Reclamation printed in their manual: That in spite of section 8 of the Reclamation Act the Federal Government is the owner of all unappropriated waters in the streams of the West. and that the Federal Government need not comply with the water laws of Colorado.

That only because the issue involved questions the integrity not only of Congressmen but the chairman of a committee and of the committee itself. and for that matter. of the House. It also involves the question of what procedure. in the few weeks remaining. this House is to follow with reference to subcommittees. This question arose when the gentleman from Michigan early this year came to me and complained that Iron Mountain. one of the towns in iis district. was a distressed labor area where around a thousand people were unemployed. This was a distressed labor area. It is a town where the Ford Motor Co. had formerly a very large plant. The people who were attempting to obtain employment for the citizens of that community. Iron Mountain and the surrounding area. had agreed to put the plant in a state where they thought local industry would be able to bid on a Government contract for planes. They had been denied that opportunity by the Air Force. At the time the gentleman from Michigan early this year made his complaint about the refusal of the Government agency to permit his constituents to bid. two Members of the other body. Fenators FERGUSON and POTTER. also asked that they might be heard. Instead of referring that matter to the full Committee on Government Operations. instead of referring it to a regular subcommittee which had a staff. which would undoubtedly send investigators out into the field and spend perhaps a week or two in determining this issue which should be determined. in my opinion at least. at once. a special subcommittee was appointed by me. as was authorized by the rules. until last Wednesday. July 15. the full committee attempted to deprive me of that authority. That was a special threeman committee. the gentleman from Missouri . the gentleman from Texas were members. I was chairman. The Air Force was asked to send over someone to explain the situation. The gentleman from Michigan appeared. The tw Senators from Michigan appeared. The Fontana brothers appeared. Other witnesses appeared in behalf of their claim that they had been deniednow. listennot a contract. not a contract but an opportunity to bid on a contract. After hearing from those witnesses and the testimony of the Air Force people it was agreed by those present that the Fontana brothers should be given an opportunity to bid and that their plant should be resurveyed. Now. a long. long story can be made out of that situation. but that. in substance. was the situation. I ask: Is there anything wrong in a Government Operations Committee of this House appointing a special subcommittee to give 2 Senators and 1 Congressman an opportunity to present the plea of their constitutents that they should have an opportunity to bid on a Government contract? If it is wrong then I was at fault. If it was proper then I should not be deprived of the opportunity to assist you should the occasion arise. I am raising this issue now because last Wednesday the House Committee on Government Operations killed off every single special subcommittee that had been appointed by me. and denied me the authority to appoint any further subcommittees."},{"1":"1952","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"The Senator from Louisiana probably well knows that the Republic of Mexico wants to restrict the migration to the United States of Mexicans from northern Mexico. because Mexico is trying to build up her own agriculture.

Otherwise the Government of Mexico will not enter into an agreement."},{"1":"1951","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President.

I believe he is fully familiar with the fact. if we could reestablish a principle so that any farm products which were imported would be imported on a basis of fair and reasonable competition. from 80 to 85 percent of the farm products would not need a tariff. However. until that time and until the country comes to its sensesMr. President. I should apologize for making that statement. for the country has come to its senses. The resolutions coming to us from labor. which I have read. and the resolution coming from the Farm Bureau in my State. which I am about to read in the course of these remarks. and what I hear when I go home and when I go to other States of the Union proves to me. that the country is at least 2 or 3 years ahead of the Senate of the United States. The country has realized the utter futility of the present freetrade program which destroys American industries and also would lower the standard of living in a futile effort to preserve our industries. after really destroying them. However. judging by the unanimous vote on the part of the Finance Committee. it has not yet caught up with the Senate. and of course is a long way behind the people of the country. I am in hopes that the members of that committee will have an opportunity to go home this summerunless there is another emergency or some other police actionso that at that time they can obtain at least some idea of how far ahead of them the country is. and then will get their feet on the ground in regard to some of these matters."},{"1":"1950","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. there is pending before us a nomination which has aroused widespread interest throughout the country. It has been the subject of one of the most exhaustive committee investigations undertaken in the past year. The Armed Services Committee was good enough to permit me. although not a member of that committee. to be present as an observer during many of the sessions held on the nomination of Anna Rosenberg to be Assistant Secretary of Defense. In one way it was shocking to me that an individual of such high and unquestioned repute. of such notable attainments. for whom so many people have vouched on the basis of intimate associations extending over two decades. should be subjected to the kind of ordeal which Mrs. Rosenberg has faced during the past 2 weeks. On the other hand. I am deeply and favorably impressed by the minute care with which the Armed Services Committee went into the charges that were madethe scrupulous attention given to each piece of testimony. to each allegation. and each statement made before the committee. Hours upon hours were spent in hearing these charges and in examining into them. and following back over every possible trail which was indicated. No stone was left unturned. no charge was left unheard. It is not my wish or prerogative to analyze the testimony given before the Armed Services Committee. nor the procedure followed by that committee. All I wish to say is that no nominee for public office has ever received a more microscopic examination of character and political background. Of course. there were ugly undertones to this proceeding. The sources of some of the charges were motivated not by patriotic devotion. but by unpatriotic prejudices. But all that is now happily over. The committee has given Mrs. Rosenberg a clean bill of health. Mrs. Rosenberg is a citizen of my State. I have known her both personally and professionally for a quarter of a century. She served her State in many official capacities during the years when I was Governor. and both before and after that. She achieved the reputation of being an eminent expert in labormanagement problems. in labor relations. and in manpower problems generally. In all the years that I have known her she has followed no narrow social doctrine or ideological cant. Her chief characteristic has been her complete openmindedness and receptiveness to facts. Her store of knowledge is amazing. Her administrative skill is of the highest. She has shown a great gift for improvisation and initiative. Her capacity for work is prodigious. I assume it was for these reasons that Gen. George C. Marshall selected Mrs. Rosenberg to be one of his assistants to share the tremendous responsibility he now has for the defense of our country and bf the free world. Mrs. Rosenberg was a member. by my appointment. of the New York defense council when it was first established in 1941. She sat on that council for 5 years. until the end of the war. My successor. Governor Dewey. kept her in that position when the defense council became the war council. One of her colleagues of those days is my colleague today in the Senate. the senior Senator from New York . who was then majority leader of the New York State Assembly. and. by virtue of his position. a member of the defense council and then of the war council. I can think of no one better equipped than Mrs. Rosenberg to occupy the post to which she has been named by the President. It is my belief that the United States Government is very fortunate. indeed. to have her services in this difficult and trying period. In this period of our history. we need the best and finest talents of the entire Nation in positions of governmental responsibility. The very survival of our Nation depends upon that. That is why I cannot view without extreme regret the experience of Mrs. Rosenberg in suffering the attacks against her character. broadcast by radio and spread over the pages of the press. I do not think it will provide a very attractive precedent for others who are approached to serve. at personal sacrifice. in public capacities. Of course. Mrs. Rosenbergs experience is not a new one. There have been similar ones in the recent past. I know that it is absolutely necessary that we exercise the most scrupulous care in the selection of persons for sensitive posts in the United States Government. Yet surely there is--there must bea better way to exercise these precautions than by charges in the press and over the radio. I hasten to add that the Armed Services Committee did its best. to my certain knowledge. to minimize the public character of the investigation. I have nothing but the highest praise for the conduct of that committee. The Senate is going to confirm this nomination. I am pleased at that. I am sure that Mrs. Rosenberg will continue to be a great asset in the Defense Department. a great aid to General Marshall. and will make a vital contribution to the vast defense effort which lies ahead for all of us. I am proud to support her nomination. and to urge all my colleagues to do likewise. This fine lady is a great credit to her State. as she is to her country."},{"1":"1949","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. President Truman in his message on the state of the Union. as was expected. urged the adoption of a legislative program to perpetuate and to perfect the Socialist regime patterned after that of Stalin and Hitler. which was formally launched by his predecessor. Among other things. he asked Congress to give him power to again subject our people to the torture of the OPA era. black markets. empty store shelves. to reline the streets with long queues anxiously and tiresomely inching their way to the counters for their daily allowancesprice control and rationing. To make political socalled loans to private industry. To further socialize housing and thus add to the political corruption that so seriously afflicts the homebuilding industrysocalled lowrent housing. and so forth. To continue and to strengthen the power of the political authority to liquidate owners of rental property and further aggravate the difficulty people are having to find a place in which to liverent control. To create the most fearful and the most avaricious bureaucracy of all. socialized medicine. and to engage in destroying the best medical care ever received by any people In the world. To imitate the German Reich and other totalitarian states and bring the common school system under the juristion of the political authority controlling the Federal Government for the purpose of indoctrinating our youth with the philosophy of socialism. and. of course. to secure the political support of teacherssocalled Federal aid to education. It is a law. but with very few exceptions. that every dollar loaned or granted by the political authority. whether to private individuals or political bodies. carries with it a degree of political control. which control expands progressively as such loans or grants are repeated. all legal verbiage. or absence of such. to the contrary notwithstanding. The very existence of these devices is contingent upon the political dividends they pay. To implement the available political means for maintaining the artificial prosperity the farming community is experiencing and to move it closer to the brink of liquidation and collective farmingpolitical soil conservation. triple A. subsidies. Marshall plans. and so forth. To fetter the expansion of and to destroy private electric energy producing and distributing plants. and to implement the program under way for -ultimate socialization of the entire electric power industry. more TVAs. and so forth. To exact in taxes for current operating costs from the lowincome groups. in the guise of soaking the rich. about three and onehalf billion dollars for an indefinite period of years. for that is about the proportion of the burden these classes Will be forced to bear if the Presidents proposal to raise an additional $4.000.000.000 in taxes annually goes through. To broaden the Insidious income tax. disguised as social security. to cover some 20.000.000 additional workers to feed the insatiable maw of politics. The incidence of taxation is such as to cause wage earners and the other lowincome groups to pay the greater portion of taxes no matter upon whom or what they are levied. This is Inherent in the very nature of things. Just as white sheep give more wool than black ones. because there are more white ones to fleece. so wage earners and working people in general pay in the aggregate more taxes than the rich and welltodo. Taxes are ultimately paid out of production. One cannot eat or wear money but only the things that money will exchange for. Since the lowincome groups produce and consume much the greater proportion of the necessaries of life and since general taxes ultimately and inevitably fall upon consumption goods. the real source of taxes must always remain predominately with those groups. Banks. agriculture. railroads. coal mines. in fact all industry is well in the process of socialization. President Truman recommended to Congress that he be given power to authorize the construction of facilities to produce materials in critically short supply. such as steel. if action by private industry fails to meet our needs. This is a bold and forthright request for power to formally put the political authority in the business of producing steel. which. in the nature of things. would have to eventuate in the complete communization of the entire steel industry. And. finally. the President asked for overall power to impose upon the Nation universal conscription. the essence of tyranny and the ultimate resort for making the regimentation complete and for maintaining a permanent status of war to keep a ravaged. disillusioned. and restive people from staging a successful revolution. President Truman has heretofore himself stated the powers he asked Congress to give him represent policestate methods and inferentially condemned them. Now he seeks to impose them upon the Nation in perpetuity and even proceeds on the preposterous assumption that he was given a mandate to do so in the last election. The result of last Novembers election shows nothing remotely resembling anything like an authorization to President Truman to continue or advance the program of communizing the United States. Only about onehalf of the eligible voters took the trouble to go to the polls.. Though the population has greatly increased in the last decade. the total vote cast In the Presidential election in 1940 was about 2.000.000 greater than that of the last election. Why? Because a great number of those who still believe in freedom and constitutional government of strictly limited powers. the kind of government under which this Nation achieved its greatness. viewed the platforms of the two major parties. and the conduct of party leaderships during the last decade or so. as being so completely and so similarly socialistic that there was no choice left to them but to stay home. Furthermore. millions who did take the trouble to go to the polls. whether they voted the Democratic or Republican ticket. did so with decided reservations. lacking faith that either party would do the right things Instead of the politically expedient ones. And by no means of least Importance Is the fact that millions voted outright for New Dealism not knowing its implications or realizing that it is leading this Nation into universal slavery. and. perchance. even to domination by some foreign power. as surely and as straight as the crow flies. There Is nothing whatever in the situation warranting the claim that the election gave President Truman a mandate to do anything. Only if. on the one hand. the voters had had a clearcut choice of voting for the existing political system which is based wholly on plundering the producing elements of the population. and. on the other hand. for true government as expressed by Jefferson. one that shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. and President Truman had won out. then. but only then. could it be claimed that he was given a mandate to perfect the police state. But the voters had no such choice which completely exposes the pretension of any mandate. The attitude of the electorate In respect of the several factions contending with each other for control of the Government and the election results clearly and unmistakably show dangerous political corruption of our national life. It Is to this that we must look for an explanation of the true meaning of the recent election."},{"1":"1948","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker.

The late Representative RAYMOND S. SPRINGER was not only my colleague. my associate. and my coworker on the Committee on the Judiciaryhe was morehe was my friend in all that term implies. For a number of years our offices were on the same corridor. We visited each other frequently. I soon learned the manner of man he was. the value of his counsel. and his general inclination to be helpful in every particular. Other speakers have made reference to his military service and public service before entering Congress. Coming from Michigan. which adjoins Indiana. I knew him by reputation and with that knowledge I soon understood why his constituents sent him to Congress. He had great ability. He was ever industrious. He took his work seriously and any task undertaken by him was always well done. He was meticulous about detail. Of judicial temperament. blessed with an abundance of tolerance. it was his notion that the ultimate objective of all legislation is justice. He believed in the common people and was firmly convinced that our Constitutional system was best suited to secure justice for all of our people. He was mindful of the fact that a Member of Congress could not hope to accomplish much in this forum unless he had the confidence and respect of his colleagues. Judge SPRINGER had that confidence and respect. When he addressed the House. he always had the attention of his auditors. He realized that with 435 Members it was not possible for each Member to have his own way in the writing of laws. While he never compromised on fundamental principles. yet he was practical. In short. he was an effective legislator. When he came to Congress he accepted a place on the Committee on Claims. and when Judge SPRINGER recommended the payment of a claim by the Government everybody knew that. in his opinion. at least. the claim was justified. His inherent honesty compelled him to study these claims just the same as he would had he been a judge in a court. Work on claims is most exacting. yet he never shirked. His principal committee work. however. was on the Committee on the Judiciary where he was soon recognized as one of that committees outstanding members. At the beginning of the Eightieth Congress he was made chairman of Subcommittee No. 4. and in this capacity had charge of the initial consideration of much important legislation. including continuation of war powers. There was no member on this committee who worked harder and accomplished more than did Judge SPRINGER. Many a law now on the statute book is a better law because Judge SPRINGER helped to write it. As chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary. I relied much upon him. It made no difference whether the work had to be done in his office. at his home in the evening. in his subcommittee. in the full committee. or presenting the matter to the House. he always carried more than his share of the load. I am convinced that his life was shortened because of his conscientious application to his work. None of us had any idea. however. that he was so soon to pay the price which overwork usually exacts. The closing days of the last session were full days indeed for Judge SPRINGER. It can be truly said that he died in harness. Judge SPRINGER liked people. and people liked him. He was a rock of trust. He hated deceit. While forward locking. he never coveted the success of others. He was real and entirely void of sham. He was never touched by the pomp of power and never lured from the realities of human fellowship. He served his Nation. his State. and his district well. His service in the Congress was especially valuable in these days of conflicting emotions and difficult problems. and in his going we have lost a personal friend and the Nation has lost a distinguished. conscientious. worthwhile Member of Congress. To his family we express our genuine sympathy."},{"1":"1946","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. in discussbIg th S bill. H. R. 6407.

Further. there is a provision in the engineers estimate for some $2.000.000 to provide for pumping water from the Ohio River up to the headwaters in order to have sufficient water supplied to operate the canal. inasmuch as the Big Sandy Basin does not supply sufficient water. Thirtyfive organizations. such as railroad and mine labor unions. chambers of commerce. city councils. county courtsrepresenting the territory affected by this canalhave expressed opposition. Mr. Chairman. in order to give a proper background to my interest in the project. I would like to inform the committee that this river borders the congressional district which I have the honor of representing for approximately 50 miles. My home town of Huntington. W. Va.. a city of 85.000 inhabitants. where I have lived for the past 50 years. is within 5 miles of the confluence of the Big Sandy. and the Ohio Rivers. About 150.000 of the population of my congressional district live within 25 miles of the river in question. Consequently. my deep interest in that section of the country is well understood. It is not my purpose today to discuss the physical aspects of the river or the economic value of the project. that will be done when the bill is read. However. I may say now that after some study I find the arguments by the proponents on these two phases of the problem to be unimpressive. The inaccessibility of coal deposits or the inadequacy of transportation is not one of our problems today and is not likely to be for many years to come. I would like to remind you that this entire region is adequately served by the C. & 0. and the N. & W. Railroads. My primary interest in railroads as such is in their economic contribution to the general welfare. However. I am deeply interestod in the welfare of the 6.000 railroad employees. men and women. who reside in my district. In projects of this naturetax free and constructed with public money and of questionable economic value the railroader is placed in the unhappy position of being taxed to assist in paying the bill for a system which will deprive his group of income. I would like to bring to the attention of the committee a feature which has manifested itself in mail received. evidently from persons primarily interested In the work afforded by public spending. It is a matter of common knowledge that we are in need of 5.000.000 housing units at this time. The need of building construction in commercial and industrial reconversion and expansion is almost beyond calculation. consequently. it is reasonable to assume that labor of all the building trades. and all the buildingmaterial manufacturers. will be fully employed in civilian construction for the next 8 or 10 years. These facts should be carefully considered in decisions affecting all Federal construction. In my opinion. it would be very unfortunate if the Government would go into the labor and material markets. where a definite shortage exists in both fields. and compete with private enterprise. except only in cases which are imperative beyond question and necessary to proper functioning of the Federal establishment. I am in favor of the improvement and development of our waterways when it contributes to the public good and the expenditure is compatible with Federal income. In opposing projects of this nature at this time. I could well use the words of Bernard Baruch and Jesse H. Jones in their respective statements opposing the British loan. The opinion of these gentlemen on fiscal matters is respected not only in this country butthroughout the world. In essence. they have stated that it is time that we halt public spending and take an accounting of ourselves. and that bringing the Federal Budget into balance and terminating deficit spending are absolutely necessary now to preserve the financial integrity of our country. We cannot afford to continue printing and spending money indiscriminately. Every time we spend an additional billion of borrowed money we reduce the buying power of our dollar. -and if we go on spending and lending and giving and losing. without regard to how we are going to pay back the money that we have borrowed from our people. it will not be long until cur dollar will be as depreciated as the currency of other countries that have overspent. Deficit spending is a definite contribution to inflationary processes. It increases buying power and demands for materials and labor in a market which is now unable to supply noimal requirements. These things. along with foreign loans. are accelerating the inflation spiral. which means cheap money. This Congress has a special obligation to maintain the purchasing power of our money. to maintain the value of the money in our bonds. Deficit spending has taken us in the opposite direction. If these spending policies are continued by the Congress. we are placing farther away into the distant future the day when a veteran can buy a homethe day when our people can have the things they need and should have at a fair price. There are a few questions every veteranyes. every citizenhas a right to ask this Congress. Has this country. since the end of the war. been brought to a satisfactory peacetime level? Have the things we need for comfortable living been made available at prices we can afford? Has the Government maintained the purchasing power of the dollar? The answer. obviously. is. No. We are going to be asked these questions and as for my part. I want the record to show my position. Our national debt today is approaching $300.000.000.000 and is in excess of $2.000 for every man. woman. and child in the United States. It is time that we stop and think where we are going. that we take stock of our resources. of our earning capacity. of how we are going to service our existing debt before we try to increase it by continued spending. There is one fact we should constantly keep before us. The major portion. if not the entire burden. of our huge national debt. the burden of all Federal spending. wasteful or otherwise. falls upon the backs of the men and women who work with their hands. All labor in industryon the farm. in the mines. in the forestsin the final analysis pays the bill. All the debt juggling and all the highsounding phrases will not change the picture one iota if we are to remain a solvent Nation. Consequently. I find myself in opposition to projects of this nature. particularly at this time."},{"1":"1945","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"No. Mr. President. that is not my position. They do not have that jurisdiction over our dams. But under the treaty they would have jurisdiction over the Davis Dam. That is my interpretation of the purpose of Davis Dam as a regulatory dam. It is my opinion that. with this provision included. neither the Bureau of Reclamation nor anyone else could come within the boundaries of my State and control irrigation there. Of course. as pointed out by the Senator from Colorado. someone would have to say how much of the water we could get. I realize that someone would have to apportion the water to the various States. under the compact. in the case of a water shortage. But under no circumstances could they disturb the old. established water rights. particularly those of the Salt and Gila Rivers in the State of Arizona. That was what I was working to protect. I do not wish to have them meddle with the waters of the Salt and Gila Rivers in any way. and I believe reservation* (c) accomplishes my purpose.

I make that request. and. as suggested by him. I will go through the motions of addressing empty seats on some matters which I think are pertinent. Mr. President. the early editions of the Washington Post of today quoted the junior Senator from Nebraska as objecting to one of the experts loaned to the subcommittee of the Military Affairs Committee of the Senate. on the ground that he had received many telephone calls from the Political Action Committee. Evidently the junior Senator from Nebraska has not had the time ATE 6861 In the last few months to read the trade papers of the American labor movement in all its phases. Anyone who had read those publications and who had been more fully acquainted with the statements of Senators interested in the pending legislation would have known that the fact that all labor groups have been constantly consulting many Senators and their staffs on this subject matter has been long a matter of public record. The labor organizations themselves have shouted this fact from the housetops. Members of the Senate in official and unofficial statements and comments have made it widely known that all branches of American labor have been constantly discussing this subject with Senators and Members of the House of Representatives and their assistants and staffs. Anyone who had the time to read the hearings on this important legislation and the official publications of all branches of the American labor movement would have known that no subject in years has so commanded the interest and the concern of American labor as has and does this subject. Anyone who has had the time to read one of the best edited and most informative newspapers in the United States. the weekly newspaper published by the railroad labor unions under the title of Labor would have seen that railroad labor is giving more space. more time. more energy. and more action to this subject than to almost any other subject in years. In issue after Issue of that newspaper frontpage articles have been published dealing with this subject. disclosIng the fact that labor has been in constant touch with Members of the Congress on the subject of this legislation. Anyone reading the American Federationist. published by the American Federation of Labor. or the press releases issued by the American Federation of Labor would have seen that the American Federation of Labor has felt similarly on this important subject and has acted similarly. That. likewise. is true of the C. I. 0. News. the publication issued by the Congress of Industrial Organizations. and of numerous publications of international unions and their locals affiliated with the railroad labor unions. the American Federation of Labor. and the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Proper legislation on this subject is so vital to the American workingman and workingwoman that on this matter all branches of organized labor have joined hands from the start. This is one oi the few occasions on which they have done so. A reader of the daily newspapers would have observed early in May of this year the fact that a letter had been written to all Senators. signed jointly by William Green. president of the American Federation of Labor. Philip Murray. president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. and J. G. Luhrsen. executive secretary of the Railway Labor Executives Association. The letter was addressed to all Senators. under date of May 1. 1944. and in it Senators were urged to give immediate consideration to and to accomplish the passage of the bill which I. along with other Senators. have had the honor to sponsor. Why is organized labor so deeply concerned with this subject? Its members know that the workingmen and workingwomen of this country must have jobs. .not only for their individual wellbeing -but also for the safeguarding of our economic system. They remember the excesses of inflation and depression which followed the last war. They remember the miseries which fell upon tens of millions of Americans. Is it any wonder that they would be interested in this subject? Is it any wonder that on this subject they would want to petition Congress and its committees and its individual Members? Is it any wonder that they would try to reach Members of Congress and thcir staffs. to convey all suggestionq which seem to them reasonable and proper on the subject of this legislation? Is there anything discreditable in the fact that any citizen of the United States or any organization of citizens of the United States communicates with a Member of the United States Senate or his staff. as may have been insinuated? I and my staffand I am sure the same is true of other Senators and their .staffshave received innumerable personal visits and telephone calls on the subject of the pending legislation from representatives of all branches of organized labor in the last few months. just as we have received telegrams from the Governors of States. from State socialsecurity organizations. from manu* facturers associations. and from others. -Was any discredit to be attached to that? The newspaper article appearing today in the early editions of the Washington Post. in the course of which appears the interview with the junior Senator from Nebraska. which. strange to say. does not -appear in a later edition. conveys the in.formation. which the Senator from Nebraska also conveys in his interview. that members of the staff of the subcommittee of which I have been serving as chairman had received several telephone calls from representatives of the Congress of Industrial Organizations or of the Congress of Industrial Organizations Political Action Committee. Let the picture be made complete. As chairman of the subcommittee. I. together with members of the staff of the subcommittee. have received scores and hundreds of telephone calls from representatives of all branches of the American labor movement. Indeed. if I were to estimate from which branch of organized labor the telephone calls and personal visits have been the largest in number. I should be inclined to estimate that the older the labor organization. the more frequently it has been in touch with our subcommittee members and with the staff. It might be useful for anyone interest-. ed in this subject to turn to the hearings of the subcommittee which had the bill before it. There he will find that among the foremost supporters of the legislation. which I had the honor to propose. are William Green. president of the American Federation of Labor. and Matthew Woll. vice president of the American Federation of Labor and chairman of its committee on postwar policy. .Anyone who had followed the course of the legislation would have noted that on .April 4. Mr. Matthew Woll. vice presi.dent of the American Federation of Labor and chairman of its committee on .postwar planning. appeared before the subcommittee of the United States Senate Military Affairs Committee and made a notable statement on the urgent need of passing an earlier version of the bill. which I have had the honor to sponsor. The American Federation of Labor and Mr. Woll were. in fact. the first to support the legislation. I would like to quote from the statement Mr. Woll made on April 4. Mr. Woll. who was the first labor witness before the subcommittee. stated: Human rights are quite as important as property rights. The workers in this country. whether in the armed forces or on the production line. have as much right to have their interests considered and have their security provided for as have the property owners. It cannot be taken for granted that the provisions for the protection of property owners would automatically mean full employment at adequate wages for workers. Mr. Woll went on to say thatRecommendations for reconversion In the BaruchHancock report * * * are implemented in S. 1823. I recall that that fact was disputed earlier today in the debate in the Senate. But I still refer to that report and to the implementation contained in the bill. Mr. Woll further ftated: We urge that the provisions embodied In S. 1623 be substituted for those in S. 1730. For the benefit of those Members of the Senate who have not had the opportunity to hear or to read Mr. Wolls illuminating statement. I offer it for inclusion in the RECORD. I know of no statement which so clearly points out the need for this urgent- legislation. and I am honored by the wholehearted supDort of that great organization. the Amerlcan Federation of Labor. of the legislation which I have becen privileged to assist in introducing. Experts attached to that great organization have been in constant consultation with me and with members of my staff. as well as with other Senators and their staffs. in an attempt t6 perfect this legislation. Again I say. where is the crime in having any group of persons insist on seeing their legally elected representatives or their staffs. and consulting with them on legislation which affects them?

I shall vote for the Senators amendment to create a board."},{"1":"1941","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I thank the Senator. In effect it is a strike against the Government of the United States. Mr. President. I wish to congratulate the American Federation of Labor for a statement appearing In the newspapers a few days ago appealing to its subordinate unions not to strike on any defense production. but to submit to mediation and conciliation. The trouble about that situation is that the national council of the American Federation of Labor has no compulsory power over the subordinate unions of that federation. but when the national council of the American Federa-. tion of Labor issues a statement of that kind. at least. it ought to have some moral influence. Mr. President. the bill which I have introduced probably ought to have some accompanying regulations and provisions. It will be remembered that during the World War. President Wilson. by Executive order. set up certain agencies to deal with and adjust labor disputes. which worked remarkably well. First. he set up the WalshTaft labor board. as I recall It. a member of which was Frank P. Walsh. as the Senator from Massachusetts will remember. President Wilson set up that labor board to deal with wage disputes and to standardize wages of certain classifications of labor in certain areas. so as to remove the danger of sporadic strikes here and there. That labor board was a governmental institution. Then President Wilson set up a mediation board. such as that which we have recently set up. In addition to that. an agreement was reached. which employers and labor were called upon to accept. providing that there would be no lockouts and that there would be no strikes. Mr. President. if the bill I have Just introduced should be enacted. there might be some person who would say. Oh. well. if the Government takes over the plant. there would be pressure from labor for the Government to accede to Its demands. But if the President of the United States should Issue an Executive order. which he would have perfect authority to do under his general power of commandeering the plants. under his power as Executive of all the administrative . agencies of the Government. whereby he would set up a wage board to determine quarrels as to wages in plants which might be taken over. either under the existing law. as contained in the Conscription or Draft Act. or which might be taken over under the provisions of my proposed amendment to the Draft Act. there could be no excuse whatever for a strike in a nationaldefense industry. There would then be in existence mediation tribunals to which the parties could submit their disputes. there would be a wage board to determine what would be a fair wage. and in the hour of the Nations peril there would be no excuse whatever for some of the leaders to whom the Senator from Oregon referredsocalled labor leadersinstigating and inciting their membership to strike. Mr. President. many men in the labor unions throughout the United States are Just as much opposed to these strikes as are those of us here upon the Senate floor. I am speaking about the men who work at the benches and at the machines and in the shops. I am not speaking about the agitators who make their living by agitation and who secure an enhancement of their compensation by stirring up strikes and commotion. Mr. President. I have in my hand. and I shall ask to have incorporated in the RECORD. a statement with respect to strikes on the date of May 29. in factories and plants affecting only the War Department. not touching the Navy. and not touching the Maritime Commission. I wish to cite a few places In which strikes are now in effect. American Potash & Chemical Co.. Trona. Calif. The men on strike are mine. mill. and smelter workers. The issues are the closed shop and wage increases. The strike was certified to the Mediation Board on April 23. 1941. Apollo Steel Corporation. Apollo. Pa. Arrow Tool & Reamer Co.. Detroit. Mich. Auto Specialties Manufacturing Co.. St. Joseph. Mich. I have named but a few. These strikes are scattered all over the country. Mr. President. this statement with respect to strikes is significant because of the widespread character of the strike movement. which is bound to convey the conviction to an unprejudiced mind that therq is a system in this movement. These are not simply sporadic strikes here and there In some particular localities. but the strikes are so widespread and so general throughout the United States that they reveal a studied plan emanating from some source. which is bound to be inimical to the welfare of our defense program. At this point I ask that the statement to which I have referred be placed in the RECORD."},{"1":"1940","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Suite 226. Woodward Building. Fifteenth and H Streets NW..

Mr. Greens letter was as follows: I cannot understand how any Catholic committee could invite and accept John Brophy. or men like John Brophy. as members of a Catholic committee. Everybody knows that John Brophy went to Russia as a sympathizer of the Soviet Government. Everybody knows that a responsible person testified before the Dies committee that John Brophy was supported by the Communists when he ran for president of the United Mine Workers some years ago. and that the Communists supplied him the money with which to pay the expenses of said election.

I think I stated my view as to that. The provision under discussion presents some difficulties. It is said it is difficult to determine the prevailing wage. and it is. What is the Administrator required to do to determine it? He is required to locate workers of the same general type in order to fix it. and there is a difficulty there. Then he has to provide a definition as between different areas of the same general type. Anyone who goes about the United States and endeavors to map accurately different areas of the same general type has his work cut out for him. if he seeks to do it before the 7th of February or the 1st of July. and then to apply in those different areas the wages of men in the same general class. comparing one areawith another. There may be in the woods of the Northwest highly organized working conditions. In another section of the country. where men are doing similar work in the woods. there may be an oversupply of labor. no organization. and living conditions may be easier. We cannot in fairness bring the wage scales within 25 percent without disrupting the conditions either in one or both of those areas. It seems to me that after we have gone ahead for 3 years upon tle prevailing wage basis. to seek at the last third of a fiscal year to set up a new scale. and provide that no money appropriated shall be used until new computations have been made which must take in the whole countrythat is. it is necessary to compare the wage scale in Florida with that in the State of Washington If there Is any similarity in employment and in areais a task utterly beyond the capacity of the present organization of the W.

After saying that the Senator from Nebraska has been an inspiration to the Senator from New Hampshire. that he has been nonpartisan. that he has always sought to be fair. the Senator from New Hampshire says: Has he changed? So says the Senator from New Hampshire. The Senator from Nebraska has been nonpartisan for 40 years. we will say. He has been an inspiration to the Senator from New Hampshire since the Senator from New Hampshire was just an ordinary citizen up in New Hampshire. just an ordinary. plain man. before he came to the Senate. The Senator from Nebraska was an inspiration to him. The Senator from Nebraska has been nonpartisan for 40 years. and he has been fair for 40 years. or fifty. or seventyfive. Has he changed? When the Senator from Nebraska does not agree with the Senator from New Hampshire In his prejudgment of the T. V. A.. when the Senator from Nebraska does not agree to convict the T. V. A. without trial and without witnesses and without facts. the Senator from New Hampshire immediately begins to doubt him. He is not going to be an inspiration to me any longer unless he helps get me on the investigating committee. He will not be nonpartisan unless he makes up his mind in advance. and prejudges the T. V. A.. and calls the administration doublefaced. and says that the Federal Government is a twoheaded monster. If he will do that. I shall continue to be Inspired by him. and I shall continue to follow his nonpartisan policy. Has he changed? I hope not. and I believe not. but why is he now seeking to cloak the sins of this agency behind the sure protection of a second administration controlled agency? In other words. the Senator from Nebraska was seeking to hide the sins of the T. V. A. If the T. V. A. has sinned. it has already been convicted. has it not. by the Senator from New Hampshire? He says the T. V. A. has sinned. and that the Senator from Nebraska is seeking to hide those sins behind the cloak of an investigation. I suppose this statement referred to the proposed Investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. Well. whatever may be said of the Federal Trade Commission. it has conducted a number of notable investigations. It has laid the facts before Congress and the country. and. so far as I know. it has never been charged with partisanship or partiality. Oh. but the Senator from New Hampshire Is concerned about this investigation:. We need and must have an honest investigation by a congressional committee of the charges of gross waste. mismanagement. and possible corruption. Any other kind of investigation one would expect from a rubberstamp. machineled partisan but not from the very distinguished and able Senator from Nebraska. In other words. we would not expect that kind of an investigation from the Senator from Nebraska. but If we followed his plan. the inference of the Senator from New Hampshire was that would be the kind of investigation we would get. Rubberstamp. machineled partisan. It is refreshing. Mr. President. in this time of political passions. to find a really nonpartisan spirit like that of the Senator from New Hampshire. It is as refreshing as a breath of spring after the chill of winter. when the buds begin to burst and when the perfumed breezes of spring are wafted over the velvety greensward. It is very refreshing to have a breath of air like this from the Senator from New Hampshire. nonpartisan. impartial. one who believes in honesty in government. devoted to decency. His implication is. however. that he Is the only prophet crying in the wilderness in behalf of decency in office. He would have us believe we cannot trust the five members of the committee. that we cannot trust the Vice President of the United States. On March 9 the Senator from New Hampshire said: I have tried to be fair about this question and to answer the questions asked by my colleagues. I should like now to ask them to answer one.

More misinformation. unwittingly perhaps. has been broadcast about reclamation and its value as a national conservation policy than about any other one subject that concerns Congress or the Nation. This state of mind or thought is not confined to any one section but even in our own region of the West. where irrigation knits together States and communities. there is often a failure or inability to understand and appreciate what the expansion of a wellconsidered. financially sound program will do toward advancing the solution of our own problems but aid in stabilizing the economic welfare of the Nation. Irrigation or reclamation is not an experiment. The Quakers or Dutch of Pennsylvania. many of whom had come over from Holland. thought canals were necessary for farming In America as it had been In the old country. The early settlers of the West learned that conservation and distribution of meager water supplies were necessary and by 1860 more than $15.000.000 had been invested in irrigation enterprises. By 1900. 2 years before Congress enacted the reclamation law. individuals. firms. corporations. cooperative organizations. and a few public agencies had invested approximately a quarter of a billion dollars in irrigation enterprises."},{"1":"1936","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"I might say to the Senator that this part of my amendment was suggested by the proponents of this legislation. particularly by the Secretary of Agriculture.

I appear as counsel for the Cotton Textile Institute. On behalf of the institute and its entire membership representing one of the great basic industries of this country. employing in its affiliates more than 500.000 men and women. I desire to express appreciation to the Tariff Commission for its diligence and splendid cooperation in the preparation of the information necessary to act intelligently upon this provision of the National Recovery Act. Those of us who have been interested in this research from the beginning. last August. could not have made the progress that we have in the development of the facts except for the cooperation of this arm of the Government. I should like to say. Mr. Chairman and gentlemen. that the Cotton Textile Institute. with which members of the Cotton Rug Manufacturers Association are affiliated. has cooperated in every possible way from the beginning to make the National Recovery Act a success. It will be remembered that the President. In a national broadcast some 2 weeks before this bill was introduced. directed attention to the textile industry as having within it certain members whose business practices produced demoralized conditions. The President mentioned 10 percent of the textile group in this class. The Cotton Textile Institute commenced at that time. and prior to that time. to exert every power at its command to bring this great and diversified industry in the North and East and South and West into perfect agreement with the policy of the Government. This statement is borne out by the fact that the first code. code no. 1. is the Cotton Textile Code. That code today is in operation giving effect and purpose to the policy of the Government as efficiently as any other code that has been submitted. I think that General Johnson and the President would say to you that there has been in every stage of this movement complete cooperation on the part of the Cotton Textile Institute. I think that this picture ought to go into the record: In March 1933 there were employed In the cotton textile industry in America 320.000 men and women. and. I fear. perhaps some few children. In September 1933 the cotton textile industry had 446.000 operatives. an increase of 146.000 people from April 15 to September 1. an increase In employment of 45 percent over that period. No other industry in America can show such a record. but. more significant than this increased employment. which was one of the fundamental purposes of the National Recovery Act and spread of employment. is the fact that in March 1933 the total monthly salary paid to the textile workers. the 320.000 men and women. amounted to $12.800.000. In September of 1933 It amounted to $27.000.000. an increase in wages to this increased number of operatives of approximately 114 percent. Now. the Cotton Rug Manufacturers Association is included in that statement. But the significance of this application before this body and its merit is found in the fact that whereas. actually. the cotton textile industry had increased its employment in conformity to the purposes of this act and to give it effect had spread employment. and had Increased wages for that purpose. the cotton rug manufacturers. starting in September or August or July. have suffered a loss in employment. so that today there are approximately only 15 percent as many men and women employed In the manufacture of cotton rugs as there were in June and September. In other words. 85 percent of these men and women are out of employment. whereas the whole industry has shown this tremendous expansion. I respectfully submit that this condition Is directly attributable to Japanese competition. crushing competition. in cotton rugs. I happen. Mr. Chairman.. to know something about the early inception of this National Recovery Act. I served on the Industry Committee when this act was being prepared. When this act was prepared and submitted to Congress this section 3 was not In it. When it passed the House it was not in it. My recollection Is that it was put in when it went to the Senate. Now. why was it put in there? I think that this case presented is a case that is as clearly and manifestly in contemplation of the act of Congress as any case that could be presented. In this case we respectfully submit that an emergency exists. I think that this provision of this act. that is. section 3. conferring this power upon you as the agent of the President to make this inquiry. Is one of the finest and most efficient methods I of the administration to bring about the readjustment of Americas economic and social structure. without which we would be helpless. That is the reason Congress finally placed this provision in the statute. Let me read you section 3 of the act under which we ask relief: On his own motion. or if any labor organization. or any trade or industrial organization. association. or group. which has corn.plied with the provisions of this title. shall make complaint to the President that any article or articles are being imported into the United States in substantial quantities or increasing ratio to domestic production of any competitive article or articles and on such terms or under such conditions as to render ineffective or seriously to endanger the maintenance of any code or agreement under this title. the President may cause an immediate investigation to be made by the United States Tariff Commission. which shall give precedence to investigations under this subsection. and if. after such investigation and such public notice and hearing as he shall specify. the President shall find the existence of such facts. he shall. in order to effectuate the policy of this title. direct that the article or articles concerned shall be permitted entry into the United States only upon such terms and conditions and subject to the payment of such fees and to such limitations in the total quantity which may be imported (in the course of any specified period or periods) as he shall find it necessary to prescribe in order that the entry thereof shall not render or tend to render Ineffective any code or agreement made under this title. We know that when this act was being prepared the Secretary of State was on his way to the London Conference. where it was expected that tariff barriers and economic needs that had disturbed the relations of world commerce would be discussed. Yet. out of the rebirth of the Nation. it was found that the National Recovery Act had intervened. The language of the act is positive and direct. There is nothing ambiguous about it. When facts showand they show it In this casethat speed is of necessity. the President is authorized to make an Immediate investigation. and. if he shall find the existence of such facts. he shall. in order to effectuate the policy of this section. direct t~at the article or articles concerned shall be permitted entry into the United States only upon such terms and conditions and subject to the payment of such fees and subject to such limitations as he may prescribe in order that the entry thereof shall not render or tend to render ineffective any code or agreement under this title. That Is why we are here. I submit that the evidence presented by the Cotton Rug Manufacturers Association will not only tend to show. but will convince this group beyond the shadow of a doubt. that the American cottonrug industry is being ruined. literally ruined. by the flood of imports into this country. resulting in the paralysis of the members of this group. if not corrected by the arm of the Government that you set in motion. It is a significant thing. gentlemen. that under the increased operating costs of the National Recovery Act the cottontextile industry of America has practically lost its export trade. In 1932 the cottontextile industry exported about 7 to 7/2 percent of its total manufactured products. We have practically lost our foreign trade. and that is not unnatural because none of the foreign competitors of the American cotton industry are under a code or anything like the restrictions and the humane and social policies that characterize the American plan under the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Philippines is a particularly favored section under the arm and protection of the United States. Yet we have lostpractically losttheir trade to the Japanese. The Japanese are landing goods there every day. because they can pay the tariff and still occupy the market. The same is true of Cuba. We have no trade in Cubapractically nonein cotton textiles. Even in Puerto Rico we are suffering great disadvantages. and our exports have practically passed out. Unless relief of some sort is granted. we are going to be confronted in this country with trying to operate a great industry whose products will have to find a market only with the American consumer. Of course. our condition Is nothing like the condition of England. where 70 percent of their products are exported. nor is it like the condition of Japan. where a large percentage of her cotton goods are exported. While we have only 7 percent. that 7 percent represents $115.000.000. and It represents the employment of around 50.000 people. As the export business dries up. that 7 percent necessarily has to come back into domestic business and becomes a competitor with the 93 percent engaged in the manufacture of American goods. Mr. Chairman. we are going to present only two or three witnesses. We are taking notice of the fact that this branch of the Government exercises its power to perform its duty. We realize that you have not heard either yesterday or today a scintilla of evidence from the witness stand that is not already in your possession. Speaking for the Cotton Textile Institute. I would be perfectly content to permit this group to make its recommendation to the President without the introduction of a particle of evidence. because of the confidence we have in the fairness and diligence and research of this Commission. I think we are in a public hearing because the statute requires it. and we are here to bring just as much light and information as we think will tend to clarify the record and to satisfy your judgment. The first witness to be called in this case is Mr. Roy Cleeland. of Philadelphia. Mr. Cleeland has been working now for 5 months in the preparation of the record and in the study of the history of the cottonrug industry and the inroads that have been made constantly and Increasingly ruinous to its condition in American industrial life. He has performed a service for the industry and for the country which I think is very patriotic and unselfish. Mr. Cleeland is the president of the Cotton Rug Manufacturers Association. and is familiar with every phase of the industry. He is also president of the Robert Cleeland Sons. of Philadelphia. He understands the whole science of manufacture. He knows particularly about rag rugs and Chenille rugs. and in his particular function encompasses the whole industry. I ask Mr. Cleeland to come around as the first witness."},{"1":"1933","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I ought to leave the gentleman extend his remarks. but I do not agree with the gentleman at all. because it is not the tariff rates that are closing up the factories. It is the fact that 25centsperdaylaborproduced goods in foreign countries with very cheap raw products used in those plants are coming into America in very large quantities. How can American manufacturers pay high taxes. keep up the American standard of wages. and pay high prices for raw products. and sell in competition with goods produced in oriental countries with a labor cost of 25 cents per day and European countries at 50 cents to 75 cents per day? It can not be done. and the gentleman well knows it. not even with reference to the wool of Angora goats raised down in the gentlemans State of Texas. If the HawleySmoot tariff bill has caused all the ills of the world. as the gentleman indicates. then why has not the House controlled by the gentlemans party for almost two years reduced one tariff rate?

It will probably be reported by the time we get through with the military affairs appropriation bill. So the program I am outlining will go right on. Immediately. when my colleague gets the prohibition bill up. some oneperhaps the Senator from Washington or some other member of the Appropriations Committee in charge of the State Department appropriation billwill move to take it up. Then the controversy comes up again. and Senators say to my colleagues. That will be nothing. Just as soon as we get this appropriation bill through you make a motion to take your bill up. and we will give you our support and our votes. He does that again. they discuss the appropriation bill a couple of days. and that is passed on. Then my colleague again makes a motion to take up the prohibition bill. and the Senate. true to its promise. takes it up. has it before the Senate. just gets started on it. when along comes another appropriation bill. This time probably it will be the independent offices bill. A motion will be made to take that up. the same argument prevails. the same rule is followed. it is taken up. the prohibition bill is displaced the third time under a promise that just as soon as we get through with that we will all help my colleague to get his bill up again. We get through with the independent offices appropriation bill. and then my colleague moves to take up the prohibition bill. True to the promise. Senators come to my colleagues rescue and take up his bill. it is laid before the Senate. and he just gets fairly started when along comes the District of Columbia appropriation bill. Some one makes a motion to take that up. and we lay aside the prohibition bill for the fourth time. and as soon as we get through with the District of Columbia appropriation bill. which consumes a few more days. and they get that out of the way. he makes the motion again to take up the prohibition bill. and we all back him heroically. according to our promise and agreement. and get it up. he gets just barely started with it. when along comes the legislative appropriation bill. The prohibition bill will have been laid aside four times. and we lay it aside on another motion the fifth time and take up the legislative appropriation bill. That runs along a couple of days. until the latter part of next week. perhaps. when we get through with it. when again comes forward a motion to take up the prohibition bill. Again we all loyally put our shoulders to the wheel and get it up. and just get it up. when along comes the Navy Department appropriation bill. A motion is made for the sixth time to lay the prohibition bill aside. the motion prevails. and we consider the naval appropriation bill for several days. That is disposed of. and then comes my colleague again and makes his motion to take up the prohibition bill. Again the loyal soldiers get behind him and we take it up. but he does not get started with an argument in favor of it before along comes the second deficiency appropriation bill. Another motion is made. and for the eighth time the prohibition bill is laid aside. By that time the 4th of March is staring us in the face. Before that time comes. a conference report on the agricultural appropriation bill will be brought up. the prohibition bill will be laid aside for the ninth time. and the conference report taken up and disposed of. Then we get behind my colleague again and take his bill up again. when along comes the conference report on the first deficiency appropriation bill. We lay the prohibition bill aside again. for the eleventh time. Then the War Department appropriation bill conference report is brought up. then the conference report on the State. Justice. Commerce. and Labor appropriation bill. and before we get through we will have taken up the prohibition bill a.out twentyfive times and laid it aside the same number of times. I am not complaining of that. perhaps it ought to be done. I am not finding fault with those who think it ought to be done. but we must not close our eyes to the fact that it means that we will not pass this prohibition bill at this session."},{"1":"1930","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I desire to submit my views in favor of legislation to provide a pension for the indigent aged. This question of caring for the rapidly growing number of needy aged persons in the United States has become acute. and in my opinion the time is not far distant when the Congress will be faced by a compelling necessity to enact such legislation. This problemt has arisen from many cumulative causes. and has been growing in importance throughout the last 20 years. with marked acceleration in the last 10 years. Tie question now is not whether we should have a system of oldage pensions. but what sort of legislation will be constitutional. what sort of an organization and system for determiniug the ampunt of pension to be allowed in each individual case. what the method of raising tite money shall be. and what sort of an organization shall be created by Congress for adtninistering tie law. We Americans like to boast that we are generous. We also like to remember that we are what we arethe richest Nation on the globe. Welike to point to our postwar relief for the starving millions of Europe. our quick response to foreign famine funds. our philanthropies and benefactions. which are much larger than those of other nations. But much of our giving still is of the old personal charity type and too little is of the organized social relief type. We dislike to face the fact the we. the richest Nation o the globe. in spite of our boasted hunmanitarianism. are the only industrial nation in the world which has made no national provision for the relief of its indigent aged. Nations which many of us consider to be backward have gone ahead quietly about the business of providing for their needy aged while we have been busy in the more spectacular pursuit of creating great fortunes for the few. Nearly every other civilized country on the globe has some system for caring for its aged dependents. yet we have none. Although this problem now is acute. it will be necessary to conduct a long and careful study of all the factors contributing to the causes of indigent old age in America. and for the system of pensioning. and the most effective method of administering relief. before final legislation can be enacted. First. we must anualyze the causes for the rapidly growing number of needy aged in this country. As has been pointed out before your committee during the hearings by the representatives of the American Association for Old Age Security and other expert witnesses. the situation in this country not only is more serious than in any other country but the necessity for legislative relief is becoming more imiperative year by year. There are many contributing causes for this condition. But since it is my purpose to indicate my sentiments with regard to the principle. rather than to undertake an analysis of the causes making this legislation necessary. since analysis can be better handled by experts who have made long studies of these questions than is possible for a Member of Congress to do. I shall discuss only some of the most obvious reasons which appeal to me as indicating the necessity for the earliest possible legislation on this questiofi. Three prime causes have arisen under our modern civilization to produce this problem of indigent aged. The one is the technological cause. The tremendous advances and discoveries made by science and applied to the increase of efficiency in industrial production in this country have brought about a condition in industry under which by the aid of machines the tasks formerly requiring mnany individuals to perform now are accomplished by a few individuals with greatly increased production. Il other words. one man operating a modern machine today does the work which a dozen or even a hundred men were formerly required to accomplish. This has brought about a problem of unemployment which I regard as permanent. The element of the survival of the fittest enters into industrial work to such an extent that in the natural course of events the elderly workers are crowded out by the more youthful. JuTy 3 The operation of this vast and complicated machinery demands the physical agility. the mental alertness. and the physical stamina to withstand long periods of strain which are not possessed by elderly individuals. This naturally results in the gradual shelving of the man or woman beyond the age of 45. because industry and commerce are unable to assimilate those past middle age thus displaced in their regular lines of.work. The modern educational system has also resulted in turning out each year many thousands of young men and women thoroughly trained in colleges or technical institutions for responsibilities and duties which formerly could be discharged only by those who had learned their jobs by long years of experience. The graduates of these colleges and technical institutions are being turned out into the industrial and commercial world as thoroughly trained workers at an age at which a few years ago the hndividual was just completing his or her apprenticeship. This all may be expressed in the statement that the age average of experts and executives In all lines of human endeavor is rapidly being lowered. Here again we have a condition under which the displaced elderly workers have no avenue left through which to find a comfortable income through their own mental or physical exertions. The fact may just as well be faced that in this country the percentage of persons beyond the age of 45 engaged in industrial and commercial pursuits Is constantly shrinking. while the per cent of persons beyond the age of 45 who are suffering from the pangs of poverty and who are unable to find any place in the economic scheme of things Is increasing in the same rapid ratio. Another great cause of this problem is the fact that in America we have by every method possible encouraged our people to live beyond their means. to mortgage their future through installment buying and to indulge themselves in the costly and complicated business of modern luxuryloving living with the result that as the individual finds himself displaced in the work of industry and commerce. he is also overtaken by the sad results of having lived up his income day by day. Whether this condition is the fault of the Government. of the State. of industry. of commerce. or of the individual. or whether it is a combination of causes. is now beside the point. The great facts are that we have this problem. that it is intense. that it is growing greater year by year. that it cau not be handled by the organized municipal charities. that it can not lie handled by the State. and. finally. that it is now the problem of the National Government. The whole question is so fraught with problems so difficult of solution that it seems at times to one studying the situation wellnigh hopeless of practical solution. It is so obvious that the studies of these problems will necessarily cover such an extended period of time before actual legislation may he made effective that it seems to be imperative that we adopt such measures as are necessary to begin a comprehensive survey of the problem with a view to as quickly as may be possible working out this relief legislation. Another contributing factor is the increased longevity which has been accomplished through medical science. While it is true that the diseases of old age. such as arteriosclerosis. heart disease. and other organic and usually fatal diseases incident to advanced age have not Ieen aplreciably reduced by medical skill and study. still remains the fact that former fatal diseases of infancy and early youth have been so conquered by modern medical science as to vastly increase the number of those who live to reach an age beyond 45 years. In conclusion. then. I desire to urge such measures as may be necessary to facilitate a study of the problems surrounding this question and the enactment of adequate legislation to meet this great and pathetic need of our indigent aged in the United States."},{"1":"1929","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. on Thursday. the 20th of this month. a distinguished and much beloved Member of this body will celebrate his eightyfifth birthday. and I know that every MemberDemocrat. Republican. and FarmerLaboritewill rejoice and join me in wishing for the able senior Senator from Wyoming many. many happy returns of the day. Senator WARREN has had a notable career. He was born in Massachusetts. and. when he was 18 years old. enlisted in the Union Army. and thereafter had a distinguished military service. He was given the congressional medal of honor for gallantry in action at Port Hudson. Shortly after the war he moved to Wyoming. and no man has ever taken a more active part in the affairs of any State than Senator WARREN has since that time taken in the affairs of Wyoming. From time to time he was a member of both houses of the Territorial and State legislatures. mayor of the city of Cheyenne. he was appointed Territorial Governor of Wyoming by President Arthur. and afterwards reappointed by President Harrison. When the State was admitted into the Union be became the first governor of the State by vote of the people. He was then elected to the United States Senate. on November 18. 1890. and with the exception of two years. when there was a deadlock in the legislature and no one was elected. Senator WARREN has been Senator from that State ever since. This birthday of Senator WARREN brings to mind his long service. Senator WARREN has served in the Senate of the United States longer than any other man who was ever a Member of this body. On the 20th of this month he will have served 36 years 6 months 28 days. linger by more than a year than anyone else who has ever serves. Next to Senator WARREN in length of service was William B. Allison. of Iowa. who served 35 years and 5 months. Only 11 Senators. all told. have ever served as long as 30 years. It will be interesting. I am sure. to know who these are: FRANCIS E. WARREN. of Wyoming. 36 years 6 months 28 days. William B. Allison. Iowa. 35 years 5 months. Justin S. Morrill. Vermont. 31 years 9 months 24 days. Henry Cabot Lodge. Massachusetts. 31 years 8 months 5 days. John Sherman. Ohio. 31 years 7 months. William P. Frye. Maine. 30 years 4 months 20 days. John T. Morgan. Alabama. 30 years 3 months 7 days. Shelby M. Cullom. Illinois. 30 years. Eugene Hale. Maine. 30 years. Francis M. Cockrell. Missouri. 30 years. John P. Jones. Nevada. 30 years. Mr. President. these 11 Senators of longest service In this body have written their names large upan their countrys history. All 11 of them were wonderful men. Their names are household words throughout the country. They are familiarly known by all students of American history. Their long services show the esteem in which they were held by their fellow citizens in their several States. Perhaps none of these. Mr. President. has accomplished more for his State and Nation than has Senator WARRgN. From the day he arrived as a new Senator he has taken a most active and effective and conspicuous place in the affairs of the Senate. His splendid physique. his strong physical constitution. his handsome appearance. have stood him in good stead. His honesty. his ability. and his patriotism are traits of character deeply admired by all his colleagues. There perhaps never was a more indefatigable worker in the Senate than Senator WARREN has been and still is. When the Republicans returned to power in 1921 he became the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. When we recall that that committee has appropriated each year an average of something like $5.000.000.000. and that the chairman of that committee must know where that money goes. what it is used for. and every detail concerning it. it can be understood what a vast amount of work Senator WARREN has done in the last eight years. In other words. he has looked after the expenditure of something like $40.000.000.000 in eight years. and those years between his seventyseventh and his eightyfifth. Not being a member of Senator WARRENs own party and being an unswerving and fighting Democrat. and not believing in many of the things Senator WARREN believes in. it is easily understood that on the Appropriations Committee. of which I am also a member. we have had many differences. and vigorous differences. We have sometimes actively and vigorously opposed each other on the floor of the Senate also. but through it all. and in it all. I want to say. that Senator WARREN has had at all times my most profound admiration and respect and my warm appreciatioo of his many great qualities. I regard him as one of the great men of our country. I esteem him highly as a man. as an honorable. upright. and courageous mana man Who believes in the right and who is willing to fight for the right as he sees it. Figuratively. I take off my hat to him. I make my bow in admiration of him. I congratulate him on his clean and splendid life. I congratulate him on his wonderful work for his State and his country. and I wish for him many. many years of strength and health. to the end that he may continue to serve the people of the country in the future in the same splendid fashion that he has served it in the past. (As Mr. WARREN rose to his feet. the Senate as a body rose and applauded him.)"},{"1":"1928","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I rise in opposition to the amendment. If this amendment is adopted. it takes the very heart out of the bill. Every Muscle Shoals bill which has been before Congress and passed either House of Congress has provided for the manufacture of fertilizer. That means a complete fertilizer. Now. this amendment of the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. ATCMtLLAN.J proposes to strike out the word fertilizer  and insert in lieu thereof  fixed nitrogen. We have promised the farmers all along that fertilizer would be made at Muscle Shoals when the plant was put into operation. Now. when this and other amen(dmenits offered by the gentleman from South Carolina provided for in this bill will be ]imited to the production of fixed nitrogen I believe that we should keel) faith with the farmers and provide in this bill for the making by the Government of a complete concentrated fertilizer at Muscle Shoals. We have been insisting and demanding all along that this be done. but now it seems that the fertilizer lobby has induced a sufficient number of Congressmen to vote to limit the production of the Government to fixed nitrogen and not allow the making of a complete fertilizer. as is provided in the Morin bill as reported by tile Committee on Militaly Affairs. Those who are opposing tie making of a complete fertilizer by the Government on the ground liat it would be Government operation in competition with private capital and industries engaged in the manufacture of fertilizer in this country nre mistaken. It means that the Govermnent is going into its own business. the operation of its own plant for the benefit of its own people and in competition with foreign capital. the Chilean nitrate monopoly. with headquarters in London. [Applause. I We have met in this historic House this afternoon to vote ol and decide one of the most important issues which has been before Congress in many years. We are acting in the capacity of a jury to decide an issue made up between the strong and the weak. On one side is the great foreign monopoly. the Chilean corporation. the power molopoly. and the Fertilizer Trust. Oil the other side are those engaged in agriculture. the tillers of the soil. who earn their bread by the sweat of the brow. We have heard much talk recently about the Government going into btsiness in competition with private industry. It has been overworked. This bill does not mean the Government going into competition with private industry. it simply means that the Government is going to carry on its own business for the benefit of its own people. If it means competition with any interest. it is with foreign interest. anid not only foreign interest bu a great foreign trust and monopoly. one which has bled the tillers of the soil for more than 40 years to the extent of at least $11.000.000 per year. Our soil is being depleted and must be replenished with nitrogen. It is said by those who should know that there are 21.000.000 tons of nitrogen over every square mile. All other countries except Ours have been. and are. operating great airliiirogen plants for taking this essential plant food known as - nitrogen from the air and fixing it into a solid substance to be used by the farmers as a fertilizer. The fertilizer mixers do not produce nitrates. but buy it and the most of it is Chilean nitrate. and. as I have said heretofore. this forces tie American farmer to pay tribute to a foreign country to the amount of $11.000.000 per year. So the Morin bill means competition not only with foreign capital but a great foreign monopoly which not only controls the price of Chilean nitrate but nitrate in all other forms. The Congress in 191.6. realizing its neglect of agriculture by providing for such plants. authorized and appropriated the money with which to construct such a plant. and it was thought then that it would be in operation in a very short time. but the selfish monopolistic interests of the power and fertilizer coinbinations have up to this hour defeated the will of the people. and we have continued to permit this great fertilizer octopus to furnish the American farmer with this highpriced inferior grade of fertilizer for which lie pays tribute to a foreign Governient to the extent of at least $11.OCO.000 per annulm. tid freight rates over more thai 6.000 miles for a socalled fertilizer containing 85 per cent dirt and 15 l)er cent nitrogen. After eight years of continuous labor and effort on the part of our committee to which this subject was assigned they have brought to us by an almost unanimous report a bill carrying out the law of 1916. and one -that will protect the farmers against the further imposition of this unreasonable and unjust fertilizer system. The committee has heard the evidence. had it reduced to writing containing several volumes of printed matter. The committee has also filed its report and has aldvised us as to what they thought should be done. So the issue has been made up and the evidence introduced. and it becomes our duty to render within the next few minutes a verdict involving the best interest and welfare of those wilo till the soil and feed and clothe the Nation. May wve be given the wisdom and the courage to decide this issue between the strong and the weak in such a way and such a manner as to do justice to all. Ours is the greatest country on the globe. Our people have demionstrated that we are the greatest Nation of people in existence. Our form of Government is unequalled by any other in the galaxy of notions. May we be able to resist the arguments of the lobby representing the pernicious trusts and monopolies and hear the appeal of the men and women on the farms crying out for farm relief. and who are not able to come here nor send a lobby. Some of the representatives they sent here to protect their interests have joined the ranks of the lobby opposing their best interest. They iust look to us and to us alone to protect their interest. Shall we produce our own nitrates by taking it iroi tie air at tile Governients airnitrogen Ilant at Muscle Shoals or continue to buy it in tle form of Chilean nitrate? As I have said heretofore. the war airnitrogen plants in Germany are being operated for fertilizer purposes and the German farmers no longer pay tribute to the Chilean nitrate monopoly. but on the other hand Germany has become a large exporter of fertilizer and some of it is being imported into this country. Shall we continue to pay tribute to this foreign monopoly or shall our Govenmnent operate its plant at Muscle Shoals and save the farmers many. many millions of dollars? That is fhe issue to be settled at this time.. I siall be greatly disappointed if this bill is amended in such a wly that tile Government corporation provided tor in the Morin bill will not be authorized to make a complete highly concentrated fertilizer. This is what I have stood for all along. so I appeal to you to vote down this and all other amendinelits which will prohibit the Government from making a complete highgrade fertilizer that call be sold to the farmers at a very nmuch lower price than they are now paying. However. if it is clanged I will have the satisfaction of knowing that I have done the best that I could to secure for the farmlerS of the country the very best and cheapest fertilizer possible. Some members of the House seem to have changed their views ill regard to tie bill since the arrival of the fertilizer lobby. but I shall stand firm in tile interest of the farmers I have the hmonlor to represent. I would not be disloyal and unfaithftul to tile people who have honored and trusted me for all the gold and silver and ranches of Albert Fall."},{"1":"1927","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker.

LA FOLLETTE sang the hymn of the conquered who fell in the battle of life. His tears were for the wounded and beaten who died overwhelmed in the strife. The jubilant song of the victor was not music to his ear. The resounding acclaim of nations lifted in chorus for an oppressor of mankind thrilled not that greatheart. The chaplit of fame on the brow of the unworthy was to him as withered leaves. His voice was ever heard in bugle blast and clarion tone for the low and humble. the weary. the broken in heart. His sobs were for those Who strove and who failed acting bravely a silent and desperate part in the tragedy of human existence. His pitying gaze was ever bent on those whose youth bore no flower in its branches. Instinctively his sympathetic mid leapt to the consolation of those sufferers whose hopes burned in ashes away. and his great. heart shook with grief at the woe of those who stood at the dying. of the day. at the end of the long and lonely trail with the work of their life all around them unheeded. alone. with death sweeping down oi their failures and all but their faith in Gods infinite mercy and wisdom overthrown. He never joined in the tumultuous shout of the world for those who had won the worldly victory. While the trumpet was sounding triumphant and high to the breeze and the sun. gay banners were waving. hands clapping. and hurrying feet thronging after the laurelcrowned victor. ROBERT M. LA FOLLETTE stood oil the field of defeat with those who were wounded and dying. Chanting a requiem low. lie placed his hand on the painknotted brows. held the heads that were helpless. and whisperedThey never fall who die in a great cause. The block may soak their gore. their beads may sodden In the silo. Their limbs be stretched to city gates and castle walls. But still their spirits walk abroad. Years may elapse and others share as dark a doom. They but augment the deep and swelling thought That overwhelms all others And leads the world at last to perfect freedom. Through time and over space in soul inspiring language his magic tones will carry hope to the children of all men. He has urged them to teach the generations to come to fight for truth which will blaze the* way for a larger and finer liberty and freedom. Ye shall know the truth. and the truth shall make you free. was to him what Carthago Delendaest was to Cato. But his was a battle cry for humanity and that of the Roman a slogan for blood and tears. His wonderful words will yet reach every heart throughout our broad land. that they only the victory win who have fought the good fight and vanquished the denmns that tempt us within. His prayer for those who have held to their faith unseduced by the prize which the world holds on high will yet be on many tongues. and the lips of children wfil sing them as a sweet song of an everlasting hope. In the flllness of time history will write in enduring letters. large and luminous. so that they might be beheld from afar. the name of ROBERT M. LA FOLLETTE. We weep. He is no more."},{"1":"1926","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman and menibersof the committee. the poet. Montgomery. expressed a beautiful sentiment in the lines: Ils home. a spot on earth supremely blest. A dearer. sweeter spot than all the rest. The importance of the home to the welfare of any nation. in fact to the very life of a nation. is so well understood as to require no discussion. The more universal is the home instinct of the people of any country. the higher is Its standard of morals. Although. without owning a house. one may establish a home. nevertheless the ownership of the place which one regards as home develops a feeling of selfconfidence and selfrespect which can be gained from almost no other experience in life. It would seem. therefore. to be admitted that whatever may be done to encourage the ownership of homes by our people will improve the standards of American life. Heretofore. however. it hasbeen almost impossible. or possible only by the most extreme sacrifices. for those depending on their meager earnings to procure for themselves houses in which to establish homes. Even if by the greatest economy they are able to save a little money for the purpose. they are always comlelled to borrow a large part of the money necessary to purchase a house. The high rate of interest which must be paid for the use of the money and the cost of procuring the loan add greatly to the burden of the person striving to have a home of his own. Knowing how hard it is for the ordinary man to borrow money. it is a common thing for the banker to insist upon a grossly unreasonable profit from those who must have a loan. It is true that in every State of the Union laws have been passed prohibiting those lending money from charging more than a certain rate of interest. In Ohio. for example. if no specific agreement is made about the rate of interest which is to be paid to the lender for the use of money. the law allows him 6 per cent. The nmneylender may expressly provide in the agreement for the payment of interest at the rate of not more than 8 per cent. and that is the highest rate of interest which the law of Ohio permits anyone to charge for the use of money. For many years. however. the professional money lender has succeeded in evading the law which prohibits the collection of interest in excess of 8 per cent. He accomplishes his purpose by charging what lie calls a bonus for getting the loan for the person desiring to borrow money. At the beginning of this practice the professional money lender. who is generally a banker. would explain to the person asking to borrow money that the bank had refused the loan. but that he might be able to get the loan somewhere else if the person desiring to borrow the money would pay him for his services. Almost always. of course. the applicant for the loan would agree to pay the amount named for the services. The amount charged by the lender would be from 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the amount of the loan. If the lender thought that the borrower. rather than pay more than 10 per cent bonus. would do without the money or go somewhere else for it. his charge for his services would be 10 per cent. or even a little less. but if the borrower was compelled to have the money the lender charged him often as much as 30 per cent for getting him the loan. Now. as a matter of fact. the loan was actually made by the banker himself. and he merely had the note and mortgage made to someone else and then assigned to the real lender by the person to whom the note and mortgage had been made in order to evade the law prohibiting him from charging an excessive rate of interest. The practice has now become so common. however. that the professional money lender does not take the trouble to explain to the borrower that he is charging him a commission ranging from 10 per cent to 30 per cent for his services in getting the borrower the money. The borrower of the present day is bluntly told that the interest on his loan will be so much and that the bonus will be so much. The result of all this is that the person struggling to buy a house to be used as a residence invests il his house. when all is said and done. only part of the money which he borrows. If it becomes necessary for him to sell his house. he must generally lose at least the amount of the bonus. for that amount is not paid for material or labor for the house. As already explained. the payment of the bonus has the effect also of increasing the rate of interest paid by the person on the money actually borrowed and invested in the house. If. for example. a man should borrow $1.000 and be charged 20 per cent bonus. he would receive only $800 which would actually be used for the purchase or construction of the house. If the note for $1.000 should provide for 8 per cent interest. which is the highest rate that the law permits. then he would pay $80 per year interest on the note. Since. however. he would receive in cash only $800. that would mean that he would pay $80 per year for the use of $800. or. in other words. he would pay 10 per cent to the money lender. or 2 per cent more than the law permits him to charge. Not only would the borrower be compelled to pay the 2 per cent in excess of the lawful rate. but he would also pay the 15 or 20 per cent or even 30 per cent bonus. which represents no value in his house. It would seem that all rightthinking people should be opposed to this practice and that something should be done to stop it. In recent years the building and loan companies have been a real help to the people. They have enabled many persons to get homes who could not manage to get them otherwise. With the building and loan companies which have been doing business fairly and according to law there is no complaint. Some method should be adopted by the Government. however. to prevent the greedy money lender from evading the law by charging most excessive interest and thereby discouraging the praiseworthy efforts of the people to own their own homes. Some time ago I introduced H. R. 5581. entitled: A bill to provide capital at reasonable rates of interest In order to promote the establishment and ownership of homes by the people of the United States. This bill follows the plan of the farm loan act. That plan was adopted for two reasons: First. because it overcomes the objections of those timid people who. before supporting a ineasure. must always know that the same thing has been done before. either here or somewhere else . second. because the farm loan act itself has been a great success and has helped the farmers greatly. I was told a few days ago by a prominent citizen of Nebraska that not only had the farm loan act made it possible for farmers to procure loans on reasonable terms. but that the act had resulted in the reduction of the interest rate charged by the privately owned banks of the State. When the private banks found that the farmloan banks were lending money to farmers on reasonable terms. they were compelled to lower their rate of interest in order to get any business. No one would now propose to abolish the farmloan banks. and even a suggestion that we should abolish them would be met by a storm of protest. There are 6.500.000 farms in the United States. but there are more than 24.000.000 families not living on farms. and these 24.000.000 families require homes. I am glad that the Congress passed the farm loan act which so greatly helps the farmers of the country to borrow money conveniently and at a reasonable rate of interest. but I insist that the families not living on farsms should be given the same kind of help to enable them to establish homes. I do.not propose in the bill which I have introduced to give the home builder something for nothing. I do claim. however. that the Government should do everything possible to make sure that the people of this land. who are earnestly striving to establish homes. should get real value for the money which they spend for that purpose. To insist upon this is not to propose charity for anyone. I claim that it is necessary for the welfare and strength of the Nation itself. One writer has said: The strength of a nation. especially a repnblic. is in the intelligent and wellordered homes of the people. That statement is true. No good reason can be given why this measure should not be passed promptly. It is no reason at all to say that it Is in advance of the time. .That same argument has been made against every proposal to enact laws for the purpose of abolishing different forums of injustice. Regardless of how Members feel about this question. at the present moment. it is absolutely certain that before long a law of this kind will be passed. Why then delay? Let us take action at once. and thereby render to the American people a service of great value."},{"1":"1925","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. under the provisions of the bill as reported by the committee there are about 84.000 reserve officers. and of that number there are being trained about 14.000. Under ill of the testimony given to the committee by. the Secretary of War and the Chief of Staff. and as is generally known among military men. there ought to be a larger number trained. at least onethird. The Secretary of War in one of his statements said: I have repeatedly recommended increases in reserve training to the extent that at least onethird of our reserve officers should be trained each year. and I feel that an increase in the training over that now available for reserves is absolutely necessary to maintain popular interest and maintain efficiency in the reserve project. That was concurred in by the present Chief of Staff. General Hines. who stated very recently. to be exact. on October 27. 192.3. when this same problem was before the Congress: Training is. therefore. a most important problem. It is a continuing problem and one whose successful solution offers considerable difficulties. A satisfactory solution could not be hoped for if reserve officers were unable or unwilling to devote time to this work while on an Inactiveduty status. He then states that these reserve officers are willing to give time for training. and we all know that they are giving time. which means to them money. The President of the United States is on record as favoring the reserves in a letter of October 23. 1924. to the president of the Officers Reserve Association. in which he states: Your association is interested in the defense ot the United States. and you display that interest by giving of your time. labor. and attention in the manner deemed best by the National Government. In so doing you furnish an example of the cooperation between the leaders of our professional Army and the citizen leaders of the country. which Is really the backbone of our present defensive policy. The continuance of your labors along the lines upon which you are now engaged will do more than any other one thing to insure for our country that complete immunity from external aggression which is an indispensable prerequisite to the fulfillment of our national destiny. The amendment which I have offered. Mr. Chairman. and which. if it is passed. it will be necessary to supplement by two other amendments. will provide for the training of 18.000 men instead of 14.000 men. If the three amendments were adopted. it would add to the appropriation $802.184. To my mind. if you do not make these appropriations the reserve officers who are giving more than any other class of men to the national defense with less pay will lose their interest. because if you can not give these men some training at least once in three years you can not maintain their interest. I know that the Members of this Congress who have gond to these training camps are familiar with the course of training that is given and the work that is being done. as are the former service men of the House. The latter support the amendments without any personal feeling or prejudice. because most of us do not belong to the reserves. for the simple reason that there might be some question in our minds as to whether or not under the Constitution we could be members. That question has never been satisfactorily adjudicated. Those of us who have felt that these men ought to be trained oftener than once in three years are notmembers of the reserve. and we present this proposition to the Congress in order to carry out what we deem to be the intent and the provisions of the national defense act of 1920."},{"1":"1924","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. the employees of the Government Printing Office should have tlie sincire sympathy of the Members of Congres. They are the only crowd tlht have not had a raise. except the Members of Congress. all through the period of the war. except that they have had a bonus. but that is about to cease on the 1st of July. and it is necessary to determine their base pay and make an arrangement whereby a graduation can be fixed so that each man will be paid according to the merits of his particular class. I call attention to the fact that 90 ceits an hour is a minimum wage. In other words. all of them are to get 90 cents an hour. and then those grades where the character of the work requires an amount of skill vhtich necessitates a higher wage. they are to get an additional wage. adjusted by a conference between them and the Public Printer. And you will notice that the terms of the bill allow them to select their own committee to represent them in that conference. There was first a proposition that the printers and the bodies of the crafts desiring a raise had to have a committee of their own members. who must be employees of the Public Printer. We struck that out. They can go outside and have a committee of their own. independent of the man who employs them. to deal with that employer and fix the proper wage for Lhe work which they do. If they fail to agree. then the whole miat.lr cones to the Joint Committee on Printing. consisting of three Senators and three Members of the House. and that Joint Committee on Printing determines what finally it shall be. so that gentlemen should not get it in their heads that when we provide that the minimum pay shall be 90 cents an hour. everybody shall get only 90 cents.

Very seldom have I heard any of those advocating the adoption of this bill say one thing in regard to any debt of gratitude Great Britain owes to the United States. Their line of argument throughout seems to be that we owe a great debt to Great Britain. that we did not do our duty during the war. that we did not assist them sufficiently during the war. and that now we must forgive them a billion eight hundred million dollars of the indebtedness they incurred for loans obtained from us. Well do I recall when the British mission came here appealing for assistance and appealing to the American Congress and to the Chief Executive of this Nation for financial aid and for aid In men to go to the front to save them from the disaster that was Impending. I dare say that at the time Great Britain borrowed this money from this Government they felt they were etting a great accommodation from the American Congress. hey felt that. in justice. they should pay the interest which had to be borne by the American people for the money which was being loaned to them. Had it been heralded throughout the United States. when we were floating our Liberty bonds. that we were giving 4* per cent on those Liberty bonds for a loan to Great Britain. contemplat.Ing that three or four years after the war we would reduce the rate of interest to Great Britain to 8 per cent. although the Amerlcan people had to continue to pay the 41 per cent. I dare .say there would not have been such enthusiasm and such response to the calls of the American Government for our people to purchase Liberty bonds. The people of this Nation naturally thought. when they were providing those funds. that America was carrying its part of the expenses of the warand it was. and nobly sothat Great Britain would return to this Nation the money she was borrowIng. and that she would at least pay the rate of interest which the American Government Was required to pay for the loans. This proposition. leaving off all of the frills. involves the proposition of the American people having the debt for interest shifted from Great Britain and placed upon them. to the extent of the difference between 3 and 4* per cent. America was generous with Great Britain throughout the war. rendered every assistance she could. and I think properly so. and she has been generous since the war. We proposed to allow them until 1922 to make an adjustment. we proposed to give them a long time in which to pay the bonds. and then to say that we will shift the burden from the British people to the American people of paying the interest upon the funds which we loaned them I think is asking a little too much generosity. more generosity than should be expected of the American people. Many Senators here have talked about what would have happened to our boys If the British had not secured the loan and carried on the war as vigorously as they. did. What woul4 have happened? But what would have happened to Greal Britain had America not loaned them the money? What would have happened to her had we not sent our forces to the front? Where would Great Britain have been?. Whatever I say upon the subject I say with no unfriendly spirit to Great Britain. I feel very friendly to that nation. Some talk about unfriendly spirit and the pound of flesh. We do not want to exact the pound of flesh from Great Britain. nor do we want the pound of flesh extracted from the American people. I can not see why. in justice. this debt should not be paid by Great Britain. and in my opinion It is an Injustice to shift the obligation fot the payment of the interest upon the debt to the American people to the extent of $57.000.000 the first year. and throughout the life of this contract to the extent. as suggested here. of $1.800.000.000 in principaland In effect. if we cancel a part of our Interest it is the same as canceling a part of our debt. I dare say that Great Britain Would just as soon have us say we cancel $1.000.000.000 of the indebtedness and maintain our Interest rate. What difference does it make! But Instead of that the rate has been reduced. We should not charge the British Government any greater rate of Interest than we have to pay upon these funds. but. on the other hand. in my opinion we should not require the American people to contribute the difference between 3 and 41 per cent. the latter being the rate we are required to pay on this indebtedness. Of course. some Senators say that it Is not a question of taxation. and that it does not make any difference about this money one way or the other. If that is true- with regard to the interest. it must be true with regard to the principal. so why not cancel it all? You say the people will never get any benefit from this fund. Then why ask them to reimburse the Federal Treasury for money expended oi that account? The argument is unsound. As far as stabilizing conditions Is concerned. all favor that. but it is a matter of settling a debt in a just way. We all want to see an adjustment. but It should be settled and adjusted without requiring the American people to suffer this great loss. I feel that if there had been a little more vigor. a little more energy. a little more seeing the question from the American standpoint rather than seeing it from the British standpoint. we could have gotten a better contract for adjustment. I never saw anybody who set out to do a thing who could accomplish it if he said that he could not do Itin finance or in endeavor of any characterand when our commission set out and said they could not expect to get over 3J per cent. that we were paying 4J. but that Great Britain would not be able to pay that. although they obligated themselves to do it. we should not have expected them to accomplish anything. But the fact that our commission may not have exerted the energy and the eagerness in behalf of America which should have been exerted does not commit me to a policy of voting for a contract or for a bill which. in my opinion. does not represent a zealous conservation of American interests."},{"1":"1922","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. we have debated this bill now for an -entire week. and we have at last reached the point where we are to make a decision. The bill is important in the highest degree. both because. it directly relfatea to the national security. which must always be our first concern. and also beca1use it carries an appropriation ofnearly a quarter of a billion of dollars. It has been- asserted that the amounts carried in the bill are insufficient and that the number of men provided -will not. properly. man the ships wbich we are to ietain under the agreements reached at the Conference on Limitation of Armament. If I believed that this were. true .I \\\\youkd not.vote for the bill myself. The. amounts carried axe based entirely upon..the theory that they axe. adeqvate to meet .all the. requirements. of the treaty navy. I do not believe that the position ofthe committee as to this. has been. sliakeir.in the slightest degree during the entire week of debate. The propositions laid down at the beginning of the debate have not been successfully met. Tile most serious criticism of the work of the committee. apparently. has been that we were not willing to accept without challenge the. views of the Navy Department. particularly with regard to the size of the enlisted personnel necessary to operate a navy based upon the 553 ratio. I need not say in this connection that the coumlittee has at alltimes. been eager to obtain the viewpoint and the. opinion o. the. Navy Department. but we have been just as eager to ascertain the reasons as we. have been to learn their conclusions. An opinion. no matter from what source it may come. is of little value unless the reasons lying at the bottom of such opinion appeals to the judgment. I am frank to say that we have. not accepted statements and opinions without question. and I may say we have scrutinized every demand for money with more than usual severity. We believed that the conditions of business in the country and the state of the finances of the Government demanded such a course. We proceeded upon the theory that no person under the Government. high or low. was entitled to a single dollar for his department unless he could sit on the opposite side of the table and show with a reasonable degree of certainty where that dollar was to be spent and why it was necessary to spend. it. We assmned that you wanted us to pursue this course If we were to accept without question whatever. wa laid before us in the. form of demands for money. the labor of the committee might as well have been eliminated and the estimates brought directly to the House. We regarded ourselves as the agents of the House. to inquire. into. all time facts. and felt ourselves charged with the duty of making a most searching inquiry and examination into the needs of the Navy in the light of the Conference on the Linritation. of Armament before. bringing for your coiusideration this great bill. carrying more than $230.000.000. We have kept the faith to the very best of our ability. I will admit at the outset that the committee and the Navy Department have not always been in accord. and that we have not accepted in every instance the views of the advisers of the Navy Department. There is in the Navy the same difference of opinion with reference to naval matters as exists in the professions of medicine or the law as to legal and medical affairs. The committee did not. therefore. expect to find that every naval officer agreed with every other naval officer. If it were merely a matter of disagreement between two officers of equal rank and experience. the committee could choose between them or disregard either or both. But the thing that has disturbed the committee more than anything else has not been the varying opinions of different men but the widely differing statements of fact made by the same naval officer under exactly the same conditions and within a comparatively short period of time. The committee has been obliged to adopt a most searching attitude because of this fact. The military head of the Navy under the Secretary is the Chief of Naval Operations. The same officer who held that position a year ago holds it now. During the course of the hearings last year tile Chief of Naval Operations was asked to state to the committee of the House the number of capital ships and necessary auxiliaries which could be maintained in full commission with an enlisted force of 100.000 men. He put into the hearings a table on January 10. 1921. which appears on page 65 of last years hearings. In this tahlle it appears that he could keep in commission 17 battleships and the necessary auxiliaries with an enlisted force of 100.000 men. The bill passed the House carrying approximately $400.000.000. The Senate added approximately $100.000.000 more. During the consideration of the Senate increases this same officer testified before the Naval Affairs Conmlittee of the Senate. on the 18th of February. 1921. with the same bill under consideration and with no change in world conditions. that he could keep in commission only 15 battleships and necessary auxiliaries with 120.000 men. t the same time. and whiie before the same committee he put in another table showing that with 110.000 men he could keep in commission only 13 battleships. We gave him 106.000 men and lie has kept in commission IS battleships. [�Applause.] I am going to make a statement which I fear may sound somiewat harsh. but I believe that it should be said. No. executive department of the Governmeat should permit its officers to juggle with facts in the manner above stated. I do not believe that any officer ought to be continued as the military head of the Ainerican Navy who appears before two different committees of Congress within t month and makes such varying anti contradictory statements as a basis for increased appropriations. I have always been glad to be guided by the counsel of the officers of the Navy Department -whenever such counsel has been consistent and appeals to the judgment and can be defended in reason. The experience of our committee. however. last year made it necessary to adopt more searching methods of inquiry this year than heretofore in determining the requirements for the Navy. We did not believe that the House would be satisfied with the mere statement of the Chief of Naval Operations that any particular number of ships could be kept in commission with any particular number of men. We therefore decided to determine the needs of the Navy in a more detailed and thorough manner. Instead of inquiring as to tile number and type of ships that could be kept in commission with a particular number of men. we decided. first. to require the Navy Department to furnish us a complete list of all ships of every type. by name. which in the judgment of the department would be necessary to a properly balanced 18battleship fleet. This list the committee has printed in its report. We then assigned to each ship the number of men now carried oi that particular ship. as furnished us by the Navy Department itself. as of February 1. 1922. The bill. therefore. provides for all the ships of the treaty Navy. with as large a personnel carried thereon as was on board on the date above mentioned. I do not see how a fairer or more accurate method could be devised. But they say we took advantage of them. I suppose that what they really mean is that had they known that we intended to base our appropriation upon the number of men upon the ships on a certain day the results might have been quite different. Be that as it may. it is claimed the number was not normal. This debate has been going on now for a full week. Officers from the Navy Department have been in constant consultation with Members of Congress. supplying information and making suggestions relative to the various proposals carried in this bill. I have no criticism whatever on account of their doing this. but I am sorry that some of them thought it necessary to exchange their uniforms during the past week for civilian clothes. whenever they came to the Capitol. If the number of men carried on the ships. as of February 1. 1922. was abnormally low. if there had been an hour during the last 12 months when the records would show a larger number carried on the ships than were carried on that date. have you any idea that my good friend from Massachusetts- would not at least have had a letter from the Navy Department advising him on this fact? But we go through the whole debate for an entire week. the department claiming that the number of men on the ships was below normal on February 1 last. with il the records in their office to show this fact if it were true. but we come to the very hour of voting and no such proof has been furnished. No other proof is necessary. in my judgment. to convince the House that the number of men carried on the ships on February 1. 1922. represented a fair average of personnel afloat on these particular ships for the year. The number of men we. have. therefore. allowed for the treaty navy stands upon as solid a ground as to accuracy and sufficiency as when printed in the report and laid before Congress. So much. then. for the Navy afloat. They have not shown that they need another muan. We have provided for 50.000 men for the treaty Navy afloat2.000 more than were carried upon these identical ships before the great nations of! the earth entered into a solemn compact to keep the peace of the world and to maintain friendly relations with one another. No one has yet given any reason why a larger number of men should be supplied than the ships actually carry at this time. The only other question. therefore. is. did we give them men enough on shore? My answer is that it gave them a man on shore for every job on shore. and 7.000 men besides. . But it did not seem to be sufficient. They had on Febmrumry 1. last. only 12.600 places on shore where they could legitimately put men. and yet they are asking this Congress for 32.000 men on shore to fill 12.600 jobs at a time when farmers. merchants. and manufacturers are borrowing money to pay their taxes. If the Committee on Appropriations had actually followed any such advice as that. then. indeed. the suggestion of the gentleman from New York that the Appropriations Committee might well be abolished wonld be timiely. jLaughter.] Wy do they deshe this large number of excess men on shore? I am sure that question has been ranning through your mind constantly during this week of debate. I asked the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts the other day if he. as a business man. was willing to say that we ought to appropriate for 32.000 men to fill 12.000 jobs. and lie said that he thought so if the Navy Department wanted them. But the other gentleman from Massachusetts . with a mind as sharp as a razors edge. was not so easily satisfied. and lie pressed me for an answer its to what the department could do with all these extra unassigned men. And the question -is still unanswered by any proponent of this increase of 20.000 men above the amount provided in the bill. In my judgment there is only one possible reason for asking for these 20.000 extra men. It can not be because they are to be added to the ships of the treaty Navy. Those ships already carry enough. as has been shown by Mr. OLivFpii. Mr. BYRNEs of South Carolina. mind other gentlemen on this floor. They are not needed on shore because we have given them a man for every job and 7.000 unassigned men for training or to take the place of iiien who are sick. on leave. or in transit in the service. But that was not enough. They come here and want 20.000 more. What for? The gentleman front Massachusetts [Mr. DALLIN.(mEn] on yesterday asked to have the navy yard items passed over until the number of enlisted men were agreed upon. In answer to a question by me as to the theory upon which his request was based he replied that an increase in the number of men. of course. would mean an increase in the number of ships and a consequent increase in the item of repairs. Inasmuch as the committee had provided for the treaty navy. it becomes apparent that those who demand the increased imimber of personnel expect a larger Navy to be kept in commission than that required under the treaty. The other gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. iloExs] also let the cat out of the bag a whilTe ago when lie conlemned as unwise tiepolicy of not kdeping all our fighting ships in full commission. And the gentleman from New Jersey . more frank than alt the rest. urged that all our destroyers should be kept in full commission. And at last we have the reason why the 20.000 extra men are demanded. It proves out with almost mathematical precmson. We have 200 surplus destroyers and it takes 100 men for each destroyer. So that if we keep them all in commission it will require exactly 20.000 men to man them. This is tile only Apiuj. 15. logical reason which has been given by anyone for increasing the personnel provided in this bill from 67.000 men to 86.000 men. But what does this proposal mean? Are we ready to send this challenge out to the world. that we intend to keep in commission 200 warships over and above the number required to maintain the treaty Navy? How does such a performance on the part of Congress harmonize with the lofty ideals enunciated by America at the time of the assembling of the Conference on the Limitation of Armament? What will  the world say tomorrow morning as the Christian people of the earth assemble for worship on the Sabbath day if they are told from the pulpit that the American Congress has just appropriated $54.000.000 to keep in full commission and ready for instant war 200 ships of war in addition to those permitted under the treaty? Such A proposal as that would strike at the heart of civilization everywhere throughout the world. The mischief that such a course on the part of Congress might do can not be calculated. But it is said that the President and the Secretary of State have advised this. If they have been misled as to the effect and the purpose of this increase in personnel. the responsibility upon Congress to prevent the mischief is only thereby increased. Why have our naval officers taken this position? Why do they desire all these surplus warcraft to be kept in commnission? They have simply fallen into a panic. The 200 surplus destroyers require 1.600 oflicers. and if we lay up the 200 destroyers the officers are lying awake nights wondering what will be done with the officers thus released. I think the officers have made a mistake. Personally. I have not been in favor of greatly reducing the number of officers. In fact. I am willing that we should have a surplus of officers. I )elieve that should be the policy of the Government. If we have the ollicers and the ships. the enlisted personnel is not so serious a problem and could be quickly supplied. There is no provision. therefore. in this bill for any reduction in the nmber of officers. although it is possible that some reduction may be necessary at an early date. Thus through fear of losing promotion or perhaps through fear of being severed entirely from the service. I fear the officers of the Navy have made common cause with the various localities of the country whose business interests have been adversely affected by the agreements reached at the Conference on Limitation of Armament. We therefore find arrayed against this hill all the local influences fron Maine to New Orleans on the Atlantic and from San Diego to Seattle on the Pacific. I do not say that this is not a natural attitude for these various navyyard communities to take. They naturally feel the loss of business as a result of smaller naval activities. I call well sympathize with the employees here in the Washington Navy Yard. Some of them have been employed hy the Government for 20 years. They have been manufacturing the great 16inch guns that were to be placed on ships that are never to be built. These guns will never even fire a salute. When the agreement was reached at the conference the major portion of the work in the Washington Navy Yard came to an end. and the thousands of employees had to look for employment elsewhere. There is a great navy yard in Boston. I do not censure Representatives from that locality who reflect the opinion of the city which they represent. There is a great navy yard in Philadelphia. and I do not censure Mr. VARE for looking after the interests of his constituents who will stiffer financial loss because of reduced naval activities at that point. But the fact that new adjustments will be necessary. and that tenporary losses must be sustained in certain localities. must not be permitted to retard the work so gloriously begun at the Washington conference. Gentlemen of the House. it is very well to sympathize with those who may be financially or professionally affected by the great world movement having for its object a reduction and a limitation of armament. Where it is possible and proper. no doubt some temporary adjustments should be made until employment in civil lines can be obtained. I want to say. however. in conclusion. that the American Congress must not permit any group of individuals or any combination of localities anywhere under the flag to throw themselves across the path of the worlds progress in its onward march toward the goal of international understanding and good will.

It is the idea of this bill to form a corporation in a way. so far as bookkeeping is concerned. and to keep an account of the products that are manufactured and sold. just as. any outside agency would. It is proposed in this bill for the Government to manufacture supplies not only for the Army and tile -Navy. but for the Post Office Department. At the present time different departments of the Government are purchasing supplies needed for their respective departments from other bureaus of the Government. I need only cite one Instance. that of the Post- Office Department. in securing its supplies of post cards from the Government Printing Office. The Government Print Ing Office has a certain appropriation for carrying on its work. The Post Office Department has another appropriation for carrying on its work. The Post Office Department advertises for bids for the supply of post cards. Post card bids are submitted from outside sources and also from Government sources. In the last bidding the Post Office Department selected the bid of the Government Printing Office. When the Post Office Department secures its supplies of post cards. true. it is a bookkeeping arrangement in a way. but nevertheless it goes through the same method of payment for these supplies as if it were paying for them to a private contractor. and that is necessary in order to keep the business accounts of the respective departments of the Government. the Government Printing Office and the Post Office Department. separate and distinct. More than twelve or fourteen years ago. when I first began service on the Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads. we were purchasing our mail bags. which it Is proposed here to manufacture at the Atlanta Penitentiary. from a private contractor. who had them manufactured by convict labor. That was later. by an act.. forbidden. because we did not believe it was rightfor the National Government to secure the manufacture of any article it needed by convict labor through a private contractor. Now we propose to have those bags. that are manufactured by private manufacturers. manufactured at the penitentiary at Atlanta. The Post Office Department in thePost Office appropriation bill has a certain amount of money for the purchase of mail bags. running into the neighborhood of three or four hundred thousand dollars. A few years ago it was $400.000. I believe it is now between three and four hundred thousand. The department will purchase these bags manufactured at the Atlanta Penitentiary from this Government agency at the market prices. That penitentiary will be credited with that amount in its working capital. in order to purchase the raw cotton necessary to make the bags and also to pay. the convicts directly. or to their families. for the work performed on the bags. It is pvoposed that that method of keeping account of the transactions between the respective establishments should be followed. as it has been heretofore. It is a question of bookkeeping and accounting. so that we can go on In the orderly method pursued in the past. so that we can keep account of the expenses an(d operation of this plant."},{"1":"1917","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Over there they charge 12 cents per person for coffee. and here they charge 25 cents.

That reduces the price for each Individual to 48 cents when six dine together. If six persons (line together over here on ro ast chicken. if the bill is no. $30 you will be very lucky.

I do not know how much truth there is in the statement I have heard. or whether there is any truth in it. I am not going to make the statement on my own responsibility or with any idea that it is true. but I shall state it for what It is worth. I was told that Mr. Hoover suggested a short time ago that he intended to try to get the hotels of the United States to reduce the size of their portions about onehalf. Somebody suggested to him that he ought to reduce the price for each portion onehalf. and he said ini reply that lie was not concerned about the price. But the people of the United States are. They are anxious not so much for the reduction of the portion as they are for the reduction of the price.

I think those are difficult questions. Mr. President. but I believe. not without some serious doubt as to what the court may eventually say. tile bill is constitutional. Judges on the bench in weighing propositions before them ofttimes have great difficulty in deciding as to how a case should be decided. They are ofttinles in doubt when an appeal is taken and the line is so close. I think we have here a line that Is very close. I am simply going to reiterate in a moment. after reviewing the Tholnas amendment. my reasons for thinking the bill is constitutional without going into the general argument as I have upon a previous occasion done. I want to say a word about the anendluent of the Senator from Colorado [Mr. TnorAs]. I shall vote against the amendment. and really my purpose in rising was to explain my reasons therefor. I believe the amendment is like other amendments which are offered to bills of this character which weaken the bill itself. I think there is a great distinction between the proposition embodied in the amendment of the Senator fromi Colorado and the proposition embodiedin this bill. There is a difference between that class of labor which builds ill) and that class of labor which destroys because of the conditions surrounding it. The Senator from California has referred to a boy working on the farm. We have all probably had the same experience. It is hard work. of course. but it is different from work In a factory. There may be individual instances where it does harm. of course. I know by experience just wiat the Senator was picturing here today.

It has appropriated $35.000.000 to build a railroad up In Alaska and to open up that Territory and develop that great property. It has passed the waterpower bill for watering the public lands in the West. It has given those people an extension of time on the irrigated lands. Rather than force them to make payment now. which they could not do. the Democratic Party has extended their time and saved to them their homes. You Republicans used to talk about reclamation and conservation. The kind that you gave the West was the kind that stifles and kills. The kind of dcvelopment that you made in the West was the kind that locked up and prevented development.

Habitforming drugs are one of the worst evils in our country. and while I am not sure that the provisions of these bills even go far enough. they probably go as far as could profitably or properly be expected at this time. I had the honor to introduce the original bill preventing the importation of smoking opium. and while the bill which I introduced was not the one which was passed. still it was the occasion for obtaining a favorable report from the Committee on Ways and Means. which did not desire to have its jurisdiction interfered with and which preferred to report a bill rather than to have a motion which I had made to take it away from the committee come up. and the bill passed. Gentlemen now say in their report that it has not been fully effective. I presume that is true. but I congratulate myself upon the fact that I happened to be in a position at the time where I was asked to introduce the original bill. which in the first place was prepared by the State Department. as I presume these bills have been. in part at least. I think it is Dr. Wright. in the State Department. who has been doing work under the General Government for years in relation to the international traffic In opium. That. however. Mr. Chairman. is not the only bill which I congratulate myself upon having the honor to haveintroduced. The prevention of the importation of smoking opium and the control of narcotic drugs is of great importance. but there is arother measure to which I wish to direct the attention of the House for a moment. which I had the honor to present to the House. and that is the whiteslavetraffic bill. a law now upon the statute books. supported. I am glad to say. by the distinguished gentleman now occupying the position of Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union. the gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. Sims]. who was one of two Democrats on the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce who favored the bill. notwithstanding the constitutional objections which were made to it by the other Democratic members of that committee. Judge Russell. of Texas. a Member of the House at that time. and Mr. Sims both stood favoring that bill. Judge Russell. of Texas. then a member of that committee. had the honor afterwards to write an opinion holding the bill to be constitutional. and he told me of a conversation which afterwards occurred. when he came back on the floor of the House while on a visit in the city of Washington. One of the other Democratic members of that committee. who bad declared that the bill would be declared unconstitutional If enacted. had a conversation with Judge Russell. and the judge said to him. Ahi. but that bill has been held by the courts to be constitutional. The other gentleman said. But by what courts? I have not heard of it. Judge Russell replied. By my court. I have written the opinion. and I am proud. Mr. Chairman. that he had the honor of doing it. The Supreme Court upheld Judge Russell. But. Mr. Chairman. in order to make a law effective it must first be put upon the statute books. it must be constitutional. and it must be enforced by the administrative officers through the aid of the courts. and when we find that the chief law officer of the country and the Chief Magistrate of the country have permitted themselves to be used to prevent the enforcement of a great moral reform law like this we have a right to make inquiries and give consideration to the case. We are all familiar with the telegram sent to the President of the United States upon the 21st day of this month by the United States district attorney of the northern district of California. Mr. McNab. tendering his resignation for the reasons stated in his telegram. The President on June 24. after he had waked up from his dream. through the activity of the people of the country without regard to partisan politics. accepted the resignation of Mr. MeNab. and in the course of his telegram accepting the resignation he made these remarks: I greatly regret that you should have acted so hastily and under so complete a misapprehension of the actual circumstances. but since you have chosen such a course and have given your resignation the form of an inexcusable intimation of injustice and wrongdoing on the part of your superior. I release you without hebitation and accept your resignation to take effect at once. Have given your resignation the form of an inexcusable intimation of injustice and wrongdoing on the part of your superior officer! And the Attorney General. in writing a letter to the President. said: Mr. McNab. as United States attorney. held a position of peculiar trust and confidence. demanding the utmost loyalty to the department. If. as such an officer should do. he bad availed himself of the opportunity to send a dispatch recalling my attention to the peculiar conditions which he thought rendered the proposed action inadvisable. as I had always theretofore doneThat is poor English. by the wayI should have given earnest consideration to his suggestions. and. with this before me. could have acted with the local conditions fresh in my mind. Instead of pursuing this manifestly proper course he waited until June 20. and then published the sensational telegrams wherein he imputed base motives to me. His conduct has. of course. made it Impossible for him to continue in the prosecution of this case. Wherein he imputed base motives to me ! Let us see what were the facts in the case. On May 16 the Attorney General wired to Mr. McNab asking him to make a full report of these cases. That reply was made under date of May 21. and reached the Attorney General on May 27. On May 27 the Attorney Genral wired to Mr. McNab. approving the course which he had pursued and asking to proceed with the cases. On June 1 a former distinguished colleague of ours. the Secretary of Labor. telephoned to the Attorney General and asked to have this case postponed. What the date of the telegram from the Attorney General to Mr. McNab was is not given. but it could not have been before June 18 or afterJune 20. It must have been June IS or June 19 that the Attorney General directed Mr. McNab to continue these cases. The Attorney General received the telephone message from Mr. Wilson on June 18. The President received the resignation of Mr. McNab on June 20. but meanwhile the Attorney General had directed Mr. McNab to postpone the cases. and then the Attorney General says: Instead of pursuing this manifestly proper course. he waited until He waited until June 20! That is a pretty hasty place up in the Attorney Generals office to way he waited before he did what he did. Here the district attorney. receiving the telegram on June 1.9 from the Attorney General. replied to it with his resignation on June 20. and the Attorney General blames him because he waited so long to pursue his remedy ! But did Mr. McNab accuse the Department of Justice of wrongdoing or impute base motives to the Attorney General? He did not. What was the telegram of resignation which Mr. McNab sent? Remember that there were two cases pending in the district court of the northern district of California. one against a man by the name of Diggs and one against a man by the name of Caminetti for violation of the whiteslave act under circumstances and conditions. if the facts charged are true. which would make men blush that they are men. Caminetti was a youthful boy of 27 years. with. I believe. several children. and it was desirable to have his father at the trial to protect him in his guileless innocence. having only seven lawyers to do so. and his father not being a lawyer. I presume. Well. they say his father is a lawyer. probably the same kind I amhas been admitted to the bar. His father had been appointed Commissioner General of Immigration. one of the duties of which office is to enforce both the Mann and the Bennett whiteslave laws in reference to the deportation of aliens brought here for the purposes of prostitution. a fine man to place in that position. whose principal object is to leave his office in order to go to the side of his 27yearold son under trial for a whiteslave offense. Is he a proper man to be in charge of the decision of questions as to the deportation of aliens brought here for the purposes of prostitution? And the district attorney. McNab. charges the Department of Labor. the Bureau of Immigration. and the Department of Justice with refusing to deport some alien prostitutes. And I demand that they shall make public the information which has been sent by Mr. McNab to either one of the departments on this subject. so that we and the public may determine whether there has been any other crooked work in reference to the deportation of these prostitutes. Mr. McNab received his order to continue these two cases. And. by the way. there were two cases. These men. both married. had run off with two young girls. less than 20 years of age. but each one was indicted separately. What reason was given or is given by any-. one for the postponement of the trial of the Diggs case? Was Mr. Diggs with his seven attorneys also in the need of the influence and advice of father Caminetti? Why should the Diggs case be postponed? They were two separate cases. The district attorney had warned the Attorney General that every effort would be made to prostitute justice. to perjure witnesses. to buy away the witnesses. to thwart the ordinary administration of law. and then the district attorney sends a telegram to the President."},{"1":"1912","2":"S","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Now. Mr. President. I am going on to draw the picture of national extravagance as well as I can. Mr. Ford says. and says with absolute truth: It appears from statements compiled under the direction of the appropriation committees. in the first session of the Sixtieth Congress. that the number of new offices created In excess of those abolished aggregated 10.682. with salaries aggregating $9.087.987.50. The Official Register for 1909 (commonly known as the Blue Book) contains a list of Federal officeholders aggregating 870.065. Over a third of a million. In 1816 the number was 6.327. in 1863. 49.212. From 1871 to 1881 the number increased from 53.917 to 107.095. Dnuble. In 1899 the number was 208.215. Nearly double again from 1881 to 1889. So In the decade to 1909 the number was increased byNot to butby 101.850. or over 16.000 a year. Increased by over 10.000 new officeholders a year for that period. Mr. President. the money that gets into the Treasury and is paid out of the Treasury does not fall like the manna of God from heaven did upon the children of Israel in the wilderness. Every single dollar of it must come out of the pocket of some citizen of tIle United States somewhere. Whether it be levied directly or indirectly not a dollar can get into tile Treasury till that is not taken first out of the pocket of the citizen. There may be citizens so foolish that they do not know they are paying the taxes because they are levied indirectly. but that does not change the fact that they are paying them and it does not change the fact that they are just that much poorer at the end of the year than they would have been if they had not paid them. Now. I want to call your attention especially to the expenditures on legislative account. Members of the House and the Senate are sometimes very critical when it comes to the expenditures of the Executive department and the judicial department. but I am sorry to say that we are not very critical about our own expenditures. and I say advisedly we and our. because what is the sin of one of us has been largely the sin of all of us.

The gentleman criticises with a good deal of vehemence our failure to increase this item when we are asked to increase the number of carriers. The increase of the number of carriers. Mr. Chairnmn. is provided in the other item. which is now passed. This item is limited entirely to the establishment in the first instance of the substitutecarrier service in a city that never before will have had a substitutecarrier service. We appropriated for the current year $1.300.000. We carry the same item for the next year. The reason this is not increased is that it was found that the $1.300.000 for the last year was too high. and they had nearly $200.000 unexpended. This amount was agreed to after a hearing. after inquiry with the officials having charge of this appropriation. It has not been curtailed in any spirit or disposition of being penurious. This is not the money of the committee. Some people can vote loudly to expend money other than their own. but the Committees of Appropriations of the House are obliged to scrutinize very carefully the necessary expenditures and recommend to the House in a fair way such expenditures and appropriations as inquiry has demonstrated will be necessary. I think it ill becomes any Member of the House to criticise so severely a committee which. in my judgment. Mr. Chairman. gives as much time. at least as much zealous work. as many unselfish hours of labor. to the discharge of the heavy and numerous duties of the committee as any other committee in the House. I can speak. Mr. Chairman. with knowledge upon that fact. I have seen these men and have worked with them. They deserve the highest praise for the conscientious. faithful. and honest manner.in which they have dischanrged their duties. It had not been my intention. Mr. Chairman. at any period of this session to make reference in any degree to the fact of my retirement from the House. The intimation of the gentleman from Massachusetts that it was due to a bludgeon gives me the opportunity. without any favor of the future. to express my appreciation of the loyal support of my colleagues upon that committee. What little I have been able to do will have been finished practically with the conclusion of this bill. Whether I have been in error or not I will let history record. but it has not been with any intent to take food from anybodys mouth nor to withdraw the proper meed of praise from any employee. The duties are arduous. are embarrassing. are troublesome. We are not met with brass bands as others are who are more favored for their zealous work in a raid upon the Treasury. We have tried. Mr. Chairman. to perform our service with an eye to the Governments needs. and with fair equity to the employees. and I believe it has been done. Without any disposition to criticise. I believe those few instances in the recent past when the recommendations of the PostOffice Committee have been overthrown by the action of the Committee of the Whole House and the House. that the committee. at least. have not been in error. The facts will demonstrate that their work has been done with careful scrutiny of the facts. with the proper regard which the officials of the department are entitled to receive for their labors. and with a view. Mr. Chairman. of recommending to the House only legislation for which they can properly stand and can at all times defend. and in no instance during my six years of service as chairman of this committee has there been put into a bill any joker for the benefit of any member of that committee. We stood. Mr. Chairman. for what we believed to be right. without regard to the insinuations of Members who think that we ought to join with them without reference to our duties and our consciences in voting appropriations to aid Members to increase their popularity with the postal employees. We are willing to stand or fall by that record. [Loud applause.]"},{"1":"1908","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. I move to strike out the last word. One day last week I listened with astonishment to the speech of the gentleman from Indiana . As is the habit with a multitude of Republican politicians. they conceal from their view the needs of the people and the errors of their party. and then in beautiful. glowing generalities endeavor to beguile the simple voter into believing that black is white and that panic is joyful prosperity. This may have beed possible under peculiar conditions in the past. but I am profoundly convinced that in the face of hard facts and dire need even the artful sophistry of Republican past masters can not longer deceive the people. Standing upon the floor of the House with a carefully prepared manuscript in his hand. showing that his remarks were the result of deliberate thought and not the flight of passing fancy. the distinguished gentleman from Indiana stated: This Republican panic lasted three months. the Democratic panic lasted fortyeight months. just sixteen times longer than the Republican panic. The panic is over now and the country will soon be over the panic. This statement. made in all seriousness. brought several Members of the House to their feet. The gentleman from Indiana was requested to state the exact date at which the panic terminated. as a great many people in the country labor under the delusion that it is still on. He answered that it ended just three mollths and one day from the time it started in. and he accounted for the fact that so many people throughout the country are still out of employment by stating that it was because of the necessity of these people making other arrangements. now that they have satisfied the money centers of New York. so that they can get the money with which to continue business. Then the following colloquy took place:"},{"1":"1907","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"I take great pleasure in answering the gentleman. For many years the fortification bill has carried an appropriation for the reclamation of sites. out of which surveys and estimates for such purposes have been made. I have in my hand a memorandum of an answer received by telephone this morning from the Treasury Department. stating that there is unexpended a balance in the Treasury to the credit of this fund. available for this purpose. of $151.876. The Engineers Department estimates that. it will take $3.000 to make these surveys. borings. and estimates. There is the sum of $151.876 available for that purpose now unexpended in the Treasury. Now. if the War Department deems this of paramount importance. it will certainly assign the necessary money for these surveys from this large sum at its disposal. And if the War Department does not deem it sufficiently important to make a survey before demanding that we give $2.600.000 upon a project that may. like the Dome of the Capitol. cost ten times the amount originally estimated. I for one will not vote to give it any money at all. Now. Mr. Chairman. I do not care to detain the Committee longer. and unless the gentleman from New York has some time that he wishes to yield. I will call for the reading Of the bill."},{"1":"1906","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Provided the clerk can satisfy the Secretary of Commdrce and Labor that the business of his office requires an additional force which can not be compensated for with the $3.000. Let me state the object of that. It was made upon the earnest solicitation of the member of the committee from New York City. and I suppose. to a certain extent. the same would also be true of Boston and Chicago and other large cities. that the additional work that would be required by the provisions of this bill would make -necessary the employment of a number of clerks. We do not seek to prevent naturalization in any case where the alien is entitled to it. We have not sought to throw bars or obstacles in the way of naturalization. We want to provide the machinery by which those entitled to naturalization shall have the opportunity to be naturalized and not to delay them in their naturalization."},{"1":"1905","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"I understand that. Now. Mr. Speaker. the Agricultural Department has made great inroads into this arid country. Land that a few years ago was considered absolutely arid. hardly fit for grazing purposes. has been made fertile and rich land by the application of irrigation. It is true that under the terms of this bill the Secretary of the Interior is allowed four months to sete aside such lands as he believescan be used for irrigation purposes. And in the first place. four months is not enough time. But in addition to that. leaving out the lands that can be reclaimed. all irrigation dams and irrigation ditches. the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture are making great effort in the aridland country. reconverting it into fit land for agricultural purposes by demonstrating where wells can be sunk and pumping the water to the surface. irrigating these arid lands and making them suitable for farming purposes. Again. it has not been fully decided yet as to how far these lands can be developed. utilized. and made beneficial to settlers by planting forests. establishing it for forest purposes and agricultural purposes. so that this legislation ought not to be passed until these experiments are made and we have been able to determine how far. by the establishment of wells. by the planting of forests. and by the improved methods in agriculture. these arid lands can be developed into homestead lands and set apart for homestead settlement. Let me read what a commission that was appointed by the President to report on this publicland question has reported on this question. They say: The agricultural possibilities of the remaining public lands are as yet almost unknown. Lands which a generation or even a decade ago were supposed to be valueless are now producing large crops. either with or without irrigation. This has been brought about in part by the introduction of new grains and other plants and new methods of farming and in part by denser population and improved systems of transportation. It is obvious that the first essential for putting. the remaining public lands to their best use is to ascertain what that best use is by a preliminary study and classification of them. and to determine their probable future development by agriculture. Until it can be definitely ascertained that any given area of the public lands is and in all probability forever will remain unsuited to agricultural development. the title to that land should remain in the General Government. in trust for the future settler. For example: The passage of the reclamation act (June 17. 1902) made certain the disposition to actual settlers of large areas of land which up to that time had been considered as valueless. Other areas. which are too high and barreh to have notable value even for grazing. are 11ow know to have importance In the future development of the country through their capacity to produce forest growth. The making of wells will give an added value to vast tracts of range lands for which the water supply is now scanty. In short. because of possible development. through irrigation. through the introduction of new plants and new methods of farming. through forest preservation. and grazing control. the remaining public lands have an importance hitherto but dimly foreseen. In view of these facts it is of the first Importance to save the remaining public domain for actual home builders to the utmost limit of future possibilities and not to mortgage the future by any disposition of the public lands under which home making will not keep step with disposal. To that end your Commission recommends (see p. 12) a method of range control under which present resources may be used to the full without endangering future settlement. After the agricultural possibilities of the public lands have been ascertained with reasonable certainty. provision should be made for dividing them Into areas sufficiently large to support a family. and no larger. and to permit settlement on such areas. It is obvious that any attempt to accomplish this end without a careful classification of the public lands must necessarily fail. Attempts of this kind are being made from time to time and legislation of this character is now pending. modeled on the Nebraska 640acre homestead law. which was passed as an experiment to meet a certain restricted local condition. This act (33 Stat.. 547) permits the entry of 640acre homesteads in the sandhill region of that State. Whether in practice the operation of this law will result in putting any considerable number of settlers on the land is not yet determined. Your Commission is of opinion. after careful consideration. that general provisions of this kind should not be extended until after thorough study of the public lands has been made in each particular case. because to do so controverts the fundamental principle of saving the public lands for the home maker. Each locality should be dealt with on its own merits. Even if It should ultimately appear that this law has worked beneficially in Nebraska it would by no means follow that such a law might be safely applied to other regions different in topography. soil. and climate. No arbitrary rule should be followed. but in each case the area of the homestead should be determined by the acreage which may be necessary to support a family upon the land either by agriculture. or by grazing if agrculture is impracticable. Until such acreage is determined for each locality. any new general law providing a method of obtaining title to the public lands would. in the opinion of your Commission. be decidedly unsafe."},{"1":"1904","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"If that is true. I do not understand how the Senator can reach the conclusion that because the Pension Office has a great number of such cases. all claiming to be disabled. to examine during a year or two years or three years. the Pension Office can reach as an average the conclusion that 62 years of age is a criterion whereby you can determine that a man is to a certain degreethat is. onehalf or onequarterdisabled. Every one of those applicants comes before the Pension Office with the prima facie showing on his part. so far as he can. that he is disabled. It is not like taking a body of healthy men and striking an average as to their disability. It is taking a body of men who claim to be disabled and who probably are more or less dsabled. Therefore I do not exactly see how the Senator can claim. as has been claimed here I y others. that the Pension Office has a better opportunity f6r deciding on this point than we have in our common observation of the workings of life. Mr. M(.CUMBER. It is simply because the Pension Office officers are taking evidence daily upon that specific disability. a disability which will decrease the amount of manual labor a man can perform. and if they find by the testimony in 99 cases out of 100 that a man 62 years of age is disabled onehalf. they can take that as a criterion. as a presumption from experience. from facts which have been investigated for thirty or forty years. that when a man who has been a soldier has reached the age of 62 years he is disabled onehalf simply because nearly all the cases so indicate. Allow me to go a step further. He finds it by the same reasoning that the Senator himself would find from actual observation. that when any man has reached the age of 80 he is unable to perform any manual service at all whereby he may earn a living."},{"1":"1903","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I call the gentlemans attention to the fact that only 10 per cent of these tribes subsist by labor.

There were prominent men under the Chinese Government who were responsible for it. Possibly the Chinese Emperor was responsible for it. Possibly the Dowager Empress was responsible for it. I am not able to say. But we have demanded indemnity for it. Other Governments have demanded indemnity for it and have put upon the Chinese Government punishment at the cannons mouth. Are we in this way to add to that? Are we to violate the treaty because of the outbreak in China? The outbreak in China. to me. gives an added reason why we should in this instance. if not in all others. move along the line of honor. giving to treaty obligations scrupulous observance. because out of the trouble in China came the splendid attitude of the United States Govermment toward China that ought to win the friendship of China. which. from a commercial standpoint. I believe our people in the long years to come much desire and will much profit by. The attitude of this Governmentand I am glad we were in a position which gave weight to itwas against the seizure and partition of China. Never. in my judgment. under any administration was there finer diplomacy than that which characterized that Administration in relation to the whole Chinese difficulty. When the time of settlement came we exacted no punitory damages from China. We put upon China no humiliation. We stood out apart from some other nations as we stood apart on questions of partition from some. and exacted from China only actual damages. We have a right to feel that China owes us her friendship. Is there any man here who is anxious to have noninte rcourse for all time to come between China and the United States? Are we not looking to the Orient for an immense. incalculable addition to our foreign trade? Is there any reason why that should be considered only a dream? Is there any reason why we should not in the future have our share of it? Is there no reason in the interest of labor why we should be just to China in the observance of treaty stipulations? Is there any pressing necessity within the next two years for our departing from the line of good faith and violating in fact and in spirit obligations of this treaty? I have not been able to see it. If there were need for it. if we were threatened with an influx of Chinese labor. I would vote to pass this bill and to make it more drastic even than it is. I am willing. as matters standI feel it as a Senator to be a dutyto continue. not simply for two years. but until another treaty is made. followed by necessary legislation. the laws now in force. including the Scott Actlaws which hitherto have been so effective as to reduce the number of Chinese residents inthe United States. Take the matter of merchants. What does merchant mean? I have authorities as to what it means. but I can not take time to refer to them. It is used there. I think. in its generic sense. It is defined in this treaty. where they adopt the definition in the act of 1893. This bill provides. in addition to the definition in the treaty. as follows: The term merchant. as employed herein and in the acts of which this is amendatory. shall have the following meaning and none other: A merchant is a person engaged in buying and selling merchandise. at a fixed place of business. which business is conducted in his name. and who during the time he claims to be engaged as a merchant does not engage in the performance of any manual labor. except such as is necessary in the conduct of his business as such merchant. And where an application is made by a Chinese person for entry into the United States as one formerly or at the time engaged in China as a merchant. or in some other foreign couniitay as a merchant. or where such application calls for entry into one portion of the United States fron another portion thereof. then. as a prerequisite to entry. the applicant must have been engaged as a merchant for at least one year next preced ing his application and it must appear to the satisfaction of the appropriate Treasury officer at the port of entry that he comes to exercise in good faith his calling as a merchant. and that calling exclusively. and that he has the means nder his ismnediate controt for forthwith becoming. and has coipleted the arrangements for forthwith becon ing. the owner. in whole or in part. of a goodfaith mercantile business in the United States. or any portion of the territory thereof. May he not under the treaty come to buy our goods or to sell his own? May he not come. being a merchant. upon his business. as a merchant. in our interest and in his. without opening an establishment here? He is not a traveler. teacher. student. etc. He does not come as a commercial traveler to sell some one elses goods. but to sell his own or to buy ours. The treaty wasintended. in this provision. to promote commercial intercourse between the two countries. Being a merchant in China within the definition of the treaty. he can not under this bill come here to become a merchant unless before he comes and before lie knows anyplace or person he shall have completed arrangements for forthwith becoming the owner ien whole or in part of a  goodfaith  mercantile business in this country. Is this in the merchant definition of the treaty? Clearly not. It is a plain violation of the treaty in every way. Suppose a merchant engaged in business in China at a fixed place of business conducted in his name wants to come to the United States to make business arrangements. to study our productions. to examine into our machinery. to buy our goods. to select some agent or factor to sell his wares. is he not under the treaty entitled to come. and entitled to come by producing the certificate of his Government vis6d by our representative abroad? To say that he shall not. to put the restrictions upon him which are put in this bill. is practically in my judgment to exclude him. and a plain. palpable violation of the treaty. Merchants have a right to come. in my opinion. being properly vouched for by their Government and our own representatives. as men who are within the definition adopted by the treaty of 1894. and if we may put the restrictions about them which are put into this bill without violating the treaty. we can add others without limit. I intended to analyze this provision. but I have not the time to do it. The interruptions have taken time which I intended to devote to the consideration of some other sections here in their relation to the treaty. There are several violations of it. in my judgment. I can not take further time. and all I wish to say in conclusion is that I hope the Senator from Connecticut will accept the amendment which I have read in the hearing of the Senate. modifying it if there is any doubt about its reviving the Scott Act. which I am certain there is not. so as to revive it beyond all question. I hope. also. he will amend his substitute so as to clearly exclude the Chinese from coming from the Philippine Archipelago into the United States. Whether they ought to be permitted to come any longer into the archipelago I do not know. There seems to be a difference of opinion about that among our officials over there. and I have thought. as we are in a few daysprobably on Thursdayto take up the Philippine government bill. that on a fuller discussion and better opportunity to get at the truth and consider from all standpoints this particular phase of the subject. we might take up the matter when that bill is before the Senate. I regret to have been so diverted as to preclude a more thorough discussion of this bill. There is no need to violate the faith of the Government. and I will not vote. without necessity. to do it."},{"1":"1901","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. the bill now up for consideration in this House is one of great importance. not only one of vast importance to capital and all property owners. but of great importance to the labor organizations throughout the country. one in which they feel a deep interest. The bill as originally drawn and sent to the committee is too broad to be enacted into law. Some gentlemen on the other side have compared it with a similar act of the British Parliament. They did not state to this House that the laws of England in regard to conspiracy. riots. etc.. referred to in that act. are very broad and very comprehensivemuch broader and much more comprehensive than ours on the same subject. When we put these amendments in this bill we made it almost exact in intent. in purpose. and in effect with the act of England on the subject. and that is one reason we put them in. Now. my respected colleague on the Judiciary Committee FMr. CLAYTON of Alabama] says in his minority report. and in which it will be noted all the Democratic members do not concur. that there would be no objection to this second amendment. if what? If we knew the meaning of the words used therein. Now why should not the gentleman from Alabama understand the meaning of these words in this amendment? Let me read them and see whether there is any obscurity or not: That the provisions of this act shall not apply to threats to injure the person or the property. business or occupation of any person. firm. or association. or corporation. Any obscurity there? Does anyone want it made lawful for a large number of persons to get together and threaten to do these acts and follow the threat by an overt act? I think not. No member of a labor organization. if he has the interest of his organization or the interest of his country at heart. would want any of these acts named in the amendment legalized. Nor shall it apply toIntimidation or coercion or to any acts causing or intended to cause any illegal interference by overt acts with the rights of others. Any obscurity there? Do you not know what it means? The plainest man on the farm or on a railroad train knows what these words mean. every one of them. and if the gentleman from Alabama does not know what overt acts are in connection with crime. I would turn him back to the reading of the decision. the luminous decision of John Marshall. in the great trial of the United States against Aaron Burr. when the question was up and discussed. We all know what constitute overt acts. There is no obscurity in the definition of overt acts. Every lawyer. every farmer. every laboring man knows what constitutes an overt act when the question of whether or not a crime is being committed is presented. And no man possessed of good sense or desiring to have good order in a community would ask to have one of those acts excepted from the operations of this bill by the amendment legalized. We desire to protect the interests of mercantile men. business men. and railroad and other corporations. while at the same time protecting the interests of the great labor organizations and other labor interests of this country. This we do by the amendments to this bill. They are wise and necessary. These amendments are very simple. they are in the interest of the laboringmen. the labor organizations. and of business. for labor and capital should go hand in hand in these matters. each desiring to promote the just interests of the other. and both working for the common good of all. They must go hand in hand. work in harmony. and then there will be no trouble. There was some difference of opinion in the committee. but by a large majority it was deemed wise and best and necessary to incorporate these amendments in the bill. And. Mr. Speaker. if in the future it shall be discovered that we have not gone far enough in liberalizing the law as it now stands in the interest of labor it will bevery easy to give still further relief and take a step further in that direction. Every lawyer knows how dangerous it is in amending criminal laws. or laws against interference with property and personal rights. t8 let down the bars. Therefore we say that we ought to move with caution. that we ought to go slowly. We have gone a great way in this bill. as far as the judgment of this committee thought it wise and proper to go at this time."},{"1":"1900","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"I know nothing about that. I am simply talking of the proposition in regard to Government ships. To continue. Mr. Bowles explained in his statement before the Committee on Naval Affairs that under our system of yard management requisition upon requisition is frequently needed for the procurement of the simplest necessities. Why this is I know not. It may be the result of a system which is intended as a protection for the Government against extravagance. I simply repeat what I said a few moments ago. that I do not believe our constructors in this country are more extravagant or wasteful of the public money than those of foreign countries. The labor in foreign yards. taking it as a whole. is of equal productive ability. I gave the reason for that a few moments ago. The mechanics. the foremen. the boys. and the laborers of every description in English dockyards are on a par with those in the English private yards. It is true that in all English ship or dock yards the hours of labor are the same. but the rates of pay are not the same. The rates of pay in private yards are higher than in Government yards. so that the Government has had considerable difficulty in obtaining the best laborers for work in its own dockyards. But at the same time it is said by Professor Elgar that in all probability the average wages. with several exceptions. earned by each of the two classes of menthe one in Government yards and the other in private yardsare about equal. and their productive ability is also equal."},{"1":"1899","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"I have not critically examined the provisions of the treaty. It can not be possible that the framers of the Constitution. who had so recently rebelled against the arbitrary authority of the imperial government. declaring that all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. deliberately intended to provide authority in this Government to hold and govern people as subjects without a single right of person or property. If Congress can govern the island possessions without regard to the Constitution. it would be impossible to conceivb of a despotism more absolute. It will be no answer to say that our policy toward them will be liberal and benevolent. for the character of a government is not determined by the manner in which its affairs are administered. but by the presence or absence of constitutional safeguards for time protection of the rights and liberties of the people. A government is none the less a despotism because it has a benevolent despot. It is difficult to believe that the fathers who laid the foundations for the Government had in mind any such a despotic power. This Government. that fifty years ago hardly knew where to find authority to preserve its own existence. must have had a marvelous development indeed if it can now govern vassal states at its own arbitrary will. Our relations with the Indian tribes afford no precedent for such a course. because we justify our treatment of them on the .round that they are aliens. nontaxable. owing no allegiance to the Government. We expect to tax the inhabitants of our insular possessions and require of them allegiance to the Government. The Federal Supreme Court has repeatedly decided that residents of Territories are citizens of the United States and entitled to the privileges and immunities of the Constitution as amply as citizens of the States. The Federal Constitution confers no political powers upon its citizens. Those rights are conferred by the States. and Territories are under the control of Congress. consequently their inhabitants possess only such political rights as Congress sees fit to grant them. Congress has the power to govern Territories by any agencies it may establish. provided it violates none of the personal guaranties of the Constitution. It need not provide any degree of local selfgovernment. but may enact all the laws and regulations for their government. as it does now for the District of Columbia. and it may. in its discretion. continue that kind of government indefinitely. There is an abundance of power to govern Territories by laws adapted to their stage of development. but what I have endeavored to demonstrate is that when territory is annexed to this country it becomes part of the Republic and the Constitution automatically extends over it. and its inhabitants are entitled to the privileges and immunities of Federal citizenship. Among the important rights secured to citizens of the United States by the Constitution is that of free commercial and social intercourse with all the people of the country. We will have no more authority to exclude the citizens of the Philippines from the States than we will have to exclude the citizens of the States from the Philippines. Neither can we tax the commerce of the islands for the privilege of coming into the markets here. This is the important and intensely practical aspect of the situation that I desire to impress upon gentlemen in this discussion. The Constitution declares that all duties. imposts. and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States. We can not impose duties in ports of entry in the islands different from those imposed in the ports of the States. we can not impose a higher rate of internal taxation upon the islands than we impose at home. Chief Justice Marshall. the ablest of a long line of able American jurists. in applying that clause of the Constitution to Territories. said: The eighth section of the first article gives to Congress the power to lay and collect taxes. duties. imposts. and excises for the purposes thereinafter mentioned. This grant is general. without limitation as to place. It consequently extends to all places over which the Government extends. If this could be doubted. the doubt would be removed by the subsequent words which modify the grant. These words are. but all duties. imposts. and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States. It will not be contended that the modification of the power extends to places to which the power does not extend. The power. then. to lay and collect duties. imposts. and excises may be exercised and must be exercised throughout the United States. Does this term designate the whole or any particular portion of the American empire? Certainly this question can admit of but one answer. It is the name given to one great Republic which is composed of States and Territories. The District of Columbia. with the territory west of the Mississippi. is not less within the United States than Maryland or Pennsylvania. and it is not less necessary. on the principles of our Constitution. that uni. formity in the imposition of imposts. duties. and excises should be observed in the one than in the other. Since. then. the power to lay and collect taxes. which includes direct taxes. is obviously coextensive with the power to lay and collect duties. imposts. and excises. and since the latter extends throughout the United States. it follows that the power to impose direct taxes also extends throughout the United States. (Loughborough vs. Blake. 5 Wheaton. 317.) That decision has been cited with approval in repeated instances by the Federal Supreme Court. and the principle has been so frequently reasserted that it is no longer an open question. if. indeed. it ever was. It is useless to speculate about the power of Congress to tax the products of the insular territories seeking a market here. in the face of that constitutional requirement. Much is said respecting the supreme character of treaties negotiated by the executive department of the Government. It is claimed that they are above the Constitution. and that conditions contained in a treaty ceding territory to this country are valid without regard to the Constitution. The treatymaking power is given by the Constitution and is subject to its limitations. Does anyone contend that the powers of Congress may be enlarged. that its limitations may be abrogated by the terms of a treaty? Suppose in ceding Porto Rico Spain should have stipulated in the treaty that human slavery should be perpetually maintained on the island: will it be claimed that Congress. in making rules and regulations for the government of the island. would have the power to foster and encourage that barbarous institution? Or suppose in the cession of the Hawaiian Republic it had been conditioned upon the establishment and permanent maintenance of a particular system of religion by the Government. would that have given Congress the power. in the face of the express prohibition contained in the Constitution. to establish and maintain by law a system of religion? Or again. suppose the treaty of cession should have contained stipulations providing for a system of taxation different from that maintained in other parts of the United States. would that abrogate the requirement in the Constitution that taxes shall be uniform throughout the United States? I assert that the only power on earth that can enlarge. modify. or change the Constitution abides with the people of the country. The treatymaking power is as clearly subject to the limitations of the Constitution as any other department of the Government. What. then. becomes of the opendoor policy of the Philippines? Can a peace commission set aside the Constitution? Uniformity of taxation and free intercourse between all of the citizens of the country constitute the strongest bond of national unity. They have unified sentiment. promoted homogeneity. and made us a nation in fact as well as in name. Among all the provisions of the Constitution none illustrate the exalted statesmanship of the convention that framed that great charter more fully than these. and we can not afford to abandon them now. In this brief discussion of these great questions I have aimed to demonstrate that the newly acquired islands must occupy the status of Territories. covered and protected by the Constitution in so far as its guaranties of personal rights and privileges extend. There can he no doubt that the products of the islands will e entitled to free markets in all the States. The new possessions will increase our annual expenditures at least $100.000.000 a year and diminish our customs receipts at least $50.000.000 a yeara difference of $150.000.000 annually. and the question is. How will we obtain the revenue to make it up? I submit these observations. not for the purpose of criticising the expansion policy. but because they present an important business proposition which w e ststtle at an early date. We can not solve it by pretending not to see it. or by trying to think about something else. because it is a living. burning question affecting all departments of the Government. It maybe that the new policy will bring markets for our wares and opportunities for our people that will more than compensate for the increased expense and the loss of revenue. and I sincerely hope it will. but I am discussing now only the revenue aipect of the situation. It is evident that we must have larger resort to the excise system as a permanent source of income. The country was led to believe that the warrevenue law would only be temporary. but conditions are such that that hope must be disappointed. We should proceed without delay to revise and enlarge that law with the view of its permanency. or we must increase our bonded debt. which has already gone up from $585.000.000 in 1893 to over a billion dollars. and it will be further increased $150.000.000 by the construction of the Nicaragua Canal. an improvement which the country seems to demand. The policy of bperating the Government on borrowed money will not commend itself to the wisdom of the people. We can not lay to our souls the happy unction that since an overpowering destiny brought the islands under our control. a bounteous Providence will provide ways and means for their government.. Means will not come from heaven as manna in the wilderness. but Congress must provide them from its constitutional resources. The expansion policy was inaugurated by Admiral Dewey at Manila. and it was carried into execution by the force of public opinion. and I have no doubt that the country will submit willingly to all reasonable requirement for its perfection. But it may be well to be admonished that while its burdens and responsibilities will begin at once. it will require considerable time to realize its benefits. This great Government has had a succession of brilliant achievements in all its relations. and advocates of the new policy assure us that it will be no exception to our splendid history. Our manufactures and farm products are to find rich markets in the Orient. which will infuse new life and energy into all of our activities. I have aimed in these remarks to call attention to some of the practical aspects of the situation. We must have a larger army. The new conditions imperatively demand it. and our resources are ample to meet all the expenses that will be necessarily incurred."},{"1":"1898","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"The sentiments expressed by this great newspaper in the East and this newspaper and distinguished citizen of the great West will awaken responsive feelings all over the country. I heartily indorse them. It has been said that the President. who has been a bimetallist and who voted for the free coinage of silver again and again. would maintain his position. but this mornings paper puts that question at rest. In his speech delivered last night in New York he used these words: Whatever may be the language of the contract. the United States will dischairg all of its obligations in the currency recognized as the best throughout the civilized world at the times of payment. The Senator from Massachusetts has introduced an amendment which he proposes to the pending resolution which is to the same purpose. He insists that the principal and interest of the bonds shall be paid in the money which is the highest money of the world. He has no regard for what the money was at the time the contract was made or whether that money has grown worth twice what it was when the contract was made. The Senator from Massachusetts declares that the bonds shall be paid in the highest money. that no matter if it represents three times as much labor of the American citizen. the bondholder must have it all. The President in his speech last night went to the extent of calling this extortionwhich I would characterize as infernala sacred obligation. We. too. think it is a sacred obligation to pay what we owe. but the claim now made is that the American people shall by our action be compelled to pay more than they owe. To pay in a dollar worth more at the time of the payment than it was at the time when the contract was made is dishonest. and is an outrage to which the American people will not submit."},{"1":"1897","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"The Senator is mistaken.

That is as to the question of Government ownership. I do not care to discuss and will not attempt at all to undertake a discussion of the question of the wisdom or propriety of the Government of the United States becoming the owner of the railroads of the country and running them as public highways. I do not think that question properly enters into the consideration or determination of this question at all. It may be a sufficient answer to say that if the Government does engage in that business it ought to get a system of railways that will be of some accommodation and benefit to the whole public. and not pieces of road. at such an enormous cost as these roads would cost them. Now. let us see what this Commissioner says on this: How much will the roads cost the Government? They will cost the amount of the firstmortgage bonds. of the subsidy bonds. and of the interest that will have been paid on the subsidy bonds. in excess of the repayments made by the companies. Taking July 1. 1897. as the date of average maturity of the subsidybends. and assuming that the companies. under existing laws will pay for the next five years the same amounts they have paid for the last five years the cost July 1. 1897. of the roads would closely approximate the sum of $186.000.000. This will be an average of $77.71.98 per mile for all the aided roads on which the Government can foreclose. This sum is made up as follows: Firstmortgage bonds. $63.615.000. or an average of $26.580.45 per mile. subsidybonds $62.995.192. or an average of 26.321.47 per mile. interest paid by the United States in excess of repayments made by the companies. $69.889.818. or an average of $24.815.03 per mile. making the grand total of $186.000.ed0. or an average of $77.716.96 per mile. These are the figures on the aggregate of the aided lines. 2.89380 miles. Taking the two systems separately. the figures are as follows: Central Pacific firstmortgage bonds. 127.858.00. subsidy bonds. $27.855.80.- excess of interest. $84.22.894. makig atotalo e$89.982.674.94. or an average of $104.490.14 per mile on 80.68 miles of road. Union Pacific frstmortgagebods. $85.762.000. subsidy bonds. $85.189.512. excess of interest. $25.165.918.00. making a total of 398.087.425.0. or an average of $62.682 per mife on 1.52.62 miles of road. It would ot seem desirable for the Government to acquire railroad properties at these figures. Could the Government profitably operat the roads? In my oinen it comu not. I d1o not believe th. n even under fir conditionsthnat is. if it conld obtain full control of al the roads. rights. and franchises that are controlled. owned and exercised by the Union and entral Pacific companiesoit culd so handle the properties as to make them profitable. I know of no instance. in this or any other country. where railroads have been operated profitably and to the best advantage of the public while under governmental control. While the General Government has never owned or operated railroads. sevral of the States have experimented in that direction. and always with disastrous results. :No less than six or eight have made the attempt and abandoned it. In 1860 MKassachusetts took the Troy and Greenfield line. including the Hoosac Tunnel. but the property is now in the possession of the Fithburg Railroad Company. ichigan. in 188. went into railroad construction and operation. including the Miceigan Central and Southern and some other les. In 184 and 1850the roads were sold and a provision was incorporated into the constitution inhibiting the State from being thereafter engaged in any work of internal improvement. f llinois at one time put $1.000.000 into a railroad connecting Meredosia and Springfield. and afterwards sold it for 100.000. or a tenth th re cost. and it is now a part of the Wabash system. Indiana. in 1886. put $1.200.000 into a railroad projected from MIadison. on the Ohio River. toindianapolis. but ceased to operate it in 1843. and a private corporation took the road an f she d it i n erg i lthe W estern an Atlantic. perated it some years. then leased it to a private corporaton. and it is n ew in the hands of receivers. Missouri andVirginia have both been interested in railroad properties. and in each case suffered heavy losses. Pennsylvania. mny years ago. began the construction of a railroad from Philadelphia to Columbia. to connect with a canal extending to the base of the Allegheny Mountains. It later sold the works to private corporations as the result of a conviction. drawn from experience and never shaken. that transportation must be regarded as a private enterprise and not as a public function. In no cauntry in Europe has the government ownership and control of railroads been satisfactory to the people. and the tendency has constantly en toward placing the management of transportation properties in the hands of private corporations. In all cases where governmental control is the most absolute are the rates the highest and the service least satisfactory. The cost of railroad transportation in the United States is less than that upon the lines of any country which owns and manages its railroads. though in such countries the wages of labor are much less than with us. In these facts the United States may find a lesson to profitably study and a warning to heed. Now. look at the situation and the conditions that wouldrevail in the event of a foreclosure of its liens by the Government. The ens are only on the trunk lines. The Government. by its foreclosure. would get no interest in or control over any of the branches. On theCentral Pacific it would acquire 860 miles out of a total of 1.860. and on the Union Pacific 1.3 miles out of a total of 7.944. Most of the main line of the Central runs through an uninhabited and worthless region. It is almost without local traffic for more than half its leng th. It has no terminal facilities on the Bay of San Francisco. where the b of the Pacific Coast trade centers. It mainly receives its business from the nonaided lines of the system with which it is now connected. That would be rather an expensive luxury to engage in. Now. as I said. Mr. Chairman. every official connected with the investigation or the consideration of this question has reported in favor of some adjustment of the Government debt excepting the minority report made by Governor Pattison when he was a member of the Pacific Railway Commission. He did not agree with the measure that was recommended by the majority of that Commission. and I may say in this connection. without making myself immodest. that I did not agree with it. and. as a member of the Committee on the Pacific Railroads of this House. joined in a minority report against a measure of the same character that the majority of the committee had reported. But I do not know that Governor Pattison in his report anywhere discussed or what his opinion might beif it was worthy of consideration. as I concede it to be upon this or any other questionas to a proposition such as is embodied in the terms of the pending bill."},{"1":"1894","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I do not rise to oppose the provisions of the paragraph in regard to the Hawaiian treaty. but to again call the attention of the Senate and the country to another one of the gross inconsistencies of thepending bill. The Senate by a solid vote of the Democratic side of the Chamher has today refused to give a bounty. as we were required to do by an equitable contract. to the citizens of the United States who are engaged in the production of sugar. The paragraph under consideration proposes to pay out of the pockets of the people of the United States abounty of 1i cents a pound to every producer of sugar in the Hawaiian Islands. where. as the Senator from Connecticut suggests to me. they use Chinese labor in competition with American labor. If it is indefensible and unconstitutional to pay a bounty to citizens of the United States. by what process of reasoning do you sustain a proposition to pay $4.950.000 per annum to the sugar producers of the Hawaiian Islands? Many of the owners of plantations there are not even citizens of the United States. What part of the Democratic platform. what partof the doctrine of the Democratic party. as enunciated by the two Senators from Louisiana and other Senators upon the opposite side of the Chamber. is it that permits that to be done? This mosaic of legislation. which puts in one line a provision that is acknowledged to be unconstitutional. and in another puts a provision of an opposite nature. can not be defended upon any. principle which has been advocated heretofore by any party in the United States. I should like to know how my friend from Texas . who I see is now honoring me with his attention. can support a prevision of this kind. I should like to know how the Senator eom Delaware . whose ideas in regard to what can be done within the limits of the Constitution are very strict. can vote to take money out of the pockets of the people of the United States. and in the form of a bounty pay it to foreign producers of sugar. I admit that there are many political reasons for this action. but if the Constitution is to be observed. if the policy of the Democratic party is to stand in any of the provisions of the pending bill. if there is not to be an absolute abandonment of even the pretense of tariff reform. then what justification is there for this action?"},{"1":"1893","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. I fully agree with the distinguished gentleman from New York that this is a measure which should be fully discussed. and I suggest that this amendment would not now be before us if those who favor it really desired discussion. It should have come before us as a separate proposition. with ample time for examination. but instead of that it isfastened upon an appropriation bill at the end of the session. with but a few hours at most for consideration. and we are given our choice between it and an extra session. Surely we who oppose the amendment are not responsible for the limited opportunity for debate. and we should not allow ourselves to be forced into the acceptance of it. The legislation proposed is not only farreaching in its effect. but its purpose is doubtful and its language ambiguous. No reason has been assigned for it which is valid. and no construction has been suggested which is act.eptable. If its effect will be. as many contend. to compel the cancellation.of the $346.000.000 of greenbacks as fast as they are redeemed. it can not be justified for a moment. for it would contract the currency and substitut3 an interestbearing debt for a noninterestbearing debt. Upon this proposition the country has already set the seal of its condemnation. and woe to the party which either openly or secretly seeks to reverse that decree. If. on the other hand. it is contended that under this amendment the greenbacks redeemed will be reissued. then I submit that it provides for an unlimited increase in the public debt without bringing any permanent relief to the Government. Of what advantage will it be to issue $10.000.000 worth of bonds today to secure gold if the entire sum can be drawn out tomorrow by the presentation of greenbacks for redemption. Is it possible to conceive of a grander scheme of speculation? Will the people tolerate an indefinite. an unnecessary increase in the public debt in time of peace? Be not deceived. sirs. our people plead. not that additional burdens be imposed. but for relief from the burdens already upon them. The ostensible purpose of the amendment is to keep at $100.000.000 the coin fund intended for the redemption of greenbacks. It reads as follows: To enable the Secretary of the Treasury to provide for and to maintain the redemption of United States notes according to the provisions of the act approved January 14. 1875. entitled An act to provide f )r the resumption of specie payments. $50.000. and at the discretion of the Secretary he is authorized to issue. sell. and dispose of. at not less than par in coin. either of the description of bonds authorized in said act. or bonds of the United States bearing not to exceed 3 per cent interest. payable semiannually and redeemable at the pleasure of the United States after five years from their date. with like qualities. privileges. and exemptions provided in said act for the bonds therein authorized. to the extent necessary to carry said resumption act Into full effect. and to use the proceeds thereof for the purposes provided in said act and none other. The issue of bonds is not necessary for two reasons. We do not need $100.000.000 as a redemption fund now. as we did in 1879. Then we were resuming specie payments and might expect a larger demand for coin than can be reasonably expected now. If the Treasurer has power to issue bonds whenever necessary to provide coin to redeem greenbacks. $25.000.000 or $50.000.000 in coin would answer for a redemption fund as well as $100.000.000. But. Mr. Speaker. there is another reason why these bonds are not needed. Our obligations do not call for gold. but for coin. Our bonds are payable in coin. our greenbacks are redeemable in coin. and our coin certificates only call for coin. There is no note or obligation of the Government. excepting the gold certificates. which can not be discharged by silver. There is no scarcity of silver. We have an abundance of it to meet every demand. Shall we issue bonds and buy gold when the silver lies idle in the vaults? If I may be permitted to guess the real purpose of this amendment. I believe it is. Mr. Speaker. to secure a solemn declaration from Congress that gold is the only coin and that silver is no longer a legaltender money. It means an abandonment of the principle of bimetallism and the adoption of a single gold standard. It means that silver money is to be redeemed in gold. and that instead of having our paper money supported by both gold and silver our gold coin shall be made to support both our paper money and our silver also. This means that gold shall be made moro valuable and the price of all products of labor decreased. It is the second skirmish in the great battle of the standards. We saw the first a few days ago. when it was attempted to.suspend the purchase of silver without substituting anything in its place. We now witness another attempt to give the yeilow metal an advantage over the white metal. but the friends of bimetallism will oppose every attempt in whatever guise it may appear. and will carry on the contest until bimetallism is fully established in the  gold and silver coinage of the Constitution. It is contended that the Secretary of the Treasury has power now to issue bonds. and that this amendment only contemplates a reduction in the rate of interest and a shortening of the duration of the bonds. but. sir. the refusal of this House to approve of the amendment will be notice to the Secretary that. in the opinion of this House. no bonds should be issued. It will be notice to him that this branch of the legislative po wer. in which all measures like this should originate. does not believe that there is any need for the issue of bonds to buy gold.. I believe that he will heed this notice. But. sir. if we accept the amendment we will virtually instruct him to issue bonds. and those who will profit by the sale of bonds will be quick to urge as a duty that which is now asked as a privilege. The House will meet no graver question than this during this session. Let. us so solve it that a contraction of the currency may be prevented. that an unlimited increase of the public debt may be avoided. and the principle of bimetallism preserved."},{"1":"1892","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Well. you will not find it so in the RECORD if I did not say what I intended. But. Mr. Chairman. to proceed. What follows from the decisions to which I have referred? It seems to me that the House can make a special rule even under an appeal from the decision of the Chair. I have said that the Journal was approved on the 15th day of February. under the rules of the House approving the action of Speaker REED on the 14th day of February.when. before we had any rules. on a roll call he had directed the Clerk to enter upon the Journal the names of certain gentlemen who were present and declining to vote. Clearly. sir. the decision of the Supreme Court has covered every point in the rulings and decisions of Speaker REED in the Fiftyfirst Congress. On the 17th day of February the House met and the Journal was read. and the leader on that side of the House. Mr. CARLISLE of Kentucky. immediately rose in his place and said that the rules having been adopted the minority did not propose to make any further contest in regard to the approval of the Journal. but they believed that they were right in their contention about this constitutional quorum that it should require those acting and presentacting as well as present. a majority of themto constitute a quorum. He also said that the minority would see to it that a case should be made up and taken to the Supreme Court of the United States and there settle the question at issue. They selected the Dingley worsted bill as the case. they carried it to the Supreme Court. and the Supreme Court of the United States have forever settled that question. and decided that Speaker REED was right in the position he took in the Fiftyfirst Congress. that the majority were right in that Congress when they asserted that the Constitution meant just what it saidA majority shall constitute a quorum to do business. Having a majority they were ready to do business. And yet. notwithstanding this decision of the court. our friends upon the other side do not even do as that judge up in our State used to do when he was beaten. either take an appeal or go over to the tavern and swear at the court. But they entered a special plea to try to avoid the decision of the Supreme Court. they try to change the issue made in the Fiftyfirst Congress from 21.52 what it really was to what it really was not. But the principle of the decision of the Supreme Court affirms every act done in regard to a quorum either by the Speaker of the House or the majority of the House itself. The Supreme Court has unanimously vindicated the action of the Fiftyfirst Congress. Our friends on the other side remind usand I think you will find it in every speechthat both this quorum business and the McKinley monstrosity were tried in that grand tribunal of the people in 1890. and overwhelmingly cast out. and that they were sent here to repeal it. to get rid of it. to reform it. Yes. Mr. Chairman. it is true we had an election in 1890. the McKinley bill finally became a law on the 1st day of October. and went into effect on the 6th day of October. Then thirty days thereafter we had an election in this country. and. as I said. the bill was denounced. Why. it was a robbery. it has increased the duties on everything that man. woman. or child wanted. either for necessity or comfort. There was not a thing on the whole list but would go up in price and the poor would be robbed. farmers were to be robbed. everybody was to be robbed because of this  monstrous iniquity.1 We heard it proclaimed on every Side. we read it in every Democratic newspaper. that it was a monstrosity without excuse or justification. and they cited instances. such as needles. which they said had been advanced by the McKinley bill and now were selling at outrageous prices because of it. not stopping to see that the McKinley bill had put needles on the free list. and so on all through the bill. Every merchant with a stock of goods -n his counter. oh. how anxious he was to sell. how philanthropic he was to his customers. how benevolently he took them aside and says. I advise you to buy a whole piece of these goods becanuse the effect of the tariff is going to be to raise them. They are going up. and when I get new invoices I will have to sell higher. but I will sell this stock now on hand to my old customers at exactly the old prices. Well. they sold the goods. and that is what they wanted to do. The importer went to the retailer and said. I will let you have that line of goods now at the old price. but the next invoice will come in under the McKinley bill. and there is a great rise in the duties. and there will be a great rise in the price. Buy now. And so the retailer got his store full of goods. So everyone was frightened by the prospect of high prices. Why. what the wholesalers and the retailers were telling their customers happened for once to corroborate the anteelectionshall I say lies or mistakesof the Democratic party. and happening to jibe in just at that time. a good many people believed them. Some of them took it out by voting the Democratic ticket. A good many more of them stayed at home and did not vote at all. So that when we came to count the returns. to our surprise and to your surprise you had 140 Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. Well. now. you have been talking about that a good deal since. It will require a change of 70 seats to make the House even. and yet there are more than a hundred men on the other side of the House who sit trembling day after day. for fear their successors will be Republicans. Why. they lie awake at night. and they dream of demagoging and some demagogic scheme. for fear their successor will be a Republican. And the gentlemen from the South and the West. I am told. come into the Democratic caucusI know they come into the House of Representativesand say. If you want t9 save us from the Farmers Alliance you must give us an opportunity to pass the freesilver bill or we can not come back to Congress. And our friends from Massachusetts cry out.  Is the seat of a Democratic member in Georgia more important than the election of a Democratic President? They say. You may succeed in passing your silver bill and saving your own scalps. but can you carry the country? And then the woeful predictions they make on the subject. each man struggling to save himself. and the whole party trembling with fear lest the next House should be Republican. and each one trying to invent some new scheme to save his own seat. Now. I should think you would glory over your 140 majority. If you are to have any majority I am glad you have got 140. It gives you a chance to do all the mischief you can dream of. day after day and night after night. Why. this tariff act of 1890 is spoken of not only as highway robbery. but highway robbery is respectable when compared with the McKinley bill. they say. It is burglary in the nighttime. That is the only proper epithet that seemed to occur yesterday to the gentleman from Nebraska in regard to this McKinley bill. Well. now. this thing was not done in a corner. The McKinley bill was not conceived in darkness. The process by which it was made up was never withheld from the public.view. It was no darklantern measure. but the eight men who composed the majority of the Ways and Means Committee in the last Congress. as soon as they were appointed. issued an invitation to the people of the United States. They sat the next day after Christmas. They had hearings every day from that time down to the final day when the vote was taken on the bill in the House. and the people of the United States came to those hearings. Oh. you say. manufacturers came. They did. Importers came and were heard. farmers came and were heard. mechanics and laboring men came. and they were heard. The organizations of labor sent their delegates and they were heard. The committee did not start out with the idea that they knew all about the tariff. They believed that protection was the best policy for this country. They started out with that belief and what they learned from the people only reinforced and encouraged them in that belief. And they made a bill symmetrical. a bill for the protection of American industry. for the encouragement of American manufacturers. believing that in this way they were giving the greatest good to the greatest number. and were building up the people of the United States."},{"1":"1891","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Not the carrying trade. The carrying trade his not increased. Mr. cAD00. The gentleman holds that our commerce. our foreign trade. has increased. that there is a larger amount of foreign products coming into our ports than formerly. He points to the great growth of our shipping ports. But the Commissioner of Navigation. who is a zealot. if not a fanatic. in advocacyof this bill. answers thegentleman. He says what I have stated. that our flag is not recognized as a commercial flag. that the British Lloyds and the merchants of foreign countries will not deal with our ships. that our flag. as I have stated and want to impress upon the House. is not recognized as a flag for forei g commerce. and that an American ship lying side by side with a British ship in the harbor of San Francisco has to wait nearly twice as long to get a cargo. and has to meet the opposition of the British Lloyds underwriting. And the Commissioner of Navigation himself admits that the subsidy bill would not relieve us from these features of our situation. Among other things he says: American cargoes outward being of our own products. it might be thouaht ourshipping should have held its own for their transportation. but sueb ha3x been the will and power of the Lloyds it could not do so. even If other ob tacle did not exist as they did. The bondedwarehouse system. established) n s le.. in the course of time has thrown our import trade into the hands of forelgo merchants. shipowners. and underwriters. and reduced the most of our merchants to shipping and commission business for foreign houses. This regression from an unwiselaw. together with the godsend of the Union war. has greatly aided the Lloyds in taking advantage of our unprotected condition. and driven ourshippingout of exporttrade. leaving now only 9 per cent. of the total carriage outward. which is now nearly engrossed by foreigners In command of cheap capital and the control of European marketq. Without. American importers and exporters and unbiased underwriting. as there u- 2d to he in the halcyon days gone by. there can be no future foreign earrying trado of preponderance for an American merchant marine. So feeble is our prsent power to share in the trade to or from Great Britain that little or no aco.nt 14 taken of our supply of suitable tonnage for this trade In any one of our own ports. Your subsidized ships would have to meet the same opposition from the Lloyds. the same difficulties of foreign exchange and underwriting. and all the embargoes that now exist against an American ship. This is an answer to the gentleman from Maine when he asserts we arc importing a great deal of matter which might come in American bottoms. You can not get an increase of the merchant marine commensurate with the increase of your foreign commerce under existing conditions unless by a differential rate of duty. by that old drastic but efficient remedy which your fathers applied to restore the merchant marine. and which those of us who believe in tariff reform would have. if it were possible in view of existing treaties to enact it. that goods brought in American bottoms to our ports should have a certain amount of duty taken off. But we have made treaties with every nation on the earth to the effect that where they allow certain free entries to our ships we will allow the same to them. So that this remedy is an impracticable one. Now. one of the main arguments of gentlemen who defend this bill is the example of Great Britain. We have had a bitter controversy on this floor as to whether Great Britain subsidizes her merchant marine. I do not think that is germane to this question. I assert today that there is no analogy between Great Britain and the United Statcs in this matter. that you can draw no illustration from Great Britain that will affect the people of this Republic. I have heard it asserted on this side of the House that Great Britain does not subsidize her shipping. but that she makes liberal and j ust payments for mail carriage by water. That she did formerly subsidize her shipping is strongly insisted upon. I have beard gentlemen on the other side dwell with great strenuousness and force upon the fact that Great Britain does subsidize liberally her shipping. For the purpose of this argument I do not care if Great Britain pays fifty billions a year by way of subsidies. It should not carry one iota of weight with this House. and why? Because there is no analogy between the position of Great Britain and the United States. What is England? A patch of sods upon the bosom of the North Sea. with dependencies and colonies scattered in every quarter of the globe. She is under an absolute military necessity of intercommunication under her own flag with India. with Australia. with Canada. and with every one of her colonies. What would be a wise policy for Englishmen would be a fatal one for Americans. because the positions of the two countries are not alike. If I were an Englishman and a member of their representative body. I should as a loyal citizen of Great Britain be willing as a military precaution. if nothing else. to tax my people to the highest point to maintain military and commercial communication by means of mail steamers ivith the dependencies of that great empire. But. sir. a people possessing the greater portion of a continent.. with unlimited natural resources. with great railroads. a people who are a land people (and all mankind are naturally land people and only take to the sea by necessity). who have no dependencies scattered in remote parts of the world. who have no intervening ocean between this Capital and the vast. imperial dominion of the Republicsuch being the position of our people and our country. it is idle. foolish. absurd. to attempt to draw an analogy between the position of Great Britain and that of the United States. Great Britain has forced her people to the sea as the old eagle pushes the hesitating young ones out of the nest to hazard their lives in the upper air and find sustenance in other fields. With 39.000.000 and over of people upon those two comparatively small islands. with a system of land laws creating a monopoly in that upon which man lives. with a crowded and dense population. with land insufficient to furnish those people with bread if every acre of it were planted with wheat. why. Mr. Chairman. it is the cruel law of necessity which makes the British man take to the water. He can not find subsistence upon his own land under his own flag. If the land laws there were made free. if land monopolywere struck down. if every Englishman could have his heritage as our people have had in the public domain. yet. sir. their population is so dense in comparison with the area of the island that still the people of Great Britain would be forced to take to the boats in order to find in other lands the bread they could not get at home. How different the position of the people of this Republic! Sixtyfive millions ofpeople coveringtbe greater portion of a continent which is able to support 350.000.000 in peace. prosperity. and material happiness. There is no forced obligation here to go to the water. I have said already that men take to the boats and to the sea only under the stress of necessity. Man is not an amphibious animal. Alan is neither a frog nor a fish. He is a laud animal and looks to the land as his home. His instincts attach him to the land. At sea he is seeking the land. He gets his living from the land. The earth is his mother. and he clings to her breast until necessity drags him from it. Our people. then. on this great continent. with its tremendous resources. varied productions andpeoples. a world withinitself. hardly as yet touched. with its boundless areaof land and wholesome climate. have no necessityto take the taxes of the people and apply them to the creation of an American merchant marine. simply for the purpose of seeingthe American flag float at the foremast and benefiting a very limited class of people as against the rest of the population. Why. Mr. Chairman. after the war did we not rebuild our lost vessels and thus regain our prestige on the high seas as one of thegreat commercial powers? I will tell you. sir. the reason. It was because American capital and American enterprise was engaged in rebuilding the waste and destruction of the war on the land. and. in developing the magnificent resources of an assured and perpetual Union. It was because American capital found a greater field in the railroads andthe great mines. agricultural. manufacturing. and timber regions of the United States than inbuilding vessels. Hadourcountrybeencrowded with a teeming population as Great Britain. and our capital not found an outlet in the great railroads that span our continent. and the vast mines opened in te West. and the tremendous uprising of the giant of the South. it might have been employed in building Cunard lines instead of Northern. Southern. and Central Pacific Railroads. The real reason was thatthere was a better output of American labor and American capital on the ground and in our own country rather than in shipbuilding and shipowning. We are asked to adopt British laws and customs by the friends of this bill. while our condition is entirely different. There is no similarity between them. There is a sense of humor in the situation. If we do not adopt this British law we are enemies of our country. and if we pattern after other British laws we are still more pronounced enemies. such seems to be the argument. Now.

Surely Bourbonism after a quarter of a century has made no progress with the negro problem. has been a failure and a curse to the South. The young men of the South have outgrown their beliefs of yesterday. they will next discard the leaders of yesterday. The ghosts of negro equality and the white mans party already begin. like the ghosts in Hamlet. to scent the morning air in the new South. We can not go backward. we can not stay where we are. The black man as a slave drove the North and West to a war for his freedom. Today the North and West are driven to insist on the exercise of his franchise as a citizen. The irrepressible conflict in behalf of the slave then is the irrepressible conflict in behalf of the present and future status of the black citizen now. The organized labor of the North. West. and border is averse to a growing competition with a race of increasing ignorant pauper laborers. and realizes more clearly that whatever keeps down the black labor of the South can not elevate the white labor which practically rules the white States. The manufactures and industries of the white States will not long tolerate the counting of the blacks in representation whereby one favored white freetrade vote in South Carolina avails as much as five less favored white protection votes in Kansas. The tide of race prejudice thus spreads beyond the borders of the black States. Its waves reach this Capitol. One white man in the black States on this floor equals five white men in the North in representative power. Its influence during the four years past has controlled the Executive and this Hall of Representatives. The triumph of white rule does not end with local white government. The Southern white Democracy counts the black man effectively in forty votes in the electoral college and forty Representatives on this floor. By the supremacy of the white Democracy in the black States the nation is unduly controlled by the white minority. and the less intelligent white minority. in our country. Of the twenty millions in the South six millions are illiterates by the last census. In the Black belt 25 per cent. of the native white and 7S per cent. of the colored people are illiterates. 45 per cent. in these eight States can not read the name on their ballots. States with 49 per cent. of illiterate voters represent 76 per cent. of the majority of the electoral college and of this House of Representatives."},{"1":"1888","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Speaker. it is with deep sorrow that I rise to pay tribute to the memory of my friend and colleague. Seth C. Moffatt. I had known him a long time. and while we differed upon political questions. our relations were of the most friendly and cordial nature. And I an thankful thatin all our intercourse no word or action ever occurred to interrupt the kindly feeling that existed between us. Mr. Moffatt was a native of the State whose district he represented. being born in Battle Creek. Mich.. in 1841. He received a commonschool education. and graduated at the law school of the Michigan University. Many times had the people reposed confidence in him. He was a member of the State senate in 187172. a member of the constitutional commission of 1873. and was speaker of the Michigan house of representatives in 188182. He was elected to the Fortyninth and Fiftieth Congresses. He was a thorough and consistent iepublican. At the time of his death he was the leading apostle of that political faith in the district which he represented. But while he was adevotee of the principles of the Republican party. some of his most intimate associates were Democrats. He was a man who made friends wherever he went. and who had the respect of all who knew him. regardless of party. It is customary to speak well of those who have passed away. The old Latin maxim. Do mortuis nil nisi bonie. I is an excellent one.. But in respect to my dead colleague it is not necessary to invoke the application of this maxim. because if we speak truthfully we can say of him nothing but good. He was a sterling man. true to the core. liberal and magnanimous. with a pure and stainless character. He possessed the qualities of activity and perseverance in a remarkable degree. He was an indefatigable worker in any matter on which lie was bent. and no member of this House was more industrious in behalf of the interests of his constituents than he. He was of a kind disposition. openheartd and generous. modest and gentle as a woman. One would make a mistake to think that under his quiet and unostentatiousmanner there did not lie any resolution and firmness. He was peculiarly possessed of those qualities. I remember an instance which well illustrates this. When he was a member of the Legislature in 188182 he was elected speaker of the house. Some time after serving at the regular session lie was taken ill. His indisposition was protracted so long that it was feared he would not recover. Right at this time. while he lay upon a sick bed. an extra session of the Legislature was called by the governor. Thinking that he could not live to assume the duties of speaker. many members of the Legislature commenced to discuss the question as to who should be his successor. Just prior to the opening of the session this subject was considerably agitated. But Mr. Moffatt. with indomitable energy. arose from his sick bed. and when the hour for the convening of the Legislature arrived. to the surprise of a great many. he appeared in the speakers chair. weak and pale. but very determined. and took the gavel and called the house to order. When the committee of this House which accompanied his remains to their last resting place arrived at his home the scenes were touching indeed. and I can fully indorse all that has been said in that respect by the gentleman who preceded me. I never saw more genuine sorrow manifested than at Traverse City when we laid him away. The town was draped in mourning. business was wholly suspended. and a sadness pervaded the entire community. Few men in Northern Michigan will be missed more than he who so lately was with us full of life. hope. and ambition. As I stand here it seems but yesterday that I sat in this very Hall in friendly converse with him. and today he is clasped in the bosom of the earth and the winter snow of the north rests upon his grave. As a lawyer he was industrious and successful. as a citizen he was highminded and exemplary. and as a friend he was staunch and true. B y his death this House has been deprived of one of its most worthy and able members. his district of a iithfal and conscientious Representative. and his family have siffered the irreparable loss of a kind antindulgent father. a tender and loving husband. He was but fortysix years of age. an age at which most men are considered to be in the prime of life. It is inexpressibly sad. that one so beloved. at such an age. right in the zenith of his career. when such a fate was least expected. when his dear wife and children were a thousand miles away. should be so ruthlessly taken by the Angel of Death. But sooner or later it comes to us all. The glories of our mortal state Are shadows. not substantial things. There is no armor against fate. Death lays his icy hand on kingsScepter and crown Must tumble down. And in the dust be equal made With the poor sickle. scythe. and spade. His hopes and aspirations are crushsd. his family are heartbroken. but he has gone where no pain. no sorrow. no anguish exists. He has been taken to that unknown hereafter from whence notraveler returns. That there is a hereafter every man. it seems to me. must believe. I can not conceive how any one with human instincts can think otherwise. If there exists a person who honestly believes that when his eyes are closed in death nothing remains. then I say such a person is to be pitied. Can it be that at the conclusion of mans existence on this planet for a comparatively infinitesimal period of time. can it be. I say. that then. when dust is rendered into dust. all is ended? No. When matter and mind are perished and lost. And all that we see into chaos is tossed. From nothing to nothing we pass out alone. Like a flash or an echo. unknown. unknown. No word comes back. we know not what awaits us. Still. I have something here. in my innermost soul. which tells me that this life is not the end. that beyond all this we have a wider. a higher. a nobler destiny. There lies in the human breast a something which says. This is not all. What an encouraging hope. what a divine thing it is for this world. this belief in a future existence! How could the widow and the fatherless children of our dead colleague bear up under their unutterable grief if the hope of a future reunion beyond the dark valley were taken away? To teach any other belief is unnaturalyes. it is monstrous. Air. Speaker. from all earthly scenes my associate is gone forever. But he will not .be forgotten. His friends will ever keep his memory fresh in their hearts. And when the glorious summer comes. and the grass grows green. and the beautiful Michigan roses blossom on his grave. although hushed will be his lips in death. yet the tender blades and the perfume of the flowers will speak of him. and to those who knew him best will seem to say. Beneath here sleeps one who was kiMnd. and noble. and true."},{"1":"1887","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Let the report be read. The report was read. as follows: The Committee on Invalid Pensions. to whom was referred Senate bill 1627. report that they have examined the same. and adopt the Senate report. as follows: [Senate Report No. 784. Fortyninth Congress. first session.] The petitioner is the widow of Marcus H. Miles. late a first lieutenant in the Eleventh Michigan Cavalry. The claimant made application for a pension on the ground that her husband received an injury that resulted in hernia. and which was the cause of his death. The Commissioner of Pensions decided that his death was not a result of his military service. There is no record testimony other than that which identified the soldier in his line of duty. The surgeon of the Eleventh Michigan Cavalry. Lucius C. Woodman. testifies that lie was well acquainted .v ith Marcus H. Miles. and he describes minutely the accident. which occurred from a fall while on a train of ears. and from which it appears that hernia was immediately produced. and for which he was treated then and subsequently by Surgeon Woodman. The colonel of the regiment was present and testifies to all the circumstances and to the subsequent disability of Lieutenant Miles. and to the necessity of placing him on detached service. The AdjutautGeneral certifies to the presence of these two officers at the time. The physicians who attended Lieutenant Miles during his disability. and down to the date of his death. agree that he was notable to perform any kind of labor. and that the cause of his death was paralysis of the b.dder and suppression of the secretions froms the kidneys. owing to nervous prostration and continued irritation from complicated hernia.

About this time a number of gentlemen who had amnassed a large amount of depreciated paper money started on a wild hunt after honest moneystarted to impress the Government with the necessity of coming with rapid strides back to goldstarted to bring this country by forced marches to a gold currency. They commenced to contract the currency for that purpose. and prices came down till they brought the country to the crash of 1873. We certainly all remember that. We certainly all remember that from 1873 to 1879. after we had commenced the coinage of silver. this country passed through a period of darkness and gloom that has never been witnessed at any other time in its history. and God grantthatit may never be witnessed again. I remember standing here and seeing a venerable Representative of Pennsylvania (Mr. Hendrick B. Wright. now no more) rise and unroll a petition signed by 20.000 of his fellowcitizens asking this Government to relieve their distresses and. if it gave them no other relief. to give them some means of flying from their homes where starvation confronted themselves. their wives. and their children. We remember the time when the city of Pittsburgh was set on fire. when the United States Government had to send its armed troops to protect property and suppress the terrible disturbance made by the Congress of the United States bending its knees in devotion to the gold power of the East. Every State in the North tottered from turret to foundation.stone. and every one of them was calling on the Government of the United States to stretch its strong arms around them and help them to stand in the midst of the tempest of disorder and violence created by their distressed and suffering people. Three millions of men willing to work were out of employment. They could have earned $3. 000.000 per day. but there was none to employ them. Bread and meat were cheap. houserent was cheap. fuel was cheap. everything was cheap but gold. Gold was high. but the pockets of the workmen were all empty. Would you take the country again through that valley of the shadow of death? Would you repeat again that experience so full of lamentations and mournings and woes? If you would. listen to the soft. sweet notes of the siren as she sings from the vaults of the national bankers about dishonest dollars. Drive out into banishment the old silver dollar of our fathers. call in the silver certificates. retire all the Treasury notes. make money so scarce that the poor bankers in New York can buy a bushel of wheat for a dime. a pound of cotton for a penny. make it impossible for people to pay their debts. make labor so cheap that working people can only earn enough to pay interest to moneylenders and taxes to support the Government. and you will see again the return of that night with all its horrors intensified. Sir. let the man who lives by the sweat of his brow. and his Representative here. be not deceived by the shams and fablse pretenses that are thrown around this measure that is filled to the brim with the direst of consequences to millions of people. Let the laborer remember. and write it on his wristlets. carve it on his frontlets. and wear it as an amulet over his heart. that scarce money is his sleepless and unforgiving foe. a foe whose bosom never swells with a sigh of sorrow. whose eye never moistens with a tear of pity. No one can deny that it increases the burden of debt which labor must pay. No one can deny that it makes the lifestruggle darker and harder. One of the most distinguished advocates of the suppression of silver has but recentlysaid if we stop coining silver that the act will be a drag upon production and that suffocation and strangulation are words not too strong to express the agonies of a people who are encircled in the coils of this golden serpent. And yet. with our eyes open and looking down into the abyss of human suffering that yawns before us. we are entreated and importuned to drag the country to the edge of the precipice.and plunge it over into the tortures and agonies of contraction. to satiate the lust for gold. Sir. history has recorded on its pages every kind of scourge that has been sent upon mankind from the hand of his fellow. and it has carved the names of the guilty wretches on its pillory where they stand before the eyes of each recurring generation to suffer the execration due to the atrocity of their crimes. It tells of Nero vainly struggling to extinguish the truths of Christianity by lighting the streets of Romewith the burning bodies of her missionaries. of Tamerlane discussing philosophy with the sages of Aleppo while his savage soldiery were gathering the heads of his slaughtered foemen into monumental piles to please the eye of the royal invader. it tells of Philip II sacking. burning. and butchering the helpless inhabitants of the Netherlands. loyal to his kingdom and crown. because they elected to worship at the shrines where conscience badethem kneel. it tells of the obliteration of Poland. the partition of its territory. the banishment andeonfinement of its unhappy people in the caves of Siberia by the sceptered robbers of Russia. Prussia. and Austria. it tells of the conquest and longcontinued oppression and robbery of Ireland by the kings. parliaments. and people of England for five hundred years. and that in the face of the remonstrances of all Christendom still stretches her victim on the bed of torture. But in all the wild. reckless. and remorseless brutalities that have marked the footprints of resistless power there is some extenuating circumstance that mitigates the severity of the punishment due to the crime. Some have been the product of the fierce passions of war. some have come from the antipathy that separates alien races. some from the superstitions of opposing religions. But the crime that is now sought to be perpetrated on more than fifty millions of people comes neither from the camp of a conqueror. the hand of a foreigner. nor the altar of an idolater. But it comes from those in whose veins runs the blood of a common ancestry. who were born under the same skies. speak the same language. reared in the same institutions. and nurtured in the principles of the same religious faith. It comes from the cold. phlegmatic. marble heart of avariceavarice that seeks to paralyze labor. increase the burden of debt and fill the land with destitution and suffering to gratify the lust for gold [applause]-avarice surrounded by every comfort that wealth can command. and rich enough to satisfy every want save that which refuses to be satisfied without the suffocation and strangulation of all the labor in the land. With a forehead that refuses to be ashamed it demands of Congress an act that will paralyze all the forces of production. shut out labor from all employment. increase the burden of debts and taxation. and send desolation and suffering into all the homes of the poor. In this hour. fraught with peril to the whole country. I appeal to the unpurchased representatives of the American people to meet this bold and insolent demand like men. Let us stand in the breach and call the battle on. and never leave the field until the peoples money shall be restored to the mints on equal terms with gold as it was years ago.

I desire to say thatthebill doubtless has been inspired by a purpose to correct what has been acknowledged to be an evilin this country. caused by the action of corporations who employ large numbers of laborers. Railroad companies and large manufacturers have. in order to obtain the service of persons in their employ at reduded rates. made contracts with persons abroad to come to this country to labor in their employ. That is an evil. and is acknowledged to exist in this country. and I suppose that the bill was inspired by the idea of correcting that evil. but the bill illustrates the tendency of the human mind to go to extremes. .In order to correct an admitted evil. we are adopting a measure which is very sweeping in its character. Under the operations of this bill no man can aid the immigration to this country of a person from a foreign country to labor. with the understanding that he is to remunerate him for the advance which he has made. in any pursuit whatever. It so happens that in many agricultural sections of this country there is a scarcity of labor at times. There is a great disinclination on the part of a great many people in this country to work on farms. As soon as the sons of farmers come to manhood they are inclined to seek some other employment. Thus in many sections of the country agricultural pursuits labor under a great disadvantage from the scarcity of laborers necessary to their employment. At this very time there is in my State an association of flrmers. Ibelieve commissioners. appointed for the purpose of trying to secure help 1i8R5. fl FFBiuArY 17. upon the farms. A farmer needs a man to labor in his service. and some person will say. I will get you a man from abroad if you will pay for his transportation here. Heis to be brought here not to work in mines. not to work upon railroads. not to work in large factories. butto labor on the farm. A farmer makes the advance in order that sor man may come and help him perform manual labor upon his farm. ana yet this bill would prohibit him from doing that. There is no harm in doing that.. it is bringing an industrious class of people here. I admit there is an evilwhere large importations of foreign labor are made for the purpose of Teducing the wages of employds andwhere the contracts for labor are made abroad. That is an evil which I would help to correct. but we are too sweeping in all these provisions. I desire that the amendment which I have offered. excepting agricultural laborers. may prevail. because. living in an agricultural community. I know the fact myself that there is often a necessity for agricultural labor which is not to be commanded. and no harm can result from the provision. I hope the amendment which I have suggested will commend itself to the favorable consideration of the Senate. as I am sure it will prove beneficial in many agricultural sections of the country."},{"1":"1884","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. Chairman. in every meritorious contest between labor and capital or any force or combination antagonistic to the real interests of labor I have ever been and ever desireto be upon the side of the latter. and I greatly desire in all my officialacts while occupying a seat in this body to so speak and vote upon all questions relating to the laboring classes as to advance their interests and their cause. If I may be pardoned a personal allusion. Iwill say that by birth. education. and experience I have all my life been identified with the classes who labor and earn their bread by the sweat of their brows. not that I have always toiled as a laborer in the shop or the field. but that life with me has been one of continual and unabated labor from youth until the present moment. and. sir. believing as I do that in our day it has become possible fbrdesigning and unprincipled men. backed by the power of large sums of money. to so organize and combine in their purposes and schemes for personal aggrandizement as to perpetrate gross hardships and injustice upon those who are engaged in what is called common labor. I unhesitatingly avow it to be my desire that the Congress of the United States in all matters bearing upon thegeneral labor system of the country shall enact laws for the protection. security. and prosperity of those who now and for generations yet to come shall pass their days in those vocations of life in which the greatest exactions of toil are demanded by the very necessities which compel them to labor. But. sir. while I feel free to make this avowal I am firmly impressed with the conviction that every act of legislation in this direction should be the result of deliberation and wisdomthat. in fact. every law of the nature of the oneunder consideration should be founded upon principles of right. doing justly by all who may be affected thereby. and if I could bring my mind to regard the measure now under discussion as one thus founded I would cheerfully give it my support. but I do not so regard it. and in its present form I can not support it. My first impressions of the bill. as I listened to the argument of the gentleman having it in charge and to his recital of the history of the socalled eighthour legislation. were favorable to its passage. It seemed to me that if the Government in years past has violated this law which is now and for a number of years has been upon our statutebooks. or has permitted its agents and officers. its heads of Departments. to disregard the law and so manage the affairs of their. Departments as to work injustice to a large class of laborers employed by them. the men whowere thus employed and compelled to pertbrm more labor per day than the law required have or ought to have such claims against the Government for the value of such time as they have labored in excess of that demanded by the law as are worthy of consideration in the manner proposed by thisbill. butas the discussion hasprogressed and I have gi ven further thought to the subjectmatter. I have become settled in the conviction that the bill should be defeated. During the afternoon I have been led to consider the real purpose and policy of the Government in placing upon the statutebooks the enactments to which gentlemen have referred. and one of the questions. that has suggested itself to my mind is this: Was it the purpose of the Government in enacting this law that purely financial benefit should result to the classes contemplated. or was it the purpose of the Government to legislate with a view to secure to its employ6s more time for rest. pleasure. and culture--to say to them the Government is. willing to accept from you eight hours of labor per day. instead of nine. ten. or twelve. and compensate you therefor as for a greater number of hours. leaving to you the balance of the time to be disposed of as you may see proper ? Now. sir. I believe the policy of Congress was to secure such benefits as I have suggested rather than enlarged pecuniary gain to the classes comprehended by the law. I do not urge. however. that this is by any means an answer to the arguments adduced by the friends of this measure. but that in arriving at our conclusions we should not overlook considerations that bear upon the spirit and true policy of the law. But there are. I think. a number of substantial and Satisfactory objections to establishing a precedent fbr the payment of arrearages of pay to civil emnploycs. What is the fhct with reference to this matter? It is alleged here. and I accept the statement as true. that certain heads of Departments have for a number of years violated or permitted the. violation of this statute. but that it was largely done by or through a system of special contracts. which in one or more cases have been construed legal by our Supreme Court. and by the terms of which contracts the employs. knowing the law. consented to become parties to. its violation. Now. I insist that those persons who knowingly and willfully become guilty of violating the law should not receive at our hands thefavorable consideration accorded to those who have had respect unto. and obeyed the laws of the land. These men were not compelled. at least legally speaking. to enter upon any such engagement. Theywere free citizensfreei moral. and commercial agentsand could engage or not as they saw proper. They concluded. knowing -the law.. to engage to perform this service. They entered into solemn contract. and Said we agree to this proposition. and will accept the compensation which you engage to pay us. The contracts were consumnmated by the perfbrmance of the labor. and the Government through its. officers paid the agreed price. and here. it seems to me. the case should rest in so far as any further compensation is concerned. The accounts. between the Government and its employrs have been settled agreeably to contract and to the satisfaction of the parties. as judged by thespirit and terms in which they engaged to perform the services. I insist now. as a matter of law and sound policy. that we ought not in these cases which I think involve largely the principle of class legislation. to open those questions which have been settled and to throwwide the doors of the Treasury to claims of the character contemplatedJ by this bill. and which concern a class of men better able. in my judgment. to forego the proposed additional compensation than the thousands of our laboring people the country over. who. year by year. arc submitting to wrongs far more grievous to be borne than the socalled loss of certain time by menwho received the full agreed price for their labor. There is another point upon which I wish to base an argument right here. Both of these parties have been guilty of a violation of the statute. and as all lawyers know who are familiar with the most ordinary principles of law it is manifestly against public policy to reward either party to a contract when that contract was itself a violation of the law. The violation of this statute was wrong. was bad faith. and contrary to good public policy. Gentlemen may say that as to the officers of the Government it certainly was contrary to good policy. But I insist that this claim applies equally to both contracting parties. and that each should be left where they have by their own voluntary acts placed themselves. and where the law says they should remain. I am opposed to this bill upon many other grounds. one of which I would like to state before my time expires. I am opposed to opening this door to claims for back pay for the further reason that there are many thousands of soldiers throughout this broad land who. as the result of their service during the dark days of war. now bear upon their bodies not only the scars of battle but permanent injuries unfitting them for the active duties of liMe. Many of them come here to us and ask fbr special pensions. not being able to obtain them through the Pension Office. I am glad to attest the generosity of this Congress in meeting this class of cases fairly and in granting pensions to many hundreds of those who have thus applied for relief. But let me remind this comnfittee that with perhaps one or two exceptions we have denied to these men any thing like arrears of pensions. Yet here is a proposition to grant by special legislation to people who labored years ago. under contracts which have been consummated and settled. arrearsof compensation for the labor they have performed. With all of my feeling of friendship for the laboring classes I do not regard this as a step which ought to be taken. Let me say further that. as I understand it. this Congress declines positively in cases of injuries to persons employed in the civil service of the nation. and who may while so employed have been seriously injured by or through no fault of their own. but as a result of the negligence of colaborers or those superintending the work in hand. to grant any compensation or pension to the party so injured. Now. I insist that while we refuse to the deserving soldiers of the land. who exposed their lives to the furies of war. arrears of pension. even when their disability at or since discharge is clearly established. and while we decline to compensate or pension worthy laborers who are injured in our civil service. it would be grossly unjust to single out this class of fortunate laborers and grant them arrears of pay. ir. Chairman. I am most heartily in favor of the rigid enforcement of this law while it remains upon our statutebook. and I am not now in favor of its repeal. but. sir. I beg to urge that enforcement can be accomplished without the necessity of passing such a sweeping measure as this. which. in addition to many other objections. is unaccompanied by any estimate as to the amount of money required to meet its demands. Some gentlemen seem to be of opinion that the most direct. speedy. and efficient way to accomplish enfbrcement is to compel payment at once of an immense amount of money. as if that proceeding would punish the Government and cause it to beware of the future. as might be the case were it a sensitive. economical capitalist. but. sir. this. in my jdidgment. is not the proper way to reach the desired object. Heads of Departments and all officials of the Government are subject to the control of the people. as represented by the Congress. and it any official is persisting in violating this law. let us at once proceed by proper legislative action to call him to accountability and compel obedience by mandates within our power. The important consideration with reference to this matter. unless I ain in error. is to secure for the future strict and faithful observance of this law. in deference not only to the law itself. but to that worthy sentiment in the country that is seeking the highest good and largest degree of prosperity to the laboring classes of the land. [Here the hammer fell.]"},{"1":"1883","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Mr. President. I owe the Senate and the country an apology for having said one word upon this question. I have been sitting in my seat desiring earnestly the passage of a tariff bill. refraining from discussion. allowing every argument and sophistry which could be imagined to be presented by the other side of the Chamber without reply. because I desired the passage of this bill. and I thought that the other side did not. I should apologize for having provoked anew the repetition of this old story which we have heard over and over again when any Senator on this side has attempted to say a single word in reference to the policy of this country with regard to a tariff. But it having been said. I can not allow it to pass without some few words of reply. and I will endeavor in the fewest possible moments. I think not exceeding ten minutes. to make some suggestions and to ask some questions which it seems to me will let some little light in upon the position occupied by the Senator from Kentuckyand the other sideof this Chamber. First. with reference to the illustration which the Senator drew between the raising of tropical fruits in New England or elsewhere in the colder climates of the North and manufacturing. The conditions of nature are against the raising of tropical fruits in a N orthern climate. but the conditions of nature are not against manufaeturing in this country. The conditions of nature favor it. There is no spot on this whole wide world where manufacturing can be carried on so successfully and in the end so economically and cheaply as in this country of ours. I do not speak of New England alone. I speak of the whole country. Manufacturing. first established. perhaps. inNew England. likeall other incidents of civilization. has been taking its march westward. New England is no longer the manufacturing section of this country. Manufacturing has passed out of the borders of New England. it has spread over New York and Pennsylvania. it has crossed the Alleghany Mountains. it has gone out on the plains of the West. it has gone into the States of the South. it is no longer a local industry. Senators talk as if New England were standing herepleading for manufacturing. It is not New England. it is the whole nation that is interested in it. New England is fast losing its prestige in this respect. The West and the South. States like Illinois. Colorado. California. Georgia. and Alabama. are in fierce competition with New England in manufacturing and in many respects beating her in the race. We do not complain. We have in this country all the resources of nature to enable us to manufacture cheaply. unlimited waterpower. coal. iron. and all minerals. we have the best labor in the world. intelligent labor. skillful labor. men of genius. men of invention. we surpass.the world in enterprise andin the inventive faculty and genius necessary to cheapen the processes and products of manufacturing. and yet we stand here and hear day after day the doctrine proclaimed that we do not want any manufacturing in this country. The Senator from Kentucky desires to sweep it all out of existence. He says the people will rally in their might to destroy the edifices whick have been erected under our system of protection to manufactures. - lHe wants this country to discard the policy of protecting any manufacturing industry. I want to put a few pertinent questions. I want to know if the Senator from Kentucky. if any other Senator on this floor. believes that this country would be any better off today if manufacturing had never been established here. I did not interrupt the Senator."},{"1":"1882","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Let the report be read.

Generals Office files in evidence a surgeons certificate. dated Chapel Springs Hospital. Fort Saratoga. D. C.. March 1. 1864.recommending said Abbey for a leave of absence. in which the surgeon says: He has carefully ani repeatedly examined this officer during the last year. and finds that he has had frequent attacks of malarial fever. complicated with pleuritic and neuralgic pain. He is seldom free from pain from the latter complaints. and. owing to frequent attacks of the former. theircombined influence has unfitted him for duty much of the time. The post at which his battery is serving is especially tainted with malaria. and. in my opinion. unless he is permanently removed froi it lie will never recover. On this certificate said Abbey was allowed a sick leave. The return for May. 1864. repots him  absent. sick at Washington. District of Coluibia. since May 27. 1864. On November 2.1864. he was honorably discharged on account of physical disaiilty. A transcript from the records of the SurgconGenerals Office reports: Captain Abbey. Compan K.

He was admitted to treatmont by the attendant surgeon of volunteer officers at Washington. District of Columbia. May 23. 1864. for acute dysentery. and detailed on C. M. June 10. John G. Moore. in an affidavit filed December 30. 1879. states that he has known claimant since 1859. and knows that at the time of enlistment he was a sound man. that he visited said Abbey when he was sick at Camp Lincoln. Virginia. and that during the entire period intervening from date of discharge to the present time he hits been suffering with disease of the liver and spleen. and has not been able to perform manual labor. Captain R. M. Gomedie. in an affidavit. swears that claimant was sound at time of enlistment. and contracted intermittent fever at Fort Lincoln. Virginia. April 1. 1801. that during every fall and spring while he remained in the service lie suffered from like attacks of said fever. and was subsequently discharged on ac. count of se. Mrs. Hannah Turner and Henry C. Ford make affidavit that at different inter. vale during the whole period intervening between the spring of 1815 and fall of 1876 the said Abbey received more or less treatment (medical) from Dr. William M. Tanner. now deceased. for enlarged liver and spleen. as a result of malarial fever contracted in theArmy. Dr. Towashend. who took medical charge of claimant in January. 1877. makes an affidavit that he treated claimant for enlarged liver and spleen until October 15. 1877. and that said Abbey was not able to perform labor during that time. .Dr. William A. Hammond. in a statement dated November 25. 1879. says claimant has been under his charge for the past six months for locomotor ataxia. &o. Upon this and other medical testimony the said Abbey was peusioned Januar. 23. 1880. at the rate of $15 per moant. to date from November 3. 1864. for effects of malarial poisoning. This pension was afterward increased to $24 per month. to date frm November 26. 1879. which pension the said Abbey now receives. There isin evidence an affidavit made by said J. N. Abbey tho26th of November. 1881. In which he says thatHe has for the past six and onehalf years been so totally disabled that he was unable to performl any manual labor. and. moreover. his ptiysical condition has. diring that time. been such that lie was and is compelled to keep a body servant to render him personal aid and attendance. An affildavit in evidence. made by Dr. Hamilton. of Philadelphia. Pennsylvania. March 7. 1882. states : I have known Captain Joseph N. Abbey for thepast three years. during which time he has inquired my constant attention as medical adviser. with the excepton of a period of three months.wiich was spent uder the care of another prartitinner. Upon taking nharge of the ease I made a thorough examination. with tie following result. Ski. pulse. and temperature normal. violent end stupefying paine in the occiput. accompanied with severe attacks of vertigo. faintness. and extreme prostration. alaost daily thoroeoccucred violent spasmodic action of the threat and neck. with a sense at impending suffocation . sond of beant. normal. but the osgan very irritable. svrs attacks of neuralgia of the chest and of the stomach. There was considerable enlargement of the spleen. with constant pain. also nt. largemont of the liver. with prostration of its functions. constipation and groat weakness. and numbness in the lower extremities. The symptoms above enumer. ated at times became aggravated to such a doge that for two or three consecutive days at a time ho was confined to his bed. bt owing to the force of his indomitable will almost every day l has been conveyed to his office. frequently in a condition of the most intenelagony. During the thne in which he has been undermy caro I have been able to relieve the attacks at intervals. but the general candition of prostration and suffering still continues. The patient at present requires the care and watchfuhisssof a competent nurse. Knowing that his means were limited. I have not heretofore insisted upon the procuring of such a person. but nowdeem it of the most paramunt importance. The case of Captain Abbey is one that commends itself to the favorable consideration of those whose duty it is to provide for the soldiers who have lost their health in battling for the welfare of thcir country. The cause of the present fearful suffering of Catain Abbeyis exposure to malarisl influences while in the service of the United States. Dr. Samuel Cleveland makes affidavit that he has treated Joseph Nf. Abbey. andFound enlargement of liver and spleen. which we are accustomed to recognize as malarial. profund disturbances of nervois centers. cerebralinvolving pains of almost every kind and paretio conditions. transitory. but following in rapid sueceossion. cardiac--involving true angina and solar. creating gastric inability. Dr. Cleveland further says: That the condition of .oseph N. Abbey. while under his treatment. rendered him wholly unfit for anylabor from a physical standpoint. though his will han carried him by intervals through necessary work. greatly to his physical detri. mont. Willian C. Ewing makes an affidavit to Abbeys condition. and says: Ever since I became familiar with his everyday life I declare that I have not known lim to oejoy an hours release from pain or disability during that period. I also declare that since my personal acquaintance with him he has not been in a condition to perform any manuallabor. but he has had to depend entirely for what he could earn Mn braiii work. There are on I ls numerous other important affidavits to the effect that be was sound physically at the time of his enlistment. thathe is now unable to perform physical labor. and has in constant attendance upon him a nurse. andin addition to this has the extraordinary expense of being conveyed to and from the house in a carriage. &c. The ground of rejection at the Pension Office was the doctors inability to determine whether the disability would ls permanent or was of such a character as to bring him under the general law. The medical record covers a period of twenty Tears. and shows conclusively that the disability is a continuous one. and the medical affidavits filed since the rejection at the Pension Office show that his infirmities are increasing. and undoubtedly will soon place himin a condition of themost complete helplessness. Now. judging from the long medical record. the suffering of the claimant. sa the fact that hi is so much worse today than he was twenty years age. and now has to employ the services of a constant attendant. are pretty conclusive proofs as to the parmanency of hIis disease. Your committee regard this case as one of extreme disability and suffering. and therefore recommend the passage of Senate bill 1264. with the following amend. ment : In line seven. immediately preceding the word dollars. strike out the word seventytwo and insert in lieu thereof the word fifty. Your committee likewise ask that the bill pass."},{"1":"1881","2":"S","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"To be entirely safe. I think the number in the SurgeonGenerals Office ought to be increased at least to the amount he asked. independent of the increased force of the Pension Office. that is. fifty clerks. There are two or three reasons why that is necessary. It is in the line of economy of time. If a claim is waterlogged. so to speak. in the SurgeonGenerals Office. it will be the subject of two or three inquiries during a session of Congress on the part of members of the House and Senators who may be solicited to make those inquiries. The occasion of a large amount of extra labor is in replying to letters. and but for which the ordinary business of the office would move more rapidly. PI think myself that in view of what the SurgeonGeneral has stated. the number of clerks in line 1305ought to be made ninety in place of sixtyfive. and I will move. if no one else will. to make the number of clerks ninety. !..Mr. DAVIS. of West Virginia. I suggest to the Senator. as there is a difference of opinion between the committee and himself. and as the committee have tried to arrive at the same end that he has in view. whether he had not better stop a little short of that number. Twentyfive would be rather a large increase. I suggest to the Senator to add fifteen to the sixtyfive and make it eighty instead of ninety. and not say what they are to do. letting the SurgeonGeneral employ them in copying if he thinks proper. or put them on pension work jast as he may be pressed to do. That is. add forty clerks in all instead of twentyfive as the committee has done. I suggest that to the Senator. I know he does not want to go beyond the necessities of the Government."},{"1":"1880","2":"H","3":"Yes","4":"NA","5":"Mr. Speaker. I shall occupy but a few moments in the consideration of this case. It was not my purpose to say a word upon it. With a great deal of reluctance I came to the conclusion that the sitting member. Mr. Siemens. upon the testimony found in the record. was entitled to hold his seat in this House. I came to that conclusion following the precedents which make the law for the government of this body. * There are many things in and about this case not in the reeord. and there are some things thrown into the record which excite a very considerable amount of suspicion that the coutestee was not entirely free from very bad conduct in the course of the election in his district in 1878. But.Mr. Speaker. one thing is trueand upon that my distinguished friend from Iowa will agree with methat the testimony here which attacks a portion of the majority of the contestee obtained in that election is insufficient to overthrow his entire majority. In all kindness to the gentleman from Iowa. without desiring to detract at all from the glory he may take in attempting to assume here to be the champion of free elections. let me say that in his report he did not find that any such thing had happened as would suffice to overthrow the entire majority returned for the sittin member. The gentlemans very short report is not quite up to his boldness on the floor of the House. for it simply suggests that there may be something in this case tending to show that Mr. Siemens was not elected. In the discharge of our duty here toward a fellowmember. are we called upon on such a finding as that to oust the sitting member I I wish to observe here that I do not deny the right of the House to reject the entire vote of a voting precinct where it is shown that intimidation. fraud. or bribery so far entered into the election as to render it impossible to eliminate it from the honest vote cast. But in such case the unlawful means used in a particular voting place would not vitiate the election held in other voting places in the district. Mr. Speaker. there is one question which may arise. and doubtless has arisen. in the minds of many gentlemen around me. Suppose it appears by the proof that the sitting members majority as returned is 2.827 . suppose it appears that of this majority 2.000 votes were obtained through intimidation. fraud. or other improper means. suppose it appears that these 2.000 votes ought to be struck off of the contestees majority. because the proof shows that he was guilty of fraud and violence. suppose his majority is thus reduced to about 800. Now. are we upon that sort of finding called upon to say that this gentleman was not elected. Let it be understood that we give to the contestant the benefit of every claim. every shadow of claim. that he submits. yet in the case I put it leaves the contestee with a majority of 800 unattacked. Upon such a case are you prepared to find that the contestee. as a matter of law. was not elected ? That would be equivalent to saying that because he claims 2.800 majority and was entitled to claim only 800. therefore he is not elected at all. This is a proposition which the gentleman from Iowa does not meet and cannot meet. In his report lie does not undertake to say that the majority of the contestec was overcome. He does suggest that if the House would find certain things which he does not undertake to say were proved by the evidence. then lie is in favor of the resolution which le subunits. The gentleman was a member of the subcommittee that examined this ease. and if he had been able to point the committee or the House to any evidence shoing that the majority of the contestee was overcome by reason of improper conduct on his part or on the part of his political friends. I would have been willing to respond to his appeal to vindicate the purity of the ballotbox. I would not draw fine legal distinctions to save the contestee or any person who might be guilty of polluting the ballotbox. But the gentleman does not make such a case. In his report he utterly fails to do so. Now let us go one step further. If the case which I put be truethat the contestee has an unlainted. unpolluted majority of 800are we to declare the seat vacant because he has been guilty of itimidation or fraud in the course of that election?"},{"1":"1879","2":"H","3":"NA","4":"Yes","5":"Will the gentleman from Pennsylvania concede that this law wts unconstitutional?

I now read from the report proper: We find thatfrom various causes there has been of late years a decrease in the width and also in the depth of the chanact and that the harbor itself has been gradually shoaling. Then the report goes on to give the causes. To restore the integrity of the harbor and to makeit eubservjentto theincreasing wants of commerce will require extensive dredging. involving liberal expenditures. Admirably protccted by its remoteness from the sea from any hostile demonstrations from without. with a climate where labor yields its best returns. and where skilled labor abounds. and accessible at all seasons of the year by its freedom from ice of sufficient thickness to obstruct its free navigation. its claims to favorable consideration assert themselves and require no argument to make them manifest. One of the recommendations isThat the bar opposite the mouth of the Western Branch should be deepened to twentyfive feet at mean low water fera distance of fortyeight hundred feet. and a width of five hundred feet. including slopes of repose. The dredging would here amount to three hundred thousand cudio yards. the average cut being one and onetenth yards. and the masimum nut one and eighttenths yards. This report is made by Commodore Stevens to the honorable Secretary of War in relation to improving the harbor and the necessity of further expenditures for its improvement.

We only entered upon the erection of this new building very recently. and so far as the War and Navy Departments are concerned new buildings would not have been erected for them at all had it not been in connection with fihe State Department. It becomes necessary to erect a building for the State Department because there was no building at all for that Department. Gentlemen will remember that the State Department was at thc north end of the Treasury building. but the new Treasury building was built slowly and was the work of years. and when. in the progress of its reconstruction the corner where the old State Department was reached. it was torn down and the Treasury building was extended. We had then no building for the State Department. and the necessity for a new building for that Department lead to the idea that a building should be put up which would include the War and Navy Departments. But for this. even in the prosperoutimes which we had a few years ago. when the country was feeling no burden at all. I think the construction of a new Navy and War Department would not have been thought of. But it was perhaps well enough that the work was entered on in connection with the new State Department. There is. however. no such necessity of haste about this matter as to require us to throw the labor of years into a single year and place on the industries of the country burdens of taxation in a single year which ought to be borne for a period of several years. Let us learn something from our fathers in reference to this matter of burdening the people for public works. There is one item to which neither the gentleman from Maine nor the gentleman from Pennsylvania has referred. and that is the insertion in this bill of a provision which was not referred in any form to the committee of conference. I believe there have been few instances of this kind. but I feel confident that with a full knowledge of the fact every gentleman will concur in the provision. It was found thatthe agents for the Alaska forseal fisheries bad not been provided for in any of the appropriation bills and had been overlooked in the estimates. We have four of these agents. or rather one principal agent and three assistants at the islands of Saint George and Saint Paul. Their compensation is fixed by law. and the amount to be received by them as traveling expenses to Alaska and back for the purpose of counting the number of skins taken from the fur seals is also provided by law. Under these circumstances and at the urgent request of the Treasnry Department. the committee of conference consented to incorporate an appropriation of the necessary amount of money. providing at the same time for abolishing two of these assistants after the 1st day of next October.

Now. Mr. President. I claimed in my opening remarks. and I still claim. that it is nothing but a revenue measure. There is not a single tax proposed lere that is asked for in the way of protection. there is only a proposition made to increase the tax upon articles on which we now levy duties. But I should iot expect to find a tax bill here or a bill imposing duties upou foreign imports that would receive the approbation of the Senator from oMissouri. I know that home protection is the black beast that always excites his hostility. Bit he must bear this in mind. that we have a large revenue to collect in order to meet the interest of the public debt and the ordinary public expenditures. and that the duties will be incidentally protective in their effects to more or less extent. That we cannot help if se would. and would not if we could. I aun quite sure that the premier of England would be entirely satisfied with any tariff that would suit the Senator from Missouri. He could not have here a more efficient advocate of the interests of Great Britian than the Senator from Missouri. He would say. buy always where we can buy cheapest. But still we have to impose taxes upon our people. We cannot manufacture merchandise of various kinleJ or ships at time same rate that they might be purchased where labor is less appreciated than it is here. and therefore we should have to go abroad for all or nearly all that we should consume. and that would suit British interests. and I am frank to say that I believe from the sentiments avowed by the Senator from Missouri would best suit him. But. Mr. President. there was one fact stated by the Senator from Missouri. and partially assented to by the Senator from Ohio. the chairman of the Committee on Finance. that I must controvert and rebut. and that is. if we impose these increased duties upon sugars we raise the duty up to 80. 90. or 100 per cent. That is an utter fallacy. and. as.I understand it. wholly without fomdation. Look at the present prices of sugars. Yon find today that sugars clayed. No. 12. bring in our market *- cents per pound. They are only taxed 2J cents per pound. or about 25 per cent. of the home valuation. Is that SO or 90 per cent.? Of course the grocers profit made on sugars is generally not over a quarter or a half cent per pound. When you come to the lower grades. you find that the prices of thelower grades of sugar are utterly inconsistent with any idea that they have paid a duty of 80 or 90 per cent. It is an absurdity to suppose any such thing. It may be possible that on some very itferior quality. tankbottom sugar or low grade. dirty sugars. such aa are sometimes brought from India. where there is scarcely perhaps a difference between such sugars and melada. they may pay a hig1her rate. hut the ordinary rate of duties imposed by the present taxiff on common sugars ia.got over somewhere about 331 per cent. Mr. President. I did not intendI to iay anything more upon this bill. but I do not like to have it supposed that I would foist a bill upon the Senate without having the Senate fully uderstand Its merits as well as its demerits. I have therefore conceded that this was not such a bill as would suit Mue. not such a bill as I would be glad to support.

I cannot say precisely. as my fliend from Nebraska has said. that after listening to tle honorable Senator from Maic lie concludes to vote as lie has lone heretofore. but I will say that the speech of my honorable friend fron Illinois [Mr. LooiAx] last night. among other reasons. induced me to change my vote. aud I shall now vote to take the recess. The speech of the Senator from Illinois. however. is not the only reason. Since the action of the Snaite a few days ago I have takent the trouble to inquire of certain Senators. who voted with me at that time against a recess. as to whether they intended to remain emre or not. and I find that the very patriotic gentlemen who are so elotuent agains9t the recess propose to go houe and leave tim rest of us hero without aquorum. If tlatis to be the caseaimj t d lgi tg by all past. experience it will beI can see nothing to be gained by refusing the recess. And I wish to say with reference to it that I do not thus vote Oil account of any personal conveniene to myseif. as suggested by the honorable Senator from Maine. Shoul I consult my own personal convenience and preferences alone. I would prefer that the .Senate should remain in session. If the recess be ftken I presunte that. with other gentlemen upon whom the Senate has devolved a certain public duty. I shall leiave the city. but consumltiiig my own fcehngs I very much prefer to reinit although I believe the business with which tlint connittee is charged is important . :ind by reason of certain promises that have been made to the people of tie South I feel under an obligation to go into that section of tlew country for the purpose of investigating one of the great questios of the dtay. Therefore. sir. not seeking niy own personal convenience at all. Uot consulting my personal preferences. but consnlting wholly my ideas of public duty. I shall vote for this recess. A single word as totthe positio in i which certain gentlemen on this floor seek to place some of us who favor the aljournment. The honorable Senator froni Illiuois last might clargtt that the Senate was unwilling. or had refused. to grant Oven two days extension of time to consider the qubstion of the bankrupt law.- that. with the present necessities. to which he referred. npoi us. we refused to vote an extesion of even two days. I know of no suelt action on the part. of this body. I have heard of no such vote. I certainly have not refused to extend the tiue for two or three thays. tor has any other Senator. to my knowledge. That proposition has neer been before the Setate. but those gentlemen who are so patriotic of) his question did last night.. for an hour or two. by dilatory motions. prevett i1s from acting on the adjournment qnastim at all. Had the resolution beet brought before the Senate last night. I have no doubt that an extension of two or three days would have been granted. it thiereb3 anything eoth have beeti acconlpisied. I. for one. am quite willing that the recess shall tako place on Monday next. aud if we can have the assuratce that any important measure can ic acttd upion in tlfe men time. I will vote for such an extension. Bitt it is amisrepresenting. nnintentionally of course. the action of those republicans who voted as I did to say tltrt we have reused to grant two or three days extension of timo. There has been no such voto takerl. On the other band. wheu the H1ouse of Representatives send a resoluttion of this hind to us. we indelinitely postpone it. aud refhse to act upon it. at aI. When we sought to call it up last iight. aud ttke the sense of the Seutate upon it. what was the result? Dilatory tattions . motions to prevent action upot the resoltion itself. Let ate say to gentlemen that a ten years service in the House of Representatives has taught inc that they expect their action to Io treated with some slight degree of consideiation and respect. If the Senate is opposed to granting this recess. after two resolutions of the kind have come from the louse. passed tetre by a very large majority. let is y so squarely. If it he tlesirable to ainiOd it so as to extend the time for two or three days. let it be done. and send the resolution back to the House for concurrence . but if a resolution of this kind is to be denied a respectful consideration. and then you expect the other branch of Congress to sit here during the recess. whei they know. as you know. Mr. President. and as I know. and as I believe every other Senator knows. that there will not be a quorum here to do business. I can guarantee on the part of the Iouse that you will not ind a quorum there. Now. sir. if you seek to do anything with reference to the bankrpt law. my impression is that the only thing that can be done is to take the bill that passed the House of Representatives and iass it here. I ant in favor of its passage. Yo can act upon that within two hours. I take it. and if there be any further legislation neces.sar. whon you conic back again after the recess you call enact it. Bit. sir. if you seek to amend the bill of the House upon the subject of the bankrupt law by such provisions as have required our able Judiciary Committee to spend some three weeks of hard labor upon them. and yet. as said by the Senator fromnt Virginia. they have not yet been able to agree upon themif you expect yea cau amend it in that way. and receive the concurrence of the House of Representatives. you will find that the bill will not become a law until after the 1st of January. If you seek for relief. then. Senators. for that class of people who are oppressed. take up the House bill and pass it. and when you come back after the holidays deliberately reenact such parts of the law as may be necessary. Very much has been said about the will of the people on this subject. The Senator from Illinois last night. and other Senators. spoke eloquently about the wishes of the people. charging us with disregarding their wishes. and the honorable Senator fioii Illinois read us a very modest lecture upon our duties as Senatorsan exceedingly modest lecture. For one. I appreciate the modesty of any Senator who gets up on tlis floor and reads to his peers a lecture as to their duty. I take it very kindly. I am glad that we have a. censor over our consciences. and that there are those who are willing to tell us not only what their individual duty is. but also what toy duty is. But. sir. I could not help. while Ie was speaking. compairing the parties to this question. Oi the one side is the House of Reprosucitatives. the direct representatives of tie will and the wishes of the people of this country. on the other (and I mention it in confidence) arc the candidates for the Presidencytho representatives of the people against the candidates for the Presidencyand tho vote. when it conies. will show whether the candidates are in the majority."}],"options":{"columns":{"min":{},"max":[10]},"rows":{"min":[10],"max":[10]},"pages":{}}}
