380 million gallons a day of sewage being dumped in this estuary that they talk about. this environment they are trying to protect. when you think about that much sewage being dumped into the delta on a daily basis. you hear the same people talking about trying to protect it. there are things going on in that delta. and they have been restricting our water for the last 20 years. and it has not saved that species. there are provisions in these bills that actually help. we attacked the invasive species that is attacking the delta smelt. the striped bass. we have offered that provision many times. we are offering many solutions. like the author mentioned earlier. we have had language in probably five different pieces of legislation going through the house over to the senate. we have begged for an open and transparent process where we can debate this and have some commonsense ideas brought forward and voted and signed into law so that we can help both our communities. if you truly care about the delta. stop polluting it. if you truly care about the people of california and what it costs to feed your families. if you truly care about farm workers. if you truly care about these small communities. you would care about water and doing this right and having an honest debate. now. i have been approached off camera a million times now to have another offcamera conversation about this. and we have said all along: no more conversation like that. everything on the floor. this is an open. transparent process. five pieces of legislation have this language in it. and we are going to continue to push until we can get some support so we can fix this problem. so those little communities in my district that people claim to care about could actually turn on a faucet and fill a pot of water so they can make themselves some food to eat and some dinner. maybe bathe their children. because that is where we are today. we have houses that. when they turn on a faucet. they no longer have water. and i get the whole junior water rights concern. but if they were truly concerned about the environment. they would give up some of their water. but you look at hetch hetchy. that has had 100 percent of their water and continues to deliver that water via pipeline all the way to san francisco without one conversation about that water being able to help some of these rivers and some of these species. but they are not willing to give up any of their water. they are willing to take other peoples water. it is the same thing we hear about on so many different issues. take someone elses product. or someone elses water and try to solve another problem with it. and the problem has to be solved the right way: language that we have offered. that has been offered into these amendments. into these bills. and that we have pushed over to the senate. and the conversation has to be had in an open. transparent process like our senators have told us they wanted. so we are here. we are ready for that conversation. we want an honest debate. and we want to talk about the way we actually fix these problems. we are not going to try to accommodate communities dumping their sewage in the delta. but we want to help those species. and there is language in there to do that. even language in there to help capture some of the water. use some of the infrastructure we have paid for as taxpayers and allow it to be used to its full capacity so we can continue to store water that we do have and not waste it. this is an honest piece of language that could actually help solve californias problems. and i think we need to continue to have an honest debate.","mr. speaker. i rise today to honor mr. danny trull. sr.. on his retirement as the united auto workers unions (uaw) assistant director for his service to the men and women of the united automobile workers. and for his years of service on the texas state democratic executive committee. mr. trulls welldeserved retirement comes after a fortytwo year tenure in organized labor. during this time. mr. trull has been dedicated to advocating for workers rights. promoting the values of the democratic party. and supporting the local. state and national labor movement. during his years of work with the labor movement. mr. trull has made a direct impact on his community through his numerous roles at uaw and with the democratic party of texas. mr. trull began his career at uaw on july 9. 1973. when he started working for tyler refrigeration and became a member of local 514. upon the closing of local 514. he became a member of local 276 and went on the international staff in 1987. working in the time study department. in 1996. he transferred to region 5 as a service representative based in the dallas office and continued to serve region 5 out of the dallas office when he was transferred to the national cap department in 2007. he was appointed to his current position of assistant regional director in 2012. from which he is retiring at the end of this year. aside from his work with uaw. trull has continued to be a community leader as a delegate to state and national democratic conventions. and as a state democratic executive committee member in 2002. mr. trull is a wellknown champion for texas jobs and workers. coordinating uaw political activity in the state and region and fighting for higher wages and benefits for hardworking americans. the automobile industry is a powerful economic engine in the 33rd congressional district and will continue to be for years because of mr. trulls lifelong commitment to his community and the people who live and work there. i wish him all the best. in honor of mr. trulls retirement and his dedication and leadership within the public service community. this statement will be submitted on monday. november 16. 2015.","mr. president. i rise today to join my colleague from rhode island to talk a little bit about a very important piece of legislation we are introducing. it is called the comprehensive addiction and recovery act of 2014. i think it is fair to say that senator whitehouse from rhode island and i do not agree on everything in this body that comes upall the policy issues. but on this one we agree that it is necessary to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to deal with this heroin epidemic that is sweeping across our country. he has been an unwavering ally in trying to find common ground on this legislation. i appreciate him. again. i think this is an area where we can find common ground on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the capitol to move legislation forward that can help to deal with this growing issue in our states. i do not think we can afford to wait. every day. unfortunately. the number of people who die from heroin overdoses grows. every day more mothers and fathers. brothers and sisters. sons and daughters are lost to this horrible scourge. by the time this year is out. i am told that more than 19.000 ohioans will have overdosed on heroin or other opiates. the deaths from heroin overdoses this year will be the no. 1 cause of death in the state of ohio. exceeding traffic accidents. elected officials around the country. medical professionals. and grass roots volunteers are dealing with this issue. they are fighting back. they are doing everything in their power to try to save lives and to try to stem this epidemic. but they need help. the challenge we all face is serious. to address it we need a comprehensive effort. marshaling the resources of communities. grass roots organizations. local. state. and. yes. the federal government. that is where we come in here. in the congress. i think only together can we make progress here and prevent new victims from falling into the grips of addiction. only together can we help those who are already struggling with heroin to rebuild their lives. i think this bipartisan legislation we have introduced today is the important first step in that. it lays out a broad spectrum response to the epidemic of heroin and opiate addiction. it starts with prevention and education. why? because we know that approach can work. obviously. it is the most effective way to deal with this. to keep you from getting into the addiction in the first place. nearly 20 years ago i joined with leaders around southwest ohio to form what is called the coalition for a drug free greater cincinnati. i was here in the congress on the house side. a constituent came to me and said her son had just died from an overdose of smoking marijuana and huffing gasoline. i was ready for her. i had all the statistics as to what we were doing at the federal level in terms of eradicating crops in places like colombia. interdicting drugs. prosecuting people. trying to stop the flow of drugs into this country. she kind of looked at me and said: how is that going to help me and my community? how would that have helped my kid? how does that help me deal with our church. where people are in denial and will not even talk about it. or our school. where the principal said: it is not a problem here. so we came up with this notion of these community coalitions. there were a few around the country. and they seemed to be working. ours in greater cincinnati has worked well. it is still working well. by working together with grass roots organizations across the spectrumteachers and parents. law enforcement. religious leaders. the media. businesswe pulled together a group. that coalition led to this greater effort that we started in the house. and there is legislation that i authored called the drugfree communities act. which has now provided funding. by the way. and therefore helped to create thousands of other community coalitions. it has provided funding to over 2.000 community coalitions around the country. there are now about 5.000. i think. around the country. those have worked. but they are not adequate to deal with this heroin epidemic. but we start there. we start with this notion that there is a way. through a grass roots program. for more focus on prevention and education to be able to help stem this growing problem. that is. stopping addiction before it even starts. that. of course. again. is the most effective way. it saves money. saves lives. we also. though. have to do more to incentivize new innovative treatment programs for those who have become addicted to try to break the cycle and break the addiction. we do that in this legislation by encouraging diversion programs like drug courts that provide treatment alternatives to incarceration. we do it by funding evidencebased heroin treatment pilot programs. there are some exciting new medications out there that we think are worth a try. including some new medications that actually block the urge. the craving. we are funding evidencebased treatment programs. but at the same time encouraging the use of emergency medications to stop overdoses. this is something we have seen in all of our states. it expands the availability of naloxone. which is an overdose inhibitor that the law enforcement agencies and other first responders have access to in order to be able to keep people not from overdosingwhich is happeningbut from dying from that overdose. we know that there have been many lives saved. even over the last couple of years through the use of that medication. we offer more resources to promptly identify and treat incarcerated individuals suffering from addiction disorders by collaborating with criminal justice stakeholders and. again. providing evidencebased treatment. this revolving door in the criminal justice system of people who are drug users getting into prison. getting out againand within 2 or 3 years over twothirds of them are back in the systemwe are all paying for that. the communities are paying for it with increased crime. the families are paying for it. the taxpayers are also paying for it-$25.000. $30.000 a year for incarcerating individuals. who. if you can get them into a drug treatment program. in part through these drug courts. in part through other programs that are proven to work. they can then not just get over their addiction and not be committing crimes but become productive citizens and taxpayers themselves. we have seen this lap around the country. we have to be encouraging that and supporting that at the federal level. i saw a model of this kind of approach when i visited the compdrug treatment center recently in columbus. oh. i met with several nurses and counselors who are there on the front lines in the battle against addiction. they used medicationassisted treatment. but they also use a lot of counseling to help men and women get on this path to recovery. so it is not just the medication. but it has to be a more comprehensive plan. they do this in both a public health capacity but also in connection with a prisoner reentry program. so. again. it is people coming out of the criminal justice system who have a history of addiction and to get them into this program so they can get not just the treatment they need to get over their addiction but the job training they also need to be able to get back into the workforce to become productive citizens. we do not stop here in this legislation. if there is one thing i have learned over the last couple of decades working in this area. it is that the best solutions on this are not going to come from washington. they are going to be developed at the grass roots. on the ground. what we can do is support those efforts on the ground and provide states with more flexibility to be able to use these resources that are already coming from washington. so our legislation does that as well. our bill offers states that are proactive at enacting proven policies the ability to benefit from support under state incentive grants. these grants will reward states such as ohio that are improving access to drugabuse services for specific atrisk individuals and that are working to reach 100percent compliance with programs such as the prescription drug monitoring program that tracks prescription drugs. some states such as ohiowhere we have a big prescription drug problemthere is also southern ohio with adjoining states west virginia and kentucky that have this issue and without a sufficient monitoring program. some people are getting prescription drugs filled in ohio and then going across the river to kentucky and getting them filled. there is no way to monitor that without an effective program. we want to encourage all states to adopt this kind of a program so we know who is getting prescription drugs. who needs them and who is abusing the process. we also talk about this issue in the abstract. i have done that today talking about numbers19.000 overdoses. but what does that mean? it is a shockingly high number. we sometimes forget that every one of those overdoses represents a person. a family member. someone who has hopes and dreams. someone who at some point made a mistake. and now that mistake threatens those dreams and often devastates their family. as i have seen and i am sure you have seen. sometimes it can even result in that persons death. as we talk about overdoses this year. it will be the no. 1 cause of death in my state of ohio. i want to share a couple stories briefly before i close. people i have met in ohio. people in communities in my state who are struggling with the weight of addiction. i recently met a guy about my age. his name is paul. paul came to a roundtable discussion and has been engaged in this issue because his son died of a heroin overdose. he was 19 years old. he died of an overdose 2 days after getting out of rehab. sadly. that is not an uncommon story. people go into rehab to turn their lives around and many are successful. but many arent. for some of them when they get out. the temptation is too great and unfortunately their body no longer has the tolerance for the drug it once did and sometimes they overdose. his son was one of those. this man has been in a lot of pain. i could tell. he is still in a lot of pain. but where he has channeled his grief and his pain is helping others to overcome addiction and to bring this discussion out of the dark. to talk about it. it is not a comfortable topic for a lot of people to talk about. but he has been willing to do it. to talk about his family situation and talk about the fact that every family around the kitchen table ought to be talking about this subject. we ought to be talking about it in the classrooms. we ought to be sure that people understand the incredible risk and danger our young people face today. earlier this year i met a young woman named sarah. sarah has been struggling to overcome her own addiction. she has been successful. and i applaud her. she told me: addiction starts in treatment. roe. but it also happens in the community. you have to have a surrounding that supports you and encourages you. she is fighting her own battle. but she is also doing something interesting at ohio state university. she has started a studentled recovery program. kind of a support network among students. again. often this is in the shadows. she has been the one to step forward and say: hey. i have an issue. i am a recovering addict. and i want other recovering addicts to come and join me and feel support so they dont do what pauls son did. then there is bill. bill is in recovery from a heroin addiction that he told me used to cost him $2.000 a week at its height. it cost him his freedom too. he ended up in prison. when he got out of prison. he was able to take advantage of some of these programs we talked about today. some of these prisoner reentry programs and treatment options. bill turned his life around. interestingly. he now works at the very corrections facility where he once served. as he joked with me. he said: i used to be behind bars. now i hold the keys to the cells and i am spreading a message. i imagine he is a very credible spokesperson for that message. he is working with inmates to help build relationships and reentry programs. not just in the prison behind the walls. but also in his community in canton. oh. he encourages employers to give people a second chance. to give them a shot. his quote to me was: dont give them the keys to the safe on the first day. but give them a shot. it worked for me. it can work for others. this battle against addiction will not be an easy one. we know that. but we also know it is well worth the fight. we have to take the fight. when we see the number of overdoses drop. and we see statistics showing that fewer kids are using drugs and more people are breaking free of the addiction that once held them. we will know it paid off. it is not only about dollars and cents. yes. we can save taxpayer money. we can be sure that more people are productively employed. and that our society is more efficient and communities are safer. but ultimately this is about our young people and what kind of future they are going to have. it is about our children and our grandchildren. will they have a better shot at their dream. a better shot at getting through school. getting an education. a better shot at getting a decent job and being able to hold it. and a better shot at being able to take care of their own families and having the dignity and selfrespect that comes with that? that is ultimately what this legislation is about. i thank senator whitehouse for joining with me to craft this legislation. i also thank senator leahy. who i understand has recently agreed to become an original cosponsor of this bill. i encourage other members to take a look at it. it is a good way for us to come together as republicans and democrats to focus on an issue that is affecting every single state represented in this body. sometimes people are in denial about this subject. but the reality is it affects all of us as americans. by mr. kaine: s.j. res. 44. a joint resolution to authorize the use of united states armed forces against the islamic state in iraq and the levant. to the committee on foreign relations.","mr. speaker. it appears that the obama administration has finally come to the conclusion that the employer mandate in obamacare is a job killer. many have speculated that the obama administrations decision to delay the employer mandate until after the 2014 election was due to fears that job cuts and hour reductions that would result from the mandates implementation would negatively impact the presidents party at the polls. it does seem that those fears are justified. recently. the teamsters and other labor groups wrote to senate majority leader harry reid and house democrat leader nancy pelosi stating that the implementation of obamacare put at risk the 40hour workweek. the health care. and the takehome pay of their members. mr. speaker. i agree with the teamsters that the employer mandate is a job killer. eliminating the employer mandate would not stop the individual mandate which requires every american to purchase governmentapproved insurance that they may not want. that they cant afford. and may not be provided by their employers or otherwise they have to pay a penalty. is that fair to american families? the legislation. mr. speaker. that we are considering today would give every americanevery americanthe same 1year reprieve from obamacare that the president has offered to businesses. because we extend this help to all of the american people. the president has threatened to veto this bill. mr. speaker. the president is not a king. he is the president. he does not have the authority to change the law and to delay the employer mandate on his own. congress must give him that authority. i would say to the president that we will delay the jobkilling employer mandate. as he has asked. and we will also extend the same relief to all of the american people. the president and members of congress who vote against this bill will have to explain to the american people why they heard the concerns of business but not those of the people. we have heard the people. we share their concerns. we stand with them. and i would urge all of my colleagues to stand with them as well and to support this very vital legislation.","mr. speaker. i rise today to recognize avondale. arizona mayor marie lopez rogers on her election as president of the national league of cities (nlc). mayor lopez rogers is the first latina in nlc history to lead the advocacy group. which is dedicated to helping city leaders build better communities. since she was first elected to the avondale city council in 1996. mayor lopez rogers has demonstrated a deep commitment to public service. from her time on the council to when she was elected as avondales first latina mayor in 2006. mayor lopez rogers has been instrumental in transforming avondale from a once tiny community to one of the nations fastest growing municipalities. having served in local. state. and national organizations such as on the board of the national association of latino elected and appointed officials (naleo). as a member of the league of arizona cities &amp; towns executive committee. and as president of the arizona women in municipal governments. mayor lopez rogers skills and talents have reached well beyond avondale. in 2011. mayor lopez rogers was recognized by president barack obama for her dedication to and accomplishments in local government at a national conference of hispanic leaders. additionally. she has received the hispanic leadership institutewest public service award. the valle del sole profiles of success 2009 special recognition award. and the 2010 jacque steiner public leadership award for children from childrens action alliance. mayor lopez rogers knows the meaning of hard work and does not shy away from a challenge. she worked alongside her parents in a farm labor camp as a girl and then became the first member of her family to go to college. today. as the head of nlc. i am confident she will use her resolve to fight for initiatives important to cities in arizona and across the united states. i have known mayor lopez rogers and her family for over thirty years and i extend my sincerest appreciation for the support and friendship they have shown to me. mr. speaker. i ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the many achievements of mayor marie lopez rogers and in wishing her the best during her tenure as president of the national league of cities.","mr. speaker. you have heard it said many times: energy is jobs. energy is jobs. we have a wealth of resources in our nation: oil. natural gas. and coal. yet we see gas prices rising to unbelievable rates here in america. approaching. in many places. in excess of $4 a gallon. and what are we doing about it? not very much. weve got a permitting process that is failing america. and we have an opportunity today to show america just how bad that problem is. later today. im going to be introducing a bill called the road to jobs act. it stands for regulatory openness. accountability. and disclosure. and we are going to show the american people. through a report that is going to be required from the council on environmental quality. just how flawed that permitting process is. requiring them to show the permits that are in cycle and what the economic implications are of not authorizing permits to go after americas resources.","i thank the chairman. the gentleman from new jersey. for yielding. mr. speaker. i rise today in strong support of h.r. 3199. the emergency medic transition act of 2010. this is a collaborative effort. and i would like to thank representatives harman. bean. sarbanes and so many others for their collaborative partnership on drafting the bill. i also want to thank representative steve buyer with whom i have worked closely on the veterans affairs committee. representative buyer offered some commonsense suggestions as the ranking member of our full committee on how to improve h.r. 3199. he is also a member of the house energy and commerce committee. and he helped make the final product a better piece of legislation. this bill takes important steps to improve the ability of veterans to translate their military experience into the civilian workforce. specifically working to help veterans with military medical experience to become civilian emergency medical technicians. the legislation creates a grant program that will assist individual states in the creation of a fasttrack emt certification process that takes into account the experience a veteran gained while serving in the military. recent estimates from the united states bureau of labor statistics suggests that veterans between the ages of 18 and 24 had an unemployment rate of 21.6 percent in 2009. this is a terribly troubling number and the veterans affairs economic opportunity subcommittee. which i have the honor of chairing. has held a series of hearings during the 111th congress on a variety of issues related to veterans employment. these hearings have shown that one of the critical barriers facing newly separated veterans trying to enter the workforce is the challenge of translating their military experience to the civilian market. so i am pleased that the legislation the house is considering today not only increases access to health care. but does so by increasing employment opportunities for veterans and allows them to use their skills gained in service to our country to serve their local communities in civilian life. h.r. 3199 also requires an assessment of whether this new program should be expanded to help veterans with medical training to obtain certification in other health professions. i urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important legislation.","madam speaker. the national media have given president obama a free pass on the economy. earlier this year. the obaina .administration said congress needed to pass the presidents stimulus package to keep the unemployment rate below. 8 percent. since congress has passed the presidents nonstimulus stimulus. the economy has lost more than 1.5 million jobs. and unemployment has jumped to 9.4 percent. despite - the massive layoffs. the president claimed this week that the stimulus has saved jobs. the national media have allowed the obama administration to get away with spinning jobs lost as jobs saved. and the national media have continued to ignore the congressional budget offices conclusion that the stimulus bill actually would reduce outputreduce output. the media should scrutinize the presidents words and actions. not give him a free pass. ] 1030","i thank my good friend and new member. in one sense of the word. from maryland for yielding time to me. i also want to thank the chairwoman and ranking republican of the subcommittee on economic development. public buildings. and emergency management. representative eleanor holmes norton and sam graves. and i thank chairman oberstar for his continuing leadership as well. mr. speaker. i was pleased to have introduced this resolution with many of my colleagues from florida. all of them. as well as the majority leader and his floor staff. were so helpful in getting this resolution to the floor today. mr. speaker. i rise in strong support of this resolution that commemorates last weeks 80th anniversary of the okeechobee hurricane of 1928. numerous communities in the congressional district that.i am privileged to serve last week remembered the destruction of the okeechobee hurricane. also known as hurricane san felipe segundo. the storm ravaged florida. puerto rico. the virgin islands. the bahamas. and numerous islands of the caribbean. the resolution also pays tribute appropriately to the over 4.000 lives lost from this tragic storm. more than 3.000 were lost in the united states alone. the second largest death toll ever recorded by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration. floridians living near lake okeechobee in communities that i am now privileged to represent experienced a devastating loss of life when the hurricane led to extensive breaches of the levees surrounding the lake. of the more than 3.000 casualties in the continental united states. more than 75 percent were migrant workers near lake okeechobee who welre overwhelmingly african american. the lack of capacity to respond to the storm and racial overtones of the era led to extensive disparities in the treatment of victims of the hurricane. many african americans were buried in poorly or unmarked mass graves. including one site in west palm beach where over 670 unfortunate souls were laid to rest. similar graves for white victims of the tragedy were visibly memorialized. whereas many african american graves were forgotten and still not known and some not recognized until many years later. mr. speaker. neglecting these darker moments of our history can overlook important lessons. as we saw with the devastation of hurricanes katrina. gustav. and most recently. ike. beyond just recognizing the victims of the okeechobee hurricane. their loss is a reminder of what can happen when there are injustices in disaster response and mitigation. the potential for devastation due to failing infrastructure following disasters exists i many places throughout our nation. that is why this resolution also places emphasis on hurricane preparedness and education. it also commends the army corps of engineers for the work that they are doing today to repair the herbert hoover dike. the dike. which was built in the 1930s to protect the lake okeechobee communities that were flooded and destroyed by the okeechobee hurricane. is in dire need of repairs. to date. congress has appropriated well over $100 million to repair the dike. without continued help. these communities will be vulnerable to devastation from future storms. i wish to add a footnote. i came here 15 years ago. and all of my colleagues from louisiana on both sides of the aisle in the senate and in the house were continuously arguing then about the levees in new orleans. and i just shudder to think about the fact that we were tardy in responding to them. . the experience of the okeechobee hurricane still touches the lives of so many of my constituents and people throughout florida and the caribbean. one of them i wish to personally memorialize. dave larramore. who we referred to as brother larramore. one of his favorite expressions was \"aintchaknow.\" brother larramore was from the bahamas and he was in okeechobee when that storm occurred in 1928. he lost eight members of his family. he was holding on to his wife who was holding his child. and she dropped the child. and he grabbed the baby. .and they were the only ones that came out of that storm. he told that story often and stories of others. i take this opportunity to remember him with the kindness that this body offers to our people when they pass. no matter how long ago that it was. the houses consideration of this resolution today is both appropriate and timely. i ask for my colleagues support.","it is interesting. rarely do you come to the house floor that somebody says. dont you have compassion? dont you want to take money away from this american family and hand it over to this program over here? and. again. i want our society to spend more money on education. i want them to spend more money on health care. i want them to spend more money on housing. im just not indifferent as to who does the spending. i want american families to do the spending. they want the federal government bureaucrats to do the spending after taking a huge hair cut for all the waste and fraud andabuse and duiplication that takes place in the nations capitol. what i hear from my constituents. and i have the great honor of representing the fifth congressional district of texas. which is dallas and east texas. and i hear from people like the kirkendahls in garland who wrote me: \"congressman. at this point. between taxesand utilities we are at the breaking point of being able to keep a home. if we have an increase of over $2.000 per year in taxes. it may well be the straw that broke the camels back.\" well. where is the democratic compassion for the kirkendahl family as they try to keep their home? i heard from the taylor family in forney. texas also in my district: \"dear congressman. im on the verge of foreclosure after 15 years in my house. i wont be able to make it if taxes continue to rise.\" well. where is this democrat compassion for the taylor family in forney? im having trouble seeing it. and so they forget about the people who actually do the work and pay the taxes. because its their dreams once again. and so compassion. i believe that compassion ultimately shouldnt be measured by the size of a government check. it ought to be measured by the size of a paycheck. and all this democrat spending is fueling more taxes. which will kill the jobs. kill jobs in this american economy. we start replacing paychecks with welfare checks. theres no compassion in that. and ill yield back to the gentleman from new jersey.","i thank the gentleman for his courtesy. i heard my friend from puget sound in washington talk about how this was a good deal. you have heard speaker after speaker after speaker talk about how this is a sham. that it is not a direct vote to be able to deal with the minimum wage. but it is worse than that. because those people in puget sound who are tipped employees. who work for the minimum wage are going to see a $2.48 an hour cut under the republican bill intent. in the state of oregon. where we have indexed the minimum wage. our people are going to see a $1.75 an hour reduction. the republican bill cuts the wages of hundreds of thousands. perhaps millions. of workers in the states of alaska. california. minnesota. montana. nevada. oregon. and washington by preempting the state minimumwage laws where a state has disallowed the employer tip tax credit.","madam speaker. we are here again. we went through this marathon a year ago. we have had several sets of hearings and markups on these four bills. and one would think thby are very important. they are important. but in the reverse way. they are not important to protect the health and safety of working families in america. they are important because they are trying to trivialize the whole safety component of the department of labor and the whole safety responsibility of the government. they want to trivialize it and make it seem insignificant and unimportant. i understand each of the four bills amending the occupational safety and health act now on the floor will be considered individually. and i would therefore save .my comments on the specifics of the other three bills until the appropriate time. when you consider these four bills as an entire package. however. it becomes very clear that they will seriously erode the enforcement of u.s. safety standards. they will undermine the ability of the occupational safety and health administration to enforce onthejob safety standards. and will only add to more worker deaths and more serious injuries. e 1415 it will not only lead to the department of labor becoming more and more the departmentagainst laborers. the department against working peo ple. by bringing these bills to the house floor. the republican leadership shows yet again just how out of step it is with the american people. in this case. the house republican leadership is backing four bills to weaken osha at the very .time that the american public is demanding the exact opposite be done. according to a recent poll sponsored by the wall street journal. eight out of every ten americans believe congress should be passing legislation to ensure greater health and safety in the workplace. let me repeat that: the wall street journal. which is hardly a liberal publication. they sponsored a poll in april 2005 revealing that 84 percent of those surveyed want lawmakers to pass bills ensuring safer workplaces in america. that is 84 percent. parade magazine. another mainstream publication. tells us the same story. an article published in the april 10 issue of parade magazine assessed our national priorities based on 2005 dollar allocations for government programs. the article juxtaposed business versus safety. pointing out that this years funding for the securities and exchange commission is $888 million and the small business administration. which is $580 million. far exceeds that for osha. which is $464 million. and the consumer product safety commission which is $63 million. the amount dedicated to business. parade magazine concludes. is close to $1 billion more than that dedicated to safety in this simple comparison.","mr. president. i rise to introduce the center for transportation solutions act of 2004. i am deeply troubled that the federal government is not doing enough to address important national and regional transportation issues from a systemic perspective. there is too little research being devoted to profound questions that have a longterm impact on the future viability of our nations transportation network. such questions may include: how well is our transportation system responding to the global economy? how can transportation meet the needs of greater environmental sustainability? how can people become more involved in transportation planning in their communities? what transportation technologies will be important in the future? are there more effective ways to finance improvements to our transportation infrastructure? what will be the demand for various modes of transportation in the future? how well do the various modes of transportation interact? is there a better way to reduce transportation accidents and enhance safety? in fact. the federal government does not adequately invest in finding answers to these and other important questions. the united states department of transportation spends approximately 1.5 percent of its budget on research. this amount is insufficient when compared to the 2.8 percent. spent by the department of agriculture. 4.8 percent by the department of health and human services. 8.1 percent by the environmental protection agency. and 14.9 percent spent by the department of defense. much of that 1.5 percent spent by the department of transportation is focused on shortterm. highly applied research activities. such as the performance of varieties of asphalt in different climates.. too few resources. however. are devoted to research in finding solutions to our most intractable longterm transportation problems. the consequences of this lack of foresight are significant.. as dennis christiansen. deputy director of the texas transportation institute. testified before the house subcommittee on highway. transit. and pipelines last year: \"in the private sector. failure to innovate may mean one goes out of business. in the public sector. failure to innovate may simply mean that we do things less efficiently and at a higher cost.\" in addition. the american public transportation association commented at the same hearing that \"without research and training. innovation withers and american jobs are lost offshore.\" . the lack of adequate investments in longterm transportation research. however. is not the only concern. the nations transportation research and technology programs are highly decentralized as well. there are state and federal transportation agencies. universities. contractors. and material suppliers all participating in transportation research activities. while this decentralization- has its benefits in that the same broad array of institutions that are conducting the research are involved in its implementation. it also has its drawbacks. it poses challenges to effective ptioritysetting. and can lead to unnecessary duplication. results that are not transferable. and significant research gaps. the legislation that i am introducing will address these important issues by establishing a center for transportation solutions as an independent agency in the executive branch of the government. its purpose will be to develop and encourage the execution of a longterm national policy for the promotion of research and development related to multimodal transportation. the center is modeled after the national science foundation. it will be under the leadership of a director appointed by the president and a board composed of sixteen individuals with expertise in transportation research and policy. like the national science foundation. the center will de organized into a series of research divisions on such issues as safety. the environment. infrastructure. intermodal connections. and transportation economics and financial policy. regional centers for transportation solutions will also be established to investigate these important issues from a regional perspective. the new center will not supplant existing transportation research activities. but supplement them. it will award competitive. meritbased grants to academic. public. and private research institutions to support longterm strategic transportation objectives. according to the transportation research board. \"competition for funds and merit review of proposals are the best ways of ensuring the maximum return on investment of research funding and addressing strategic national transportation system goals.\" sadly. much of the funding that is designated for transportation research today is earmarked for specific projects or research institutions without open competition. finally. the center will facilitate the interchange of transportation research data among interested parties. work closely with the united states department of transportation in setting research priorities. and coordinate its scientific research programs with public and private research groups. this legislation is a work in progress. in the coming months. i intend to further refine it for reintroduction in the 109th congress. nevertheless. the bill embodies an important goal namely. the need for increased resources and strategic planning devoted to tackling the nations longterm transportation needs. i realize that the 108th congress is nearing completion. i am also aware that the senate and the house of representatives will likely revisit the reauthorization of surface transportation programs soon after the 109th congress convenes in 2005. that legislation would be the perfect opportunity for congress to look farther into the futureeven beyond the traditfonal sixyear scope of the surface transportation billand begin to make the investments necessary for solving our nations most . difficult transportation problems. after all. if we can devote resources to finding a cure for cancer and other lifethreatening illnesses. shouldnt we do the same and find a cure for traffic congestion? by mr. frist (for himself and mr. ensign)","mr. president. the bills before the senate to implement the u.s.-chile and u.s.-singapore freetrade agreements are being considered under fast track procedures. this means debate is limited and amendments are not in order. senators can only vote yes or no. i opposed fast track because we should not limit the ability of congress to improve trade agreements which may not. as some in the past have not. represent the best interest of the american worker. american farmer. or u.s. industry. although the u.s. international trade commission found the impact of a fta with chile and singapore would be minimal on the u.s. economy. the u.s.-chile and the u.s.-singapore freetrade agreements are widely considered likely to lead to more open markets. singapores market is currently quite open with respect to consumer and industrial goods and imposes no tariffs on most of these products. any remaining tariffs will be eliminated upon entry into force of the agreement. chiles tariffs average 6 percent and they will be eliminated quickly in the agreement. for example. 85 percent of consumer and industrial goods trade becomes duty free immediately upon the entry into force of the u.s.-chile fta. with most ofthe remaining tariffs eliminated within 4 years. of particular interest to u.s. auto makers is chiles commitment to eliminate its domestic tax of 75 percent on luxury automobiles over 4 years. the united states also made significant gains in opening the service sector market in both countries. these agreements do have shortcomings. for instance. they lack a requirement to strive to achieve the core ilo labor standards that were contained in the u.s.-jordan fta. and instead only require each nation to enforce its own laws. they also have separate dispute settlement rules that place arbitrary caps on the enforceability of the .labor and environment provisions of the agreement. this is in contrast to the u.s.-jordan fta which treated all commitments in the agreement to identical dispute settlement mechanisms. however. the weaker labor and environment commitments and enforcement is not as great a concern as might otherwise be the case because the laws of chile and singapore essentially reflect core internationally recognized labor rights. such language would be a concern. however. if contained in future agreements with countries with lesser labor and environmental standards. each trade agreement should be judged on its own merits. while the provisions for chile and singapore may be acceptable for chile and singapore. the language of these agreements would clearly not be acceptable for trade agreements with countries with weaker labor laws or environmental standards. the u.s.-jordan agreement. with its stronger labor and environment commitments and enforcement provisions. is the- more acceptable model for future agreements with countries with wekker standards.","mr. chairman. reclaiming my time. i thank my friend. the gentleman from texas. for pointing that out. we do. of course. want to keep the physical plant. the jobs. and all the related benefits in brunswick. georgia. as part of it but also i want to say it is not just that. it is that inside of fletc there is a lot of angst and concern about moving it from the department of treasury to the department of justice. and we have not seen any justification for doing that right now. so it is not purely provincial that i am pushing this.","mr. speaker. i would like to make it very clear to my friends on the other side of the aisle. as chairman of the subcommittee on workforce protections. i care about the health and safety of workers just as much as they do. but this is a very bad rule coming from osha that could. indeed. hurt those same workers they want to protect. let us just take one simple hypothetical. let us say an employee hurts themselves playing softball. they know that. under this regulation. if they claim this musculoskeletal disorder and can blame it on the work force. then they can take 90 days off with 90 percent of their pay. the injured patient then gets to the doctor and gets the doctor to say this softball accident really is work related. the employers call the doctor and say. wait a minute. this msd was caused by playing softball. i know that. two or three of our employees saw it. the doctor says. sorry. i cannot talk to you about this. it is against the law.","mr. president. energy prices are going up. gasoline prices are up. i doubt there are many families who do not spend $60 a month on gasoline. those who commute. those who have children with vehicles. a husband and wife working may have two or three vehicles per family and not be wealthy. they may be paying $100 a month or more for gasoline. if they were paying $60 a month for gasoline 18 months ago. they are now paying over $90 a month. if they were paying $100 a month last year. they are probably paying over $150 a month this year. that is $50 a month or $30 a month. perhaps more in some families. withdrawn from the usable income of that family. money with which they no longer can buy shoes. a new set of tires for their car. to go on a vacation with their children. take the kids to a ball game. buy shoes for them to play soccer or basketball. baseball. or volley ball. that is $50 a month extra of aftertax money that american citizens had 15. 18 months ago and no longer have today. that is because the price of energy has gone up. in addition. businesses are facing those same increases. i traveled a couple of months ago with a fulltime truck driver and his wife. i traveled from north of birmingham to clanton to montgomery and discussed with them the problems they are facing. they are paying up to $800 to $1.000 a month extra to operate their truck. they try to pass it on. which increases the costs down the road. but they are not able to pass it all on and it is reducing their standard of living. they have. in fact. less money with which to go to the store and buy products. what does that ultimately mean? it means there are going to be fewer widgets bought. there are going to be fewer shoes bought. there are going to be fewer new cars bought. fewer new houses bought and many other things we would like to purchase. we will not be able to purchase those items because opec. through its pricegouging cartel. has fixed the oil and gas prices and driven them up to an extraordinary degree. as a result. it is hurting us. we know this. we know the economy appears to have some slowing. we know that profit margins across the board have been shrinking significantly. and we know that higher energy costs are a big reason for that. i say that because we are talking about some very big issues. if you do not have money to purchase. lets say you purchase 8 things this month instead of what you would normally purchase. 10. there is somebody who would have made those other 2 items. somebody who would have sold those other 2 items. they may not be able to continue to do that. what does that do to the producing business? it puts stress on them. it can cool off this robust economy with which we have been blessed for quite a number of years. kofi annan. the secretary general of the u.n.. wrote an editorial recently which i was pleased to read. he pointed out how it hurts poor nations more than wealthy nations. but it hurts wealthy nations. too. wealthy nations are hurt when poor nations do not have money to buy products from us. we sell all over the world. whatever cools off the entire world economy cools off the american economy and jeopardizes jobs. what caused us to come to this point? i say with confidence that it is the clintongore policies. primarily vice president al gores energy policies. that have been involved here. the simple fact is that those policies are driven by and motivated at the deepest level by his adoption of a radical. nogrowth agenda that is playing in his book. he set it out some years ago. people are astounded when they read that book because he is deeply revealing of a philosophy that we ought to reduce spending on energy and that will somehow drive up costs and we will use less oil. less gas. we will. ride bicycles and use solar cells. and that is how we are going to meet our national energy policy. the trouble is that solar cells cost 4. 5. 10 times as much as fossil fuels do to produce energy. who is going to pay for that? working americans are going to pay for that while some elite people think it is a cool idea and for which they are not paying the price. they can afford to pay it perhaps. we are into that mood now. this radical agenda is demonstrated by the policies that have been carried out systematically since this administration took office. it has been steady. and it has been regular. they have not said our policy is to raise prices. they are too clever for that. they are not going to allow that spin to get about. what have they done against the consistent opposition of members in this body who have warned over and over that reducing production of american fuels was going to lead us to a crisis? what have they done? they have opposed drilling in the anwr region of alaska which has huge reserves equal to 30 years of the production in saudi arabia. this one little area amounts to the size of dulles airport. it is a very small area with huge reserves. they vetoed legislation that would have allowed us to produce oil and gas to help meet our needs. over vigorous debate in this senate and a strong majority vote. it was vetoedby the clintongore administration.. what else? they steadfastly oppose nuclear power. france has gone from 60 percent of their power nuclear to 80 percent. industrialized nations realize it is the cleanest. safest of all sources of energy with unlimited capacity to produce electricity. with no air pollutionvirtually no air pollution.- and only a small amount of waste that we can easily store in the nevada desert. oh. no. president clinton and vice president gore vetoed the ability for us to store that waste in the nevada desert. therefore. helping shut down our nuclear energy. we have not brought on a nuclear plant in over 20 years in this country. we are denying ourselves that capacity to produce energy. there are huge reserves of natural gas in the rocky mountain areas. natural gas is the cleanest burning of all our fossil fuels. all our electricgenerating plants today are natural gas plants. we are hitting a crisis in the production of natural gas. they refuse to allow those federal lands in the rocky mountain areas. almost all of it owned by the federal government. to produce natural gas. which isnt a dangerous fuel to produce. it doesnt pour oil all out on the ground. it is an evaporative gas. it is safe to produce. certainly we could do that. they are opposed to drilling offshore. in fact. vice president gore. during his campaigning in new hampshire. promised not only to not approve any additional offshore drilling of natural gas but to consider rolling back existing leases that have already been issued. how are we going to meet our energy needs for natural gas if we cannot produce it? there are many other areas where. through regulation. we basically shut off coal as a viable option for expanding our energy needs. in fact. even though we are much more efficient than we have ever been with electric energy. we need more. the projections are that we will have a substantial increase in demand even though we are improving our efficiency steadily. so that is the problem we are facing. the problem is that when opec realized our demand was increasing. and the world demand was increasing. and our own domestic production was decreasing 14 percent. while demand was going up 18 to 20 percent. they were able to reduce production. force the price up to exorbitant levels. and make themselves rich. in fact. it was a political decision by governmental leaders to force up the price. it was not even a free market decision. it was a political decision by the leaders of these oilproducing nations because of our failure to produce energy and because we have become dependent on their oil. so they have been able to demand what they want to in price. our politicians lost to their politicians. their politicians beat our politicians. and who is paying the price? the american citizen. when he goes to the gas pump. when he buys his heating oil. when he goes and buys a product. it is more expensive today to buy that product than it was before because of increased gasoline prices in the whole production system. that is what has happened. we have been taken to the cleaners. to me it is as if we put a tax on the gasoline. but instead of taxing gasoline 50. 60 cents a gallon extra where the revenue comes to washington so it at least can be spent in the united states. it is. in effect. a 50-. 60cent tax that goes to saudi arabia. venezuela. and the middle east. the opec cartel gets our tax. they are taxing our wealth and sending it abroad. this has the capacity to kill the economic growth this nation has been experiencing. it has the capacity to drain our wealth to the degree that this economy could slow down. it could even go into recession because we have done nothing to deal with it. we have done nothing. the only thing. in the long run. that we can do is to make sure we produce what we have. we have virtually unlimited reserves of natural gas and oil in the united statescertainly for decades to come. there are myths that we do not have enough. we have large reserves. we should have been producing those more effectively. but the policies of this administration have been to reduce our production. and as night follows day. the price is going to go up. it threatens not only the pocketbook of a mother who is trying to now get byshe was paying $100 a month for the familys gasoline. now she is paying $150 a month for the familys gasoline. she cannot buy things at the store she used to buy. and the producers of those products are now going to have to lay off workers because people are not buying those products at the rate they were previously buying them. this is not an ittybitty issue. this is a tremendous issue for our country. i hope it will be discussed tonight in the debate. i hope it will be made a part of this campaign. i believe. with an absolute conviction. that if we allow these international greedy producing nations to jerk us around. to take money from the average mother and father and working american when they go to the gas pump. having their money sent to those nations. they can hurt us badly. it hurts a lot of people. i pumped gas a few months ago and washed peoples windshields. i talked to them about the costs they were facing. i talked to a young lady in her early twenties. she was going to college 3 days a week. the college she attended was 30 miles up the road. she talked about how much her gas bill was. she was trying to save money for tuition. her car was not a new car. she said she would like to have a new car. but she could not afford it. that extra cost was coming out of her pocket. this is a real issue. it hurts our families. they have less money in their pocket and in the family budget because it has to be spent on gasoline. it is hurting businesses. their profits are down. home building is down. what will happen in the future? i dont know. but if we do not get in this ballgame. if we do not challenge opec and figure out a way to break that cartel. and if we do not increase our own production of energy. we will have what we have had numerous times before. and that is. a recession driven by increased energy costs. what a tragedy that will be. it should not happen. our projections are and our needs as a nation are to continue this prosperity. to continue the surplus we have been able to generate in this government. and to pay down our debt and to be able to do some things we wish we could have done before. this is a glorious time for us. i believe we have to take strong action. i have been frustrated that this administration remains steadfast in blocking. time and again. any step to increase our production of energy. and that has no more consequence but one: when you reduce production. it will drive up costs. i thank the chair and. again. express my appreciation for his fine remarks on national defense. mr. president. i yield the floor.","act is necessary because the national labor relations board

suffer as a result of these agencies \"find and fine\" approach are magnified by the abuse of \"salting\" or the placement of paid union organizers and their agents in nonunion workplaces for the sole purpose of disrupting the workforce. \"salting abuse\" occurs when \"salts\" create labor law violations or workplace hazards and then file frivolous claims with the nlrb or osha. businesses are then often forced to spend thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend themselves against nlrb or osha as these agencies vigorously prosecute these frivolous claims. accordingly. many businesses. when faced with the cost of a successful defense. make a bottomline decision to settle these frivolous claims rather than going out of business or laying off employees in order to finance costly litigation. the \"fair act\" will allow these employers to defend themselves rather than settling. and. more importantly. it will force the nlrb or osha to ensure that the claims they pursue are worthy of their efforts. the fair act will accomplish this by allowing employers with up to 100 employees and a net worth of up to $7.000.000 to recover their attorneys fees and litigation expense directly from the nlrb or osha. regardless of whether those agencies decision to pursue the case was \"substantially justified\" or \"special circumstances\" make an award of attorneys fees unjust. thus. the congressional intent behind the broadly supported. bipartisan \"equal access to justice act\" (\"eaja\") to \"level the playing field\" for small businesses will finally be realized. the \"fair act\" is solid legislation. it is a common sense attempt to give small businesses the means to defend themselves against unfair actions. accordingly. i ask my colleagues for their cooperation and assistance as i work to ensure that the \"fair act\" is enacted into law.* by mr. stevens (for himself.","this is a budget that will set our spending priorities. what my amendment says is there are only two responsible ways to spend any future surpluses: to pay down the debt. to save social security. or to give tax relief to the hardworking american family. if congress decides to put all the money into debt relief and social security. that is consistent with this amendment. the only reason you would vote against this amendment is if you want congress in the future to be able to go on spending binges and give the bill to our children. this allows us to put all the money on paydown debt or to give tax relief. it is important that we recognize that we have labored mightily. we should not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory on the balanced budget. this is our chance to take a stand. we are going to spend any future surpluses in only two ways--to pay down debt or to

but just on what the gentlewoman from ohio has just mentioned. let me say this: some people think because the stock market is at record highs that that means that everything is ok. but i think we need to ask ourselves. are we really in the lull before the. storm? because in the last 3 years. 1.5 million people have lost their jobs due to corporate downsizing. and as one of the national .newscasts reported a few days ago. almost all of the people. unlike in the eighties. almost all of the people who lost their jobs in the nineties have stayed out of work on average about twice as long as in the eighties and they have had to take jobs at far less pay than the ones they lost. in addition to that. we had a $153 billion trade deficit last year. and every leading economist will tell us that conservatively we lose 20.000 jobs per billion dollars. so that means we lost over 3 million jobs due to poor trade policies just in the last year. and then. even more importantly than that. mr. speaker. our unemployment rate is relatively low but our underemployment rate is terrible. we have millions of college graduates who cannot find jobs in the fields for which they were trained. and we are ending up with the best educated waiters and waitresses in the entire world. we need to work on these things if we are going to straighten this country out and make it a land of opportunity again. as if should be.","mr. chairman. one of the many. many virtues of the amendment offered by the gentleman from wisconsin is that it would strike from this bill the incredibly illconceived provision generally referred to as. the istook amendment. which attempts to control speech and political advocacy in this country. it is often described as if the only objective were to keep federal funds from being used for federal lobbying. that is already essentially against the law. this proposal would go far further than that innocentsounding purpose and fundamentally put the federal government in the business of crippling the ability of anyone who is covered by this amendment to participate in the political life of this country. mr. chairman. if it were to become law. large numbers. probably millions of americans. would end upr having to file. or participate in the filing. if you can conceive of this of a certified annual report detailing their political activity. incredible. the proponents of this amendment often trot out a picture of a pig eating federal dollars. i guess that pig is supposed to represent farmers and small business people. the girl scouts. the red cross. the ymca. the u.s. catholic conference. some.of over 400 organizations that are opposing this provision. the proponents say their purpose is to keep these people and organizations from spending more than a minimal amount of money to affect federal policy. but the real guts of this is to keep americans from spending their own money. their own money. on political advocacy. . it flies in the face. as the gentleman who opened this debate indicated. of the first amendment. whether we are talking about university researchers. churches getting funds for day care centers. companies receiving help for displaced workers. gun clubs being allowed to do target practice on a federal reservation. on and on and on. being swept into this incredible proposal. . perhaps worst of all. this amendment would establish a big government. big brother system of political controls. it would bring about the creation of a national database of political activity. and if you can believe this. a master computer file in washington. dc. covering everything from communications to contributions made by covered groups and their employees. managed by the government of the united states. mr. chairman. a shame. an absolute shame. how any of us who took an oath to uphold the constitution could stand still for this kind of nonsense on the floor of the united states house of representatives in a free land. especially those whove spoken over and over again about wanting to restrain the reach of the federal government. is absolutely incredible.","madam speaker. in central new york we have seen some 10.000 wellpaid manufacturing jobs evaporate over the past 5 years. i am concerned about the effect of the clinton health care plan on jobs--and so is the majority of american business according to a recent u.s. chamber of commerce survey. they do not want this plan. about 71 percent of the 40.000 respondents are opposed to governmentsponsored employer mandates. these are the people who have seen government mandates wednesday next week. the a to z disbefore. they have seen price controls. charge petition will be available for and they have seen the negative re- signing at the clerks desk.

advisers. laura dandrea tyson. has said so. it is not hard to believe. in fact. some business people i have talked to predict higher job losses. the congressional budget office in february put the range of expected job losses at 300.000 to 1.2 million. why? because history shows that when government mandates what business must do. the costs are high and the effect is loss of jobs. this will be especially true in my home district. madam speaker. where we have major employers in the insurance and health care fields. health care. yes. more taxes. more bureaucracy. more recession. more lost jobs? no.","mr. chairman. last year during the presidential campaign. we heard a lot about federal budget deficits and about economic growth and about gridlock in washington. we heard from president clinton. and we heard from ross perot. and we heard from the american people. they were all correctbill clinton was right. and ross perot was right. and the american people were rightwhen they said that deficits do matter. that deficits are sapping the vitality from our national economy. and that todays deficits are tomorrows bills come due. well. mr. chairman. if deficits do matter. and if the american people want an end to gridlock and a beginning to bipartisan solutions to the problems which matter to them. the solomon budget is the place to begin. and i am proud to rise. in support of that budget and ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to give it . their support. republican members of the house have worked together over the past several days to put together a budget resolution for fiscal year 1994 which we believe truly reflects the priorities and the desire for change among the american people. we believe that it is a budget which both republicans and democrats can support. in assembling the solomon substitute. mr. chairman. we identified three objectives: substantial deficit reduction by means of real restraint and actual cuts in federal government spending. a fair and realistic package of proposals to increase federal revenues by asking the wealthiest americans--and only the wealthiest amer.cans--to pay more in taxes. and. an overall budget plan that would not threaten or undermine the prospects for a continuing economic recovery. i believe that we achieved each of those objectives and that they are reflected in our budget resolution. first. let us look at deficit reduction and how we achieved it. the solomon substitute achieves substantially more deficit reduction next year and over the next 5 years than either of the budget plans that came out of the house budget committee. our budget reduces the deficit by $620 billion over 5 years. thats about $160 billion more in deficit reduction than the democrat budget achieves despite the fact that it calls for over a quarter of a billion dollars in net new taxes over the next 5 years. our budget achieves deficit reduction primarily by controlling the rate of spending growth in most federal program spending. land by making actual cuts in other nonessential federal programs. those of us who assembled this substitute share with all of our republicans colleagues the view that america suffers under the weight of this monstrous deficit not because the vast majority of her people are taxed too little. but because the federal government spends too muchmuch too much. our budget reflects that belief. because the solomon substitute takes the republican budget committee proposal as its base. it adopts what is in effect a baseline freeze on all nondefense federal. discretionary spending. what this means. in terms that normal people can understand. is that spending for more than 90 percent of all federal discretionary programs will grow over the next 5 years by an amount equal to the inflation rate over the next 5 years. critical programs like pell grants and head start will not see their funding cut. our proposal does. however. call for and specify actual reductions in funding for other programs. for example. we eliminate funding for the superconducting super collider. cut funding for special interest federal highway projects. cut agricultural subsidles to individuals with nonfarm incomes of over $100.000. and cut funding for support of the already oversized but still growing government bureaucracies. as a result of our determination to hold the line on spending. spending cuts account for more than 80 percent of the deficit reduction in the solomon substitute. unspecified spending reduction accounts for barely half of the deficit reduction in the democrat package. mr. chairman. i think that john kasici and my republican colleagues on the budget committee did a remarkable. and a remarkably honest job in their budget on the savings side. they showed that we can make a substantial dent in the deficit without resorting to unspecified promises of spending restraint and without resorting to the massive tax increases that the administration and the majority. leadership are calling for. all of my republican colleagues involved in drafting this alternative budget share that view. . the american people. however. have made clear that they expect us to produce a budget package that makes more dramatic reductions in the federal deficit than can be achieved by spending cuts alone. it is for this reason that many of my colleagues and i believe that we need to go significantly further than our republican colleagues on the budget committee. and the only way to do that is by asking the wealthiest americans to make a contributlon in higher taxes. our alternative budget does that. we raise nearly $140 billion in new taxes over 5 years by incorporating already proposed tax increases on the wealthy. while at the same time stripping all of those new taxes proposed by president clinton and the democrats.--such as the btu tax and higher taxes on social security recipientswhich hit lower and middle income americans hard. contrary to the rhetoric. these taxes will hit middle income american families and retired americans hard. president clinton made a promise to shield middle income americans from the impact of new taxes. the president and his party are breaking that promise. we have a budget which gives them the opportunity to keep it. moreover. mr. chairman. the new taxes that we include in our proposal do not get implemented until after the spending restraint and the spending cuts we have proposed begin to be implemented. we are not asking any american to again pay for promises which they know have been made and broken many times before. we do indeed cut spending first. finally. mr. chairman. we sought to bring a budget resolution to the floor which would be progrowth. the economy is finally showing signs of life. though no one can take comfort from the extent of the recovery thus far. job growth statistics. in particular. remain disappointing. nonetheless. the economy is showing increased strength and the last thing we want to do is sap that strength. we want to support the recovery and keep as many americans as possible on the job. the solomon substitute contains a substantial package of tax incentives for business investment which will contribute to productivity growth and the creation of new jobs. moreover. though our proposal calls for very substantial reductions in defenige spending. it takes into consideration the fact that defense dollars provide more than just guns and jet fighters. defense dollars provide jobs--millions of jobs for american workers. we have just had a very bitter reminder. mr. chairman. of the human pain which defense downsizing entails. and no doubt. there will be more of it. the question. however. is how much more and how fast. our budget calls for nonadministrattvely related cuts of $60 billion in defense over 5 years. this is in additionand it is very important to point this out because many of my democrat colleagues conveniently fail to do soto almost $75 billion in cuts that president bush proposed before leaving office earlier this year. the democrat budget calls for cute that are twice as large. will be twice as painful. and will cost twice as many americans--military and nonmilitarytheir jobs. mr. chairman. i want to urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to take a careful look at the solomon plan. we have put together a budget alternative which is closer to what the american people have told us they want than any other budget resolution which has been offered. our budget delivers a third more in deficit reduction with less than half the new taxes--and none of the new taxes on middleincome americansthan the democrat resolution proposes. our spending restraints and cuts are specified. not promised. and we start reducing spending before. not after. we start collecting new taxes. we are not asking taxpayers to buy any more pigs in the poke. finally. our budget gives the american people the kind of economic program they want without asking an already vertaxed middle class to send even more of its income to washington.","mr. speaker. f rise to provide. a coalplitex pqlanation of the legislon i introduced this monxng. the transport of produce [top act i introduced this bill: for severaf reasons to feed undernoudshed and hungry americans. to create badly needed jobs. sd o. open a. dialogue. on an underutilized fund created by te appropitatlona. cormifittee ibr the deparikm of agriculture. mw initial interest in this. bill. arose when f discovered that there are produce commodities which are currently destroyed or not harvested because the produce does not meet the specifications of a marketing order agreed to by growers of a particular produce corne3123 modty. marketing orders help growers make a profit on their commodity. for example. this year. under the california tree fruit agreement. 5 million pounds of peaches and nectarnes did not meet market order standards. the market order required the elimination of this fruit from the primary market even though the fruit was peifect in every way except for its size. out of the 5 million pounds of peaches and nectarines which did not meet the marketing order standards. some of this fruit was brought to secondary markets such as farmers mar.. kets. and some was brought to processing plants. such as plants that provide dded fruits. or canned goods. after fruit which can not be sold in the primary market due to a marketing order is removed for the secondary market. multiple tons of edible. nutritou fruit still remain either on the trees. or in heaps on the ground. where it is left to rot. since there are marketing orders for 43 commodities such as potatoes. onions. and table grapes. try to imagine the amounts of produce that are going to waste. this is truly shameful since each month 20.000.000 americans rely on food distribution centers for their meals. some growers donate this excess fruit. unused because of a market order. to local food distribution sites such as food banks. soup kitchens. and homeless shelters. there is currently no restrictions on growers for donating food. nor should there ever be a need for such restrictions. growers decide on the marketing order. and growers decide who will receive their excess commodity. under my bill. none of these factors will change. my bill will simply ensure that food which growers wish to donate. but are unable to because they lack the funds or transportation. will be harvested. collected. and delivered to a food distribution site. growers can still donate their commodity to their favorite charity. or for whatever reason. allow the produce to be destroyed. under my bill. the department of agriculture would be required to expend 25 percent of a fund. a contingency fund that contains up to $300 million at the beginning of any fiscal year. for this program. the contingency fund [cf] was established by the appropriations committee for the department of agriculture [usda] to be used for emergency food distribution. the cf is part of usdas section 32 fund. which is used for federal food and nutrition programs. the section 32 fund is broken down in the following approximate amounts: $4.5 billion to fund food and nutrition service administration. $450 million for entitlements for the school lunch program and for removing surplus agricultural commodities. $70 million is transferred to the department of commercefor fishery products. and. $300 million is used for contingency buys in emergency situations. the section 32 fund is replenished annually through customs receipts. the contingency fund is replenished by any yearend surplus in the section. 32 fund. and is capped at $300 million. my research shows that atthe beginning of each fiscal year. over the past 10 years. an approximate total of $200 million existed in the cf for the following year. out of this total. an average of only about $70 million was expended for emergency buys over the course of the year. this still left $130 million for other buys. twentyfive percent of this total. the amount the bill would require usda to spend. would have averaged about $30 million annually for the top program. this would still have left an average of a $100 million surplus in the section 32 contingency fund at years end. which would then be replenished for the following year by excess in the section 32 fund. i understand that there will be some hesitancy on the part of the department of agriculture. and on the part of the subcommittee on rural development. agriculture and related agencies under the appropriations committee to utilize this fund. the fund is a sacred cow. i understand their hesitancy. but in the name of fiscal responsibility. in the name of jobs. and in the name of millions of undernourished and hungry americans. this congress must use all resources available to the nation. the section 32 contingency fund is an emergency fund. i believe that 20.000.000 individuals hungry enough to be forced to eat at soup kitchens every month can be called a national emergency. and i believe that the manner in which the proposed allocations would be used is consistent with the purpose of the contingency fund. i believe that congress should mandate the use of this fund for the purposes of this act. permit me to discuss some of the other mechanisms of this bill. and the problems they address. first. assuming growers are willing to donate their food. the undersized or bruised commodity needs to be harvested and stacked for transport. many growers allow volunteers to retrieve this excess produce and bring it to local food distribution sites. however. in some areas. there may not be volunteers available to pick the produce. in this situation. the secretary of agriculture may. should he or she deem it necessary. provide funds to growers to hire gleaners. second. once the commodity is harvested. the food needs to be transported to food distribution sites. my bill calls on the secretary of agriculture. in conjunction with the secretary of transportation. to develop a plan for hiring transportation contractors to collect and deliver these commodities to soup kitchens. homeless shelters. and food banks throughout the nation. third. the act establishes a method for choosing which food distribution sites will be eligible to receive .these commodities. local food distribution sites will be nominated to the state by the local government. with the assistance of nonprofits and other private sector organizations. each state will then submit an apportionment plan to the secretary of agriculture. the secretary of agriculture is required by this act to create a plan for allocating the commodities to the states. the reason this plan must be established is due to the nature of marketing order harvests. these harvests are regional. these harvests occur at different times of the year. and these harvests are perishable. my bill gives the secretary of agriculture the flexibility to decide who will collect and deliver this produce. at which locations. to which locations. and at which time of the year. the secretary would be required to confer with private sector and nonprofit organizations to ensure the fairness of the plan. finally. my bill allows the secretary of agriculture to increase spending on this program should it prove successful. the 25 percent of the contingency fund that the secretary of agriculture would be required to spend under this bill is a minimum requirement. the secretary of agriculture may spend more on this program. at his or her discretion. there has been discussion about ellminating the marketing order system. however. i do not believe that congress will be able to reach a consensus on ending marketing orders. the reason for this is that marketing orders are agreed to by growers of any particular commodity. the selection of the specifications of the marketing order must in general be agreed upon by twothirds of growers of a commodity. by decreasing the amount of produce introduced into the primary market. the cost of the produce is increased which increases profits for growers. for this reason. i do not oppose marketing orders. i only oppose the waste of an abundant and nutritious food source. mr. speaker. i believe that my bill is good policy. with low implementation and administrative costs. precedent exists for the types of contracts which would be established by the secretaries of agriculture and transportation. and for nonprofit and other private sector participation. this bill is fully funded. in closing. this plan is very simple. it will prevent the waste of tons of unused produce. it will create many jobs in the transportation industry. and it will feed numerous undernourished and hungry americans. the federal government will only act as a facilitator. with a minimum of interaction with the day to day operations of the transport of produce [top] program. the benefits of this act far outweigh any gain in protecting the sanctity of the contingency fund. and i urge my colleagues to consider this as they judge the value inherent in this bill. as the numbers published following this statement in the contingency fund analysis demonstrate. the lowest amount at years end in the cfin 1985--was approximately $37 million. twentyfive percent of this amount is about $9 million. that would mean in 1985. a minimum of $9 million would have been spent to feed americans and put americans to work. at not cost to the taxpayer. even after spending these funds. over $27 million would have remained at years end in the contingency fund. in 1991. $239 million remained at years end in the cf. that would have meant that nearly $60 million would have been spent to feed the hungry and create jobs with no added cost to the taxpayer. in 1991. $180 million still .would have remained in the contingency fund at years end. allowing this money to sit. unused. in this contingency fund is simply abominable. we have food going to waste while there are mouths to feed. and while there is a dire need to create jobs. we have the resources to accomplish this goal. my bill takes all of these factors into account. i urge my colleagues to support this legislation in the remaining hours of this congress. and early in the 103d congress upon reintroduction. e 3124 e3125 [i i dtde l cf cf qv cf an*u 25 gofcf awpkn cfimda mob yer 19 3 .... . ....... . . . .. . ........................................... 281.701 150.071 131.030

payments from income tax. i am not talking about all benefits. i am just talking about the supplemental. they are not getting them now. there is no tax on them now. like they are taxing regular benefits. so there is no loss of revenue. the moneys in the first place would not go into the trust fund. they would go into the federal coffers. now it seems to me there will be no effect on the budget and it seems to me that this is very equitable. as minimal as the number of weeks are and the amount of money they will get. this will be just a little extra money in their pockets. i just hate to see the government putting a few bucks in one pocket and then the irs coming around the other side and taking it out of the other one. now. the inequitable part of this is that it takes the previous 6 months of an entire state to be able to determine what each and every individual county or region in the state gets. they do not take into consideration the high unemployment in any one county. if you go into the district of the gentleman from ohio and my district and the district of the gentleman from ohio [mr. traficanti and the district of the gentleman from ohio . you find very high unemployment. but because of the fact that ohio has a lower unemployment rate in other areas. we are going to lose out. so that counties or states across the ohio river in kentucky and west virginia are going to be getting 20 weeks and 13 weeks. our little river counties in ohio are only going to get 7 weeks. i think that is very inequitable. my people are hurting. 0l 1230 let me just say this. that my people are hurting. my people are out of work. charlie hayes was talking about being on unemployment compensation at one time. nobody knows what the traumatic effect is that it has on you or the effect that it has on your family to be out of work. nobody wants to be out of work. they want to be able to have enough income so they can house. clothe and feed their families. that is all they are asking for. this is a little bit of extra money. now it is not of their making. it is because of government bad trade policy. government economic policies that has gone awry. through a host of business bankruptcies. and now we have the clean air act. which in ohio is going to cost us thousands of more jobs. we are going to have people out of work. they are going to be coming back eventually and looking for some supplement benefits. a ugus t 2. 1.991 they want to have a quality of life just like anybody else. we have supported the rest of the nation for a good many years. now i think the rest of the nation at least ought to look back and take care of those of us who helped the rest of the country.","mr. president. i rise today to thank the committee on environment and public works for accepting my mississippi water quality act as an amendment to s. 2740. the water resources development act of i had originally planned to offer this bill as an amendment to the clean air act. but the floor managers. senators baucus and chaee. persuaded me that my proposal would be better placed on a bill dealing more with water issues. i am pleased that the environment and public works committee attached it to s. 2740. which authorizes the u.s. army corps of engineers civil works program to construct various projects for improveinents to the nations infrastructure. just recently. colonel baldwin. the st. paul district u.s. army corps engineer. and louis kowalski. the chief of the planning division. were in my office to review the various corps projects in minnesota. i was pleased to extend my congratulations to the st. paul district corps on receiving the \"1989 award of excellence.\" the top engineering award of the corps. the st. paul district designed a project using dredge placement site material to build islands in weaver bottom backwaters. these islands provide waterfowl nesting habitat and reduce wave action. which leads to more productive marsh habitat by increasing aquatic plant growth. and provides additional capacity for dredge material. in addition. the dredge material provides closures and partial closures along the existing navigational channel. which should improve sediment transport efficiency and reduce maintenance dredging. mr. president. when i introduced my mississippi river water quality study act i outlined the importance of this great river. about 70 cities in the 10 states that border it derive their water from the mississippl additionally. each year millions of people use the mississippi for recreation. swimming. boating. fishing. and hunting. the upper mississippi river alonethat portion above the mississippiohio river junctionhas a total recreation value of approximately $700 million. my amendment instructs the u.s. geological survey [usgs] to carry out a study in consultation with three other federal agencies. the fish and wildlife service. the environmental protection agency. and the u.s. army corps of engineers. and the appropriate states. now is the time to begin this study because the usgs has recently been refining techniques for data collection and laboratory analysis designed for just such an assessment. the study proposed by this bill would extend the work of the usgs to include the entire river from the headwaters at lake itasca in minnesota to the gulf of mexico. and would lead to an overall assessment document in december. 1992. mr. president. the issue of water quality in the mississippi river is of the greatest importance to out nation. if we are to make the right choices about improving the quality of this valuable resource. we must have an accurate assessment of its present status. my proposal will provide .the framework to start this assessment. again. i want to thank the managers for accepting my mississippi river water quality act. mr. president. i yield the floor.","mr. speaker. i rise today to call the attention of my colleagues to an exemplary performance by bath iron works. a shipbuilder in my native state of maine. at a time when all of us in congress are rightly concerned by reports of cost overruns. production delays and performance problems by our nations defense contractors. i am proud to note that bath iron works has completed the repair of the damaged frigate u.s.s. samuel b. roberts ahead of schedule and $3.5 million below cost. ssional record - i .veusios this frigate. damaged by a mine in the persian gulf last year. also represented an extraordinarily difficult task for biw in that it was severely damaged just below that water line. nevertheless. bath iron works rose to the challenge by applying innovative and impressive engineering skills to complete a firstclass repair to the hull. clearly. baths many decades of shipbuilding expertise were ideally suited to the job of returning the roberts promptly. efficiently and costeffectively to its duties protecting our nations interests on the high seas. i add my congratulations to the navys on a job well done by biw. and i ask that the following associated press story from the kennebec journal on biws accomplishment be included in u.s.s. \"rosunts\" leaves portland portland (ap).-the uss samuel b. roberts sailed out of portland harbor on monday. after bath iron works completed more than a year of repairs on the guidedmissile frigate damaged by a mine in the persian gulf. the ship was returned several weeks ahead of schedule to the navy. which planned to have it back in its home port of newport. r.i.. by friday. according to biw spokesman jim mcgregor. biw. which had also built the ship. completed the repair work about $3.5 million cheaper than originally planned. mcgregor said. the company had been allowed $41 million for the job. but it cost just $37.5 million. he said. biw called the job one of its most challenging. because the portion of the hull that was damaged right under the water line was perhaps the worst possible place from a repair standpoint. \"this repair job taught us a great deal about the devastating effects of battle damage.\" capt. paul robinson. navy supervisor of shipbuilding at biw. said in a statement. \"i congratulate the men and women of the navy repair office in bath. the dedicated workers of biw. and the officers and men of the samuel b. roberts for their extraordinary accomplishments in making this ship better than new.\" after striking the mine on april 14. 1988. the ship underwent some repairs in the mideast before it was brought back to the biw yard in portland on sept. 25. 1988. to complete its repairs. biw built a 312ton modular unit that contained a main engine room. which was moved under the hull and jacked into a 45foot hole. \"restoration of this ship required engineering skills and shipbuilding expertise on a level not previously seen or experienced.\" said rear adm. robert reimann. \"many of the techniques used. such as preconstruction of the main engine room assembly. had never before been utilized in a battledamage situation.\"","mr. president. momentarily. i shall ask for a rollcall on my amendment to strike title x of the public health service act from the committee amendment. a few years ago. i recall quoting a statement to the effect that $11/2 billion in the hands of terrorists could not have inflicted the longterm harm to our society that title x expenditures have done. i agreed with that statement then and i agree with it now. aid i believe the american people would agree also if they could be made aware of the facts. in the judgment of this senator. for far too long many senators and congressmen have been afraid to address the problems in this program for fear of the wrath of planned parenthood and the rest of the abortion industry in america. i think it is time that we lay the facts on the table. the american people need to make a judgment for themselves. despite the new regulations. there are still problems with title x and congress should have the courage to correct them. the american taxpayers have the right to know that their tax dollars are being used by planned parenthood and the abortion industry in this nation to subsidize abortionrelated activities clearly in violation of the original intent of this legislation. that the title x moneyshardearned tax dollarsare being used to provide free contraceptives to minors in community after community across this land and in the schools of this country without parental consent. and that the title x program has failed miserably to curb teenage pregnancies and teenage abortions and. in fact. probably is exacerbating the problem. let us look at what course this program has taken with respect to maintaining the intended wall of separation between abortion and family planning. it is obvious that congress intended a strong wall of separation between abortion and family planning. in explaining section 1008the language disqualifying programs from title x funds if they were involved in abortionthe sponsors were clear: with the \"prohibition of abortion\" the committee members clearly intended that abortion is not to be encouraged or promoted in any way through this legislation. yet. once passed. the bureaucratic termiteswith the pressure of special interest groupsbegan eating away at this programs purpose and its prohibition on abortion. it was only a matter of time before they had reshaped the title x program from one which was not intended to be involved in abortion at all to one where millions of dollars in tax funds subsidize the abortion industry. under current policies. title x recipients can engage in abortion so long as they play the shell game and use nontitle x moneys to performand i stress the word \"perform\"-abortions. title x funds have been used to inspect facilities to determine their suitability to provide abortion services. title x moneys have been used to pay dues to organizations that advocate abortion. in 1982. the general accounting office [gao] investigated this matter and found the following: one clinic provided loans for abortions from nonprogram funds but charged to the title x program the administrative costs associated with the referral and loans. another clinicthese are just exampleshanded out materials which listed various birth control methods with the barrier method and early abortion in the event of failed contraception. pour clinics provided clients brochures prepared by abortion clinics. several clinics in indiana. just for example. provided and witnessed the signing of consent forms required by an abortion clinic. now. how is that for abuse of the legislative intent? gao also discovered that iihs had neither clarified its policy with respect to abortion related activities nor used its regulations and guidelines to communicate to title x recipients its position on section 1008. in conclusion. the study recommended that the secretary establish operational guidance to title x recipients and incorporate this guidance into title x program regulations and guidelines. i do not know about other senators. but i find it disturbing that over the course of the last decade a large portion of the title x moneys have been used for secret sex programs for our nations teenagers. i used the word \"secret\" because the bureaucrats have. through confidentiality and income eligibility requirements. made sure that important people are left in the dark. those important people are the parents of the teenagers. i believe american parents deserve an explanation as to why they must give consent before their child gets her ears pierced. yet. they are not even notified when their child receives contraceptives funded with federal tax dollars through title x. i suppose many in congress have tolerated these secret sex clinics because the socalled experts had told themand they believed itthat these kinds of programs were the solution to the teen pregnancy problem. do not believe it. mr. president. well. 16 years and $1.8 billion later. it is obvious that the \"experts\" were wrong. just laying aside the morality of it all. the experts were wrong in their forecast as to what would happen. just look at the facts. there were studies by zantner and kantner in 1971. 1976. and 1979 show a near doubling of pregnancies from 1971 to 1979 among unmarried girls and young women aged 15 to 19 from 8.5 percent. to 16.2 percent. followed by a slight decrease in 1982 to 13.5 percent. the congressional research service reports that illegitimate births among this age group have increased from 190.000 in 1970 to 263.000 in 1980. abortions among this age group have doubled since 1973 from 232.000 to 445.000 in 1980. in minnesota. where a 1981 law required parental notification for abortion. the pregnancy. abortion. and birth rates among adolescents plummeted. according to a 1985 report by the house select committee on children. youth. and families. from 1980 to 1983. abortions to minnesota teenagers. aged 15 to 19. dropped 40 percent. the teenage birth rate decreased 23.4 percent. and pregnancies decreased 32 percent. that is where they required parental notification. it is bad enough that the american taxpayers are forced to provide enormous sums of money. $1.7 billion to date. to stock the teen contraceptive armory. but now the title x cannons are being aimed at americas classrooms. since planned parenthood and other proabortion groups have failed in curbing teenaged pregnancy to date. they have decided that they must get to the teens before they become sexually active. according. mr. president. to a 1986 publication by the centers for population options. 17 states have schoolbased clinic programs providing contraceptives. prescriptions for contraceptives. or referral for contraceptives. all of this without the parents knowing one thing about it. it is not lawful to let the parent know what the teenager is doing. there are 53 high school sites and 8 junior high school sites. and title x provides about 3 percent of the public funds used by these clinics. have they worked? in the sense of getting more teens hooked on contraceptives. yes. have they reduced teenaged pregnancy? absolutely not. a few examples. in muskegon heights. mi. planned parenthood has set up shop in a local high school and. in 1985. planned parenthood boasted in an information packet that it had successfully reduced the birth rate in the high schools from 13 percent. when the clinic opened. to 10.3 percent. 3 years later. but later in the mate als planned parenthood had to admit no significant change in the pregnancy rate. so. the writings on the wall. the schoolbased sex clinics have increased abortions and have not reduced pregnancies. in kansas city. the clinics increased contraceptive use from 50 percent in 1983 to 63 percent in 1985. yet the pregnancy rates remained about 10 percent in both years. although the proportion who reported that they had had a baby dropped only slightly. these are just examples. i could go on and on. but. even if leaving parents out in the cold and schoolbased sex clinics had reduced teenage pregnancies. i question the longterm implications of this kind of policy by the government of the united states. using funds furnished by the taxpayers of this country. a fair question. i think. is: is it prudent for the physical health of our children to be pumping them with contraceptives. often powerful drugs? and what about the rising incidence of sexuallytransmitted diseases among our youth? the most effective methods of protection against pregnancy will not protect our children against sexuallytransmitted diseases. the statistics show. in fact. a dramatic increase in the incidence of sexuallytransmitted diseases among young people. the most current statistics show that one in seven teenagers has a sexuallytransmitted disease. of course. what about aids? there are 148 cases of aids among those in the age bracket 13 to 19. there are 7.686 cases among the age bracket from 20 to 29. many of whor are believed to have become infected as teenagers. these figures will certainly grow as the aids virus spreads. sexual activity is a significant risk factor for contracting aids. nobody denies that. and i think we have to face up to the question: do we not owe it to our children to do the best we can to make sure they do not contract aids? and how do you do that? this legislation. as it now stands. says: well. just do not let the parents know you are getting contraceptives. that is their cure for it. the american people certainly. i think. have a right to know how each of us stands on contraceptives without parental consent. the american people have a right to know how each of us feels on schoolbased sex clinics. and the subsidizing of the abortion industry with hardearned tax dollars. that is why i am raising these issues on the senate floor. that is the reason i am going to ask for the yeas and nays on the pending amendment. if title x is not eliminated from this bill. i will drop the subject if title x is eliminated from this bill. but we are going to vote on these issues otherwise. if this senate is really interested in restoring the original intent of this legislation. it should rebuild. right now. the intended wall of separation between abortion and contraceptives by prohibiting organizations engaged in abortion from receiving title x funds. if the senate is really interested in reducing teenage pregnancies. the incidence of sexually transmitted disease and aids among our young people. i suggest that we stop applying bandaids to the synptoms and start addressing the problemwhich. incidentally. is teenage promiscuity. not teenage pregnancy. and i suggest most of all that we restore to the parents of america their right to guide. monitor. and control the sexual activity of their children. there are a lot of people around this town who run for the hills when this word comes up. they do not like to hear us talk about it. the word is \"morality.\" but i think we need to return to some moral principles. the kind on which this country was founded. we need to teach our children that sex outside of marriage is wrong. it may be oldfashioned but it is still wrong. we have spent millions of dollars on \"just say no\" campaigns against drugs and alcohol. why not do it the same way with teenage sex? so. it is put up or shut up time now. i may be defeated on this amendment. if i am. we will keep trying. but i am absolutely persuaded. mr. president. that we must end the collaboration between the title x program and the abortion industry. we must end the raging assault the title x cannons have leveled against our parents and against our children. i hope senators will vote for my amendment to strike title x from the committee amendment. i ask for the yeas and nays. mr. president.","mr. speaker. apologists for child labor in manufacturing often assert that such exploitation is excusable in that it enables such children to eat and survive. this paternalistic and insidious perspective says nothing about what would happen if unemployed adults were hired into the jobs now being performed by children and if those adult workers were paid a decent wage for their work. the following cox newspaper report from the recent series entitled \"stolen childhood\" documents some of the shocking conditions in which as many as 44 million children between the ages of 5 and 15 work in india. this sort. of blatant exploitation of children in india perpetuates poverty and undermines the development of a more selfreliant indian economy.","mr. president. last week we began the debate on the dru export bill. s. 1848. w.ich i think is a very important bill. as i spoke in support of the bill. i brought out that this legislatioi will not. only save american jobs but that it will create somewhere between 8.000 and 10.000maybe as many as 50.000american jobs. and these are high paid jobs. and it will prevent export of ameritan biotechnology from this country. two of the three top phirmaceutical companies in the world today are nonunited states. i believe that there is a tremendous export of american biotechnology because of some of the laws that we have. this bill will help prevent that. it will keep the united states preeminent in the field of pharmaceutical development--preeminent in the world where we should be. and where we have on obligation to be because of the wealth anq the opportunities that this society and its tremendous enterprise capitalistic system provides. it will decrease our balance of payments deficit we estimate $500 million to $600 million a year. and it might be more than that. it will not increase the health risks to foreign consumers. it will not erect trade barriers that invite retaliation. and it will not cost taxpayers any money. there are very few bills that could make those type of claims. but this is one of them. under our current policy. the food. drug. and cosmetic act forbids the export of most pharmaceuticals until they receive approval from our own food and drug administration or the usda. even though the destination is a country where the drugs have already been approved. sometimes it takes up to 10 years to go through the fdas safety and efficacy process. it may cost $7 million to $8 million to develop a new drug which has already been tested as safe and effective by the fda equivalent countriesi mean by that. countries that have as good a scientific food and drug system as our country has. one of the problems that we have is that our pharmaceutical companies. in order to receive approval from the food and drug administration. have to go through a very long. involved detailed process. they inform us that for some reason some of these foreign lands across the world are a little bit more efficient than ours. and some of these very good. lifesaving. healthpromoting drugs get on the market overseas before they get on the market here. we have seen that time after time. well. it is arrogant for us to say that the food and drug administration of the government of the united states of america. or the usda. are the only people who can handle these problems. let us get to the real bottom line on this bill. i thipak the real issue is ignored by the critics of this bill. the real issue is the impact of this legislation. this bill. when compared to the results of current policy on the foreign consumer and others. under current policy. every drug which may be exportable under these amendments can be manufactured at foreign plants under few. if any. controls and supplied anywhere in the world. that is current law. thus. all of the potential problems the few critics of this bill claim can happen if these amendments are passed are happening right now because all an american company has to do is move offshore. and in moving offshore they can manufacture any drugs they want. and disseminate them worldwide without any regulation. this bill will place some constraints on that. there is. in short. no evidence that this bill will affect the types of drugs available to foreign consumers at all with the exception of possible tropical disease drugs. while the bill. through its requiremefits. insures greater quality and imposes much greater fda control on those drugs produced in the united states and exported. is there any evidence that the current ban on the export of unimproved drugs by our fda. but approved by other nations. actually saves any lives? the answer is a resounding no. is there any evidence that the defeat of s. 1848 will prevent any injury to foreign consumers? the answer is a resounding no. will s. 1848 improve the situation for foreign consumers? the answer is just as firmly yes. this bill is a net improvement for foreign consumers. it will save american jobs and it will lower our balanceofpayments deficit. i say let us cut through the rhetoric and let us get this bill passed. i am prepared to proceed with amendments. as i understand it. the distinguished senator from ohio has a number of amendments that he feels are essential. i would be more than happy to proceed with those amendments at this time. with the understanding that votes will occur tomorrow. and we can stack those votes or consider them as the distinguished senator from ohio. the majority leader. and the minority leader desire. so with that. i yield the floor.","mr. chairman. i rise in support of this amendment to urge the committee on ways and means to recommend to this house the adoption of a mandatory minimum tax. and. i urge that when the committee brings forth its recommendation. it make a recommendation for a mandatory corporate minimum tax and assign the revenues raised to reducing the budget deficit. for more than 3 years. private sector and government experts have agreed that our nation is threatened by an unbroken string of budget deficits ranging between $100 billion and $200 billion to $300 billion. the office of management and budget now estimates that the 1985 budget deficit will be $222.2 billion. compared to $175.3 billion in 1984. u.s. individual taxpayers should be able to believe that our tax system is fair. they should be able to believe that congress means for the burden of reducing the deficit to be shared fairly. there can be little wonder that our individual taxpayers doubt the fairness of our tax system when 90.000 profitable -corporations pay no taxes. there should be little surprise when our individual taxpayers doubt congress will to make all parties share the burden of deficit cuts if we fail to make all profitable corporations ante up. when our individual taxpayers learn that 65 major u.s. corporations. with combined profits of nearly $50 billion between 1981 and 1983. paid not 1 cent in taxes during that period. the conviction that our tax system is unfair grows geometrically. one of those highly profitable corporations. w.r. grace .&amp; co.. is headed by peter grace. of grace commission fame. mr. grace chronically lambasts the federal government for waste and abuse. but. not only did his corporation not pay any federal taxes on the $684 million in profits it made in the last 3 years. it received a $12.5 million federal tax refund. during his term of office president reagan estimates. in his budget documents. that he will rack up a combined deficit which will exceed the cumulative deficit of all other presidents in the history of our nation. the devastating results of such a development repeatedly have been the subject of warnings by internationally respected economics expert after internationally respective economics expert. on january 20. 1983. the bipartisan budget appeal took a fullpage advertisement in the washington post to plead for deficit control and to warn of the consequences of failure. the bipartisan budget appeal had as its leaders sixthree democrat and three republicanformer u.s. secretaries of the treasury. in their appeal. they warned: the federal budget is now out of control. it is primed to generate immense deficits. year after year. for decades aheaddeficits far larger than any in our history. this fiscal course is senseless. it threatens to lock the economy in stagnation. for the remainder of this century. massive deficits would absorb savings urgently needed for investment in plant and equipment. infrastructure and r&amp;d. productivity would sag and inflation resurface. interestsensitive industries would be smothered and exports would dwindle. the result would be a period of gradual decline. punctuated by high unemployment and social conflict and culminating in an america that is permanently poorer and weaker. these experts cited four principal results of such destructive deficits. they were: a \"feeble and temporary\" recovery from the recordsetting recession then gripping the nation. \"abnormally high\" real interest rates. \"artificially high\" dollar exchange rates which \"would continue to choke off american exports. suck in imports. destroy u.s. jobs. and could make the temptation of fullscale protectionism irresistible\". and. make \"unacceptably high unemployment a fixed feature of the industrial landscape.\" the bipartisan appeals statements were not hindsight. they were foiecasts. lets examine them in light of what has occurred in the past 4 years of recordhigh federal deficits. while the economy grew at record rates in the first two recessionrecovery quarters of 1984. it experienced a growth recession in the next three quarters. in fact. data recently released by president reagans administration shows that the economy is virtually in stagnation. in the first quarter of this year the gross national product grew at less than 1 percent. the recovery from the 198182 reagan recession seems. indeed. to be feeble. and. if the estimates of some private sector experts. who expect a recession in 1986. become reality. this recovery from the deepest recession since the 1930s will certainly have been temporary. as the bipartisan appeal warned. real interest rates have been abnormally high for the past 4 years. and are continuing that record today. despite the downward trend which has recently been experienced in some interest rates. widely respected economist henry kaufman predicted yesterday a rise in interest rates in the near future. real interest rates today are more than 300 percent higher than they were in 1980. in its estimates. the bipartisan appeal warned that \"artificially high\" dollar exchange rates resulting from persistent recordhigh deficits would harm exports. encourage imports. destroy american jobs and encourage trade protectionism. we are experiencing all those ills. since 1980 the real value of the dollar in currency exchange has risen more than 52 percent. last year we experienced the largest merchandise trade deficit in the history of our nation. and. according to president reagans administration data. the trade deficit is piling up at a faster pace today than it did in 1984. imports are flopding our nation. our exports are being choked off by the overvaluation of the dollar. thousands of american jobs. including 1.000 in my small hometown. have been lost to import competiton. the depression in u.s. agriculture exports has forced net farm income to record low levels and is helping push our farmers off the land. the fever for trade protectionist legislation is running at its highest intensity since the great depression. and. the bipartisan appeals warnings about unacceptably high unemployment are a reality in todays america. in april. for the third straight month. unemployment stayed at 7.3 percent. for the past 4 yearsyears of recordsetting deficitsthe high unemployment rate has undermined the hopes and dreams of employment for millions of americans. last month more than 8 million jobseekers could not find work. the length of jobless periods of america jobseekers has risen by nearly 56 percent in the past 4 years. although there has been some improvement in the unemployment rate since the end of the reagan recession of 198182. that rate last month was almost the same as the annual rate for the last year and was higher than the rate for in fact. as the bipartisan appeal predicted in 1983. destructively high unemployment rates seem in danger of becoming a fixed feature of our industrial landscape. because our current tax system lets thousands of profitable corporations off without paying any taxes. because abnormally high real interest rates strike at the heart of our economic future. because overvaluation of the dollar steals american jobs and blocks farm. manufactured. and services exports. because high unemployment is a drag on our economic prospects. and. because such developments either feed the growth of federal deficits or result from them. or both. the amendment before us should be adopted. and. the ways and means committee should respond by recommending a mandatory corporate minimum tax that will force corporations to pay at least some of their fair share of the cost of reducing the deficits. mr. chairman. i want to respond in part to the statement made by the gentleman from new york just a minute ago. we have heard from the gentleman from new york who is one of the architects of the fiscal disaster caused by the tax reform act of 1981 which permitted those 65 corporations with profits of more than $50 billion to avoid paying one red cent to the treasury in taxes. we have heard from mr. kemp. we have heard from his \"tax reform\" before. we have heard from his kind of justice that requires an arkansas tractor driver to pay more taxes than the w.r. grace co. but. not only is our tax code unfair. as we have said today. it is hypocritical. the current tax law permits that hypocrisy. we have heard from the gentleman from new york. who has been the chief advocate of these policies. what our amendment does is to say that these inequities should be corrected in part with a minimum tax. and that the income derived from that minimum tax should be earmarked for the reduction of this devastating deficit that prices our farmers tout of world competiton. that subsidizes foreign imports on shoes and textiles. and puts our people out of work. that is what we are saying here. and i call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment and to remove tax injustice from american society. i would be glad to yield to the gentleman from new york.","retained its flexibility to apportion work and to sublease mines without what the companies would

and american markets to an unprecedented degree. with the contract behind him. trumka said he will push to organize the 30 percent of the industry that is nonunion and for legislation aimed at threats such as foreign coal production by american firms. . u.s.-based multinational firms are \"taking american capital and technology to underdeveloped countries. exploiting workers there. and importing the coal back here.\" he said. while taxpayers subsidize the process through foreign investment tax credits which he said the umw would push to change.e","mr. president. i rise in support of the statement made by senator andrews. chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on transportation. senator andrews and his staff have labored long and hard on this bill. and their very skillful work is evident throughout the legislation and the accompanying report. chairman andrews and i have worked hard to accommodate the important transportation issues that other members have brought to our attention. we have sought to reach these accommodations within the policies established by the authorizing committees and within the funding levels agreed to in the budget resolution. as the chairman has said. we are well within the budget resolution. in fact. we are well under that resolution. and could have funded additional projects. however. there is the problem of confrontation with the executive branch. and in an effort to try to get this bill on its way we have reduced it down below the level requested by the president. the committee drafted this bill with an understanding that we need to reinvest in our nations transportation system to reverse the cycle of a decaying transportation system. it was drafted with an understanding that a good transportation system underlies and supports the commercial fabric of our country. we have done this. however. in a fiscally restrained manner recognizing that while the problems are large. the resources we have to deal with them are not unlimited. as an indication of the fiscal restraint included in the appropriation bill before us. it is $444.3 million below the level recommended by the house. it is $444.4 million below the amount assumed in the budget resolution. it is $57.9r million below the administrations request. and it is $44.4 million below the 302(b) allocations made by the czmmittee yesterday. mr. chairman. the transportation appropriations subcommittee recommended to our full committee yesterday a 302(b) ceiling that is $400 million below the level included in the budget resolution. it is fair to report that this bill is lean and fiscally restrained. mr. president. last december this congress passed the surface transportation assistance act of 1982. that legislation provided for an approximate 50percent increase in highway spending to help rebuild and repair our deteriorated system of highways and bridges. that legislation also included reauthorization for the urban mass transportation administration. and last september we adopted legislationthe airport and airway improvement act of 1982that reauthorized the airport programs. this new authorizing legislation has permitted program growth in key areas. for example. included in the bill is an overall ceiling of $12.6 billion for the highway program compared to the $8.1 billion ceiling that we started with last year. also included is an increase of $321.9 million for aviation programs and an increase of $50 million for the airports grantsinaid program. these increases are permitted by the important transportation legislation that we passed last year. while the committees recommendation for transit funding is $725.4 million less than last year. it is $307.9 million more than the administrations requests. our transit recommendations also reject two administration policy proposals that we believe would be detremental to transit systems around the country. first. we have rejected the proposal to abolish operating assistance. and second we have rejected the proposal to eliminate new rail starts. we have in fact funded the continuation or initiation of 12 new rail systems around the country. and these systems will help meet important transportation needs well into the next century. mr. president. while i support the bill in general. there is one portion of it that troubles me. the $1.5 billion funding proposed for the coast guard is an increase of only $49 million from last year. this is below the administration request. and it is below the house allowance. the coast guardthe fifth branch of the armed forcesis an agency which we have consistently sought to fund at levels higher than those rec6mmended by the administration. during times of war the coast guard has an important military role under the command structure of the navy. during times of peace the coast guard has many functions including search and rescue at sea and interdiction of foreign drugs. the coast guard has successfully reduced the flow of illegal drugs into south florida. it has also stemmed the flow of illegal aliens into this country. i do not support the funding levels proposed for the coast guard in this bill. i feel that we are only deferring an adequate level of funding that must be provided to permit the coast guard to rebuild its aging fleet and to permit it to effectively meet its many responsibilities. mr. president. on balancewith this one exceptioni support the bill. i believe it is the best piece of legislation that can be achieved within the funding constraints required to get it signed. mr. president. i would urge my colleagues to support the bill and commend chairman andrews for his very fair and courteous treatment of members on both sides of the aisle and for his very broad understanding of the transportation issues facing america today.","mr. speaker. too many times people allow their feelings of helplessness to become barriers in making the necessary changes to imressional record - extensions of remarks prove the quality of life. however. this certainly is not the case with stanley selengut. the people of the u.s. virgin islands are extremely grateful that stanley selengut had the courage to overcome these barriers. stanley has come to the virgin islands and made a difference by improving the quality of life in our community. stanley. a civil engineer and builder. came to the u.s. virgin islands 5 years ago with a vision. he wanted to build an ecological campsite resort without any of the embellishments. he found 14 acres on st. john and began to construct the resort called maho bay. the vacation spot was completed in an untouched section of st. john.and 16 x 16 tent sites were scattered throughout the grounds. the federal government. realizing the intrinsic value of this project. joined in promoting and supporting the maho bay project. it has been an excellent example of the private and public sectors joining forces for the common goodand many people have enjoyed the fruits of this labor. while enjoying the creation of maho bay. stanley made another contribution to improve the quality of life for visitors and virgin islanders alike. two people were playing a flute and guitar respectively at maho bay. and a crowd began to gather to listen to the music. stanley saw the enjoyment created by this impromptu outdoor concert and expanded upon the idea. out of this. the st. john festival of the arts was born. the festival brings in quality performers who volunteer their time and talents for a vacation at maho bay in lieu of payment. i myself had the privilege and pleasure of hearing several excellent musicians from the 1982 festival. they included: maeretha stewart. coloratura soprano. james javore. baritone.* susan poliacik. cellist. and. norman carey. pianist. it should be noted here that all concerts for the festival are free to the public. helping stanley to make this arts festival possible are other fine truly communityminded people. like sandy berman of first charter corp.. who arranged for all the travel. making a difference is not new to stanley selengut. he is noted for his work in the craft industryespecially for his endeavors in reviving patchwork. he has worked on indian reservations and in appalachia. additionally. stanley made learning materials for children and some of these are ex. hibited in the smithsonian! stanley selengut has given his time and love to the people of the virgin islands. speaking for my community. we appreciate him greatly and wanted to share his work with the nation. stanley is a true example that one man can make a difference.*","mr. chairman. one of the questions that we hear more and more. as people realize the extent of our financial problems. is \"why? what happened? why are we in this mess?\" the answer to that is the reason the country is insisting we pass the reaga!l program.. the american economy is overregulated and undernourished. in the last 10 years. business investment has dropped nearly 400 percent. productivity increases. the lifeblood of. the. modern economy. have declined to the point where actual economic growth has become more a fading memory than an actual occurrence. for the last 4 years.. taxes have gone up an average of-$610 every year for each may 7. 1.981 working man and womanin this countryl the explosive growth in the- size of the federal government has reached a point where that government consumes. in an average year. 21 percent of t .his nations wealth. american businesses that want to modernize or expand have to compete for an eversmaller supply of capital. in 1955. the federal government consumed only 5 percent of the total available credit in this country: today. the government consumes more than 23 percent of all available credit. driving up the cost of money and decreasing the amount that is available -4or businesses to expand and create niw jobs. malnourishment leads to starvation. and it is said that a starving man dies by inches. the most sinister and deadly effect of our -malnotirished economy is the slow starvation of the american dream. slowly. by inches. that dream is disappearing. you know the dreamnthe \"only in america\" dreamthe dream of opportunity. of a chance to get ahead. to own your own home. to educate your children. to retire someday instead of working until you drop .dead ain your- tracks bent over some machine. today. all these dreamsretirement. education. owning your own homeare becoming more and more distant. last year. the savings rate in this country was at the lowest point since world war ii. there is barely enough money to pay bills. and nothing left to save. nothing left to build a nest egg. or put aside a downipayment. and so fewer people. especially young people. can buy a home. and because the money was not put in savings. and because fewer people are investing. there is no money for builders to borrow to. build the homes that people cannot afford to buy. we know the answer to the question of \"what happened and why.\" the answer is all around us. we see it in the lines at the employment office. we see in the faces of the young. who are losing hope of owning their own home. the question before us now. is: are we. going to settle for more of the same or will we accept the mandate of the voters of thid country and restore to all americans the -promise of the american dream before it too becomes little more than a fading memory? in the past several years. the. response to this question has )een promises of \"responsible budgets. \"sound\" budgets. \"prudenit\" budgets. and \"austere\" budgets. what we have gotten are record inflation rates. record unemployment. record interest rates. and record deficits.. this year. the budget committee has come up with more of the same. there is only. one comprehensive program that addresses the problem. we face. that is the reagan program as presented in the bipartisan substitute. this proposal embraces. all the components of the presidents program for economy recovery. this proposal is designed to eliminate the\" obstacles to a prosperous economy. the reduction in thesize of the federal budget will free up resources to allow business to expand and create new jobs. the reduction in tax rates will put money in the hands of the people. instead of in the hands of the government. this will allow people to build a nest egg. to save for their childrens education and to begin to save for a home. these policies. together with a policy of regulatory reform and restraint on the growth of money will free us from the crippling burden of high interest rates. high inflation rates and high unemployment. the question is asked: how do we know this program will work? mr. chairman.. there is one thing we do know. the political economies of the past 40 years has not worked. this program seeks to nourish the dream we all share. to accept anything less would be a denial of the promise of that dream to all americans.","i thank the gentleman for yielding and i join with great pleasure in the special order that the steel caucus has undertaken to highlight and focus on the needs and the problems of the american steel industry. steel is fundamental to a modern industrialized society. and american steel is at a crossroads. in fact. it is entering a decade of decision. a strong america is dependent. in large part. on a strong steel industry. that is why we have joined together to form this congressional steel caucus. to assure that we will put in place the legislation necessary to strengthen the steel industry and to assure a strong future. my own congressional district is the major supplier of iron ore for the nations steel industry. in fact. better than twothirds of all of the iron ore consumed by the domestic steel industry comes from northern minnesota. a total of 7.100 steelworkers today are either out of work or are on short workweeks. and that economic slump. hundreds of miles away from basic steelproducing industries. indicates what an integrated industry is steel and how important all of the parts are to the whole of that steel industry. the slump did not occur just today or yesterday or 2 v years ago when the steel caucus was formed. the problems of the domestic steel industry go back to the early 1950s when the coal and steel community in europe was being formed. there. weakened by world war ii. by decades of decline. the leaders of the european coal and steel industries. governments. and labor joined together to form the european coal and steel community. and that coal and steel community. in a very determined. forceful. and carefully thoughtout fashion. set about modernizing the fundament of that industrial society we know as western europe. in a cold and calculated way. they determined which coal mines were inefficient and should be eliminated and which steel industries were inefficient and should be eliminated. in a similar. very organized fashion. they decided which foundries should be eliminated. they strengthened the marginaltostrong producers. and they built up the effective and strong producing steel industry. the workers were relocated to other areas where they could find jobs. and given training and relocation assistance benefits and housing assistance. in sum. they took care of the workers in a total fashion. in order to assure that there would be a trained work force in other parts of society and also to sustain the strong segments of their coal and steel industries. and today. some 25 years after that modernization of the european steel industry was achieved. they are rivaling america. they are challenging us for every pound of steel in this domestic market. we need to do the same kind of toptobottom reindustrialization. revitalization. reinvigorating of the domestic steel industry. we have approached that problem on 4 bases in the steel caucus. we approached the matter of trade from the matter of the triggerprice mechanism. the japanese steelmaking costs are vastly understated. just as the european steelmaking costs are vastly understated. we feel that the triggerprice mechanism was not effectively carried out by the administration. it did not adequately reflect home market price at the point of origin of steel. we feel that triggerprice mechanism should be reestablished in a strengthened and restructured form and carried forward by this administration. we also feel that the antidumping act ought to be effectively and vigorously carried forward by this administration. in regard to the second area of capital formation and capital recovery. we feel that tax assistance is vitally important for a vigorous steel industry. one approach which i feel is very important and holds great promise for the future is that of a refundable investment tax credit. which could pump $600 million to $1 billion immediately into the steel industry where it is needed for quick investment into new productive facilities that can turn the steel industry around and invigorate our economy. we have to reconsider. rethink. the concept of the usefullife principle that has governed the taxation of steelmaking facilities. that concept has not proved helpful. but has proved to be a drag on the steel industry. the third area of concern is that of modernization. a problem which really is tied in with the matter of capital formation and capital recovery. if we can provide the tax incentive that is necessary for reinvigorated steel industry. i think we can move ahead very effectively with the modernization of the steel industry and see existing facilities modernized and new ones put underway. the fourth problem area is the matter of environmental compliance. the decade of the seventies will be known as the environmental decade in which america turned in a vigorous way to protect the environment in order to offset the pollution of 200 years of industrial development. we are now coming to the realization that we cannot achieve those goals all in a decade. while we do not propose to stop in any way or to slow down in any fashion the protection of the environment. the cleaning up of the air and of the water and of the land. we realize that we have to somewhat shift gears and shift the pace at which we achieve those goals. this evening we will lay out some specific steps in order to attain the highest standards for water treatment facilities and clean air. as a member of the committee on public works. i worked on the water pollution control legislation and now propose that some compliance dates be stretched out to achieve these goals. three years ago when we made amendments to the federal water pollution control act in the committee on public works. i brought forth a chart similar to these showing the problem of complying with the dates set forth by the law and by the environmental protection agency. the delivery times for pollution abatement cquipment for the steel industry were so longrange that the steel industry simply could not. no matter how much money was laid out. comply with those dates set in the law and required by the regulations of the epa. at that time i offered an amendment in the committee to stretch out that time not only for the steel industry. but for other similarly affected sectors of society. after quite some argumentation in the committee. we had to cut it in half. and 3 years were stretched out to 11/2 years. i think if that same amendment were offered today. if we had that legislation pending before us. that there would be no question that a 3year time frame stretch out would pass rather handily. there is no question that the steel caucus has raised the level of awareness and understanding of committee members and the american public that there are certain fiscal impossibilities to achieve in cleaning up the environment. such goals cannot be attained overnight. but must be dealt with in a realistic fashion and placed on a longrange time plan. air pollution requirements must also be worked out to discover a means of finding the most costeffective way of achieving compliance with the air standards. both those in law and those in regulation. the steel industry now is somewhere near 93 percent compliance on water pollution. on the best available treatment. best practicable treatment of discharges from steel plants. we have to look at what are now the costs of achieving that last 7 to 10 percent and assure. that in achieving that goal. that we do not impose too heavy a cost on the industry at a time when it needs those funds for modernization. and reinvestment in productive capacity. i appeal to the congress and to this administration and to the public to understand our plea for legislation. for programs to create an economic climate in the eighties that will stimulate the recovery of the basic steel industry in america. i congratulate the chairman of our executive committee. the chairman of our steel caucus. the gentleman from pennsylvania. and the gentleman from indiana. who have led the effort and who have sponsored this special order focusing the attention of the congress on these vital problems.","i thank the distinguished majority leader. mr. president. i commend the senator from west virginia. who has so long been dealing with the energy problems of this country and has made such a significant contribution to the efforts we have made to achieve a reasonable and effective policy. i say again. to emphasize. that the report that is now before the president of the united states from his coal commission is an interim report. there are many other problems attendant with the increased production and utilization of coal that the commission is dealing with. which their final report at the end of this year will address. problems such as transportation. such as the production of coal in view of the new surface mining act that is now in the process of being implemented. and certainly the problem of management and labor relations. all of these will be addressed. i add my comments on the chairman of our coal commission. the distinguished governor of the state of west virginia. mr. jay rockefeller. and advise my colleagues that during the final days of the preparation and presentation of this report the chairman was acting under unusual stress and strain. with the impending birth of an additional child for the rockefellers being more and more imminent as the hours went by. that blessed event has now occurred. and on yesterday governor and mrs. rockefeller received a new member of the family by the name of justin aldrich rockefeller. i know that now he will be able to pursue his work with the commission-","even if it were entanglement. it might be all right because it is not excessive entanglement. this reduces language to the point where meaning begins to disappear. the senator has raised the question of the original intention of the first amendment. which is historically not disputed. i want to say that the senator from south carolina very generously has acknowledge the early meaning. and the senator from arkansas is in the chair and will not for a few moments have a chance to respond. but. if he wishes to. i will be happy to hear his position. i would like to use this opportunity to read for a moment from the annals of the congress of the united states. the first conqress. which were published in 1834 on the basis of notes taken bv a responsible person who was nresent on that occasion. it is intpresting to recall that the senste proceedinas at that time were secret but the house proceedings were open. there is a very nice passage where we can observe the point at which the difficulty we have with the intepretation of the present first amendment begins. i would like to remind a not exactly tumultuous or vet overcrowded chamber that the house of reuresentatives debated the first amendment for 1 day. madison originally put forward the proposition in which. to say it very simply. the key clause. what we now call the establishment clause. was and i shall quote it. that \"no national religion shall be established by law.\" the proposition had first been put forward that no religion should be established by law. and then madison said. \"would the gentleman be satisfied if the word national were inserted before religion?\" he believed that the people feared one sect might obtain a preeminence or that two combined together might establish a religion to which they would compel others to conform. he thought if the word \"national\" were introduced it would point the amendment directly to the object it was intended to prevent. \"congress shall make no law to establish a national religion.\" what happened to that clarifying word \"national\"? mr. gerry. of massachusetts. objected. mr. gerrys role in the first congress is confusing to historians as it was confusing to his colleagues. because he objected to almost everything. and it was widely said that he objected to anything he did not propose. in this instance. he objected to the word \"national\" and entered upon a not inelegant if somewhat obscure point that the antifederalists had opposed the constitution on the grounds that it was establishing a national government. the federalists said. no. it was establishing a federal government. but here. having won their way. what are they. first of all. doing? they are introducing the word \"national\" right into the constitution. and gerry was against it. he proceeded them to a line which was not less obscure. if indeed. also less elegant. he said. and i offer this to the senator from arkansas. who may rightly fear that our discourses might rise to the level of intemperate comparisons of one with the other. i offer him elbridge gerrys observation in that first congress. he said. with respect to the question of having differing sides on this matter. \"their names then ought not to have been distinguished by federalists and antifederalists. but rats and antirats.\" such were the views of elbridge gerry at the point. in the course of debate at which the word \"national\" disappeared from the first amendment. leaving a problem that. i think. has pursued us since. there is not the least question of the intentions of the framers of the amendment but over a very long time. that intention inevitably became more remote. there is only the one reason it became remote: because the time came when no one much longer knew. or few much longer knew what an established church was. still less that anyone very much wanted to establish one. it is just a phenomenon that disappeared in the course of the 19th century. i suppose the only established church left. in that sense. is probably the church of england. the church of ireland was disestablished. the church of scotland was disestablished. the church of canada was disestablished. state churches that were established by state governments in the 18th centuryand at the time the first amendment was adopted. 9 of the first 13 states had established churchesthey. too. in time. disappeared. mr. president. i am going to take this moment in the course of the debate to bring to the beginning an end. which is to say to make the opening statement which i have prepared for this occasion. my colleagues in this matter have been generous enough to refer to the work of my old friend and associate. dr. chester finn. who has worked on this matter. i should like to express a similar respect and gratitude to john colvin of senator packwoods staff. to susan irving of senator ribicoffs staff. and to bruce thompson of senator roths staff. who have served spectacularly in this matter. together we have tried. as the record will showi see mr. colvin is on the floor nowto present a serious proposition to the senate. one already approved. of course. by the house. and one that we hope will be judged. as is clear so far from this debate today. on its merits as public policy. it is not merely the right but the responsibility of the senate to speak its mind to issues of constitutional law when they are raised with respect to legislation. as regularly they are. and to leave the matter to the ultimate decision by the court. which always. in its deliberations. asks. what was the judgment of congress? it is a novel doctrine altogether that congress ought not to have any views of its own. a doctrine that is certainly not historically supportable. the central issue before the senate this week is whether it is to be the policy of the united states to foster state monopoly in the field of education or to help to enable individuals to obtain for themselves and their children the education they prefer at the schools and colleges they select. the issue is not the future of the public schools. they now enroll more than 90 percent of all primary and secondary students. more than 75 percent of all postsecondary students. although they do not lack for problems. their future is secure and is not the least threatened by our proposal. in no small part. this security is due to two decades of federal provision for public education. in the fiscal year about to begin. federal expenditures will average $352 per public school student and $1.227 per college student. these sums are the product of literally hundreds of laws and provisions. including aid to institutions. aid to individual students. and tax expenditures. for let no one be misled by the claim that tuition tax credits represent the first involvement of the jnternal revenue codeor the committee on financewith federal education policy. existing tax expenditures for education will total $7.7 billion in fiscal 1979. the sponsors of tuition tax credits have been steadfast and ardent supporters of these measures. many of us have participated in their inception. as a member of the kennedy and johnson administrations. i took part in the creation of the college workstudy program in 1963. in 1964. i helued negotiate the agreements that broke the deadlock over federal aid to education and led directly to passage of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965. in 1970 i drafted the presidential messae to congress that led to the basic educational opportunity grants program. the national institute of education. and th( fund for improvement of postsecondar3 education. in the senate i have votec for every major eduction authorizataior and appropriation bill that has come before us. i have done thisand my colleague. have similar recordsbecause of an absolute conviction that the federal government should support education. and that its first responsibility is to the public institutions in which the vast majority of students receive their education let there be no mistake about it. the public schools come first. we have provided for them. and we shall continue to provide for them and for their students. there is no conflict whatsoever between continued federal support for public education and the proposal now before us. and there is no truth to the accusation that in providing limited aid through the tax system to families who patronize nongovernment schools we will do any harm whatsoever to government schools. far the more important policy question before the senate is whether nonpublic schools are to have a future or whether the national government is to aid and abet those who would not mind in the least if they were to shut down entirely. for let there be no mistake about this either: in the field of education. the public sector is slowly but inexorably vanquishing the private. a quarter century ago. private colleges and universities enrolled half the postsecondary students. today. they account for just 22 percent. in 195960. 14 out of every 100 american schoolchildren attended private and parochial schools. by 197576. this had declined to 9 percent. between 1965 and 1975. nonpublic schools lost 1.8 million students. some 28 percent of their enrollments. in 1976 there were 2.246 fewer private schools in existence than there had been one decade earlier. this decline has been especially acute among schools affiliated with the roman catholic church. they lost 39 percent of their studentssome 2.16 million pupilsbetween 1965 and 1975. the public schools gained almost the same number of students2.66 millionduring this period. the question cannot be avoided: is the national government to ignore these unmistakable trends? is it to feign neutrality. all the while providing significant amounts of aid only to public schools as the schools of the nongovernment sector decline and crumble? the administration says yes. despite solemn promises by the president and pious pronouncements by the u.s. commissioner of education. the executive branch remains the property of a public bureaucracy that abhors that which it does not control. at the policymaking level. it is dominated by persons who have succumbed to a form of statism which they still. unaccountably. equate with liberalism. they have striven mightily to brand our proposal as illiberal but have succeeded only in further distorting public discourse in this area. for their arguments reduce to a single essential: the argument for state r monopoly in the education of american i children. i an element of liberty is at stake in this debate. an historic manifestation of american pluralism and diversity is at stake. the civil rights of the american people are involved. not just of those i who happen to favor nongovernment schools for their own children. but also of those millions more who would defend the right of their neighbors to make such a choice. it has been said that this is a catholic issue. and insofar as catholic schools still comprise the largest single part of the nongovernment education system. that is true. but it is also a serious oversimplification that fails to take account of the 166.000 students in schools run by the missouri lutheran synod. the 76.000 in seventhday adventist schools. the 241.000 in evangelical christian schools. the 90.000 in jewish day schools. the 77.000 in episcopal schools. the 14.000 in quaker schools. or the 277.000 in independent private schools. as well as the many other religious and nonsectarian groups enrolling significant numbers in their schools. it has also been said that our proposal would benefit only the middle class. this is untrue. no less an authority than prof. thomas sowell. the distinguished black economist. has said thatfew groups have so much at stake in the fate of this bill as ghetto blacks. four hundred thousand black and other minority group members now attend nongovernment schools. many more would be able to do so with the assistance of tuition tax credits. sowell writes that: one of the great untold success stories of contemporary american education is the extent to which catholic schools. left behind in ghettoes by the departure of their original white clientele. are successfully educating black youngsters there at low cost. in one state and city after another. a distinguishing characteristic of nonpublic schools is their high degree of racial integration. in the archdiocese of new yorkwhich extends up the hudson valley and into the catskill mountains37 percent of elementary school students are black. hispanic or asian. in chicago. 55 percent of the students in the 82 catholic schools are black. in philadelphia. 45 percent are black or spanish surnamed. in new orleans. the figure is 38 percent. in the roman catholic schools of south carolina. 28 percent of the students are black. and twothirds of those are not even catholic. at our hearings last january. the finance committee heard eloquent pleas for tuition tax credits by black parents whose children attend the our lady of perpetual help school in anacostia. d.c.. just a few miles from this chamber. the reverend george clements sent an urgent letter from the holy angels parish of chicago. which operates the largest black catholic school in the nation. enrolling 1.300 students. \"our school.\" he writes. \"has a very long waiting list because of its high academic quality. this school is located in the lowest socioeconomic area of the city of chicago. we have an extremely difficult time raising the necessary funds to keep our school alive.\" to deny this reality is worse than oversight. it verges on willful blindness on the part of those who have decided that to aid such persons and. indirectly. such schools is illiberal. i submit that the opposite is true: to deny aid to such persons and thereby make it more difficult for them to obtain the education they seek for their families is to submit to paternalism and to statism. it has been said that our proposal would result in support for segregated private schools. in order to believe this. one must believe that the internal revenue service is not willing to enforce the tax code or not competent to do so. for under our proposal no elementary or secondary student may receive a tax credit unless the irs has certified the school that the student attends is nondiscriminatory. our committee report explains these provisions and procedures in some detail. commissioner kurtz has personally assured me that the irs is determined scrupulously to enforce these standards. and that within a few weeks will promulgate even more stringent standards and procedures. he has also made clear that the irs will investigate any and every private school about which a complaint or allegation of discrimination is brought. to insure the adequacy of these procedures. our bill directs the attorney general. the secretary of hew and the secretary of the treasury jointly to monitor the enforcement of civil rights provisions by the internal revenue service. and to report to the congress. with the first such report due well before the elementary and secondary tax credit takes effect. should any shortcomings be found. we pledge ourselves to direct the attention of the congress to them and to propose the necessary remedies. it has been said that our proposal would be struck down by the supreme court. if so. that will be the end of it. we seek only our day in court and think of it as a matter of right that we should be given such a hearing. it is after all the task of the supreme court of the united states to make such determinations. the constitutional issue will be discussed at length in the course of this debate. and i shall have more to say about it. for now. i would simply cite the opinion of prof. antonin scalia of the university of chicago. immediate past assistant attorney general. office of legal counsel that: it is impossible. within the time allotted. to describe with any completeness the utter confusion of supreme court pronouncements in the churchstate ares .... i urge you. then. to axoroach this issue as a question of what the constitutional law \"should be\" rather than vainly seeking to determine what it \"is\" under the decisions of the court. i believe that is an apnropriate charge to the congress and that it sets the proper context for this debate. i would note that professor scalia was the immediate predecessor at the department of justice of mr. john m. harmon. on whose memorandum to the attorney general the opponents of tuition tax credits have relied so heavily. i thinl it is of more than passing significance that two successive occupants of the subcabinet position with primary responsibility for constitutional opinions within the executive branch should have come to opposite conclusions. that would. at the very least. seem to call for the attention of the supreme court. it is apparent by now that the principal controversy surrounding our proposal relates to its elementary and secondary school provisions. but it is essential to recall that threequarters of the benefit from the bill before the senate would accrue to college and university students and their families. tuition tax credits at the postsecondary level are by now a familiar concept in this chamber. time and again. we have overwhelmingly endorsed that concept. only to meet with a chilly response from the other body. this time. the situation is entirely different. the house has given tuition tax credits a powerful vote of support. and the time would seem to be at hand to complete action. by now the case for federal aid to middle income college students has been exhaustively made. i will rely on a single pair of statistics: between 1967 and 1976. college tuitions rose more than 93 percent. while the median aftertax income of families with college age children rose 66.8 percent. once the problem has been recognized. the issue is what solution to select. and at the postsecondary level. we have in fact been presented with various alternatives: an expansion of needbased grant aid to include some middleincome students. a massive federally sponsored tuition advance or loan program. possibly one repaid through the income tax system. or tax credits for college tuitions. in favoring tax credits. i do not reject the other ideas. i shall continue to support the basic grants program and favor its expansion. although 10 years old. the tuition advance idea bears renewed scrutiny when the 96th congress reexamines the higher education act. but that is no reason to delay another day in adopting the tax credit proposal. which would provide a modest amount of urgently needed aid to practically every postsecondary student in the land. and would do so in a manner that does not conflict or overlap at all with existing programs. in fact. we have tailored our proposal to insure that every dollar of basic grant or supplementary grant aid a student receives is actually subtracted from the tax credit for which he or she would otherwise be eligible. for some students. this will permit a choice between two forms of assistance. for some. particularly those with very low incomes. the grant programs will be more useful. but for millions ineligible for grant aid the tax credit will be available. tax credits are a particularly appealing form of financial assistance. for they do not require an individual to come as an applicant to the federal bureaucracy asking to be declared suitably needy. all that tax credits do is allow individuals and families to retain a bit more of their own income during that period of their lives when they are singularly oppressed by college costs. no complex procedures are involved and no new forms. it is simple. it is direct. it is reasonable. and it maintains an exemplary relationship between the citizen and his government. it has been charged that students and families will not retain the benefit of these tax credits. the theory apparently being that colleges and universities will boost their tuition charges so as to \"capture\" the additional resources. apart from the fact that practically every campus in the land is forced to raise its tuition almost every year simply in order to keep its books balanced in an inflationary erathis without tax credits or other middleincome student aidthis allegation betrays scant understanding of the market economics of higher education. with the 18yearold population shrinking by 25 percent between 1979 and 1992. all but the most selective colleges are already finding it necessary to work to attract enough students to remain in operation. institutions that seek to exploit tuition tax credits by boosting their tuitions will find it that much more difficult to locate enough students willing to pay those tuitions. whereas colleges shrewd enough to hold down the \"net price\" they charge their customers will improve their competitive position. i have confidence in the workings of this competitive marketplace as the surest possible safeguard against widespread \"passing through\" of tax credits to the institution. but there is a further safeguard built into our proposal: the fact that the credits are calculated at a 50percent rate means that the student must still pay half of any tuition increases out of his own pocket. this will sharply inhibit enrollmentconscious administrators and trustees from untold increases in their tuition and fees. in conclusion. let me say that our proposition has been fully heard and exhaustively examined. in response to the major practical objections that were brought to our attention. the finance committee has modified its original proposal: sharply cutting the cost and making a number of important changes and improvements. the bill now before us. which the committee reported by a vote of 15 to 1. is one that deserves the support of every member of the senate. the first remarks i made today were addressed in gratitude for and appreciation of the opening statement of the senator from connecticut . who began. for our party. that i)eriod of federal provision for elementary. primary. and secondary schools. in his statement. he had occasion to review the succession. a noble one. of enactments by the congress providing for the public schoolsprimary. secondary. coll ege and university. over and over again. as this issue has developed. we. and our party. have stated our purpose and conviction: public schools come first. it is urecisely our sense that provision has been made that enables us now to turn to the nonpublic schools. let us be clear that this matter began in a joint collaboration between the administration of president eisenhower and the congress. i think it has to be said that if we want to ascribe responsibility for the present era of federal support for education. we have no historical choice but to acknowledge the indispensable role of the soviet union and the engineers who produced sputnik. that led to the ndea. the elementary and secondary education act was a response to what we judged to be responsibilities imposed upon us by our sense of what ought to be done rather than what had to be done. mr. president. i interject there to say it will sometimes appear awkward for us in finding words. alternatives to the terms \"public\" and \"private.\" it being inevitable in this age that some presumption attaches to the word \"private.\" that if something is private it ought not have public support. the schools of which we speak are not private. they are as public as any school. but simply have not had public moneys available to them. they preceded the existing public schools as the source of education for the public. the public schools in my part of the nation began. roughly. in the 1820s and consolidated in the 1840s. in the south. there was no public education prior to the 1870s. there are states so recent in their founding. such as oregon. that mchools are perhaps not even that old. in every case. the nongovernment schools were coequal with or preceded. in most cases the public schools. we now see. at this moment. perhaps the most conspicuous instance of the general phenomena about which schumpeter wrote at the end of the second world war when he explained how the society which the west has created in the course of three centuries would come to an end. he said that the end of liberal society would come with the steady conquest of the private sector by the public sector. there would be no place where this conquest would be more significant in its longrange impact. as well as in its immediate context. as in the disappearance of nongovernment education. or private education. in the context of tax advantage. on the one hand. and cost burdens. on the other. that made it possible to sustain. that is what the senior senator from connecticut spoke about this morning. he said that when he began as secretary of health. education. and welfare. 15 percent of the primary and secondary school students in the united states were in nonpublic schools. and today 9 percent are. we know that the roman catholic church has been prominent in this sequence. it is no historical mystery. at a time in the 1830s. basically. when it commenced to be agreed that large sums of public moneys would be made available for education. a portion of the churchrelated school systems transferred themselves into the public school system. and they did it in a most open way. because of the practices of a general protestant sensibility. the choice of bible. things like that in the public school systems would conform to protestant practice and. therefore. were acceptable to it. it was the judgment of the catholics that in that case they would not join and. therefore. at that point. one sector of the churchrelated school system remained private and the other became public. this persisted in a remarkably stable pattern for a century and a half. only in the last several decades has the churchrelated system commenced to lose its viability in economic terms. the roman catholic schools lost 39 percent of their students between 1965 and 1975.","mr. speaker. some misconceptions appear to exist about the purposes and effect of house resolution 420. it will be useful to clear them up immediately. house resolution 420 continues the work of an existing committeewith the same functions. the same staff. the same location. it does not create a new committee. the joint committee on congressional operations does not duplicate the activities of any other committee or commission. this will also be true of the select committee on congressional operations. no other committee or commission performs the functions or provides the services which we do. operation of the placement office and the tracking of court cases of concern to the congress are important functions of our committee. but they are in no way our only functionsfar from it as i shall demonstrate. the joint committee has cooperated extensively with the commission on administrative review. we have not duplicated their activities. nor have they duplicated ours. there is no indication that the commissionwhich is an ad hoc body and will cease to function at the end of this sessionwill recommend the transfer of any of the joint committees or the proposed select committees functions. as a select committee. the functions of the joint committee will continue unchanged and undiminished. those functions have proved their worth as the continuing demand of members for our services and publications and assistance will indicate. our staff is experienced. staff salaries are based on the same provisions that govern salaries in every other committee. the joint committee. and the select committee we propose to take its place. does indeed have a missiona mission that is important to every member and committee of the house. the need for the resolutionwhich would simply reconstitute. in effect. the joint committee on congressional operations as the house select committe on congressional operationsarises directly from the action of the senate. that body. in approving senate resolution 4 to restructure its committee system. voted to eliminate a number of standing. select and joint committees. including the joint committee on congressional operations. so as to reduce the number of senators committee assignments. senate members have informed us they will begin phasing out the joint committee immediately. in light of this situation. we believe that adoption of house resolution 420 represents the wisest and most appropriate action for the house to take. we have reached this decision after consultations with the speaker of the house. the chairman and ranking minority member of the legislative appropriations subcommittee. the chairmen of the committee on house administration and the committee on rules. and many individual members of the house on both sides of the aisle who believe the work of our committee should be continued without interruption. that is precisely what house resolution 420 is designed to accomplish: continue the work of the joint committee without interruptionnothing more. nothing less. we believe a house select committee is the appropriate vehicle for this purpose for several reasons: first. more than 80 percent of the clients of the joint committeethe members and committees of the house and senateare in the house of representatives. second. the offices of the joint committee are physically located within the house. so no disruption or delay would be involved. third. substantially more than 80 percent of the members and committees who regularly call on the joint committee and its staff for assistance are also in the house. fourth. the same high proportion of users of the joint committees products. services. and publications is accounted for by the members. committees. and staffs of the house. as a practical matter. therefore. the joint committee has always been primarily a houseoriented committee. and house resolution 420 would provide formal recognition of that fact. let me emphasize. mr. speaker. that under house resolution 420. the proposed select committee on congressional operations would function. within the house. exactly as the joint committee has functioned within the congress. we are asking for no new authority. we are seeking no new jurisdiction. we are requesting no additional staff. let me describe. briefly. what it is that we do. the joint committee derives its authority and jurisdiction from two sources: the legislative reorganization act of 1970 and the committee reform amendments of 1974. in drafting the provisions of house resolution 420 regarding the purposes and functions of the select committee. we followed very explicitly the language of these statutes. except for slight stylistic changesto account for the change from a joint committee to a select committeethe wording is the same. under the legislative reorganization act of 1970and under house resolution 420we are required to. and i summarize: . first. study and recommend improvements in the organization and operation * of the congress so as to strengthen the institution internally and improve its relationships with other branches of the government. second. identify. and call to the attention of the house. court proceedings and actions of interest to the congress. third. supervise and control the office of placement and office management. under the committee reform amendments of 1974and under house resolution 420we are required to. and again i summarize: fourth. study and make recommendations dealing with the workloads and jurisdictions of house committees. you will note. mr. speaker. that except for the operating authority we have in connection with the office of placement and office management. we do not have nownor are we seeking in house resolution 372any legislative jurisdiction. our authority is. and would continue to be. limited solely to conducting studies and making recommendations. but this authority is important. to the house and to the congress as a whole. as a result of the extensive studies during the mid1960s of the joint committee on the organization of the congress. the congress concluded that rapid technological and social change affected this institution as well as every other institution in the land. it recognized that congress needed an institutional committee. one that would devote its full attention to the job of helping congress work effectively. our joint committee is. and the proposed select committee would continue to be. the permanent successor to that farsighted body and the only committee in either house specifically assigned this essential responsibility. in exercising this responsibility. we have maintained a low profile. our objectives have been practical ones: to improve the operations of the congress by providing useful services and by meeting identifiable needs. we have not intruded on other committees jurisdictions. we have deliberately avoided unnecessary and unproductive controversy. we have purposely resisted pieinthesky proposals. on the contrary. we have dedicated all our activities to help members. committees. and their staffs do a better job. many of you are personally familiar with some of our achievements. for example: members have made good use of the breakthroughs we have brought about in the application of computer tchnology to the information needs of the house. including the member information network of terminals we established last yeara project we later transferred to the house information systems. you and your staffs regularly use our congressional handbook. which we revise and update four times a year. the only source of its kindfirst in our 200 year history. our placement office has assisted many of your jobseeking constituents from among the nearly 10.000 applicants we interview and test each yearan average of approximately 20 constituents from each of your districts. the placement office helps you find qualified employeesand has placed an average of three employees in every members office. our information inventories have brought together in one place. for the first time. thousands of sources and services available to the house from the legislative branch. the executive branch and private organizations on virtually every subject of concern to the congress. all carefully organized and extensively indexed. our publication. staff. provides the first marketplace. in effect. of professionally useful information and ideas for the staffs of congress. more and more members and committee offices are working more efficiently because of the management assistance we provide. we developed and installed the summary of proceedings and debate system. designed to keep members offices in touch. on a continuing basis. with what transpires on the house floora project which we have turned over to the doorkeeper of the house. improvements in the services you request from the legislative counsel. the congressional research service. the congressional budget office. and the office of technology assessment have resulted in part from the studies and recommendations we have madeand a similar indepth study is now being made of the general accounting officeeach of which was conducted at the request of the committee on appropriations in an effort to eliminate duplication and keep costs under control as well as to improve service. our travel service office has experienced increasing demand from members and committees in making arrangements for official travel. our legal staff tracks all court casesand there are an increasing numberof concern to the congress. and we publish detailed reports on such cases three times each year and provide individual assistance in understanding the consequences and significance of such legal proceedings. there are more such projects to report. more such services to describe. more such publications to which to referbut i do not want to take too much time. our activities reports for the past three congresses. since the joint committee was established in 1971. have been printed in the record. some of the projects i have mentioned are still in their infancy. others are well established and functioning effectively. a great deal more needs to be done. our members are interested and active participants in the work of the committee. our staff is capable and broadly experienced in every aspect of congressional operations. we believe. as i have emphasized. in the importance of cooperation and coordination in pursuing the work of the house and in relating to members and committees which share our interests. we do not now and we shall not in the future intrude in the jurisdictions of -other committees or commissions. or duplicate their activities. the joint committee represents a valuable asset to the house. to the best of our ability. that asset will increase in value to every member and employee in its reconstituted form as the select committee on congressional operationswith your understanding and support.","mr. chairman. i rise to speak in support of the bill. which is the product of a great deal of careful and deliberate consideration by the committee on agriculture. i salute the gentleman from virginia . the author of the bill. who worked long and hard in negotiating with the executive branch and in reducing the results of these negotiations to legislative language. mr. chairman. this is an important bill that will strengthen and coordinate americas agricultural research activity to insure that our agricultural industry remains strong and viable. such research will not only increase the nations food. fiber. and forestry production and improve the nutritional value of our food. but will also guarantee that all aspects of u.s. agricultural research remain strong. mr. chairman. i would like to make the record clear that the committee made every effort to insure that the term \"agricultural research\" in the act was defined in its broadest aspects to cover every activity connected with agriculture. if anything. it is the intent of the committee that the term be even more broadly construed than it is in the present act. i feel the need to clarify this point. because of the apparent concern of millions of horsemen across the country who fear that some may argue later that it is the intent of the act to curtail existing or future equine research. as all members of this body know. following world war ii horses began a resurgence in popularity that has yet to subside and indeed becomes stronger each year. although we have no firm figures regarding the number of horses in the united states since no national census has ever been conducted. we anticipate that the horse population will exceed 10 million head by 1980. notwithstanding the renewed interest and popularity of the horse. there has not been a sufficient concomitant response by public research agencies to adequately service this important segment of american life. our knowledge of equine diseases has not kept pace with the expanding horse industry. additional research is essential if we are to cope with the problems this expansion has brought. the need for equine research is clear. hearings on the animal health research act which was vetoed by the president on inflationary grounds offer a library of evidence in this regard. in 1973. the horse industry advisory committeehiac--of the usda listed various priority categories for equine research. listed in the top priority category were venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis. equine infectious anemia. equine piroplasmosis. african horse sickness. and equine respiratory disease. in its 1974 report. hiac added a second priority involving biological management which included waste disposal. housing design and physical environment. feeding systems. feed processing. nutrition and reproduction. the importance of research into these areas cannot be overstated by the american horseman. all of these areas of concern are within the definition of \"agricultural research\" in the present statute and are included within the areas of research in the present bill. that the usda recognizes the importance of equine research is clear from its reinstitution of research into certain diseases affecting horses. during 1976. the department is expected to expend about $1.5 million for equine research into venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis. equine infectious anemia. piroplasmosis. internal and external parasites. and african horse sickness. this research. however. is presently insufficient. moreover. the department is doing no research on the husbandry aspects of horse production and use. the department recognizes the importance of equine research and the dangers equine afflictions involve. its research. however limited. demonstrates this. the recently adopted regulations requiring a negative coggins test before a horse may be imported is also evidence of this concern. the mobility of horses. both within this country and internationally. makes the threat of epidemic even more hazardous. nonetheless. the usda needs more funds. equally important. the usda needs a reaffirmation from congress of the importance and necessity of equine research. this legislation demonstrates congressional approval of horserelated research. the importance of equines to the american economy cannot be overstated. combined investment and annual expenditures of the horse industry amount to more than $13 billion. with horse owners spending nearly $7 billion annually on feed. equipment. drugs. services. and related items. total federal. state. and local revenues from racing and related industries approach $1 billion annually. over 320.000 boys and girls are engaged in 4h horse projects. more than the number in cattle and swine projects combined. mr. chairman. the american horse industry grows stronger every day bringing with it not only jobs. employment. and new sources of funds for our people. but also a great deal of personal pleasure and recreation. it is important that research into equines be continued and expanded. since this bill provides for continued and coordinated research into all areas of agriculture. including equine research. i ask that all members support it. mr. chairman. i would like to engage the gentleman in a colloquy for the purpose of establishing the record.","mr. president. during the closing days of the 92d congress. we enacted the consumer product safety act. this act. which established the consumer product safety commission. gave the federal government a major role in assuring the health and safety of the american public. the national commission on product safety had shown that each year. 20 million americans are injured by hazards relating to consumer products. the commission has now been in business for almost 20 months. on february 21. 26. and 27. our committee will conduct major oversight hearings into the implementation of the act. in addition. it will be necessary at that time to amend the act to authorize additional appropriations. in my opinion. it is too early to make any major modifications to the act. since most new agencies require a shakedown period of at least a year. the commission is just now beginning to exercise the full scope of its powers under the act. however. there are several minor amendments which are needed to refine several provisions of the act. i proposed today those amendments. on april 3 and 11. 1974. the committees on commerce and government operations held joint hearings to investigate a controversy between the consumer product safety commission and the civil service commission. the controversy arose in late 1973 when four members of the consumer product safety commission wrote to chairman hampton of the civil service commission urging expeditious approval of its noncareer executive assignmentneapersonnel. citing the provisions of 5 cfr 305.601 (b). chairman hampton concluded that an nea position is to be filled by one who advocates administrative policies and thus. white house clearance of such nominees is required. i believe that the application of these regulations to the consumer product safety commission. and in fact. to any independent regulatory agencies. is both unwise and inappropriate. independent agencies are structured as such because of the sensitive rulemaking and adjudicatory roles they play. the enabling legislation of the consumer product safety commission is designed to allow this decisionmaking process to proceed in an atmosphere free of outside influence. this controversy has yet to be resolved to my satisfaction. accordingly. i am proposing an amendment to the act which would prohibit the office of the president. the office of management and budget. or any other executive office or agency to approve. other than for professional qualifications. appointmonts to the commission staff. under the consumer product safety act. a manufacturer of a consumer product or a distributor and retailer of such product. who discovers that a product fails to comply with applicable consumer product safety standards or contains a defect which could create a substantial product hazard. must immediately inform the commission of its discovery. there was an unintentional gap in the act. however. with respect to products liability underwriters and independent test laboratories. because of the nature of their business. such underwriters or laboratories may have occasion themselves to discover failure to comply or a substantial product hazard. since the purpose of the act is to detect and remedy such defects in the marketplace. it is appropriate that when such an underwriter or laboratory obtains such information. the commission should be so informed. i have proposed an amendment which would effectuate this policy. upon discovery of a failure to comply or substantial product hazard. the underwriter or independent test laboratory would be required to notify the manufacturer of such product. if the product is one which is distributed in commerce. then the manufacturer himself must comply with the requirement of the act. if the manufacturer has not complied. then it becomes the obligation of the underwriter or independent test laboratory to inform the commission of the substantial product hazard. i believe that this amendment will assure prompt remedial attention to what may be very serious defects in consumer products. if the consumer product safety act is to have teeth. it is necessary that it be enforced uniformly and fairly throughout the nation. it is for this reason that i have proposed to clarify the act to allow the consumer product safety commission itself to go directly into court to initiate or defend a civil and criminal action which may arise under the laws administered by it. that is. consumer product safety act. the federal hazardous substances act. the flammable fabrics act. the poison prevention packaging act. and the refrigerator safety act. under the current system. the determination of whether to initiate a suit and upon what ground the suit will be argued is determined by local desires. views. or prejudices of the many different u.s. attorneys throughout the united states. that discretion under my amendment would be with the consumer product safety commission because it is the responsibility of this commission to administer the laws entrusted to it. therefore the decision of which cases to initiate or how cases would be defended would also rest with that agency. to provide otherwise would allow the commission to escape the responsibility for its regulatory acts by virtue of the actions of another federal agency or some subdivision thereof. mr. president. i assure you that the committee on commerce will consider each of these amerdments thoroughly during its oversight hearings this month. mr. president. i ask unanimous consent that the \"consumer product safety commission improvements act of 1975\" be reprinted in the record in full at the conclusion of my remarks.","mr. chairman. it has been the foreign policy of this great nation to help others in need. none can deny that we have marched side by side on the battlefields with our allies. our brothers and sisters have died for the cause of peace. we have labored side by side with the citizens of the worlds undeveloped nations in strengthening their economies. and. we have taxed our citizens to help those countries torn by war and those whose development needs outstripped their available financial and technical resources. now. hostilities have ceased throughout most of our world. wartorn lands have been rebuilt. many nations have made great strides toward development. today we find our nation in a state of financial need. not for loans from foreign friends. but for the repayment of just debts. u.s. assistance helped heal the wartorn land of iran. we have recently witnessed the offer of the shah to invest more than $200 million to bail out lockheed from its financial bind. this offer is. in effect. made with money generated by an iranian economy rebuilt partially with american foreign aid. iran now owes the united states more than $1 billion and is delinquent in its repayments more than $39.3 million. my amendment is written in such a way that it applies only to countries which are benefiting under the foreign assistance act of 1961 in order to avoid a \"point of order.\" nevertheless. its adoption should be an indisputably cipar indication to the president and to the countries with past due debts owed to the people of this nation that those debts are to be paid now and that future payments are to be made on time. after 4 years of hearings by my subcommittee on foreign operations it is my considered opinion that the state department lacks the determination to represent the best interests of american taxpayers in the collection of foreign debts. if all the foreign debts now delinquent were paid at this time it would balance the budget and have a dramatic effect on the sliding value of the dollars. a document titled \"delinquent international debts owed to the united states. mid1974 progress review\" prepared in june by my subcommittee shows that as of decmber 31. 1973. 161 foreign nations and 11 foreign organizations owed the american people $33.819.176.000. one hundred and eight of these countries and five of the institutions were at least 90 days overdue in their repayments. excluding $20 billion in world war i debts. at that time. the past due payments totalled $753.245.151. our sense of responsibility to humanity must be no less than in the past. but it must be tempered strongly by a sense of duty to help take the siphon of an inflated economy out of the pocketbooks of our citizens through an injection of foreign dollars provided us in repayment of just and due debts. passage of this amendment will help make it clear that as the united states intends to keep its commitments to other nations it intends that they keep their commitments to the people of the united states. and. it will help relieve the inflationary pressures now stifling our citizens.","mr. president. 2.500 years ago the children of israel were taken into the babylonian captivity. they lived and flourished in that land. now known as iraq. and as recently as 1948 more than 150.000 dwelled there. living in relative security and enjoying the fruits of their labors in the land which they had inhabited generation after generation for 25 centuries. now. 21/2 millenia later. only a handful of a few hundred remain. insecure. limited in their ability to work and to move about. harassed. and living under the threat of arrest and worse. recently reports were published indicating that 10 prominent members of the iraqi jewish community had been executed in recent weeks in the nihaya castle prison in baghdad. these unfortunates had been arrested in september and december of last year. had been held incommunicado. and up until the publication of their execution by newspapers abroad. neither their families. their friends. their fellow iraqi of all faiths. nor concerned citizens abroad had any information as to their fate. even today the iraqi government has failed to reply to an inquiring world as to their fate. there is a fear that there may be a repetition of the dark period of 4 years ago. when in january of 1969. 14 persons. including nine jews. were accused of spying. executed in a public square before a large crowd. and their corpses hung there as a relic of some ancient barbarism. truly. if the iraqi government has any serious concern about a threat from its minute jewish minorityless than one onehundredth of 1 percent of iraqs populationthen the quickest and easiest thing to do would be to let them emigrate. rather than continue to subject them to harassment. danger. and death. logic and humanity both commend this conclusion.","you would have no argument about wages. then. representative brown. -and if we have shortages. would you favor rationing?","mr. president. in a rapidly changing world. continued commercial discrimination against countries with different economic systems than our own is an anachronism. as the cold war in europe is being relegated to the pages of history. a new generation of leaders is concerned more with ecopolitical rather than geopolitical issues. it is time for our own country to cast aside its selfimposed shackles on trade. and look toward the future with regard to our economic relations with the countries of the east. while the united states has created a number of restrictive devices in order to circumscribe its economic relations with communist nations. our nato allies have displayed much less restraint. total free world trade with the u.s.s.r. and eastern europe amounted to about $18 billion in 1970. of this total. the u.s. share. imports and exports. was only $579 million. this amounted to 3 percent of total western trade with the east. and less than 1 percent of our own total foreign trade. on this small volume of trade we enjoyed a two to one ratio of exports to imports producing a $127 million surplus. viewed in the light of our nations high unemployment rate and projected balanceoftrade deficit for this year. these figures underscore the immediate and significant benefits that would accrue to the united states from expanded trade with the east. it has been estimated that if unnecessary restrictions are removed. u.s. trade with eastern europe could reach $2 billion by 1975 or more than three times the 1970 level. other estimates are even more optimistic running to $5 billion. or 10 times the 1970 level. the rapid growth in recent years of u.s. trade with eastern countries gives weight to these projections. between 1966 and 1970 u.s. exports to eastern europe rose from $198 million to $353 million. during this same period. u.s. imports increased from $179 million to only $226 million. in 1971 it is expected that u.s. exports will reach $460 million and imports. $240 million. for a total of $700 million. eastern europe. the soviet union and mainland china all have great unsatisfied needs for the high technology equipment and products that our country excels in producing. other potential markets for the same kind of american exports to africa. asia. and south america are many years away from being able to absorb a high level of technology. the countries of eastern europe have already reached a point of departure from their dependence on the soviet union. the last comecon conference held in bucharest reflected their desire for more trade and investment ties with the west and an unwillingness to operate their economies -as part of a soviet master plan. by now the countries of eastern europe know quite well what the soviet union offers. but increasingly they want more of what the west and the united states offers. the easts participation in world commerce has grown at the impressive rate of 81/2 percent per year. for thesmaller communist countries a major impetus to further integration into the world economy can only come from a sizable increase in markets in the united states. present law does not permit the granting of mostfavorednation tariff treatment to communist countries except yugoslavia and poland. as a result. imports from those countries pay the full 1930 statutory duty rates rather than the lower rates that have resulted from successive tariff reduction negotiations. the denial of mfn tariff treatment to these countries has significance beyond its immediate inhibiting commercial effects. this discrimination poses an important psychological barrier against the expansion of trade and the normalization of commercial relations. the case of poland provides a most vivid example of how trade can be expanded if mostfavorednation treatment is granted. in 1962. without it. poland exported $46 million of goods to the united states. in 1970. with it. this figure was $98 million. last june. following the oecd ministerial meeting in paris. i traveled to eastern europe on behalf of the finance committee. in both hungary and rumania. i was deeply impressed by the visible economic progress that had been made. equally evident were both nations desires for increased commercial ties with the united states. and genuine admiration for american technological achievements and capabilities. i was dismayed. however. by the relative lack of american participation in the trade and investment opportunities in eastern europe. in hotels and airports there. i saw french. german. italian. and british businessmen with bulging briefcasesbut hardly any americans. twoway trade between the united states and rumania has grown very significantly during the last 3 years with the total trade turnover now totaling some. $80 million. but the picture is clouded. rumanian officials emphasized to me that the lack of mostfavorednation treatment did not permit rumania to begin redressing the serious imbalance of trade between the two countries. the ratio is roughly 5 to 1 against rumania at present. since trade is a twoway street. we cannot hope to continue to export more to rumania without buying more. based on my own discussions. there is no doubt in my mind that rumania wants much more collaboration with american firms in developing a variety of industries. and also wants to purchase more goods here. this is illustrated by the boeing co.s opportunity to sell from two to four 707 aircraft to the rumanian carrier. tarom. rumania is apparently willing to risk soviet displeasure by buying american. rather than soviet. longrange commercial jet aircraft. but r.tumanias main problem is insufficient dollar credits to pay for the aircraft because of their negative balance of trade with the united states. one of the main reasons for this negative balance is the handicap of excessive import duties imposed upon rumanian products entering the united states because of their exclusion from the mostfavorednation treatment. assuming a successful sale of two of these aircraft to rumania. amounting to roughly $26 million. the boeing people feel this should lead to followon orders from tarom amounting to four to five times the initial order. this could also trigger a domino effect with other east european nations buying the same planes in order to be competitive. because rumania enjoys excellent relations with mainland china. boeing believes a successful business venture in rumania could provide an avenue for entrance into mainland china. for airplane sales. the market potential here is estimated by boeing at 40 to 50 airplanes in this decade. in hungary. the trade picture with the united states is much the same as in rumania. but on a smaller scale. the hungarians also want to do more business with us. but they stress that lack of mfn treatment poses a formidable barrier to trade expansion. it is important to note that there is considerable trade conducted between u.s. subsidiaries and affiliates in western europe and eastern customers. the value of this indirect trade in american goods probably amounts to several times that of direct u.s. exports. and while these transactions ultimately benefit the earnings of the parent firm. they do not provide jobs for american workers in american plants. mr. president. the legislation being introduced today would not automatically grant mfn treatment to all countries with nonmarket economies nor to all of their products. it would not open up any floodgates of imports. nor would it erase the 2 to 1 favorable trade balance we now enjoy. it is left up to the president to decide which countries and which products would be given mfn treatment. based on the overall national interest. this legislation is particularly timely and useful in that it would give the president the actual authority to conclude a commercial agreement should he so desire. when he visits the peoples republic of china in the near future. this bill is so drafted that formal diplomatic relations between the two countries need not precede such an agreement. the longer normalization of commerce with the east is put off. the more difficult it will be for american firms to alter the trade patterns which the eastern coluntries are already establishing with great britain. france. west germany. italy. and japan. if the administration continues its present policy of tying any relaxation of our trade restrictions against eastern countries to specific political payoffs. we will be putting the cart before the horse. by forging stronger economic -ties with eastern european countries. we will be kesening both their economic end political dependence on the soviet union. and producing a diplomatic climate in which political problems are more easily solved. through the broadening of our economic relations. we will be strengthening our own economy by selling more of the things we can produce better than other countries. we will also be creating a climate in which friction between east and west can be lessened. new commercial -ties will open up new valuable channels of communication between ourselves and communist nations on a nonconfrontation level. if peaceful coexistence on -this planet between countries with different ideologies and economic systems is the only rational course to pursue. the most rational policy for the united states to follow would be to invite all nations into a world system in which the mutual benefits from trade and commerce can be shared by all. mr. president. we are making an important start in this direction by the introduction of this bill today. i hope that my colleagues will examine the proposed legislation carefully to see what it seeks to accomplish. what it will mean for our factories and workers. :and what it can ultimately do to make our world a more prosperous. and a more peaceful place. by mr. hartke:","mr. speaker. i am convinced the legislative route is the only method by which a meaningful agreement can be reached between the united states and japan on the necessity for placing limitations on textile imports. the morning newspaper reports that the japanese prime minister has sent to president nixon an appeal for a voluntary agreement on textile imports to head off quotas that would be set by a bill sponsored by chairman mills of the ways and means committee and by 252 other members of the iouse. passage of the mills bill will insure a reasonable solution to this critical problem which affects the jobs of many thousands of textile workers in south carolina and elsewhere. the dismissal last week of assistant secretary of commerce kenneth n. davis. jr.. an allout supporter of the mills bill. is alarming and the requested delay of a scheduled appearance by secretary stans before the committee on the bill is also alarming. i fear that perhaps the opponents of the legislation within the administration are gaining support even though the president himself has promised the industry relief from an admittedly unfair competitive situation. mr. speaker. i congratulate the distinguished chairman of the ways and means committee and the other 250plus members who have sponsored this much needed legislation for the relief of the harassed textile and shoe industries. i urge chairman mills to go forward with dispatch toward the enactment of his bill into law. the thrust of the mills bill lies in its encouragement to a solution by negotiation and only if negotiation that falls does it provide for mandatory imposition of quotas.","mr. speaker. president nixons decision to go ahead with the .development of the supersonic transport program is a sound decision for many reasons. let me list just a few: given the balanceofpayments situation. the president had no other choice. failure of the americans to build an sst would have been american dollars going abroad to purchase foreign aircraft and would have ended american dominance of the world air transport industry. with the russian tupelov transport now flying at supersonic speeds and announcement by aeroflot officials that they intend to fly this aircraft in moscow in 1973. failure to build an american sst would inevitably result in the destruction of a vital american industry. this is the only advanced aeronautical program now ongoing in the united states. the technology developed from this program will result in improvements of electronic navigation. communications. materials machining and sophisticated production techniques. the sst program will provide direct employment for a minimum of 50.000 skilled and unskilled workers. this necessarily translates into multiplierinduced employment impacts measured in the several hundreds of thousands. many of whom will work from generally disadvantaged groups. the economics of a nearly mach iii aircraft in terms of personal time saved alone is virtually immeasurable when contrasted with mach ii and subsonic aircraft. this program. practically unique among major federallysponsored developments. provides for virtually full recovery of its investment by the government. failure to proceed at this point would cause the leadership to pass from american hands to those of our foreign competitors. we would lose momentum which would never be recovered. mr. speaker. i support wholeheartedly the presidents decision. i would hope that the vast majority of the members of congressin both partieswill do likewise.","mr. president. i call attention to an editorial in the february 1 issue of the united mine workers journal. this editorial calls attention to the fact that mr. w. a. \"tony\" boyle celebrated his fifth anniversary on january 19 as president of the united mine workers of america. i call attention to the fact that mr. boyle is the l1th american coal miner to hold the chief executives office of this great labor union. it is a union which speaks for coal miners in more than 25 states of the united states and several provinces of the dominion of canada. mr. boyle has had a very interesting career. his irish father began work in the coal mines of scotland at the age of 9. and his grandfather and greatgrandfather worked in the coal mines of the united kingdom. mr. boyle has performed a great service during these 5 years for the united mine workers of america. as an organization. and also for the miners who make up the union. for example. he has been very active in the promotion of coal mine safety. this is a subject of intense personal interest to him. one of the great legislative victories of his career was the enactment by the last congress of an amendment to the federal coal mine safety act which brought mines employing 14 or fewer men underground under the enforcement provisions of the safety act. during the presidency of mr. boyle there have been many notable improvements in coal mine safety throughout the united states. i call attention to the fact that last year. when the coal mines of the united states were producing 549 million tons of soft coal. 217 miners were killed. this was the lowest death toll in the statistical history of mine fatalities. the death rate per million man hours of exposure. to wit. 0.91. was the lowest since 1953. at which time the previous low was set. mr. boyle should be commended for his leadership in the field of coal mine safety. and he also should be commended for the many other accomplishments which have been brought about through his leadership. such as improvements in wage contracts with the american coal industry. i shall not enumerate the many improvements which have resulted from the leadership and dedicated work of this great united mine workers chieftain. but i shall merely ask. in a moment. that those be enumerated in the record. i only wish at this point to add my congratulations to the united mine workers president and to say that american coal miners can be proud of a president who works night and day for the miners. who elected him to this important post. and for their families. i ask unanimous consent that the editorial. entitled \"january 19 was president boyles fifth anniversary as head of umwa\" be inserted in the record at this point.","i shall yield in a moment but first i wish to answer the senator from delaware. i had yielded to the senator from delaware for a question but he did not answer my question so i wish to answer his statement with a part of his amendment. at the top of page 2 with respect to what is unlawful the following language appears on line 13: (2) for purposes of applying paragraph (1). the source of the funds from which a contribution or expenditure is made shall be immaterial. and such paragraph shall apply to a contribution or expenditure made from funds contributed for such purpose by the shareholders of a corporation or the members of a labor organization. that very clearly and specifically deprives the shareholders of a corporation or the members of a labor organization to say. \"i voluntarily want to contribute funds to that union for the union to do such and such with those funds.\" it is as clear as it can be. if that does not deprive a union member or a corporation stockholder of a constitutional right that they have under our constitution. i miss my guess.","mr. president. cuna international. inc.. the public spirited credit unions association. recently published in its magazine. everybodys money. an informative article on the availability of lowcost college loans. i congratulate cuna on its interest in this important question and i believe their article deserves widespread circulation. it should help parents and students to avoid being victimized by unnecessarily high interest costs for college loans. i ask unanimous consent that this article. and the table which accompanies it. be printed in the record.","i have merely one comment to make. the senator from wisconsin has been driven into a great deal of sophistication. and the necessity of speaking many words to exculpate the blame which lies with the proponents of the measure in the arguments that are being made. it requires a sort of algebraic or mathematical mind to understand the refinements that have been advanced. on the one hand. it is said that geographical representation in the senate is good and population representation in the house is good. but it is not good for the state. the effort has been made to explain how this conflicting conclusion was reached. however. the conclusion is too refined and too belabored to be listened to. the same argument applies to the latter discussion that we have had. so far as i am concerned. if we evolve a system of state government in which the people will have an opportunity to be heard. blending the thinking of the city man and the thinking of the rural man. we will have good government. otherwise we shall have a tyrannical form of government.","mr. chairman. first of all i would like to express my appreciation for the kind words that have been spoken. and i hope i am still able to say something about the bill after this wonderful experience. i would like to start off by saying that. of course. i support h.r. 11049 completely. then i would like to say it has been a rare privilege and a great honor for me to have served on this great committee. i especially want to thank the chairman and the ranking minority member for their fair and just treatment at all times. i guess i will have to admit publicly. much as i hate to. that every member of the committee has more intelligence than i have and more ability to understand legislation than i have. yet i think i was able to understand h.r. 11049 after we had considered the previous legislation at great length in days and days and days of hearings and after full explanation. so i feel that every member of this committee. and i think every member of this house. surely must understand what is before us today. a previous speaker has mentioned that this legislation is viitually identical with the previous legislation. and it is. there are. of course. some differences in arithmetic. but they are not too serious and not too hard for us to understand what they are. if we look upon our duty today. i think it is a very simple one. but we have a very heavy responsibility. i believe that we are in the same position as directors of a corporation who have to approve. or disapprove. or alter. the recommendations of the executive. that is what we are doing today. we are passing upon the judgment of the executive department and we are altering it. we are altering it in this legislation. now i would like to go back to the salary reform act of 1962 and point out two major accomplishments which were made in that legislation. first of all. we raised. in two steps. up to the 1961 comparability the pay and salaries of classified and postal workers. it did not reach 1962 comparability. also it gave us the mechanics and specified by law as to what we are to do in the future to implement this legislation. now that public law 87793 is on the books it is our obligation to live up to the obligation that we assumed and vote according to the mandate given to us by that law. i would like to point this out also: federal employees are not allowed to strike against the federal government. therefore. they must meet us at the bargaining table. this house of representatives is the bargaining table at which labor and management are meeting today. we have to be fair in this situation. we have to understand their problems. and i think we must. with good judgment. and recognizing the taxpayers interest. meet their reasonable demands. as reasonable men and women should. title i takes care to some degree the salary problems of 1.7 million very loyal employees. for example. there are 375.000 postal employees who will receive only a minimum of. i think it is. $375 per annum increase. and yet if we look back over the last 15 years we will find that the classified employees have received 4.1percent average increase and the postal workers 4.9percent increase. this bill only calls for a 3percent increase for them. mr. chairman. if you will now look at the other side of the coin you will find that perhaps in the future years we will be giving lesser increases than we have in past years. that is a future probability. titles ii. iii. and iv take care of the legislative. executive. and judicial salary increases. there are only about 1.500 positions with $12 million per annum involved. it is not a very large sum as compared with the total amount in the bill of $533 million. mr. chairman. i would like to take just a moment to call your attention to the randall report which has not been mentioned here today. the report of the advisory panel on federal salary reforms was issued on june 12. 1963. there were 10 very distinguished members of this commission: clarence r. randall. john j. corson. professor at princeton. marion b. folsom. eastman kodak co. and a former cabinet officer. theodore u. houser. former top executive. sears &amp; roebuck. robert r. lovett. brown bros.. harriman. former secretary of the army. george meany. aflcio. don k. price. graduate school of public administration. harvard. robert ramspeck. former member of congress from georgia. stanley f. reed. associate justice. retired. supreme court. sydney stein. jr.. stein. roe &amp; farnham. lawyer. mr. chairman. they came in with these recommendations: that the speaker and the vice president should receive $60.000 a year. that members of congress should receive $35.000. cabinet officers. $50.000. the chief justice. $60.500. and associate justices. $60.000. judges of the u.s. court of appeals. $45.000. and district court judges. $35.000. our legislation does not reach these figures by a good. long shot. mr. chairman. these people had very good research facilities. they did a magnificent job. their report was based on a sound foundation of facts plus excellent judgment by men who have been through various aspects of our economy and know the answers. of course. anyone seeking federal employment recognizes that the element of prestige is important and desirable and the desire for public service is commendable. but we have to recognize that those federal employees in the executive department are not allowed to have other gainful employment. they are limited to their government compensation. i claim that in order to attract. and finally to hold. competent employees. we have to pay salaries commensurate with their responsibilities and salaries comparable to those paid in private enterprise. the figures will showand this is only a partial listthat more than 1.000 governmental employees throughout the country. outside of the federal governmentmayors. governors. superintendents of schools. and so forthreceive more than $25.000 a year. you have heard a lot about the subject of inflation. this is not a problem in this case because inflation only occurs. or can occur. when a disproportionate and a relatively sharp and sudden increase in the quantity of money or credit. or both. relative to goods available for purchase. occurs. there is no sudden or disproportionate increase here because this amount is budgeted and the government. of course. will receive back large amounts in taxes. so that it will not all be outgo. we have also heard a lot about unfunded liability. of course. this is a problem. but it is only a real problem if everyone were to retire at once. so far as the deficiency is concerned. and there is a bill now before our committee which would. if enacted. make the fund selfsupporting. funds can be appropriated or the government could make interest payments to take care of this problem. we also hear about the increase in the debt ceiling bill which will be called up next week. mr. chairman. i would like to call the attention of the members of the committee to these facts. the total amount of this bill is in the budget. so. we are not raising the ceiling because of this bill. also. that federal employment has gone down sharply in the last year. if the levels that were forecast in the 1964 budget were held to we would now have 73.000 more employees than we now have. further. i would say this: if you want to keep from raising the debt ceiling. stop appropriating money for new programs. do not take it away from people. because you cannot run a business without good people. this. i believe. is fundamental and elementary. mr. chairman. as far as this legislation is concerned the president of a concern in the private sector of our economy knows that if his competitor is paying certain salaries higher than he is. he has to meet those salaries or go out of business. or obtain inferior help. mr. chairman. i would like to close by saying this-","mr. president. i am distressed. as i am sure many other senators are. that not only is increased spending called for in the presidents proposed budget. but virtually every single department of the government. with only one exception. has proposed an increase in the number of federal employees projected for 1964 over 1963. the one exception. very interestingly to me. is the department of defense. in the department of defense there actually will be fewer employees in 1964 than in 1963. one of the reasons for that is. i believe. one of the finest management jobs we have had in government in a long time. by the outstanding secretary of defense robert s. mcnamara. lt. comdr. robert j. massey. u.s. navy. has written a fine article entitled \"department of defense programing innovations encourage good management.\" which appeared in a recent publication entitled \"navy management review.\" one of the interesting innovations is to recognize that a great weakness in governmental administration is that here is a lack of the kind of incentives which exist in private enterprise to keep costs down. recognizing that. the defense department has worked very hard to provide such incentives. mr. massey in his article sets forth exactly how that has been done. he shows how real competition among the services and among programs is provided. he indicates that there is a real incentive for every policymaking official to keep his costs as low as possible. in view of the fact that secretary mcnamara has not only been successful in keeping costs down and in reducing the number of employees in the department of defense. but also has built the strongest defense establishment in the history of the world. i think a great result has been obtained. i ask unanimous consent that the article be printed at this point in the record.","yes. i will renew my request at the conclusion of my explanation. in his state of the union message last january 11. the president of the united states said: \"i am submitting for fiscal 1963 a balanced federal budget.\" his words were greeted with applause. at the time i remarked that his assurance that he would submit a balanced budget showed that he knew the people were concerned about the purchasing power of their money and inflation. after a seventenths of 1 percent increase in the cost of living index for last year and another seventenths of 1 percent increase in the cost of living index. they are increasingly concerned. in the last year and a half. inflation has shrunk the purchasing power of bonds and savings by $3.5 billion and has worked a hardship on millions of workers living on fixed wages and salaries and more millions of retired people relying on fixed income from pension and social security payments. the value of the dollar has shunk to 46 cents compared to the 100cent dollar in 1939. as set forth on the table appearing on page 53 of the hearings. which i ask unanimous consent to have included in the record at this point in my remarks.","senator. we are almost at the end of your time. senator wilnams. i will say that we have seen these barren lives. we have seen youngsters whose only playground was a battered old car littered with glass. and there they played barefoot. it seems to me that in this country where we have done so much for ourselves. where we have brought health care to all of our poor people. welfare to all of our poor people. we have excluded it from this group of people who are rootless and homeless. who have no state and no residence. we have protected ourselves in so many ways with minimum wages. child labor prohibition. short workweek of 40 hours. all the new deal has been excluded from the lives of our migrant farm families in this country. i think the answer is yes. the time has come when our nation must recognize that these people are entitled to the same protections that all other americans enjoy. mr. smrrh. senator. you will be able to come back to that. can we have the opening statement now from mr. shuman?","we have the housing act. which came from the late senator robert taft. that act embraces goals in housing. as laid down by the congress. there is no reason why the president cannot lay down the goals as the executive branch desires. it has contacts with the labor department. the department of commerce. the council of economic advisers. and the housing and home finance administration. who else is in a better position and more supplied with the facts to lay down a program for housing than the president of the united states? or do we want only the labor movement or the homebuilders or the chamber of commerce or the congress to lay it down? i think. most respectfully. a cooperative arrangement is desirable.","i will take only 2 minutes. my proposal will raise more than $100 million a year. i point out that oil produced in saudi arabia and laid down at the great refineries in new jersey can be produced and laid down there for more than a dollar a barrel cheaper than oil produced in the united states. even without any transportation costs being computed to get the domestic production to the refinery. this is a tariff of 2 cents a gallon. or 84 cents a barrel. it will not hurt any american consumers financially. it will give us a modest tax income on imported oil. even with this tax they can produce foreign oil and lay it down at dockside in the united states much cheaper than domestic oil can be produced. my substitute will do some of the things which the senator from illinois has tried to do with this and other measures. it will raise some needed revenue. it will help our economy. it will not slow up domestic production as a cut in the depletion allowance would slow it up. it will not cost the jobs of workers in the united states. while a cut in the depletion allowance will cause domestic oil workers in the united states to lose jobs.","mr. speaker. under leave to extend my remarks in the appendix of the ricoan. i wish to include the text of an address by mr. reid brazell. president of the leonard refineries. alma. mich.. at the 12th annual testimonial dinner given by the association executives of michigan for michigan members of congress at the hotel statler in washington on april 29. and entitled \"why i like to live in michigan\": needless to say. i appreciate the opportunity and feel honored to have the privilege of speaking to you on this auspicious occasionan occasion when busy folks take time to come here to washington. to talk to. to break bread with. and to honor their representatives in the congress of the united states. when bill palmer called and asked me to talk to this group. my first reaction was. \"what do i have to say that would be of interest to such a meeting?\" i asked bill. \"what do you want me to talk about?\" his reply was. \"why you like michigan.\" that was easy. i like michigan because i believe in michigan. and becaufse i believe in michigan i suggest to you and to the people of michigan that we establish as an objective. as a goal. the job of putting real meaning and truth into the three words. \"michigan means business.\" the achievement of this goal should not be too difficult for the people of michigan if past performance is any indication of what they can and will do if such a challenge is accepted. lets take a look at our state. its history. and more importantly its people. also a look at the present. and look to the future. first. as personal reference. i should like to mention that it was by no accident of birth that michigan is the state in which i make my home. in which i raise my family and in which i earn my daily bread. i was born in dklahoma and lived there and elsewhere for 30 years before adopting michigan. notwithstanding my love for oklahoma. my native state. and my pride in it. i adopted michigan for my home. i chose it for reasons that are reflected in its history. its geography. its climate. and above all. in its people. i chose it because i believed in michigan. its people and its future. that faith of mine has become stronger each of the years that i have lived here. i truly believe in michigan. perhaps from the vantage point of the past we can more clearly perceive why confidence in the future of our michigan is justifiedand come to a better understanding of why we all of us should believe in michigan. consider for a moment: what sort of a state is michigan? what are michigan people like? there is no simple answer to those questions. michigan is unlike any ohter state lying between the two oceans. michigan people and the development of the state reflect circumstances most unlike those that exist elsewhere in this world. senators mcnamaa and potter must find it a great challenge as well as great honor and responsibility to wear the mantle of united states senator for michigan. if we start at monroe in congressman mfanns district and go westward to the western boundaries of congressman howmans district. we find fertile lknds where michigan farmers plow soil as rich as can be found in our whole country. moving northward. we find the busy saginar valley district so ably represented by my own congressman alvn bentlxm. to the east we find the great thumb area represented by congressman mcintosh. moving farther north into the districts represented by congressmen gainrl. cdnsno. and knox. a vast region of generally sparse soil where a few short years ago stood our vast treasures of pine and hardwood. some people thought these treasures inexhaustible. but the trees were felled and by 1890. they were largely gone. in every frontier country there are heedless people who despoil without thought for the future. so it was with michigans forests. but others come to heal the wounds. thus today. happily. there stands in that region row upon row of growing pines and hardwoods which will bless future generations.1 at the upper part of congressman knox district are the straits of mackinac which so long divided michigan. but now spanned by the worlds great new bridge. to unite the people of the upper and lower peninsulas and open new horizons for us. the eastern end of the upper peninsula. also in congressman knoxs district. was another land of hardwood and pines which. once despoiled. is again emerging as a land of bounty. traveling westward toward the wisconsin border. in congressman bxnrtts district. rock ridges emerge from the soil and there are found the iron and copper riches that for so many years sustained large segments of our population. 3 i believe in michigan because of its great natural opportunities. michigan is a state apart. its uniqueness lies in the varieties of its geography. climate and terrain and particularly in the uniqueness of its peoples. its uniqueness is perhaps best exemplified by the fact that michigan is dotted by more than 11.000 inland lakes. is traversed by 20.000 miles of streams and is framed by waters as blue as those of the mediterranean. it has a shoreline of over 3.200 miles. michigan is bounded by 4 of the 5 great lakes. there is lake superior. with its cold and mighty breakers smashing the rocky shores of the upper peninsulalake michigan. beating at the sand dunes to the west. lake huron. gently touching the eastern side of congressman mcintoshs district. and lake erie. lazily lapping the monroe marshes.4 michigans climate is also unique. our state is air conditioned by the waters of the great lakes. the lake waters absorb heat from air warmer than themselves and warm the colder winds. the great lakes regions are frequently a meetin. point for high and low pressure areas. with the result that we have frequent changes of weather. our climate is a seasonal climate. each year we enjoy springs rebirth of nature. summers warmth tempered by the cooling lakes. footnotes at end of speech. a4001 autumns brilliance unexcelled in beauty in any place else in the whole world. and winters quiet snows. our uncommon geography and climate have produced an uncommon people. our people vary as to types and ancestry. and because of what michigan people have done with the land that they found. our state never developed into any common type of state. \"little more than a hundred years ago michigan was wilderness. its chief industry was the fur trade. as late as 1814 history records indian massacres in michigan. it was not until 1842 that the indians ceded the last michigan lands. in the space bf little more than a hundred years this state was created from a wilderness land of trappers and fur traders to its present greatness. into its development went incredible extremes of vision and stupidity and greed and generosity. our state was born of bloodshed and dissensions so often common to frontier lands. it was born of the calamities of indian massacres. pestilences. destructive fires. wars and unprecedented waste and greed and wisdom and folly and cupidity and integrity. truly michigan has had a tempestuous past. the michigan wilderness did not come to the forefathers easily. they fought for it. first they fought the french. then the british and then the british again. and all the while they fought.the indians. when peace came many of these frontiersmen entered upon an orgy of exploitation of the michigan land and the treasures beneath the surface unprecedented in history. it is. however. of some comfort to recall that the pines of michigan housed much of the nation and produced values equal to 3 times the gold that californias earth gave up and 10 times the gold from alaska. many houses built of michigan pine still stand today. and much of the money derived from this socalled rape of the woods found its way into our colleges and our hospitals. it might be well to consider that had these pinelands not been cut away we would not have our great and growing state and national forests that are so important to our beloved michigan outi doors.6 during roughly the same period that michigan trees were producing their fortunes. michigan produced half the copper mined in the united statesmore than 9 billion pounds of itand millions of tons of iron ore. into this land came welshmen. lithuanians. austrians. and finns to fell the trees and tend the mines. joining the earlier migrations of germans. dutch. irish. and polish peoples. who had come to mingle with the original french and english settlers. thus came our complex and uncommon people. when the last great native pines came crashing down in the michigan forest and when our iron and copper ore became much less bountiful. there were heartbreaking times in many parts of our state. the lumberjacks and the ore workers took up farming. we see today in many sections of our state tragic reminders of their vain efforts and of their dreams of establishing. farms in soil inhospitable to farming. a lonely chimney against the evening sky. a rotting door stoop. a dilapidated barn. we must not assume that all of our state is thus inhospitable. today much of that soil once unsucceysfully tilled is producing fruits. cereals. and meats in great abundance. these developments have come about because michigan men who failed once were willing to try again and try ever once again. they have come about also because. just as there were those who despoiled our land. there were in greater number those who made efforts to enrich it and to insure its future bounty. in 1857 footnotes at end of speech. our legislature had the wisdom to found our great michigan state university. the first agricultural college in the entire nation to open its doors. that institution and our great conservation department are fulfilling their destiny in securing to us the utmost bounty of our soil and the riches beneath. i believe in michigan because our state has been well endowed with many resources. there are the great salt deposits in the state which have placed michigan ahead of all other states in salt production. lest we think salt a common sort of product for table use only. we should remember that salt and dirivatives from it are used in more than 14.000 different products. petroleum. too. is found in michiganenough so that in 1938 michigan was second in -the producing states east of the mississippi. while production has been declining. it is still an important product to many of us. in the era before the automobile. other great industries came to michiganfurniture in congressman fords district. wagons and carriages in congressman chambeelins district. the great paper and pharmaceutical industries in congressman johansens district. and the great and growing pharmaceutical industry in detroit. there came also a wide variety of small factories which depended upon the hardwood of the region. dotting areas to the north. michigan is bounded by waters that were bountifully filled with fish. thus it became a land of fishermen. it became also a land of sailors. our great fishing industry has declined. but with the development of the st. lawrence seaway. our state promises to provide ports for the shipping of all the world. michigan woods have always abounded with game. thus we are a land of hunters and outdoorsmen. up until now we have considered for the most part those people of michigan that depended upon the soil. the forests. and the treasures beneath the soil for a livelihood. there was. and is. the detroit industrial complex so ably represented by congressmen macssowicz. diggs. rasur. pinczll. lesns3i. grzftrrhs. and broomfield. first established as fort pontqhartraln by cadillac in 1700. detroit and its environs had a population of only 1.442 people in 1820 and only 21.000 people by 1850. as late as 1900 detroits population was only approximately 300.000 people. today its population exceeds 2 million. and it has become one of the largest cities in the united states.7 \" in 1900 detroit was a city of stability. it was a selfsatisfied city. true. there had developed in detroit the successful manufacture of stoves. drugs. machinery and railroad equipment. which continue to be successful. but at the turn of this century the most extravagant prediction as to detroits future would have paled into insignificance when compared with the actual events that followed. ford. chalmers. olds. joy. durant. nash. willys. chapin were pioneers of another sort than the trappers. fur traders. and timber men who penetrated the michigan wilderness. but they pursued their dreams with the same tireless energy and zeal and at the same hectic pace. by 1910 the population of detroit had grown to almost half a million people and detroit had become the ninth largest city in the united states. detroit did not invent or create the automobile. but detroit did create and perfect the art of making tens of millions of them through assembly line techniques and industrial practices that revolutionized not only detroit but the world. techniques and practices which may revolutionize society itself before their influence is fully spent. into the crucible of detroit came armies of unlike men. from michigan itself came the grandsons of the fur trappers. the sons of footnotes at end of speech. the lumberjacks and timber cruisers. the unsuccessful farmers and the sons and grandsons of the copper and iron miners. but michigan was an insufficient reservoir of manpower to supply the virtually insatiable appetite of the assembly lines. from the appalachians and from the deep south came other armies of men. when world war i ended. other nations poured their unneeded and unwanted sons into detroit. these were a most uncommon people. these diverse and unlike peoples from all parts of the world have been assimilated in the state of michigan. the melding of their diverse skills. cultures and backgrounds has given us a citizenship unique among the states. but with many common characteristics. michigan peoples have many common traits. among. those common characteristics are ambition. industry. bravery. skill and a love of their state and nation. we should not forget that michigan gave us many supremely brave and selfsacrificing men673.000 of them who served our nation in world war ii. most of our peoples who were not in active service. hundreds of thousands of others. gave their skills to produce the munitions of warmore than $20 billion worth by the end of world war iifar more than the production of any other state. to make detroit and michigan the \"arsenal of democracy\" in world war i. until now i have spoken most of material things. i have said little of michigans inanimate treasures. true. we are a people who have devoted much of our lives and resources to material thingsbut there is another side eq ually or more important. in 1817 our forelears established a great universitythe university of michiganone of the 4 or 5 great universities in the world. at almost each crossroad we established a church and in hamlets a college. so today there are more than 20 colleges and universities. in 1785 a land ordinance was adopted setting aside section 16 in every township to be used for educational purposes. thus today the son of a finnish immigrant writes our nations songs. the son of a polish immigrant is a judge or . congressman. a most uncommon people we are.\" detroit made automobiles available to even the poorest of our countrys citizens. more than 7 million of them in a single year. that availability has been largely responsible for the second greatest industry that our state now enjoys. the tourist industry. thus there is a close kinship between detroit and the outer regions of our state. our 11.000 lakes. our shorelines bathed by the waters of the great lakes. our thousands of miles of trout streams and our tens of thousands of reforested sfcres becken to the weary to come at all seasons and enjoy peace and beauty and to return to their homes and jobs refreshed. the automobile has provided the means for- them to come. and how they have come. from an occasional visitor a few years ago seeking relief perhaps from hay fever. we now have a flood of visitor who come from all parts of the world and at all seasons of the year to visit with us and to spend with us more than $600 million annually. with etienne brule crossed the straits and landed at sault sainte marie in 1618 he could not.imagine that a few short years hence. as .1history goes. a span of steel and stone more than 5 miles long would bridge the rushing waters of the straits. cadillac and his small band of men and women manned the ramparts of fort pontchartrain on the shore of the detroit river in 1700. and met with equal fortitude the vicissitudes of indian attack. destructive fire. cholera. and near starvation. i doubt cadillac could envision that towering edifices of steel and stone would 1 short day stand on the site of and near the old fort. footnotes at end of speech. a4002 the timber cruiser who as late as the 1880s stood in the hushed silence of a grove of towering pines would never have believed that hundreds of thousands of people would come to these woods and lakes and streams of michigan each year to find renewed vigor and contentment. i suspect that as brule. cadillac. and the timber cruiser would have been unable to prophesy the future of michigan. we now cannot successfully prophesy that future. we do know one thing well. however. that this great state of ours. and its magnificent institutions and its people. have developed. been preserved. grown and flourished in a climate of personal. political. and economic freedom. it is the hallowed function of you gentlemen whom we honor tonight. to help to continue to preserve those institutions of freedom. it is not my purpose or province to advise you as to how you shall insure that freedom endures. there comes to my mind. however. the words of two great and honored michigan statesmen who described their creeds when dealing with critical political problems of their day. first. there was senator lewis cass. who as n senator in 1850 enjoyed the dubious help of being required by custom to vote in accordance with instructions of the michigan legislature. which appointed him. differing with the instructions received from the legislature. he had this to say. \"when the time comes and i am required to vote upon this measure. i shall know how to rec6ncile my duty to the legislature with my duty to myself by surrendering a trust i can no longer fill.\" friend and foe alike proclaimed him for his coitage and ultimately the instructions. from the legislature were withdrawn and senator cass not only retained his integrity and independence. but he has been forever honored by his people. more recently the late senator vandenberg. having changed the views he had previously held on matters of the greatest national interest. -reporte2 to the shocked constituents who had elected him and said. \"what happens to me politically is of no moment to me or to the state. but what happens to the country is of vital moment to all.\" what can we predict for the future of michigan? i am reluctant to predict as to its physical characteristics. its modes of trarsportation or even as to the form and n~ture of its industry. it has been predicted by scientists that in the next 25 years worldwide transportation may become as rapid as communication is now. that nuclear developments may make energy almost as cheap as air and that climate control will permit us to have alternatively a tropical garden or an ice age. in the light of these predictions it would be presumptuous for me to try to predict the rate of growth of our state or the precise forms that growth shall take. i believe that michigan has the greatest growth potential of any state in the union. it has great natural resources. particularly the greatest bodies of fresh water in the world. the geography and terrain that make it an outdoor paradise for its esldents and tourists. and. above all. the most important resource. people of indomitable spirit. how can we put action. truth into the words. \"michigan means business\"? first. we. you. each person in michigan. should recognize it is .a job for us to do ourselves. stop expecting washington and our federal congress to do the job for us. we should ask far and expect to receive the cooperation of the federal government in those areas there joint state and rederal action is required. * second. advise our state officials and our state legislative bodies that in the development of our land of plenty. it will be necessary to invest money. now and in the future. in many projects. such as roads. educational institutions. health institutions. harbor project4 recreational facilities. to name only a fewprojects that will permit the rapid development of our michigan. and. incidentally. a rapid return of the money invested. through taxes that would be paid. we should expect the legislature to provide the funds necessary. third. the organization of groups whose efforts can be directed toward the many community projects that should be undertaken. projects that will help to put action and truth into the words. \"michigan means business.\" 11857: michigan state

the april 6. 1957. issue of the pilot. published in boston. mass.:","mr. speaker. the farm problem is everybodys problem. it is a problem that is here and is very real. i have taken this time today to spread some dependable information upon the record. i believe that if we have more light than heat. we can help the present situation substantially. certainly we cannot solve the farm problem by merely castigating the very sincere present secretary of agriculture. ezra taft benson. any more than in previous years we could find solutions to previous problems in american agriculture merely by casting aspersions on the then secretaries of agriculture. to my knowledge they have all had pretty tough sledding. i have served as a member of the subcommittee on agricultural appropriations for more than a decade. it may be that i take some license here but i would like to say that i have served the administration of four great americans who were secretaries of agriculturethe honorable claude wickard. the honorable clinton anderson. and the honorable charles brannanand last but certainly not least. the honorable ezra taft benson. through those years have also paraded -some outstanding members of this house as chairmen of the house committee on agriculture legislationthe late judge hampton p. fulmer was chairman- of that committee at the time i came to congress. he was a lovable person. dedicated to the cause of the american farmer as was his successor. john william flannigan. jr.. of virginia. clifford hope. and harold cooley. upon whose shoulders now rest the trust of rural america if legislation can assist in -our present squeeze. and. through the years. it has been my privilege to serve under quite a list of other great americans. equally devoted to the cause of american agriculture. the chairmen of -the subcommittee of the appropriations committee that supplies the funds authorized by the congress and asked for by the secretary of agriculture. in my decade of service on that subcommittee. i have had the privilege of working with such men as judge malcolm c. tarver. of georgia. everett dirksen. of illinois. h. carl andersen. of minnesota. and the present very able chairman of that subcommittee. jamie whitten. of mississippi. during my service in the congress. i have seen much constructive work done when men such as those i have named have worked together in a full understanding of what the facts are and what can or cannot be accomplished. i was particularly impressed at the time when president eisenhower sent his farm message to the congress to hear the honorable harold cooley assert that he was going to do his best to keep politics out of the considerations of his committee. i subscribe to that also and with you. i hope that we can promptly be about the business of helping in the present farm situation. we have already passed one piece of legislation by mutual cooperation and while it is not a big item. at least. it is one step in the right direction. i refer to the removal of the gasoline tax for fuel used on the farm. i am happy also to note that the aisle does not stand in the way of the support for legislation that will greatly liberalize the loaning program of the farmers home administration. i trust that we can act speedily on the two measures that will provide longer repayment periods and the power to refinance farmers home loans and generally make more effective that very useful administration which takes care of the small farmer and those who are the poor risks among our farm population. another action that should be taken by the congress immediately is on h. r. 8751 which would amend the agricultural adjustment act of 1938 to permit farmers to use the grain and wheat they have raised on their own farms to feed their own livestock. the spectacle of a monastery down in georgia faced with a penalty of $1.13 a bushel on wheat. raised at the monastery. strictly for use there. should give us pause. last year they raised more than their quotahence the penalty under the law. the same thing applies to many small producers. this proposal has already passed the other body and should be passed now in the house. through the years i have seen this house take action by full cooperation between the majority and minority parties that were truly helpful in solutions of our farming troubles. what i have to say today involves one act of the 83d congress that also was the result of such cooperation. it stands to perform much good today and in the future. i refer. of course. to the very fundamental work that we are doing through the medium of our newly reinstated foreign agricultural service. perhaps a little history would serve us well here. our efforts to aid the american farmer in intelligent and timely marketing of his surplus crops in foreign countries actually begins in the late 1920s when nils a. olsen was.chief of the bureau of agricultural economics in 19281935. olsen was oldfashioned in his thinking. fortunately. for he believed that the american farmer had to have a profitable market for that which he produced. further. he recognized that there were several agricultural commodities that had a long historical dependency on world markets. he felt that in order to maintain and extend overseas markets. it was important to have an understanding of foreign competition. demand. and marketing practices. the five. principal commodities involved are: first. cotton. an export commodity since 1739. second. tobacco. an export since 1615. third. fruit. since early in the 19th century. fourth. wheat. and fifth. rice... there are. depending on the seasons. many others of lesser importance historically. a new export. of real importance. is fats and oils. olsen felt that knowledge of foreign markets could contribute much to a more orderly program of marketing. with wider knowledge. the farmer could better plan his plantings and his shipments. olsens dream resulted in the establishment in the department ofagriculture of the office of foreign agricultural service on july 5. 1930. it became the ofas. under its authorization. the department sent specialists abroad to study marketing conditions and thereby to assist the american farmer in obtaining the maximum value for his product by enlarging every possibility in the domestic and the worlds consuming areas. but these specialists soon became more than that. because they felt the responsibility of their specific and particular missionthe line of responsibility was clear and straight from them through the secretary of agriculture to the american farmer. they soon grew to know not only outstanding producers in foreign lands. but those whose business it was to import into those nations those commodities in which they specialized. they returned to the united states periodically and moved from area to area consulting with producers and shippers. they became a dependable liaison between areas of supply and areas of want. their watchword was \"service to the american farmer.\" the record of these commodity specialists is good. that record was made during the great. worldwide depression years. and. therefore. adds to the credit they so justly deserve. from a nation famous for its production lines and specialized production. we had sent commodity specialists to help the world enjoy quality and superior condition of our specialized agricultural crops. the idea was original. it was properly directed. it was producing. the dream of nils a. olsen was beginning to bear fruit. it seemed that we were on our american way to a new approach and to a new era in foreign trade. they knew that any american agriculture problem was the problem of every american and they were at work. and then occurred a jurisdictional dispute at the cabinet level. the state department. feeling that everything outside the united states was their concern. and only their concern. looked on anyreal activity. regardless of its merits. as an invasion of their rights. they laid plans for an amalgamation of all foreign efforts under the state department. they succeeded. and in 1939 this amalgamation took place with. it should be noted. the departments of the army and .the treasury. at least. refusing to go along and insisting that in their specific fields. they be assured their independ. ence. under the amalgamation. ofas employees were offered the opportunity to become employees of the state department. this was optional and moreand more accepted. they were offered far more than the department of agriculture could possibly offer: better pay. shorter hourssince proven. better retirement benefits. more senior rights as to office space and subsistence facilities abroad. a chance for advancementone employee is today an ambassador. to my knowledge. and another. to my knowledge. has retired as a minister of embassy. it is my belief that the amalgamation actually took from the department of agriculture not only the clear straight line of responsibility from the secretary to thecommodity specialists but also theability of the secretary to do very much t6ward the protection of his foreign agricultural workers. the amalgamation to all intents and purposes destroyed nils olsens dream. our attaches. as i have indicated. became agents of the secretary of state rather than the agents of the secretary of agriculture. moreover. we changed the name of the service from that of foreign agricultural service to the office of foreign agricultural relations. for a long while it did not make too much difference. the war broke out in 1941. and with it came military and strategic state trading to take over all normal trade and that condition existed by and large until about 1950. during the war and the postwar rehabilitation period. we had a ready and a commanding demand for everything that the american farmer could produce. after the war. we wenit all out to feed and to rehabilitate the farmers of our neighboring nations. we had unrra and eca. the marshall plan. and president trumans point 4 program. a program that involved the exporting of our knowhow to foreign countries. we did bring them back to life. and in so doing we have added to our own problems here in america. it shall be my purpose here today to show you as nearly as i can some of the facts of life regarding the competition that we are forced to meet. broadly throughout the world. agriculture production today stands at 119 percent of agricultural production in the prewar years of 193539. in the free world. this figure stands at 125 percent. now. may i get back to the work that we in the congress have already done in the name of our american producers to get tooled up so that we may more adequately gage and more adequately understand the problems that we face today in world agricultural production and market competition. those of us on .both sides of the aisle who watched the american farmer rise to his full stature during the war to. produce those foods necessary to win the war and the peace. also watched our efforts through the various agenciesunrra. eca. the marshall plan. point 4. and a host of. other activities of a subsidiary nature. to restore production to the.farms of devastated europe and *the embittled areas and we felt. seeing what was going on. much as nils olsen must have felt in the. 1920s. from 1948 on. in our private conversations and to my own knowledge. in our discussions on the subcommittee on agricultural appropriations. we suggested that we should have a stronger foreign agriculture agency in the department of agriculture. many of us at first hand deplored what appeared to be a loose association between our own secretary- of agriculture at home and those who were supposed to be attached from his department in our foreign embassies. this was not peculiar to secretary benson any more than it was peculiar to his predecessors. secretary brannan and secretary anderson. as early as 1950. a great many of us on both sides of the aisle undertook to study this problem intimately. : as far as our own sub.committee on agricultural appropriations is concerned. our entire. subcom.mittee planned a trip for the purpose of studying this. problem. personally i made such a trip and upon my return reported informally to the members of the agricultural subcommittee of the appropriations committee. that was in october 1953. this report was well received and widely reprinted. following this trip by our subcommittee and following similar trips by the house agriculture committee. we did work together to the end that as part of the agriculture bill of august 1954. . president eisenhower signed the bill which returned the agricultural attaches to what we felt was their proper place as. first of all. responsible to the secretary of agriculture. we also renamed the office of .foreign agriculture relations to the new name of foreign agricultural service amd arranged for the funds supplying it .to be appropriated directly from the department of agriculture. -looking back we must say that this should have been done years earlier. it is entirely possible that it should have been done as early as 1948 and i propose now to tell you why. that it was not done is no particular discredit to anyone but a review of the facts as we have them today will indicate that we might possibly have overcome or anticipated some of the problems that today exist and which we will have to live with until we have solved them. as matters now stand. we are just completing the tooling up of this new agricultural service in the department of agriculture that in the future stands to be most useful to the american farmer. now in order to present some of the facts of foreign agricultural production most effectively at this time. i have had the department of agriculture prepare for me some charts which will bring us up to date as to world production. as i have already stated. in the free world that production is 25 percent greater than it was in the 4 years just -prior to world war ii. it has been apparent to us for some time that our foreign aid programs should be reassessed to reflect this fact and that this country no longer should appropriate funds for foreign aid that will further aggravate this imbalance. just the other day we had the prime minister of england reassure us that his -country no longer wanted economic aid. only this week the international relief society that operates under the name of care announced that they are pulling up stakes in the free world and are moving their operations to the orient where people are still hungry and where there is need for aid of this sort. these charts which i will show you are purposely made as simple as possible. obviously it will be impossible to reproduce them in the record so i am taking the liberty of removing portions of an excellent pamphlet put out last month by the foreign agricultural service which will deal with world production of at least two commodities which these charts reflect. this pamphlet is entitled \"the world agricultural situation. 1956.\" it contains an amazing amount of information regarding the world production situation. most of the charts i propose to show you are contained in this publication. i commend this pamphlet to your study. there are. of course. two commodities that are hurting more perhaps than others in the united states at this time. mostly these two are suffering because of surpluses in the united states that according to the agriculture law of 1938 indicate the need for acreage reduction. the first of these is cotton. today. cotton and its problems is everybodys problem. today the world supply of cotton stands at approximately 61.8 million bales. that is 3.3 million bales higher than a year earlier and is a new record high. the world production also is a new record high and world consumption is expected to be -nearly equal to the 195455 record. however. due largely to the fact that in the year 1950 the united states production was unable to meet its overseas commitments. world production during the last four years has skyrocketed and in those 4 years has exceeded world consumption by nearly 10 million bales with the result that endseason world stocks increased by that amount between 1951 and 1955. due mainly to world competition. our own stocks increased by 8.8 million bales which con.titutes 90 percent of the world increase in surplus. we are told that more than 50 percent of the world cotton stocks had accumulated in the united states by july 31. 1955. *while most other countries. both exporters and importers. had reduced their -stocks to a minimum in anticipation of some action on the part of the united states government to reduce the price of cotton for export. prices of foreign growths of cotton declined sharply during 195455 for the same reason and at the beginning of the 195556 season they were as much as 8 .cents a pound below those for similar .quality united states cotton. as the 195556 season opened on august 1. there was an atmosphere of suspense in foreign cotton markets as importers purchased only for current minimum needs and exporters of foreign growths offered their cotton at lower prices in an effort to liquidate their holdings before anticipated reductions in prices of united states cotton for export. export sales programs now in effect or announced for operation after january 1. 1956. include limitations intended to avoid any serious reaction in world markets that would be detrimental to foreign competitors and holders of stocks. the quantities of united states cotton involved in the programs are not large enough to stimulate exports sufficiently to bring them up even to the 195455 low level. world cotton production in 195556 currently estimated at 40.6 million. 500pound bales. is an increase of 2 million bales above that of a year ago. which was a record high at that time. half of the increase occurred in the united states. the united states increase is attributed to a 22percent rise in average yield per acre that more than offset a 12percent reduction in acreage under the productioncontrol program. the increase in foreign production was due almost entirely to an increase in acreage. world cotton consumption is estimated at 36.6 million bales and that is 800.000 bales higher than the previous record figure of 35.8 reported for 1953 and 1954. world consumption has increased steadily since the end of world war ii but has not kept rise with the increase in production. most of the increase. it should be noted. has taken place in countries that produce cotton and at the same time have high industrial development and high standards of living. cotton: acreage and production in major countries. areas. and world average 193539. annual 195455 and 195556 l acreage production

other person to. whom the country is more indebted for the fine work which has been done in this legislative body and the way it has been done. a large contributing factor has been the attitude of the minority leader in working out problems. and there is due to him a great part of the credit. i am glad to have heard what the senator from montana has said. i agree with him heartily. i believe the record sustains his statement. and that the people generally will realize its soundness.","mr. chairman. i am sure a great majority of my colleagues of the house are sold on the worthwhile program which is being discussed today in committee of the whole a program that has vast possibilities for effectinz economies in expenditures in hospitalization and in relief funds. it is a great surprise to me that the congress has failed to finance the program as adequately as it should have been financed in the past. all that was wrong with public law 113 was that it was not properly financed. the program. as contained in this bill does enlarge the program. and it should be enlarged. it has some decided advantages which were not in public law 113. do not let the fact that there was some disagreement in the committee. and that is to be regretted. lead you into believing that this bill is all bad. it does have room for considerable improvement. in that connection. may i say since the chairman announced that the vote was 23 for it and i voting \"present\" in reporting the bill out of the committee. i happen to be one of the 23 who voted for it. at the time i voted for it. the gentleman from north carolina . the ranking minority- member. was still not satisfied with the contents of the bill. i made the suggestion that if the gentleman from north carolina had some worthwhile amendments to offer to the bill that the committee give consideration to accepting those amendments or seeing to it. at least. that proper consideration was given on the floor of the house to those amendments. i understand that my colleague the gentleman from pennsylvania . has some amendments. i have an open mind on this matter of amendments. if they will improve the legislation. i propose to support them. i do not know the contents or the details of them. but i am going to listen with considerable interest when they are being presented. in the meantime. let me call your attention to the fact that this program should be broadened. it should be enlarged. and it should be better financed. the fact that we are providing for 35. 45. and finally 65 million dollars annual appropriations for this program does not mean that we are going to get that much money. the only advantage is that we may. by increasing the authorizations. bring to the attention of the appropriations committee and the budget office the fact that the program has been underfinanced in the years past. and that it is the wish of the congress that the program be enlarged. i believe this bill is a step in the right direction. for that reason i voted to report it out favorably. i did it in view of the fact that i knew very little about the actual contents of the legislation at the time. i was not a member of the subcommittee. but as a member of the committee on education and labor. my efforts have been largely expended in the field of education and labor as such. i have always left to my colleagues barden of north carolina and kelley of pennsylvania this matter of the physically handicapped. because they were deeply interested in it. the gentleman from north carolina is one of the coauthors of the bardenla follette act. and certainly knows the problem. if he thinks this bill is not in proper shape and can convince the members of the committee that some changes should be made. i am going to keep an open mind. and if i think his suggestions will improve the legislation. it is my intention to support them.","title ii is the authority to requisition. which we eliminated entirely. title iv relates to price control. which has been eliminated. title v relates to labor disputes. it has been eliminated.","mr. speaker. the social security act is the most important economic legislation ever passed by the congress. it now affects nearly everyone. there are over 60.000.000 persons insured under this program today. more than three out of four mothers and children would receive monthly benefits in the event of the death of the family breadwinner. the survivors insurance protection alone has a face value of over $2.000.000.000. there are 4.500.000 retired agcd persons. widows and orphans receiving the oldage and survivors insurance benefits every month. nearly 8 out of every 10 jobs are covered under the program. in spite of the widespread nature of the socialsecurity program. there are some groups who have been neglected. among the forgotten men and women of our socialsecurity program are the blind and the other seriously disabled people. under present law we not only deny benefits to them when they are no longer able to work because of disability. but the way the program is set up means that their protection for oldage and death benefits toward which they have paid may be lost or seriously reduced. at the time the 1950 amendments were being developed. the ways and means committee gave intensive study to the feasibility of benefits for insured persons who become permanently and totally disabled. i am convinced that a program of disability benefits. such as that passed by the house of representatives in 1949. is highly desirable and could be successfully administered. at the same time i recognize that a program of cash benefits for insured persons who become permanently and totally disabled could not be enacted with the speed which is necessary for the other amendments to oldage and survivors insurance provided in this bill. therefore. action must now be directed only toward protecting the disabled person against loss of the oldage and survivors insurance benefit rights toward which his contributions have been paid. this is what this bill does. another group who are without protection under the present socialsecurity law. and who deserve the protection perhaps more than anyone now under the system. are the service men and women now fighting in korea. in the 1950 amendments we gave wage credits to the servicemen of world war ii. it is now absolutely necessary that we extend the same protection to those serving during this emergency period. i am also strongly in favor of increasing the benefits as provided in this bill and of increasing the amount of the retirement test. it needs no argument to demonstrate that the average benefit of a retired worker-$42 a monthis too low. the amounts must be raised and. moreover. those beneficiaries who are too old to work should be allowed to increase their earnings to $70 without loss of benefits. i am one of those who believes that the oldage and survivors insurance should be made universal and should cover just about all jobs. i am. therefore. heartily in favor of the provisions in this bill which extends the opportunity to come under the program to additional employees of state and local governments. the socialsecurity program is fast becoming one of the best in the world. it is important that we speed the day when it shall stand first. we are now engaged in a war of ideas with the dictatorship of communist russia. in the oldage and survivorsinsurance program we are demonstrating th:.t democratic capitalism can provide security and can do it in the american way. under this program security is earned as wages are earned through work and through the individual contributions of the employees who are protected. this is part of the demonstration of our concern for the welfare of the individual. the oldage and survivorsinsurance program must be extended and improved. this bill is an important step in that direction. mr. f@rand. mr. speaker. any program as closely tied to the economic life of the nation as is the socialsecurity program would soon become obsolete and unable to fulfill its function if it were not periodically examined and brought up to date. while h. r. 7800 by no means solves all of the problems and issues which still confront the program. the bill is a step in the right direction. and it does take care of most of the more urgent and immediate problems which must be faced. the amendments which h. r. 7800 would make are largely confined to the federal oldage and survivors insurance program. if the vitality injected into oldage and survivors insurance by the 1950 amendments is to be retained. the program must be reassessed at comparatively frequent intervals and necessary amendments made. the amendments proposed by h. r. 7800 would preserve the gains made by the 1950 amendments. and would keep the oldage and survivors insurance program a vital forwardlooking program. two of the changes which would be made by the bill are made necessary by the upward trend in wages and prices. the increases in living costs which have taken place necessitate an increase in the amounts payable under the program. while the benefit increases provided by the 1950 amendments were substantial. they did not adequately reflect the increase in living costs which had taken place since 1939. when the benefit rates applying until 1950 were established. thus. the increases provided for in the bill are to take account not only of the increased living costs since 1950. but also of the fact that the 1950 increases were themselves not entirely adequate. the benefit increase provided by the bill is a modest increase which can be financed with no increase in the scheduled tax rate. most beneficiaries on the rolls would receive benefit increases of $5 or 12 v2 percent. whichever is larger. .while these increases are not large. they are necessary if the program is to continue to fulfill its role as the basic security program of the nation. upon which workers and their families can build their plans for financial security. recent increases in wages also make it essential that the amount which a beneficiary may earn in covered employment and still receive his benefits be increased. accordingly. the monthly amount of permitted earnings would be increased by the bill from $50 to $70. while i favor a $100 work clause. the increase provided in the bill would be an important step in the right direction.. in addition to increasing benefits and liberalizing the retirement test of the program. the bill would protect the benefit rights of individuals who are permanently and totally disabled. give wage credits to members of the armed forces for service since the close of world war ii. and permit certain state and local government employees under retirement systems to secure oldage and survivors insurance coverage. some of the most severe hardships which occur under the present program arise when the worker becomes disabled and is unable to work over an extended period of time. although the need for providing benefits for workers who become peramently and totally disabled is great. the committee is not now recommending the enactment of such provisions because of the shortness of time to consider this important matter. there is one phase of the problem. though. which can and should be corrected without delay. under the present benefit provisions of the program the benefit rights of a disabled worker are gradually dissipated and in time may disappear entirely. h. r. 7800 would freeze benefit rights under the program for periods during which the individual was permanently and totally disabled. thus. while benefits would not be paid because of the workers disability. the period of disability would not cause the worker to lose his survivorship and retirement protection under oldage and survivors insurance. the need for the provisions giving wage credits for military service seems clear indeed. the wage credits provided under the 1950 legislation for world war ii military service were given only until july 24. 1947. the needs of the survivors of the thousands of american soldiers who have lost their lives in the korean conflict are just as great as were the needs of the survivors of world war ii servicemen. h. r. 7800 would simply extend the period for which wage credits are given from the close of world war ii until the end of 1953. the socialsecurity provisions concerning the armed forces should of course be reexamined by the congress before that date. the amendment to the bill concerning the coverage of state and local government employees is another modification in the program which takes account of current developments and attitudes. thus helping to keep the program up to date. at present all state and local government employees who are under a retirement system are excluded from coverage under the federalstate coverage agreements. there has been considerable demand for coverage from some of the groups compulsorily excluded. and in some cases retirement systems have been abandoned so that the employees could be covered under the federal program. i believe that the provision in the bill will be noncontroversial. as the compulsory exclusion for members of retirement systems is retained for policemen. firemen. and elementary and secondary school teachers. the bill would permit other groups covered under retirement systems to secure oldage and survivors insurance coverage if coverage is desired. the bill also makes several technical changes which will simplify the administration of the program and correct certain inequities which have arisen under the 1950 amendments. the changes proposed by this bill have received the careful consideration of the ways and means committee. your committee feels that these changes are necessary to preserve the advances made by the 1950 legislation and to maintain the health and vitality of the program. while the scope of the amendments is very limited as compared with the sweeping advances made in 1950. the amendments are nevertheless of great importance to those persons affected. your committee feels that there can be no question as to the soundness and desirability of each of these proposed changes in the social security act. we believe that each change which would be made is noncontroversial in nature and has the support and approval of the groups concerned. while the enactment of these amendments would represent a safe. thoroughly charted and wellexplored course. there would be real danger in the failure to enact this legislation. if vigilance is not exercised fn keeping oldage and survivors insurance an uptodate and progressive program. the way will be open for legislative measures less sound and carefully thought out. i urge the members of the house to support this very desirable piece of legislation.","mr. chairman. i decline to yield. i have listened to people talk for over a year and now i wish to take the floor for but 5 minutes. a very short time. the only reason i take your time at all is because i think that in the last 30 years i have gained sufficient knowledge and experience to add to your knowledge and your experience. i came here to represent people and to be helpful to you. i am perfectly familiar with the beginning of this pattern which has been sold to many of you and which has been sold to the public. that of appointment by executive order or some other means. people to decide such important issues which have important effect on the economy of the country. my first experience was in 1917. and it may interest you to know how the first shipbuilding wage adjustment board came into being. at that time the government had set up the united states shipping board emergency fleet corporation. as usual in time of emergency they were building ships for the merchant marine. and the navy was building ships for the navy. mr. samuel gompers was president of the american federation of labor. i do not think his equal has appeared on the scene of the labor movement since his death. the acting secretary of the navy at that time was the man who later was to serve longer as president of the united states than any other man. he and mr. gompers agreed on august 20. 1917. to ask the president to appoint such a board. and it was appointed by executive order. the acting secretary of the navy for the secretary named a member. the president named the chairman. who was the public member. mr. e. c. macy. president of the national civic federation. of newyork. and mr. gompers named a member. they brought out the macy award. which in effect gave preferential high ratings to members of the american federation craft unions and other raises that threw the whole structure of wages in shipbuilding plants out of gear. and they have never been in gear since in any fair and equitable ratioand i should know for i spent 30 years with this problem. that is exactly the pattern that has been followed. one of those gentlemen continued on. perhaps seeing the political significance of such an arrangement. the american federation of labor put on a drive in the shipbuilding industry. at that time they had only craft membership. but they represented in this way all the workers. i come on to the nra days. i have been in washington numerous times. i have been exposed to this iniquitous arrangement for a long time. why in the world you subscribe to the powerofattorney theory for the american worker. and vote this authority to professional leaders of organized labor or any other organization which represents only a small segment. i cannot understand. by no means do these men who have been appointed over the years. even to the last stabilization board during the war. represent these people we are talking about and whom it is our duty to properly represent. all cf the decisions and the history of them is perfectly plain. are made on cases which are to the benefit of the union which is in preference at the time. it became the ciu in the last war. and that is common knowledge. we are embarking again on the same procedure. when i was here in an advisory capacity before the beginning of the war representing shipbuilding. i was invited by the then secretary of labor to have luncheon with her. i met there john green. who was then president of the cio sponsored industrial union of marine and shipbuilding workers. i was asked why we could not get together. since i represented the leading shipyard in the world. as you gentleman know. and make an agreement. thereby furnishing leadership to stabilize industrial relations in shipyards. i said to her: \"madam secretary. i have the highest regard for you. you are a sincere person. but you have been misinformed. and you are so ignorant of these things until you are actually a menace to the industrial relations of the country.\" i read in the paper this morning. and you probably read it. too. yet no one has mentioned it. that a cabinet officer. paid by the people. serving under oath. made a plea for 15.000.000 retail trade employees to join the federation of labor to fight for an agreement for a union shop. which would make those who did not belong to the 3ane union lose their employment and furnish greater tribute. political and otherwise. the millions of production workers who have never caused or participated in any work stoppage. who do not threaten or coerce their fellow workmen to submit to rome autocratic authority should be recognized and have membership representation on such a committee. the two major labor organizations claim membership which is less than a fourth of the gainfully employed persons. independent and unaffiliated labor organizations and unorganized who are in the substantial majority have never been recognized or given equitable treatment. surely the representatives of the whole people should prevent governmental actions which favor special interests. the influence of these special labor interests has cost the taxpayers millions of wasted dollars and brought about disputes and work stoppages in peace and war. often intimidat on of our fellow citizens. and also violence and bodily injury has risulted. a laborcontrolled government wil most certainly increase inflation as well as bring about the destruction of our constitutional form of government. representatives of the public and not special interests should control the policies and actions of such a committee as v e now seek to authorize. the areas of responsibility and action should be limited as set forth in the amendment. for these reasons. and in accord with statements previously made by my colleague. i urge adoption of the lucas amendment.","mr. president. as will rogers used to say. \"all i know is what i see in the papers.\" the papers carry the story that the republicans are trying to get rid of mr. acheson as secretary of state. i wish to dissociate myself from this undertaking. but i do wish to join with those who are seeking toassist him toward a more constructive line of policy than that which has been followed for some time past. there are a great many citizens of this country who feel that our foreign policy can be improved. among them is a correspondent. mrs. yolande elwood clevenger. of champaign. ill.. who has sent me a copy of a recent letter to secretary acheson. i should like to read a few paragraphs from that letter. she says: i am not one of those citizens who believes the cold war can be settled merely by a meeting with mr. stalin. i am aware that immense difficulties confront us in dealing with the soviet union. that their ideology emphasizes the fallacy that the end justifies the means. that they thereby justify ruthlessness and duplicity. i am aware that the very nature of totalitarianism breeds more ruthlessness. all these things make the social engineering job a tough one. but i am also aware. mr. acheson. that every demonstration of \"strength\" on our part leads to a greater one by the soviet union to grimmer determination to outmatch us. gain more territory and resources. speed up technology. and consolidate their people. and i am aware we are providing them just the outside enemy they need for these purposes. there is no chance of their relaxing controls under such a situation and remote chances for underground movements. meantime our liberties are slipping. and total diplomacy. mr. acheson. making the state department line the patriotic line. with those who oppose. it inevitably regarded with suspicion. can only result in more hysteria and more thought control in americahowever \"volunteer\" may seem the \"public\" opinion promoted by leaders of business. labor. agriculture. and civic organizations buttered up for the purpose. yours is the stature. i believe. mr. acheson. to do a better social engineering job than this. citizen perspective. citizen intuition. citizen proposals have more to offer than you think. including more realism. we are growing up a bit. i think. mr. acheson. we believe less readily that the world is black and white. divided between saints and devils. we know the russians have a different history and culture. and consequently different attitudes about many things. but we know the similarities are also great and that we have a considerable. if incomplete. body of knowledge and experience to deal with differences. we know we cannot consider the problem of russia without taking into account the history of western hostility to her and the effect of our hasty decisions at the close of the war in stopping lendlease. seeking bases. building atomic stock piles. and constantly talking about a third world war while she was weak and devastated. mr. president. i cannot quite see the same picture that my correspondent sees of russias position. namely. as having been that of a weak and devastated nation whom we have goaded into enmity. russia was savagely devastated. her people suffered hardship and death to a degree which is beyond our imagination. yet during the period of the wars ending months. when success was assured. and in the months following the end of hostilities. mr. stalin was winning diplomatic victories and was consolidating his position in asia with our active assistance. and to our present discomfiture. my own sympathy goes out to the russian people. at no time. mr. president. do i feel that we have ever needed to sympathize with the politburo itself. it is well able to take care of itself. mrs. clevenger ends her letter with this paragraph: i urge most earnestly. mr. acheson. bold. imaginative efforts to find new approaches to russia. i urge a peaceplanning board of trained social psychologists. humanrelations experts. and social scientists to study alternatives and to assist you. mr. president. the means she suggests may not be the best means. but she does have a clear idea of what is lacking in our policy. russia is fighting the cold war on the side of the minds and the feelings and the spirit of men. we are opposing her with billions of aid and billions of rearmament. the aid has been effective. but it cannot be long continued. the rearmament is necessary as a purely defensive measure. but it is absolutely barren of any effectiveness whatsoever as a means for ending the cold war. on the contrary. it perpetuates the cold war. we might fight the cold war on the battlefield where our opponent isnot where he is not. the battlefield is the minds and hearts of men. that is where the state department must go on the offensive and make the attack. .we cannot fight our opponent where he is not. and win a war. mr. president. it was a great satisfaction to listen to the clear analysis of one large sector of this problem given us yesterday by the junior senator from connecticut . it encourages me to give further thought to this no. 1 problem of our nation. and to bring further considerations to the floor of the senate from time to time. i trust that other senators will join me in this endeavor to reorient our foreign policy from billions to millions. and from the defensive to the offensive. we can win the cold war.","mr. president. i have already spoken on this subject so often that i hesitate to take further time of the senate. i should be very glad to yield to anyone who wishes to speak in favor of the amendment. i can state again very briefly the problem which is before the senate. there has been developed in recent years monopoly control of industry and of labor in labor negotiations to a point where in various industries. if labor and management fail to agree. and if there is a strike. the entire country is tied up. and is subjected to hardship of one kind or another because of that failure of labor and management to agree. that is no more the fault of labor than the fault of management. in some cases labor may be to blame and in others management may be to blame. but in any event the public interest is concerned. it is deprived of conveniences. and even of the necessities of life. in our amendment we have attempted to deal only with the one case where a strike is of such overwhelming nature that it endangers the safety and health of all the people of the united states. that is the condition with which we have to deal. i have said frankly before that no one has found the ultimate solution in dealing with that kind of a situation. in the last analysis it may go on until a general strike occurs. there was a general strike in england in 1925. and the problem was what the government should do about it. all powers were granted to the government. the government seized everything. it requisitioned all the trucks in england. the government operated the trucks and delivered the food and the necessities to the people of the island. probably we will not reach such an extreme situation here. but in various fields we may be so tied up that finally failure to solve the problem would threaten the destruction of the people of the united states. when we come to such a point. and the parties will not agree. the country practically faces a revolution and the president would have to be given broad powers equivalent almost to the powers given him in time of war. i hope we will never reach that point. we never have reached it. although 3 years ago the president of the united states himself came before congress and demanded from congress the power arbitrarily to draft all the strikers into the army of the united states. and. incidentally. all the laborunion leaders. i do not know what he was going to do with them. he asked congress to give him the power to draft them into the army and to seize the property. and to operate the property under government supervision. with the use of the united states army. as a matter of fact. the strike was solved perhaps by that threat. alone. but in any event i hope we may never reach that point. all we are trying to do now is to give the president some reasonable powers to deal with the situation when negotiations between labor and management have broken down. let us say a contract is to expire on the 31st of july. labor and management get together. and everyone thinks they are going to agree. no one expects a strike. but on the last day the parties fail to agree. that is the first time the public becomes aware of the situation. then what can the president do? under the thomas bill he can take no effective action. all he can do is to call upon the men to continue working for 60 days while he appoints an emergency board to look into the situation. if the workers defy him. he has no power whatever. he cannot seize the property. he cannot use the injunction. mr. president. the sponsors of the various amendments all agree that we should say that a strike for a period of 60 days after the end of the negotiation period should be illegal. we should be able to maintain the status quo while the president uses the prestige of his office and all his powers. and makes use of the emergency board. to settle the strike. everyone agrees on that. everyone agrees that there should be a 60day waiting period. there is no question that there is unanimous agreement on the part of everyone who has sponsored amendments to the labor bill before the senate. that there should be that 60day waiting period. but the question is. how is that to be brought about? if the men simply insist on striking. if the employer refuses to pay the sums which the workers think are right. and the plant is shut down. the president is left absolutely without power. the ives amendment. which was rejected. was very frank in its terms. it recognized that the president had no power. so it provided that he call congress into session on the next day after there was a breakdown. the senate rejected that amendment because it did not feel that at so early a point congress should be called into the matter. it is up to us to give the president some power to use in his executive discretion simply to enforce the provisions on which we all agreethat there ought to be no strike for 60 days. the only question that is before the senate is. what powers should be granted the president? it seems to me the injunctive power is sufficient. i think the injunction operated in every case to keep the men working for 60 days. to keep the plant operating. to keep the people of the country supplied with necessities. and during the 60 days some progress was made toward settlement in every case. efforts at settlement were not always successful. in some cases they were and in some cases they were not. but. at least. some progress was made. under the injunction procedure. strike action was delayed for 60 days. i have not heard much public protest against the emergency injunction provision. let us look back at all the criticisms which have been madl of the tafthartley law. senators will probably not remember any criticism aimed particularly at the presidents use of the injunction in emergency cases. he has made use of the injunction in such cases four or five times. i do not remember any criticism from the public of the presidents use of the injunction in such cases. criticisms were aimed at injunctions issued at the request of mr. denhams board dealing with secondary boycotts. but there was no resentment on the part of labor against the presidents use of injunctions in emergency cases. but when the proposal was made for repeal of the tafthartley law. labor said that the injunction. if granted. implied that labor was wrong. i do not agree with that. the injunction. if granted. works both ways. it does not imply that anyone is wrong. the injunction simply enforces the provision of law that both parties maintain the status quo for 60 days. that is all the injunction does. i do not think it implies that labor is wrong or that the employer is wrong. i am quite willing to stand by the holland amendment. but. mr. president. there is the psychological feeling on the part of labor that the injunction is in some way a reflection on them. i believe we can meet that criticism by adding a provision for seizure within 60 days. so that if the president found he could maintain a more equable atmosphere in a particular situation and remove labors objection by seizing the plant. and labor would then be willing to go on and negotiate. he ought to have power to seize. there has been much said to the effect that seizure would be unfair to the employers. whose plants were seized. those who own the plants may be in the right in a controversy. i agree that the situation is somewhat onesided. but with the injunction provision remaining in the law and along with it a seizure provision. it does not seem to me there would be anything unfair. if the emergency is of sufficiently dangerous proportions to justify the injunction. a move to preserve the safety and health of the people of the united states should be made. i agree that an injunction. making people work. even for a period of 60 days. is some limitation on the freedom which i would defend. but it seems to me that with the two provisions in the law the employer would not be able to say. \"but there should not be seizure of my plant. that is unfair to me.\" i believe that if we face a national emergency the president should have power during 60 days to try to settle the dispute. i believe my amendment is a reasonable one. i believe it is equitable. i believe we can fairly say to labor. \"look. you must behave. but we also are going to put into the law the seizure provision to see that the employer behaves.\" that is a fair proposition. the law should be availed of only in case of greatest emergency. an emergency which justifies seizure as well as the injunction. both provisions are very limited. the injunction provided for is nothing like the old injunction which at one time was used in every labor dispute and put the federal courts into the business of regulating every strike. it is simply a measure to enforce the prohibition of the strike during the 60 days. likewise the seizure provided for is nothing like the seizure during the war. the government cannot step in. as it did upon one occasion. and negotiate with the employees. or make a new contract. or new terms. which are then fastened on the employer. the government cannot step in and deal with or for the employees. the status quo must be maintained for 60 days. and at the end of 60 days the government must step out. then is the time. if all efforts have failed. when congress may have to be called together. if at that time the people are in danger of starvation or death. there will be no remedy except a complete emergency law to deal with that particular strike and no otherthe kind of law which i would not want to see permanently on the statute books of the united states. so i believe we have here a perfectly reasonable amendment. i do not see how it can be logically opposed by senators who are saying in every other breath that the right of injunction is contained in their own proposals. the distinguished senator from utah admits. and the president claims. that under his bill there is the right of injunction. if he has the right of injunction. it is a very dangerous kind of right. it is one that could be used under any circumstances which the president might call a national emergency. it is a right which should be clearly defined. and we have the right clearly to define it. all those who claim that the right exists admit the right of congress to define it. so those who claim that there is such power of injunction should be for this amendment. because it limits the power of the president against labor. rather than extending it. the distinguished senator from illinois and other senators say. \"we are for seizure. because we think seizure implies an injunction.\" i do not think it does. i think their whole argument is incorrect. i do not believe that the united mine workers case says that when the government seizes a plant it can obtain an injunction. but if senators believe that the president can obtain an injunction under such circumstances. why do they oppose a measure which gives the president power to obtain an injunction and exercise the right of seizure at the beginning of the strike. instead of moving in and finding that the men have gone? frankly. under the united mine workers case. i do not see how the president can get an injunction. but senators have said that they think he can get an injunction. if they think so. why are they not in favor of having congress define and limit the injunctive power in accordance with the provisions of the taftsmithdonnell amendment?","mr. speaker. this week more than 700 delegates. representing postal employees from 44 states. are convening in washington. the national association of letter carriers wish to bring to the attention of congress the total inadequacy of their present wage and salary income to cover the inflationary high cost of living. today the postal employee on the beginners salary of $2.100 a year. finds that it is impossible to provide his family with the bare necessities of life. the members of congress realize how much the cost of living has skyrocketed in the last 18 months since price control was removed. in june 1946. the cost of living was then unreasonably high and up until that time the postal employees of this country had received but one salary raise in 23 years. the postal employees during the war. contributed greatly to americas victory. owing to depleted personnel who were called to the armed services. thousands of postal employees carried on the added burden of delivering the mail and other duties incident thereto. during the war rush period. they willingly worked overtime to a degree that impaired the health of a great number of postal employees. i think every member of congress who is familiar with the postal service in metropolitan areas. realizes that special consideration should be given toward increasing the salary in order to meet the present inflationary prices. legislation to increase retirement annuities which have not been increased since 1930 will also be considered by the convention this week. because of inadequacy of present retirement rates. thousands of carriers. clerks. and other postal employees are remaining in service despite their eligibility for pensions. should this be corrected. thousands of jobs will be opened for younger men who thus far have been unable to get into the service. the morale of employees in post offices throughout the country is running at a very low ebb and our postal service is not up to standard because of economic conditions under which so many postal employees are now struggling.","mr. chairman. i need not take 5 minutes unless there is some controversy or some questions to be asked. the committee felt it was absolutely necessary to bring in this bill. it is no reflection upon the valuable service of these gentlemen who served in temporary capacities. however. they were never separated from their civilian jobs and consequently were not. in our judgment. entitled to veterans preference. as the congress originally intended. we felt it was necessary to bring this bill before you. and it is here for your consideration. unless there are some questions. i yield back the remainder of my time. mr. chairman.","mr. chairman. i note in checking the action of the appropriations committee on the fish and wildlife service appropriations that they have again been very saving on funds for securing basic information. for biological investigations the bureau of the budget recommended $355.600. yet the committee voted out $237.975. only a slight increase over present funds. for investigations respecting food fishes the bureau of the budget recommended $765.000 and the committee granted $659.440. dr. gabrielson. former director of the service. has often told me that the research work of the service is basic to intelligent management. they need to know more about fish and animal populations each year. about disease. predators. and foods. about crippling losses in wildlife. winter death rates. and all of the things that go to make up this thing they call wildlife management. in some .places there is conflict between livestock and deer and elk that needs to be studied by trained biologists. in other spots they need to learn more about fish populations. the effects of stocking streams. how to improve fishing conditions. and so forth. all of these things are essential so the state and federal people who are hired to carry out the jobs can do so intelligently. the funds for this sort of work in both the fish and wildlife fields have been cut to the bone during the war. young men were in this field when war came and large numbers went into the armed forces. now they are returning to the jobs for which they were trained and there are not nearly enough funds in this bill to put them back to work. it seems a shame to force these welltrained biologists into other lines of work when there are so few of them in the country and when the need in this particular field is so great. i hope these funds will be restored. by unanimous consent. the pro forma amendments were withdrawn.","mr. speaker. later on. of course. i shall yield the usual 30 minutes to the gentleman from michigan and also yield 15 minutes to the gentleman from georgia [mr. cox]. mr. speaker. the resolution before us is not of my making. i have reported it and am calling it up for consideration only because i have been so directed by the committee on rules. it is one of the most vicious rules ever submitted to the house. and if it should be adopted it would come to plague the house for many years. the rule waives all points of order against any provision in the bill and against any amendment that may be offered by the committee on military affairs. which committee does not have original jurisdiction of labor legislation. the bill was reported by the committee on military affairs without the holding of any hearings. and no opportunity of a hearing was afforded to representatives of the a. f. of l.. the cio. railroadlabor organizations. the united mine workers. or to some of the sane industrialists and to those who desired to be heard in opposition to the drastic provisions of the bill. not only the rule but also the bill is vicious. it is before us because the arch enemies of labor are urging and forcing action. notwithstanding that every effort is being made by the president. congress. industry. and labor to bring about a peaceful adjustment of differences to the best interest of all and the country. personally. i urged and pleaded that no action be taken at this time on this illconsidered legislation. but the few gentlemen who are the opponents of organized labor have taken advantage of conditions which i know not only the country but they. themselves. later will deplore. the bill aims to restrict organized labor because. in the last presidential election campaign labor organizations became active in the interest of the people and their own interest. and supported president roosevelt and those candidates who were friendly to the new deal. to progress. and to labor. some of the unions made an assessment of $1 on its members to conduct an educational campaign and were extremely successful in their efforts and. if i recall correctly. collected approximately $340.000 throughout the united states. the bill before us aims to stop their activity in the future and restrict any assessment upon union members. even though the amount may be only $1. which would prevent them from enlightening the people and bringing home real truths and facts. oh. yes. mr. speaker. the bill would also restrict the banks and corporations from making assessments. but it does not restrict their officers. directors. or stockholders from contributing large sums of money to republican campaigns. it is generally known that the du ponts individually. and through their families. have contributed $200.000. or nearly as much as all the moneys collected by the unions. it is reported that the pews have contributed almost a halfmillion dollars to the coffers of a republican campaign fynd. and many others have similarly. directly and indirectly. contributed from $25.000. $50.000. and up to $100.000. but there is nothing in the bill which would preclude them from contributing to political campaigns. however. a majority of the members of the committee on military affairs considers it dangerous for a laboring man to contribute $1 for himself and family to a campaign fund and by their action in reporting this bill say it must be stopped. mr. speaker. the second vicious provision in the bill is section 4. which provides that if there should be a strike. or failure or refusal to work on the part of any union employees to work during the life of any collectivebargaining contract. the employer shall be relieved of any obligation and the labor organization of which the employees are members shall lose its status as a bargaining agency for a period of 1 year. further. such labor organization may be sued in its own name in any federal district court and shall be responsible for damages not to the employer but to any party injured as a result of the breach of the contract. this is a most farreaching provision and whereby nearly any person who in any manner may suffer inconvenience by reason of the stoppage of work or a strike may sue. the real purpose of this provision is to bankrupt and destroy every labor organization. mr. speaker. if sanity and reasoning judgment prevails. the rule will be defeated. as it properly should be. i now yield 30 minutes to the gentleman from michigan .","mr. president. i appeal for prompt action on the part of the senate to pass the joint resolution quickly. i have prepared another constitutional amendment. under which legislatures of the states. under the constitution. can call upon us here in washington to call a convention to put into effect the direct election of the president by the common people of this country. i shall be glad to send a copy of the measure to any citizen of this country who may desire a copy of it. with the urgent request that the people organize themselves into groups to get their legislators to adopt it. i believe that in a representative government the people should elect men in high offices. if the common people can be trusted to elect members of the legislature. governors. and other state officials. representatives. and senators. they can also be trusted to elect a president and vice president of this country. may god speed the day when. sitting in the white house. there will be a man or woman sent there directly by the people. one elected by the farmers. the laborers. and the small businessmenall the people of america. i hope the returning veterans will help in bringing about the passage of this proposed constitutional amendment. because unless we have a constitutional amendment of this kind. even the veterans. the men who now are sacrificing. will be deprived of the privilege of voting directly for the president of this country. mr. president. i repeat that i hope god may speed the day when. sitting in the white house. there will be a man or woman sent there directly by the people. one elected by the farmers. the workingmen. and the small businessmen. by the veterans of all the wars. by all the people of americaa real american sitting in the white house. not a representative of the monopolists. a real american who. as president. will not be antagonistic to any foreign country. who will not be the enemy of any other nation but the friend of them all. a real american who will appoint a cabinet made up of real americans. so that the people will have the kind of government which a great country like ours should havea government. mr. president. of the people. by the xc- 19 people. and for the people. which shall not perish from this earth.","mr. speaker. yesterday i introduced a bill providing an appropriation of $44.000.000 for the completion of the intracoastal waterway across florida. the purpose of this was to provide the eastern seaboard with the necessary fuels. i said i would have something more to say about that this week. mr. speaker. the most serious blow which the axis has struck at us is the dangerous impairment of our transportation system. by driving our coastwise and intracoastal travel from the seas. the enemy submarines have created a threat to the success of our arms which can only be exceeded by successful invasion of our territory. this was and is the principal mission of the german undersea warfare. and so far it has been successful. even beyond their expectations. in addition to this it has recently been announced over the air that the axis powers will probably put in service 700 submarines in the spring. the devastation wrought by these submarines is not even at its peak if this is true. the destruction of our coastwise transport has had the effect the enemy calculated it would have. and has set in train a series of internal difficulties which strike at the very root of our war effort and our capacity for carrying the war overseas. that we were unprepared and unable to meet this thrust is one of the tragic results of our failure to recognize the strategic necessity for developing a balanced system of transport. it should have been evident to all. but was clearly understood by too few. that the extent and nature of the physical geography of the united states automatically preclude sole reliance on rail transport. we have failed to build up and connect our inland waterway systems. we have lost our coastwise ocean transport. and now our overburdened railways are breaking down. the crisis is upon us. we are already too late with too little. by our failure we have fixed the limits of our war effort. the creeping paralysis of a failing transport has definitely set in. and unless we can arrest it. we must abandon our hopes for an early victory. first. among the already existing results of this failure of our transport system are acute and crippling gasoline shortages. especially in the east. this has multiplied and complicated our transport difficulty by reducing motor carriage of individuals to a dangerously uneconomic minimum. and overburdening the public urban and interurban facilities. and vastly diminishing truck transport via the highways. this is too well known to require elaboration but many of us do not yet clearly perceive the further results of this gasoline shortage. the manpower losses in hours due to the situation have been conservatively estimated to be more than 7 percent. no one who is cognizant of the general picture in industry fails to recognize this fact. and to regard it as equal to the loss of many divisions of our fighting men. something must be done about it. second. the second disastrous result of the failing of our transport has been the famine in fuel oil. all are aware of the cold homes. cold schools. and churches. the lowered efficiency of workers. and the tremendous dislocation in employment brought about by the industrial rationing of fuel oil. but relatively few are watching the death graphs for pneumonia and influenza. the increase in accidents and the very serious loss of man hours resulting. third. a third result of our deteriorating transport system is seen in certain food shortages already existing. sugar is an outstanding example. milk and butter production are similarly affected. new dairy development has been precluded and existing production diminished by lack of distribution and collection facilities. this is a brief outline of the situation as it exists. the petroleum coordinator. the director of defense transportation. and the director of the office of economic stabilization have told us that not only have they been unable to prevent these conditions. but that they are wholly unable to prevent the present situation developing into an even worse debacle next winter. it is easy to see why this is so. in the absence of any determined attempt to throw into the breach our potential inland water transportation facilities. not only will the deterioration of our rail equipment proceed at an accelerated pace. reducing the number of tonmiles of freight which it will be possible to move. but the african campaign has indicated clearly that the military policy of the united states will be to make shipments of petroleum and other supplies to the european theater direct from the east coast when -possible. only a little foresight makes plain that when a second front is opened in europe. as we expect it will be. the need for movement of petroleum and all supplies to the eastern seaboard will be vastly greater than it is now. congress appears to have substantially recognized and ratified the truth of these statements when it enacted last july public law 675. seventyseventh congress. providing for the connection of the gulf and mississippi waterway systems with the atlantic intracoastal system by the construction of a barge channel across northern florida. the act clearly stated that the authorization was made \"in order to promote the national defense. and to promptly facilitate and protect the transport of supplies needful to the military establishment.\" the urgency was so clearly recognized that the chief of engineers was authorized to employ temporary structures where necessary. the act was expressly an emergency war measure. nearly 7 months have elapsed and nothing further whatever has been done about it. either by congress or the administration. and we have driven headlong into a situation which continues to grow worse. the people will want to know why. there is not one single physical obstacle to bringing this relief to the people and our military forces within 10 months time. the equipment to build the project is available -and idle. the manpower offers no problem. the amount of material is inconsequential. and for the most part can be furnished locally. i have seen definite proposals from some of the largest and most responsible construction concerns in the country. offering to complete this job and to open it to travel next october. if it is begun immediately. plans have long since been developed by the army engineers and only an appropriation is required to begin the work forthwith. i am aware that views have been expressed to the effect that the construction of this project would require 31/2 years. i can understand how. under normal conditions. it would be possible to spread the construction over that length of time. but with all due respect to those holding these views. i submit that they are untenable in the light of these concrete proposals from construction people who are actually engaged in this kind of work and with a long record of achievement behind them. in fact. some of the engineers have confidentially stated that it could be built in 15 months if necessary. i just want to give youone example of what can be accomplished when we are faced with an emergency. when my committee was asked for an appropriation for the douglas dam in the necessity for a stepup they came to estimated it would take 18 months to build that dam. but when they were faced with a shortage of power and saw the necessity for a stepup they came to the conclusion that it can be done in 11 months. and i think they will do it in even less time than that. i concur with general summerall. former chief of staff of the united states army. in his statement made in a letter to the governors of all eastern states under date of january 17. he says: any statements to the contrary notwithstanding. it is possible to construct this connecting channel and to initiate barge traffic on a scale adequate to supply the entire petroleum needs of the eastern states without rationing within 10 months after the work is begun. * * * the responsibility for the delay and the resulting situation rests squarely in the lap of the government. * * * it is admitted by all that if this completed waterway were now in existence there would be no petroleum shortage in the east. no looming shadow of food and other vital supply shortages beginning to materialize. and no breakdown of our rail transport. * * * our transport must be maintained regardless of priorities. materials. or manpower. it is time for congress and the government to take a realistic view of the position. to cease to consider the nations arterial water transport in political and sectional terms. to look upon this work as the stark military necessity it is. and to think of construction in months instead of in years. bear in mind that this canal not only links up the oil fields of texas with the east. but connects almost every point in the mississippi valley with the atlantic seaboard. cargoes can move to philadelphia direct from points in missouri. iowa. illinois. arkansas. and other valley states. i do not think it is necessary at this time to argue the currently expressed judgment of congress embodied in this act. it takes only a glance at the map to satisfy the average man of the common sense of this legislation enacted last summer. in authorizing this project. and in the wording of the act. congress has declared in effect: first. the project is practicable. second. it is urgently necessary. third. it can be built in time to serve the situation. i desire to make clear that while the act provides particularly for transportation relief to the eastern seaboard and for the facilitation of transatlantic movement from eastern ports. it provides to an important degree. for the relief of the general transportation system in other portions of the country. the chief reason why there is a fueloil shortage in many of the mississippi valley states is the use of an enormous number of tank cars and railway facilities pressed into service for the haul to the seaboard. the opening of this continuous waterway would take out of this service practically all of these cars and make them available for their proper function of distributing petroleum products throughout the inland areas of the country. the chairman of the house committee on rivers and harbors and the chief of engineers have both stated that through the construction of this short connecting channel across northern florida the entire petroleum needs of the eastern seaboard can be supplied by through barge transport. i quote from house report no. 2153. seventyseventh congress. second session. in which the chairman of the committee states: the barge channel across florida authorized by this bill is the only proposal that can be made capable of supplying all the oll needs of the atlantic seaboard. in the absence of oceantanker service. aside from the absolute necessity of providing for this through barge transport. the congress can practice no more wise economy than by immediately providing the funds for construction. when the tremendous difference between the cost of barge transport and rail transport to the eastern seaboard is considered. and it is remembered that the federal treasury is now expending more than $1.000.000 a day to subsidize this transportation by rail. it will be seen that the project would pay for itself in less than 40 days time and would permanently relieve the taxpayers throughout the country of a burden now amounting to more than $300.000.000 a year and which bids fair to continue as long as this war lasts. for those who may not have a clear picture of the physical situation in mind. i want to again -point out that there exists today a completed waterway over which barges may now travel from corpus christi. tex.. to trenton. n. j.. except for a small connecting channel across northern florida. the length of which is only 31/2 percent of the total length of the waterway. and the absence of which interposes an absolute barrier to the use of this system upon which we have spent tens of millions of dollars. on yesterday i introduced a bill appropriating $44.000.000 for the completion of this intracoastal waterway. i sincerely feel that it is not only for the best interest of the military establishment but also for the civilian population of the atlantic seaboard and every citizen of this nation that this appropriation be approved and the construction of this project be begun at the earliest possible date. i hope the committee to which this bill is referred will give it its present consideration.","mr. president. i present and ask to have printed in the record. without all the signatures attached thereto. and appropriately referred a petition regarding labor and the conduct of the war. signed by mr. e. h. pugh and 93 other citizens of independence. kans.","mr. speaker. i have before me a copy of the washington post of today. friday. june 13. 1941. which contains the following headlines: armed with names. united states moves to cleanse unions of communists. second aluminum strike leader an exconvict. dies termed these leaders of c. i. 0. \"red.\" united states orders auto firms not to raise prices. mr. speaker. i commend the united states government for this. but i have not yet seen any move to cleanse the government itself of the six or eight hundred communists said to occupy positions therein. neither have i heard of the government telling these subversive \"reds\" to lower their money demands when it comes to raising the price of labor as it has done the automobile business. and i hope this will be one of the next one of their moves. i am sure. if the government does these two things. the house of representatives will back it all the way.","that is a different situation. only five states are granting actual tax reductions for \"merit rating\" at the present time. i know in my state we have refused to grant it. because it is not fair to the rest of industry. especially small business. which cannot regularize employment. the taxes collected by the states are utilized for the purpose of taking care of the unfortunate unemployed. what they have been doing as the funds have accumulated is this: they recognize that we are not paying adequate unemployment payments. they are very small. they are going to be larger. let me say. year by year. they are going to be increased. these states are increasing their benefit allowances. they are increasing not always the amount per week. but they are increasing the length of period. and shortening the waiting period. and doing other things which we are doing here. we are providing for a carryover. where an employee is entitled to. say. 100 days. and he has exhausted 50 days. we allow him to carry the other 50 days over to the next unemployment year for him. so that in that particular following year he will get an increased sum. the senator spoke of \"maximum.\" i am now talking about averages. the average payment in the united states per worker per week under the state insurance funds is $10.19 per week. and under our federal railroad unemployment fund it is $7 per week. it cannot be said that we are treating our workers as fairly as the states doand those states are not altogether prosperous either. the senator said this bill should not be here. i am not ashamed of it. i have been trying for a long while to bring a better day to those who are more unfortunate than you and i. we are talking about giving a dollar or two or three or four dollars a week to a worker who is unemployed. that is the \"outrageous\" thing we are doing here. but on the contrary it is said we must save the railroads this $20.000.000. or perhaps $40.000.000 per year. by reducing the tax to 2 or 1 percent. it is argued we have to treat railroads differently from any other industry in the country. i hope the time will come when we can reduce the tax. i hope the time will come soon. and it is coming sometime. when we will solve this question of unemployment. when we will not need to raise any money for unemployment insurance. but as long as unemployment is here we must treat the unemployed worker fairly. we are giving him little enough. do not take it out of him. if we are to give a subsidy to the railroads. let us make it a general assessment. and not an assessment only on the unemployed workers. the senator from vermont [mr. austini said something about the $100.000.000 reserve. he was waxing oratorical at the time. and i am not sure that i correctly understood him. he said that the $100.000.000 will never again be transferred. that it is here once and for all. of course it is. the $100.000.000 arises in this way: in 1935. when we passed the social security act. the railroad employees were included among other employees of the country. and they were to be cared for from state funds. the law went into effect in 1936. in many of the states it was discovered that there were great discrepancies in the treatment of railroad workers. some who were insured in one state were receiving much smaller benefits than those insured in another state. there was also constant conflict as to whether an employee was really working in one state or in an adjoining state. because. of course. they were all engaged in interstate commerce. in addition. large sums accumulated in the reserves. swelled by the tax contributions of the railroads. that is how the $100.000.000 came about. we said to the states. \"you received this money. you are not to utilize it now. you do not have to pay unemployed railway workers. because we shall take care of them nationally. so give us back the balance of the money which the railroads paid into the funds of the states.\" that money was transferred to the federal fund under the federal law. it is no different from the money which we are now collecting under the federal system. that accounts for the $100.000.000. at the end of this year we shall have $65.000.000 more. so we shall have $165.000.000. and i think it is a fairly safe prediction that all we shall use in benefits will be about $25.000.000. so we shall on the average use less than the receipts and we shall have an ever larger fund. the\"senator made another statement. i cannot believe he meant it. he said that what we are doing after 1 year is threatening the fund. what are we doing with the fund? we are holding it intact. we say. \"you may not reduce it to $100.000.000. you must keep it all here. because we may have a bad year and we may want a little more money.\" the senator is the one who is threatening the fund. because he proposes that after $100.000.000 is accumulated the receipts shall be reduced by onethird. and if the fund gets to $125.000.000 receipts are cut by twothirds. we say. \"no. we will not threaten the fund to that extent. we cannot say that $100.000.000 or $125.000.000 will always be enough. and we propose to keep a good large sum.\" we propose to keep $165.000.000. $170.000.000. or perhaps $200.000.000. the time may come when perhaps we ought to readjust matters. the senator from maryland put it very plainly. we have this accumulated fund. which the railroads have paid in taxes. just as every other industry in the country has paid. when we enacted the law we recognized. as the debates will show. that the benefits were inadequate. the representatives of the railroad workers thought they were inadequate. but we were told that on a 3percent tax larger sums could not be paid. of course. the benefits are inadequate. the waiting period is too long. the number of days of payment is too short. but we were told that we could do nothinj about it. because the fund would be made unsound. and this is a contributory system. an insurance system. however. experience has shown that we were wrong. all that we propose to do by this bill is to pay. not a decent sumit is pitiably inadequatebut something more than we are now paying. the senator says that this is unworthy legislation. i do not think he should so characterize it. i introduced it at the unanimous request of the brotherhoods. every worker in the industry was represented on the committee which drafted the bill and asked me to introduce it. the railroad retirement board. which has on it a member representing the railroads. unanimously said that it was fair legislation. the workers are inadequately compensated. and the bill will give them a chance to receive just a little more. unworthy? then every worker on the railroads is unworthy. and we who are trying to build as best we can a better day for the average worker. the common man. are unworthy. that is all the bill does.","career was studded with one paradox after another. with a wealth of human learning and experience. and with achievements in several fields of high endeavor. he was born on a farm in the state of michigan. he died as a citizen of new york. the largest city in the world. educated in medicine. he became an outstanding physician. a noted teacher. a renowned statesman. he began his political life in his native state of michigan. where he was elected mayor of ann arbor. his career came to a close in this chamber as a senator from the nations empire state. he was a pillar in his church. a college dean. a park commissioner. a board of education president. a mayor. a health commissioner. and a united states senator. these varied activities gave him a broad range of training. and accounted for the depth of his fund of knowledge. his ability. his perseverance. and his natural brilliance are attested to by his rise to fame in the profession of his choosing. he began practicing medicine in 1895 at bay city. mich.. and by 1918 he had become a national figure in the medical world as he began his creditable record as commissioner of health of new york city. his political rise to distinction was just as phenomenal and was actuated by the same earnest effort which characterized his devotion to every task to which he applied himself. senator copeland served powerfully in this body. and it is not for me even to try to record the extent of his legislative genius or the influence which he exerted in the passage of legislation to which he was particularly devoted. the most important chapter in his legislative record was successfully written when his food and drug bill became law. he seized upon this subject because it was near to him and because he had a consuming ambition to protect by law the health of millions of persons from misbranded. falsely advertised. and at times injurious food and drug products. he labored over each and every section of that humanitarian law. he lent every ounce of his energy and enthusiasm to its passage. he was directly and. in most respects. individually responsible for this statute which today serves humanity so beneficially. he rightfully considered this his greatest legislative victory. and without question it was his crowning achievement in the interests of humankind. he served as chairman of the committee on rules. as chairman of the committee on commerce. and as chairman of several special senate investigating committees. including the special committee to investigate crime throughout the nation. the special committee to investigate subversive influences in the american merchant marine. and the special committee to investigate the causes of the morro castle and mohawk ship disasters. in the merchant marine field senator copeland sponsored numerous laws beneficial to the seamen. and time and again he pleaded their cause before this body. he was the*author of the merchant marine act. which set up the present maritime commission. he lent powerful influence to aviation legislation. notably the law to set up the civil aeronautics authority. he was a relentless foe of the criminal. and just last year successfully piloted the socalled firearms bill to enactment. he sponsored the flood control act of national importance. and he endeared himself to the citizens of the district of columbia by his annual efforts to promote improved civic. educational. health. and park facilities for the nations capital. i have touched but lightly upon his legislative accomplishments. but to the laborer. the farmer. the seaman. the veteran. and to many other groups he shall forever remin in memory a real and true friend. the advancement of their hopes and aspirations was always uppermost in his mind. he died serving them as a member of nine conference committees in the closing hours of a long and grueling session of congress. he felt those duties to be obligations he must not shirk. the burdens proved too great for his tired and overtaxed body. his contributions as a lawmaker. like his services in the field of medicine. improved the living standards of the poorthey enriched the republic he served so well. ordinary folk simply call royal s. copeland a great man. and i presume no epitaph could express our thoughts more genuinely. as such he shall always remain in our hearts.","mr. president. i submit that the record of these hearings absolutely and conclusively establishes the success of the governments spending program. it conclusively proves that. as a result of the government spending. prosperity was returning by leaps and bounds. and would have continued had it not been for the failure of industry to exercise sound economic judgment and moderation in the matter of prices. it seems clear from the record. and i think it is now admitted by most of the leading economists of the country that the present recession is chargeable primarily to this failure of industry to exercise restraint in its quest for profits. that is the simple. unvarnished truth. even leonard p. ayres. the wellknown economistbanker of cleveland. ohio. a spokesman for the financial interests who certainly is not biased in this matter. concedes that it was the unbalanced price situation which caused the recession. he said (p. 354. unemployment and relief hearings): in 1936 and in the early part of 1937 business was active and. in the main. increasingly so. prices were advancing rapidly. businessmen increased their inventories. and. in view of the sustaining demand for the goods that they made. or in which they dealt. they made commitments further ahead than they normally had made. or would make. probably it is true that they were actuated in doing this by the strong demand which. perhaps. was in no small degree accentuated by the large bonus payments. again. he said: last spring there were many warnings about prices rising too far and too fast. it appears that when these inventories were filled. business began to drop off. and pretty soon there was a sharp and sudden curtailment in production. unemployment began to develop. a recession thus started has cumulative effects. men thrown out of work buy less and hence cause trade and industry to produce and sell still less. and this. in turn. throws more men out of work. and so on. the undisputed fact is that industry had been overanxious for profit and simply priced itself out of business and the country into a recession. it failed to cooperate in the national program of recovery. thereby contributing to its own distress and injury. as well as bringing renewed misery to the country in the way of increased unemployment. there seems to be general agreement by economists that lack of purchasing power among the masses of the people is due to excessive prices to consumers and low earnings of workers and producers. our system of mass production can be maintained only by balancing it with mass purchasing power in the hands of the people. when prices of commodities get out of balance with the earning power of the people we have depressions. so we find that as a result of the folly of industry. and its anxiety for profits. we are in the throes of another serious unemployment crisis. never before in our national history have we had to face unemployment conditions of such duration and magnitude as we have been experiencing since 1929. the misery and the destitution of unemployment. once the concern of a few. now worry the nation. concerns that were once relegated to a few philanthropists are now bedeviling every public servant. every taxpayer. and every soberminded citizen of the country. this is no time for name calling. bitter attacks on either side of the controversy serve no purpose. and settle none of our serious national problems. they have become tiresome and irritating to intelligent citizens who have regard for the seriousness of the situation confronting the country. confidence in the government. in congress. and in american institutions is not encouraged by this vulgar competition in rough phrases. i have no patience with persons who bitterly assail president roosevelt and attempt to deceive and befuddle the minds of the people. the truth of the matter is that the program of president roosevelt for economic reform has saved our capitalistic system thus far. and in saving capitalism it has saved democracy. the problem of unemployment which confronts the nation today. and which results from the evils i have discussed. must be intelligently considered and solved if our economic system is to continue. there are no new frontiers in the nation to open up. there is no new land for the homeless and the unemployed. the new frontier today is at the door of every home in the nation. the problem is: can the ordinary american rediscover opportunity in our new pattern of life? that is the problem which must be solved. and i believe it must be solved by the business leaders of the country. the people. as workers and consumers. cannot solve it unaided. if we are to maintain our capitalistic sys.tem. the business and industrial leaders of the nation must end this dishonest and indefensible attitude and go to work with the administration before it is too late. many of our most intelligent businessmen have already recognized these selfevident truths. a number of them appeared before our committee and candidly acknowledged the lack of reason and justice in the assaults on the administration. in previous hard times. industry expected the less fortunate to tighten their belts and go through the wringer. but now it is found that men will no longer starve quietly. and that the old leadership means both colossal taxes and possible social upheaval. it is now clearly dawning on the people of the country that markets for goods must be created by raising the living standards and the consuming power of the population. by raising up the submerged portion of our population. the illfed. illhoused. and illclothed. industry must come to realize that it can be saved only by benefiting and improving the condition of the workers. and not by exploiting them. there is no profit in production if there is no market ih which to sell. thus. a fair division of the profits of industry is not merely a humanitarian proposition. but it is necessary in order to assure any profits at all. what we need now is cooperation of all the groups which make up our economic system. it is to be hoped that businessmen as a class will use their best brains in the interest of society as a whole. unless we can.provide the people of the country with increased means to buy the things they need. our massproduction system must fail. in the face of these indisputable facts. there is absolutely no basis for the contention that the government made a failure of its pumppriming theory. as a result of the conditions which have developed. and which are rapidly growing worse. it becomes necessary again to resume public spending. the recovery measure before the senate is the only solution of our difficulties. it is the only manner in which industry can again be stimulated. the only criticism that can be offered is that we have delayed a trifle long in presenting it. the necessity for priming the pump of business through public spending rests upon the tragic fact that once the spiral of declining business is set in motion. either by accidental factors or by the deliberate greed for profit. there is no force strong enough to arrest the movement of recession except the active intervention of the government. when. as at present. we cannot rely upon the fall in wages. in prices. and in interest rates to encourage private investment. when the decline in business activity itself creates such a surplus of productive capacity. and inventories pile up through the failure of demand. it is futile to hope that automatic forces will stop the decline and initiate a movement for recovery. when such a situation arises. the government must do what private business has failed to do. it must put purchasing power into circulation and thereby simultaneously lift the level of production. and create possibilities for new private investment. when a sufficient reemployment of the existing industrial capacity has been achieved. private orders for replacement and new investment will start up again. and the need for government intervention will diminish.","mr. chairman. the measure now under consideration is ostensibly designed to aid agriculture but will do the very opposite insofar as minnesota and other dairying states are concerned. in short. the operation of this legislation will destroy dairying in the north and transfer it to the south. why do i say that? well. let us examine into some of its provisions. the bill provides for taking out of production 5.000.000 acres of cotton land. which are to be put into grasses and legumes. there is nothing in the measure to compel the growers of these legume crops to plow them under. so we must assume that they will be harvested and fed to livestock. let us see how this will work out: 5.000.000 acres planted to alfalfa should produce as a very minimum 15.000.000 tons. which is sufficient to winter at least seven and onehalf million dairy cows. as they have practically no winter in the cotton belt. these seven and onehalf million cows. on an average. should each produce 250 pounds of butter per annum. which would make a total of 1.875.000.000 pounds of butter. and also about 5.000.000 calves. when we stop to consider that the total consumption of butter in this country was only 2.121.389.000 pounds in 1936. it can readily be appreciated that the operation that i have just described would absolutely destroy the dairying industry in all northern states with the possible exception of the milksheds in the northeastern states. minnesota. wisconsin. and other dairying states cannot possibly compete with the south in butter production because of the advantages that the south enjoys in climatic and labor conditions. the south has practically no winter. and labor is altogether too cheap. what would happen to the dairy industry if the domestic butter supply were suddenly increased by 88 percent? it would absolutely destroy the industry in the north. because it would force the price down to such ruinous levels that the northern dairyman could not possibly meet them. in short. it would knock the bottom out of prices and convert the butter market from a buyers to a sellers market. let me ask you gentlemen from the beefproducing states what would happen if these grasses were converted into beef? my friends. the picture that i have just painted is a very real one. and i present it for your consideration in the hope that suitable amendments may be adopted that will guard our section of the country against such a catastrophe. another purpose in presenting this situation is to show what a delicate subject we are dealing with and how easy it would be for us to pass legislation that would absolutely destroy the equilibrium of production that now exists between the north and the south. as well as to badly upset prices. the measure under consideration deals with wheat. corn. rice. and tobacco. but it practically ignores all other lines of farm production. take eggs. for instance: in 1935 we produced about two and onehalf billion dozen eggs. having a total market value of $581.575.000. eggs in minnesota are bringing from 18 to 20 cents for no. 1 grade. which is less than cost of production. it is my information that this low price is largely due to short selling of eggs and to imports from china. anyone familiar with the poultry industry knows that eggs cannot be produced profitably at prevailing prices during the winter months. when the flocks must be fed. why was not a provision written into this bill to prohibit the short selling of eggs? was it an oversight? it will be noted that rice is included among the commodities covered by this bill. and yet in 1935 we only produced 38.784.000 bushels of rice. which brought an average price of 77.1 cents per bushel. or a total value of $29.898.000. this year we produced 52.000.000 bushels of rye. with a total value in excess of $40.000.000. why should not rye be included in this legislation? it is a very important crop in a number of northwestern states. it cannot be that rye was left out because it is a northern crop and rice included because it is a southern crop. i do not want to believe that this bill was drawn along sectional lines. and yet what can we believe in view of the failure of the committee to include rye and other crops? it should be needless for me to say that i am in hearty sympathy with the general aims of this legislation. i believe that if we are to have farmrelief legislation we must have some sort of reasonable control of production. but the farmers that i have talked with are opposed to compulsory control. and their sentiment is reflected in the attitude taken by the american farm bureau. the grange. the farmers union. and other farm organizations. all of whom are opposed to the bill in its present form. we have been muddling with farm legislation for almost 20 years. and the average farmer is more deeply in debt today than when we started. i am in sympathy with the idea of an evernormalgranary plan because it would tend to equalize over a period of years the price received by the producer and the price paid by the consumer. that is an objective that we should strive for. any farm bill to be effective must give consideration to all sections of the country and to all lines of agricultural activities. the bill in its present form fails to do this. we are not going to solve the farm problem by setting up an expensive and cumbersome machine that will merely give jobs to a lot of snoopers. we had a taste of this government snooping during the war. when government men were going from farm to farm to see that none were holding back wheat. we got our fill at that time. and we do not want any more of it. i do not see how we can do anything to help the american farmer secure better prices for his products so long as we permit the foreign farmer to ship the products of his farm in here to be sold in competition with domestically grown crops. a few days ago i made some observations on this subject and at that time inserted in the record a table showing the enormous imports of competitive agricultural commodities. which showed that during the last fiscal year ending june 30 we imported $868.000.000 worth of cattle. meats. butter. cheese. eggs. wool. barley. corn. wheat. barley malt. and vegetable oils. all of which came in direct competition with domestically produced crops. as i see it. one of the prime requisites to agricultural recovery and prosperity is to give the american farmer the american market and i am going to support the andresen amendment. which will prohibit importation of agricultural products into the united states where the landed cost of such products plus the tariff duties are lower than the domestic cost of production. i am surprised that this amendment was rejected by the committee on agriculture because it is so necessary to our national prosperity. is this measure one for crop control or is it primarily designed to conserve the soil? there seems to be a disagreement among its proponents on this score. however. i am willing to take the view that its objective is primarily to control production with a view to maintaining price levels that will give the grower cost of production plus a fair profit. i hope that the bill can be amended so as to achieve this objective. mr. chairman. if the bill as it now reads comes to a vote. i shall vote against it as being a piece of fallacious legislation. i yield back the balance of my time.","mr. speaker. under leave to extend my remarks in the record. i include the following address delivered by me before the thirtieth annual grant dinner commemorating the birth of ulysses s. grant. held by the unconditionalcapitol city republican club and the young mens republican club of albany. n. y.. on april 28: little persuasion was needed for me to accept your invitation to participate in this gathering. two impelling reasons caused me to readily consent. i am especially pleased to be with you tonight because you represent that organization formed over three score years ago to advance the election of grant as president of the united states. who -was to fulfill in a large measure the principles of liberty and equality voiced by the founder of our party. abraham lincoln. in this day of such uncertainty for the future of our country. today when there are those who for base. selfish. and political purposes would seek to arouse the hatred of class against class. today when there are some who would violate the sanctity of personal liberty and security. today when there are some who would flaunt the flag of communism and fascism in the face of real americanism. who would by governmental edict seek to direct and control the lives and activities of all of our citizens. who would usurp unto themselves the legislative powers of the representatives of the people. and who would devitalize our highest court which is and has been the guardian of the rights of our people today. when there are those who would seek to tear down and destroy those fundamentals of our constitution that have made us a prosperous. a happy. and a secure people. it is a source of real inspiration to find that the young people of america. and more especially the young republicans are as active and vigorous in their determination that the principles of lincoln and grant should be carried forward and made more secure as were your predecessors in their zeal for the election of grant himself. i am proud to be with such an organization. it has strengthened my own confidence in our future welfare. my further reason for quickly accepting your invitation is the opportunity it afforded me to revisit the scenes where i once studied law and learned something about our constitution. it was here that i first learned of our three branches of governmentexecutive. legislative. and judicial--and that each of them had very positive. but limited powers. here. too. did i learn of the inviolable right of a person to be secure in his person. his house. papers. and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures. in this city did i become impressed with the right of our people to worship freely. to speak freely. and to write freely. and again. it was here that i was taught the mechanics of amending our constitution. of the very definite and positive way in which it is to be changed if circumstances indicate that a change is needed. in the past few years. having witnessed at first hand the open violation by the democratic administration of these fundamentals of our basic law. principles which my father and my forefathers have enjoyed throughout the existence of our nation. i have become more convinced than ever before that these are the groundwork of the success and happiness of our people and am unwilling that they should continue to be so openly and flagrantly desecrated without some effort on my part and the part of other young people of the country to stem the tide of rising socialism. and so. it is good to be in albany again. to revisit the scenes of my legal training. and to again become imbued with the spirit that animated the founders of this republic when they met in solemn sessions to formulate the constitution. being somewhat youthful myself. i feel that perhaps it is not presumptious for me to speak in behalf of millions of young persons of the country. who of late. like myself. have become somewhat bewildered by the political tenets which we have heard mouthed so frequently. we have heard a good deal of the evils of the old order. of the reaction of the \"old guard\". and of the failure of our system to properly and fully safeguard the rights of our people. we have heard much about the elysian fields of the new deal. of the \"more abundant life\" that is assured to each of us. of the \"planned economy\" that a beneficent government is going to prepare for us and of the \"social rights\" of mankind. those who would seek to offer honest criticism of many of the nostrums of the new deal and conscientiously oppose the extravagant spending orgy of the administration are named \"tories\". \"reactionaries\". or \"backers of bloated bondholders.\" on the other hand. those who are most active and outspoken in behalf of this socalled new order are hailed as being divinely inspired. as a moses leading the children of israel out of the wilderness. and the liberator of humanity from the \"shackles of entrenched greed.\" with all these epithets and encomiums being hurled about us. it is small wonder that the youth of the country. having faith as it does in its fellow man and wanting to believe the things that it is told. is bewildered. confused. and at loss to know which to believe and which to discredit. young america has no delusions about either the old deal or the new deal. those who are honest with themselves. must admit that there have been grave abuses of public trust in the past. that the government did not as fully take steps to protect the rights and interests of the common person as it might have. true. there were some instances in which the old order might have done better. but that does not mean that the whole american system. which is interwoven as an integral part of the old order. must be relegated into the discard and completely cast aside for this new concept of society that has swept europe in recent years and has likewise become a component part of the new deal. we are quite willing that the abuses of the past might be corrected. but we are entirely unwilling that their correction should be brought about at the expense of losing our heritage as american citizens. we do not ask that the hands of the clock be turned backward. but. much as we disapprove of the laissez faire of past days. we would greatly prefer it to the dark days of the medieval ages toward which this administration is rapidly and surely leading us. when man was but a puppet of the state. directed and controlled in all of his commonplace activities by edicts of the crown. paying annual tribute at exorbitant rates to his overlord for the privilege of a bushel of grain and a hovel in which to sleep. what is the basis of the charge against the republican party that it is dominated by the \"old guard\" and that it is the party of reaction? no one will deny that there are a few persons who have been dominant behind the scenes of our partys affairs for a great many years and who in a large degree are responsible for those failures of our party to fulfill the expectations of our votera in recent years. i speak of those who do not hold public office. but who. under cover of darkness and behind closed doors. gather for the selection of candidates and formulation of party principles. to me they are the \"old guard\". and the sooner they realize that their presence is no longer needed or wanted. the better it will be for the welfare of the republican party and of the nation. it is not necessary to name names. they know themselves and should be ready to step aside while it can be done gracefully. but simply because a person is old and has been a republican for a great many years and has been prominent in public affairs does not mean that he is a reactionary. of course. my field in politics has been limited. but i can truthfully say that the republican members of congress who are to my mind conservative to the degree of reaction can be counted on a single finger of a single hand. there may be instances in other legislative bodies and other public offices of persons of our party who are blind to progress. i do not know of them and certainly would not attempt to justify them. as the youngest republican in congress and. but one. the youngest of the entire membership. i am proud to accept as my leader there bsaamn h. snell. who has sat in the halls of congress for over a score of years. rendering invaluable service to his party and the nation. fighting with vigor and determination only those measures of the new deal that he believes to be obnoxious to americanism. surely it cannot be said that he is a reactionary or a tory or blind to progress. nor can it be said that he is deaf to the ideas of youth or to their participation in our partys councils. and in this i speak from experience. never have i gone to him with a problem that confronted me but that he gave me the full benefit of his advice and experience. never have i asked consideration from him but that he gave it to me without hesitation if he was able. never has a conference of our party members been called but that the young members were included and given an opportunity to express themselves. and never have any of us been told how to vote. so far as i am concerned. i have no quarrel with the elder republicans. i realize that we need the benefit of their experience. of their ability and counsel. just as i am convinced that if the republican party is to be successful there must be no failure or refusal to recognize the reasonable desires of the young republican or resentment of his presence in the party conclaves. there is room for both the old and the young. there is a crying need for the presence of both in the management of our partys affairs. and unless cooperation between the two can be accomplished the future of the republican party is doomed. the real difference between the republican party and the democratic party of today. as i see it. was very tersely spoken by the president in his baltimore speech of 2 weeks ago when. in speak. ing of the loss by youth of its enthusiasm and ideals as it grows older. he said. \"that is one reason why the world into which they go gets better so slowly.\" in all the history of the world there has been but one individual who. in the space of 3 youthful years was able to revolutionize the entire land in its moral and social concepts and even then the process of spreading the word of the nazarene was long. protracted. and arduous. and even in this day. nearly 2.000 years since. the struggle for the existence of christianity still goes on. centuries were required to liberate man from the economic serfdom of the dark ages. gradually culminating in the formation of the republic and the conception of our constitution embodying the rights of the common man against autocracy either of government or of wealth. the world has gotten better slowly. but for the very reason of its slowness the betterment has become certain and more secure and will remain secure if the youth and persons of all ages will hold fast to the fundamentals of freedom and refuse to be carried away by the nostrums of those whose regard of themselves is a blasphemy of the man of galilee. how is the enthusiasm of youth to attain quickly its ideals? no plan is offered to us that will not destroy our fundamental concepts of society. the counterpart of the chief executive. in speaking before the students of new york university a few days ago said. \"the answer of the old school of economics isnt the one. there must be something else. im not here today to tell you what those changes will be because i dont know.\" quite characteristic of the whole new deal are those words. \"something is wrong with the system. we dont know what it is so we will discard the whole thing and try something new. something that we are not sure of but at least it is something different from what you have had.\" before we are ready to take something new we want to know that that something is going to leave us better than we were before. we do not want to experiment with ourselves or with the lives of our children. we want to be sure. and therein is the general policy of the republican party now and throughout its history. it has not been blind to progress. in its conservatism it has waited until the new idea has been thoroughy discussed. completely understood. with the common conclusion that the remedy is sound. before it has taken the step. i am sure that the conservatism of our party. its caution and unwillingness to rush into unknown and untried ventures. no matter how romantic or idealistic they may have seemed. has been largely responsible for the prosperous history of our country and our people. we have no disagreement with the objectives of the president. we. too. would forever banish unemployment. want in reclining years. low wages. unhealthful working and living conditions. our difference lies not in the objective but in the means of obtaining it. many of us honestly are convinced that the policies of the past 3 years will defeat the very objectives we seek. that they will produce a less rather than a more abundant life. that honest business does not have a fair chance when government goes into competition with it or seeks to control it. there can be no social security without economic. business. industrial. and financial security. and we now have none of them. in any fair appraisal of the new deal it must be regarded not in the light of what it is now. but what it would have been had it not been for the supreme court. we must not quickly forget the n. r. a. and the a. a. a.. through which the president sought to impose his revolution upon society. these are but two of the prominent vehicles of the new deal. there are many others that are quietly carrying out their socialistic programs. and so. when young america looks at the new deal in its entirety. there is little in it that appeals to any of us who seek to achieve for ourselves the security of the average man. strip it of its nice words and beautiful phrases and there will be found little to attract the young man whose goal in life is to have a job. a home. and a family. to save his earnings for the education of his children and for the care of himself in his old age. to perhaps rise above the level of his fellow worker if his ability. his ambition. and his enterprise will permit him to be carried to greater heights. the president very appropriately voiced the enthusiasm and ideals of youth when he said at baltimore. \"your objective is an opportunity to make an honest living. a reasonable chance to improve your condition in life as you grow older. a practical assurance against want and suffering in your old age. and with it all the right to participate in the finer things of lifegood health. clean amusement. and a part in the satisfactions of the arts. the sciences. and religion.\" no one can take exception to that statement. that is just what we do want. certainly living off our government at subsistence wages of $44 per month will not give it to us. certainly we cannot \"improve our condition in life\" if. as laborers. we are to be told the amount of our wages. the hours that we are to work. and that our chance of promotion is slight. or. as farmers. we are told where and what we are to sow and when and for how much we are to reap and sell our crops. certainly we cannot \"assure ourselves against want and suffering in our old age\" if. as businessmen. we have the fingers of government continuously about our throat and are taxed to the breaking point to support the wanton. reckless. and profligate spending that all these experiments are costing. certainly there is little incentive for any of us to work hard and to be thrifty. to make an honest living. when we are told that one out of every six persons in the country is in the employ of some government and that we are supporting them to the extent of 25 cents of every dollar that we earn. jobs are what we want. and not relief nor governmental paternalism. we know that industry cannot employ us so long as its activities are circumscribed by the strangle hold of an autocratic government and its lifeblood sapped by the exactions of a spendthrift but greedy rulership. it is only through private business that we can hope to get the kind of a job that will give us the things we want. but private employers. already burdened and restricted with handicaps of the new deal legislation. are justly fearful of what new restraints may be placed upon them by this","mr. speaker. since the beginning of this session of congress i have favored the passage of an adequate bill guaranteeing the right of labor to organize and bargain collectively. and wiping out the inequalities in bargaining power between the employer and employee. i believe that the wagnerconnery labordisputes bill. which has been favorably reported by the house labor committee. upon which i have had the privilege of serving. will do much to accomplish these purposes and to prevent industrial unrest. i am heartily in favor of its passage now by the house and am opposed to amendments which will hamstring its enforcement. this bill strengthens the guaranties to labor of the right to organize and bargain collectively. as originally provided in the national industrial recovery act. by this legislation we state clearly thatemployees shall have the right to selforganization. to form. join. or assist labor organizations. to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing. and to engage in concerted activities. for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection. the bill further defines these rights by prohibiting the following unfair labor practices on the part of the employers: first. restraint or coercion of employees in the exercise of their rights to organize and bargain under the section quoted above. second. domination or interferences with the formation or administration or contribution of financial or other support to labor organizations. third. discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in labor organization. \"a reservation is made of the right of the employers and employees to make voluntary contracts to operate under a unionshop agreement.\" fourth. discharge or other discrimination against an employee because he has filed charges or given testimony under this law. fifth. refusal to bargain collectively with the representatives of the employees. who are selected by a majority vote. in respect to rates of pay. wages. hours of employment. and other conditions of employment. employees other than the designated representatives. individually or otherwise. may present grievances. the principal objection to the bill has been to this section defining unfair trade practices. the chief misrepresentations relative to these provisions alleged that they compel closedshop conditions. a careful analysis of this bill will show. however. that there is no requirement by governmental regulation that shops be unionized. but merely a guarantee of the right of the workers. however organized. to determine by a majority vote who shall represent them in negotiations on rates of pay. wages. hours of employment. and other conditions. the closed shop may be established only in those cases where the employer and employee voluntarily operate on this basis. the bill provides further for creation of a national labor relations board. a quasijudicial group with three members. which is given authority to investigate industrial disputes. discrimination. and other violations of the law. if. after proper notice and hearings. the board finds that any concern has been engaging in any of the unfair labor practices listed. it has authority to issue orders prohibiting such violation of the law and may take affirmative action to enforce its orders. it may order reinstatement of employees unfairly treated in violation of the law. with or without back pay. penalties are provided for failure to observe the law. and provision is made for enforcement through the courts. many of the legal technicalities are waived in connection with the procedure of the board. and representatives of the board are authorized to hear disputes in various parts of the country. so it is unnecessary for a worker to journey to washington to present his case. as indicated in the preamble of the bill. this legislation is necessary to equalize the rights and privileges of workingmen and their employers by removing the inequalities in bargaining power. it also aims to give the worker full freedom of association with a view and for the purpose of securing an agreement on any matter in dispute in the relationships of the employer and the employee. since the great expansion of our industrial system. the laborer has become only a small cog in the vast industrial machinery. and an attempt is made here to preserve his right to stand on an equal footing with the employer in making a contract for the sale of his services and regulating the conditions under which he works. i urge the enactment of this bill by the house. while those of us who favor the bill are very hopeful that it will accomplish all the purposes intended. its success will depend upon the character of the members of the board appointed by the president and the thoroughness and firmness with which they administer the act.","the joint resolution will be .passed over. the bill to protect labor in its old age was innounced as next in order.","mr. president. i am glad to support the motion of the senator from oklahoma to strike out the increased gasoline tax. it is not necessary to elaborate on this amendment. its effect will be to leave the federal gasoline tax at 1 cent a gallon instead of increasing that tax to 11/2 cents a gallon. i believe it generally is recognized that the oil industry and the motorist are paying the heaviest taxes of any groups in the united states today. we are not justified in assessing any heavier taxes on an already overburdened industry. my home state of kansas is not a large state. we have some half million motor cars licensed. the net gasoline tax collected in kansas last year. according to the bureau of public roads. was nearly 71/ million dollars. if this additional half centpergallon tax is placed on gasoline it will increase gasolinetax collections approximately 14 million dollars a year. if the tax is collected for 15 years on an amortization basis that extra half cent a gallon will cost the people of my state some 19 million dollars. in return we may get $9.700.000 of highway aid under this act. it is proposed to make the motorists of the country as a whole pay 27 percent of the entire cost of this publicworks program. as i read the measure. the extra onehalf cent gasoline tax will amount to about $61.000.000 a year. more than one fourth of the amount it is proposed to collect annually to pay for the publicworks program. presuming that the entire $3.300.000.000 is expended. if all the money authorized is not expended. then the percentage of the cost borne by motorists will be even larger. i am perfectly aware that whatever is expended must be paid for. but it seems to me there is no justice in assessing one industry. the oil industry. such a disproportionate tax. especially in view of the fact that congress so far has almost completely failed to make any provision even to give the oil industry the protection it is entitled to receive against imports of cheaply produced foreign oil. there are many phases of the oil situation. there are many crimes for which the oil industry itself should have to answer. but that does not justify the government in charging up to the motorists of this country the additional gasoline tax proposed. i earnestly hope the senate will adopt this amendment and refuse to increase the tax on an already overtaxed industry.","mr. speaker and members of the house. while the oil industry is among the most widely patronized. yet at the same time it is among the least understood of all industries. permit me to give you a suggestive outline. . oil and its refined products comprise several important major industries. the producing industry. with its 300.000 producing wells. on an average drills 20.000 wells annually at a cost of $500.000.000. producing in 1930. 896.265.000 barrels of crude oil. the transportation industry has a mileage of trunk and gathering lines of more than 100.000 miles. it has 150.000 tank cars and furnishes a greater railway tonnage to the railroads than any other industry. its transportation by water includes 369 steam and motor tankers with a gross of 2.314.000 tons. the refining industry has 1.035 refineries in 30 different states with a daily capacity of 10.516.000 barrels. representing 85 per cent of the worlds refining capacity and onefifth in total value among the manufacturing industries of the united states. the marketing of crude \"oil and its refined products is likewise an important industry. it not only handles the billion barrels of crude produced annually but in addition approximately 400.000.000 barrels of gasoline. 60.000.000 barrels of kerosene. 400.000.000 barrels of gas for fuel oils. and 34.000.000 barrels of lubricants. it has built up an export trade of approximately $500.000.000 annually. in its retail trade it has 350.000 service stations which supply gasoline and motor oil for the 27.000.000 motor vehicles. these various industries of oil pay more than $100.000.000 annually in the way of taxes. the consumers of gasoline pay state taxes totaling $500.000.000 annually on gasoline alone. with the exception of the railroads. the building trades. and shipping. the industries are the next best patrons of the products of iron and steel. the common impression is that the direct benefits of the producing industry are limited to the producers of oil. but such is not the case. there is reserved to every landowner a oneeighth of all the oil and gas produced. delivered free of cost to the owners credit in the pipe lines. in addition to that. in the oil states nearly all the land. at one time or another. has been under lease for long periods of time at a rental of $1 per acre. these rentals go direct to the landowners. who in a large majority of cases are farmers. a farm of 160 acres of land receiving annually $160 in cash for oil rentals. this money has helped maintain the family on the farm in the payment of taxes and interest on the mortgage. in the state of kansas alone the actual income to the farmers of that state krom oil rentals is approximately $10.500.000 per year. and the same is proportionately true in the states of california. wyoming. montana. colorado. oklahoma. arkansas. louisiana. and the other oilproducing states. the rentals of land for oil are not limited to the close proximity area of a producing well. they extend fifty or a hundred miles from producing territory. affording a reserve of prospective oil territory to the industry. the royalty reserved by the farmer in producing areas is a cash asset which. when distributed. affords a source for small investments to all classes of people who likewise become interested in the producing end of the industry. the direct benefits are perhaps as widely distributed. if not more so. than in many other industries. the mammoth and costly equipment of all the industries of oil is composed largely of steel. iron. and the products of motor and truck factories in our eastern states. products in which the element of labor reaches as high as 75 per cent of the cost. production must have its steel rigs. steel casing. steel drills. cables. storage tanks. pipe lines. boilers. pumps. and engines. the purchase of which products affording steady employment at good wages to labor in the eastern iron plants and steel plants. it is an american industry with 90 per cent of its laboring men americans. there are 19 oilproducing states. a larger number directly interested in the production of oil than there are cotton states. wheat states. corn states. steel states. textile states. no other industry has an equal radiation of direct benefits or indirect benefits in the distribution of its production. the major industries of oil represent a capital investment of $12.000.000.000 by 2.250.000 investors and furnish employment to 2.000.000 men. the following article by earl oliver. a leading representative citizen of ponca city. okla.. and chairman of the petroleum division of the american institute of mining and metallurgical engineers. is incorported herewith for its constructive educational value. it is a brief statement of the ills of the industry. of the legislative program proposed. and the necessity of organized cooperative effort to secure an orderly rehabilitatipn of the industry. equally protective of the rights of the producers and the consuming public. the article appeared in the issue of the oil and gas journal of april 21. 1932. with the editorial comment following the article herewith.","from the foregoing it appears for illustration that the city of milwaukee with a comparable population of 578.249 to washingtons 486.869 and an adjusted tax rate of $26.34 or $11 more per thousand than the $15.30 of washington. is also $2 per thousand above the average tax rate so found. in other words. the total tax paid in milwaukee is 70 per cent more than the tax paid in washington. the city of milwaukee paid a state income tax of $7.547.403 in 1930 in addition to the federal income tax and also contributed to the $9.500.000 subsidy granted the city of washington. for reasons which can be amplified. it is certain milwaukee is as efficiently managed as the district of columbia. yet pays a much higher tax. in a newspaper published in washington. last evenings edition. you will see the contribution from the district of columbia. how much more it pays than. it receives back from the federal government. i want to give now two or three illustrations that might be interesting. in a large majority of the comparable cities additional rates on automobile. gas. and other items have been paid in recent years. allof which are now recommended for washington to pay. as the proposed washington rate. this would produce $14.000.000 additional revenue on the average rates collected in 22 comparable cities named. contributions to the federal treasury and payments back to the contributors are studied by the states more than by local beneficiaries. for 1930. the same year. the following payments and receipts by and from the federal government are noted in several of the states. pennsylvania paid in .$230.202.064. percentage returned. 3.1. michigan paid in $137.076.199. percentage returned. 2.8. illinois paid in $247.137.637. percentage returned. 1.7. among the smaller payments werewisconsin paid in $35.512.796. percentage returned. 12.3. tennessee paid in $16.478.693. percentage returned. 15.5. texas paid in $38.884.521. percentage returned. 22.6. the largest payment and the amount returnednew york paid in $928.955.021. amount returned. $8.727.208. or less than 1 per cent. the district of columbia received more than any state in its subsidy. $9.500.000. this discloses another reason why washington should properly pay the same tax rate as is now paid by 22 comparable cities. the committee report is supported wherein it briefly discusses and unanimously rejects the bureau of efficiency effort to justify present distriot tax rates by \"per capita\" comparisons or the setting off of federal property against local property on the tax roll to determine the subsidy to be granted. .a per capita taxrate collection comparison of a city or state would be of no relative value for many reasons. some of which are set forth in the committee report. nowhere in the world. according to the hearings. is it attempted or supported by any tax authorities or communities. property and not individuals is alone the subject of taxation. and no averaging of the combined tax paid by mr. mellon. who is credited with possibly a billion dollars in property. and that of his butler gives any relative data for their separate holdings or those of any other two individuals. another plan was suggested by the efficiency bureau of setting off federal government property against district property. with estimated sentimental. monumental. and other values on public buildings. it also. included personal property belonging to the government reaching $180.000.000 but slashed to $90.000.000 because of \"depreciation.\" added $90.000.000 of intangible federal property for money in the treasury. debts. credits. and so forth. afforded an equally novel but unsound tax theory. that policy. known nowhere else in the world. if of any value or justification. would warrant charges against the national governments of all other countries and also of hundreds of cities in our own country containing federal buildings. lands. and other personal and intangible property. states with national parks and many millions of forest and other lands would be knocking at the doors of congress for like subsidies on that argument offered by the bureau of efficiency. these additional views are filed with no conscious prejudice for or against district residents. the same consideration only is asked which every member would have for his own district and state. a square deal not induced by fear or extraneous arguments or one which could not be successfully defended before any jury of taxpayers drawn from outside the local district. for reasons set forth by the committee and based on the findings of fact with the 22 comparable cities. it seems impossible to reach any other logical conclusion. justice to the remaining 22 comparable cities which we equally represent requires an approach to their average tax collections by the district before they are called upon to contribute any part of their own revenues. however small. to the undertaxed district. this certainly justifies a condition that. the district increase its revenues $14.000.000 by taxing its real and personal and other properties the same as the 22 comparable cities. let me say i appreciate the spirit of my colleagues on the committee. their unstinted labors in trying to ascertain the facts and reach proper conclusions. instead of assuming to criticize or find *cause for disagreement. these views are offered in a belief that the value -of the committees labors and report should be reflected in a correct tax solution. which may serve as a guide for district tax adjustments. both now and in the future. some emergency aid until appropriate legislation can be had would. of course. be needed. but any permanent tax adjustment should take into account the findings of fact by the committee. it is for the congress. then. to make such contribution or subsidies as may be found just and proper.","was it a contract job or was it by day labor?","that does not mean anything. senator king. it does not mean that there are only 10.000 paid workers on election day?","mr. president. i send to the desk certain resolutions adopted by different colorado organizations opposing further restriction of the immigration of mexican farm labor. and also one from the colorado state federation of labor asking for a continuance of the restriction. and also several letters on the subject. i ask that the resolutions and letters be printed in the record and appropriately referred.","especially the harvester co. the gentleman is right. besides. in the case of the haugen bill. this fault is in reality a virtue. as i shall show later on. everybody agrees that the present overproduction of 30 per cent in wheat. of about 30 per cent in cotton. and of more than 20 per cent in other farm products is caused mainly by the fact that since the war we have lost our european markets. especially the english and the german markets. as a matter of fact. there were less foodstuffs produced in 1925 in the world than there were produced in 1913. . so these peoples need our grain and our farm products as much as ever. or more than ever. only they can not buy because the war has ruined their buying power. and both in england and in germany the working class now must exist nearer the starvation line than in hundreds of years in the past. our farm problem is simply a question of finding a market for the surplus of our farm products. by making it possible for these working people of great britain and germany and other european countries to buy their flour and their meat cheaper we not only enable then( to get on their feet again. and in course of time become good customers again. but we are also doing a very humane and socialistic thing. and that is the main reason why this time i am going to vote for this bill. especially since it has been improved. the following thought also deserves attention: we had no real cause for getting into the world war. without our help and interferencewhich practically took place the very first day the war started. because we sold munitions and war materialsthe war would have ended about three years sooner. and it would have ended in a \" draw.\" we got nothing out of our interference in that war. except 123.000 dead. about 200.000 maimed. and a war expense of about $40.000.000.000. our reward was prohibition and the \"flu.\" and we earned the hatred of every eurojean nation. all participants would have gone back to work in 1915 if our munition makers and profiteers had not kept them in. and europe would have been on its feet a long time ago. and our farmers would not have lost their markets. it is only a matter of plain international justice that we should pay for the sin of our interference. . now. who is to pay? we can not make the profiteers pay. they are the real patriotsthey own the \" patria.\" and they did not make us go into the war to pay out even a part of their profits again. they are \"paytriots\" because they can make others pay. the american working class. at least as far as it is organized. will also resist. although the profiteers are very willing to have the workers pay in the form of lower wages and longer workdays. under these conditions. as a natural consequence. the farmers. who are very poorly organized. had to pay through the loss of their markets for the sin of america going into the war.","mr. speaker. under leave granted me to extend my remarks in the record. i insert a speech delivered by hon. robert cuossiti from radio station wcap on may 20. 1926. mr. crosser spoke on the subject \"the constant lssue.\" as follows: ladies and gentlemen. happiness is the object of all effort. and yet it seems that most people never attain that end. the reason is that men misunderstand the real nature of life and the true relation of man to his fellow men. this misunderstanding then results in wrong motives. i speak of misunderstanding and wrong motives not with any feeling of antagonism but only to show that they prevent the human race from enjoying the happiness it seeks. to the extent that people misunderstand. their motives will be wrong. if their motives are wrong. their actions will accordingly be wrong. wrong actions or conduct certainly can not -bring happiness. the misunderstanding to which i refer consists of the belief that a person is a separate being. .apart from and independent -of all other beings in the world. that belief is wrong. men must recognize that the welfare of the whole world is their welfare. that the good of all humanity is their good. it is a foolish blunder for people to believe that they can think of themselves only. and act without regard to others. the enjoyment of justice and happiness is delayed because men strive for personal advantage instead of seeking what is best for all. the advantage which men seek for themselves is generally. either to possess something material such as money and position. or it is to be regarded as superior in one or mere respects. not often. of course. do people by their actions or words openly and frankly admit that they seek their own advantage. they know very well that everyone has a sense of right and justice which must be observed. hence those who seek personal advantage do so by trying to make their conduct appear right and just. imitation is the compliment which wrong always pays to right. in order to make clearer my meaning. let me give a few examples of the methods used in seeking the supposed advantage of possessing something material. in a few instances. the power of wealth or position is used directly by a person to force through a business transaction which will bring him a bigger financial gain than could be gotten without such power. more often. however. various poses are assumed in trying to get money. it may be that a person wants to trade or sell something to another for more than it is worth. in that case. he may pretend that it is only because of his friendship for the other person. that he is willing to make the deal on the terms proposed. he may. on the other hand. assume the appearance of being indifferent. of not caring whether he makes the deal or not. the may pretend. too. that because he is hard pressed and must have money. he is willing to sell what he has to the other party at a great sacrifice. the larger financial advantages are often sought by trying to have the government do what those seeking the gain believe will enable them to enrich themselves. -measures are urged by- pretending that they are for the general good. when they are. in fact. calculated to benefit the few who urge them. a prohibitive tariff. for example. is advocated by claiming that it is to help the laboring man. its advocates seldom argue that it is for the benefit of those who are to sell the goods. and yet it should be clear to everyone that the seller wants the tariff so that he can charge a higher price for his goods and put the increased -profit in his pocket. common sense tells us that he will pay to labor only what he must pay. and no more. lie loses no sleep in an effort to get more money for his goods so that he may give it to his workmen. similar methods are used by many who seek political office. men frequently join one party or another because in their. commiqnity that party has long been in.power and. therefore. is in control of the public offices. tme seeker for office considers it necessary. therefore. to belong to the controlling party in order to get office. after having joined the party ie immediately begins to look for reasons to show that his party is right. the insincere person who seeks office has many kinds of pretenses and poses which he uses to gain his end. sometimes it is in the insincere handshake. sometimes it is flattery. often it is pretended indignation -against those whom a large class of voters dislike. we all know that people dislike the selfrighteous. holierthanthou kind of man. who is always condemning the conduct of others and holding up his own conduct as the standard to be followed. . the flattering kind of candidate for office also knows of this dislike for the selfrighteous person. and so tries to gain an advantage for himself by pretending to uphold and admire the wrong conduct of people who themselves know that such conduct is ruinous. and also regret it. then. as soon as he is away from the -people to whom he has been giving this \" bunk.\" as he calls it. the flattering candidate sneers at them. all these poses and many others are easily understood and coanmonly used by the insincere seeker for office. as already stated. however. it is not always the desire for money or office that causes men to pretend to believe that which they do not believe. more often the advantage sought is to be considered superior in sonic respect. fow common it is. for example. to see men do and say things in order to be praised by some person or class of persons. in other words. pride and vanity account for a great many of mens","mr. president. the letter of the acting attorney general summarizes the information given in the last report of the attorney general

instituted prior to july. 1923.\" and a formidable list is included in tle letter sent to the senator from nebraska . furthermore. mr. president. the michigan beet sugar co. is now charged by the federal trade commission with being engaged in another conspiracy to restrain trade. it is charged that the michigan sugar co. and a large number of other companies have entered into an unlawful contract with the larrowe milling co. under which the larrowe milling co. becomes the agent of all these corporations in the sale and disposition of beet pulp. except as to small quantities held for local distribution and consumption. it should be understood that when the saccharine juices are expressed from the beets there remains a fibrous substance. containing. as a matter of course. more or less sugar. which constitutes a most valuable food product for the fattening of cattle. out in our country it is mixed with chopped alfalfa and sold to the farmers with which to feed their stock. in the eastern section of the country it is mixed with chopped corn and other fodder and thus likewise bought by those engaged in the stock business for the purpose of fattening cattle. the charge made in the complaint is summarized in the following statement: a complaint issued by the federal trade commission charges the larrowe milling co.. of detroit. mich.. and 17 manufacturers of beet sugar. with the use of unfair methods of competition in the marketing of beet pulp. a byproduct of beetsugar manufacturing. the complaint alleges that the respondents are engaged in a wrongful combination and conspiracy to suppress competition in the distribution and sale of beet pulp in interstate commerce. beet pulp. the complaint states. is a byproduct in the manufacture of beet sugar. the pulp being tin residue after the sugar has been extracted from the beet. this pulp is used by stock raisers and dealers in cattle feeds. the complaint further states that the respondent manufacturers in the aggregate produce approximately 75 per cent or more of the total quantity of beet pulp produced in the united states. the complaint recites in detail numerous methods alleged to have been used by respondents in effectuating its conspiracy to suppress competition in the distribution and sale of beet pull). among such methods. according to the citation. are the following: respondent inanufacturers enter into contracts with the larrowe milling co.. giving exclusive right of selling all beet pulp produced by the manufacturer each season. extept a small supply retained for local distribution. the respondent larrowe co.. acting upon information received from respondent manufacturers. as to the quantity of beet pulp on hand. and other pertinent information and data. withdraws beet pulp from the market i certain localities and pushes the sale in other places. and otherwise manipulates the market in such a manner as to secure high prices for all the beet pulp sold by it. i omit the names of the manufacturers included in the complaint. but the michigan sugar co. is one of them. under the law whenever the commission has reason to believe that an unfair method of competition has been used. and it shall appear to the commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public. it shall issue its complaint. however. the question whether or not such method has been used is not passed upon by the commission until after respondents have had 30 days in which to answer and the issue has been tried. as is well known. if it should be found by the commission that such unfair methods have been employed an order will be issued. commanding the various parties to desist from that method ofprocedure. they may then appeal from the order of the commission to the circuit court of appeals. and it then becomes the duty of the attorney general of the united states to represent tile government. ol such an appeal. therefore. mr. warren. if his nomination shall be confirmed. will be called upon to represent the government of the united states in lroceedings in which the michigan sugar co. is a party defendant. but. mr. president. that is not all. there are now before time department of justice a long list of cases referred to that department by the federal trade commission for appropriate proceedings under the various laws enacted by collgross concerning the restraint of trade and comnierce. i shall not take the time now to refer in detail to those eases. but let me refer to tile fact that the federal trade commission some time ago found that the aluminum trust. at the head of which is tile present secretary of the treasuryi say at its headi lie was at the head of it before he became secretary of the treasury. and presumably still holds his interest in the organizationhas not only been guilty of monopolizing trade and commerce in violation of the sherman act. but has actually viohlted a decree of the court rendered against that organization and is now in contempt of the court. just imagine the aluminum co. of america being brought to book by charles b. warren for having violated the sherman antitrust act! bear in mind that that case was referred by the federal trade commission to the attorney general. and the late attorney general. mr. stone. practically approved the findings of the federal trade commission and declared that the aluminui trust. as a matter of fact. was in contempt of court for a violation of the decree against it. after having stated the flcts at some length. the attorney general. in a letter directed to the chairman of the commission. mr. van .fleet. says: briefly stated. tl above represents the competitive conditions of the aluminni industry in tile united states. 2. the .decree against the aluminum co. of americahas it been violated? he decree perpetlually enjoined the aluminum co. of america. its officers and agents. among other things. from1. without reasonable cause and notice. delaying shipments of material to a competitor. 2. refusing to ship. or ceasing to ship. (rude or semifinished aluminum to a competitor on contracts or orders placed or on partially filled orders. 3. charging a competitor higher prices for crude or semifiashed aluminum than are charged at the same time. under like or similar conditions. a company in which defendant was interested. 4. itefusing to sell crude or semifinished aluminum to a prospective competitor upon like terms and conditions of sale. under like or similar circumstances. as defendant sells the same to any company in which it is financially interested. and 5. from furnishing competitors known defective material. itle complaints of competitors. with respect to deliveries and quality of materials furnmished. may be classified as follows: 1. cancellation of quotas. 2. refusal to promise shipments. it. unreasonable delays in deliveries. 4. where two or more gauges of metal are ordered. shipping one kind or gauge and withholding shipment of the other: 5. unreasonably delaying shipment and then suddenly dumping upon the competitor large quantities of metal. 6. unreasonably delaying shipment and then suddenly dumping upon competitors large quantities of metal shortly after they have been forced to purchase foreign metal to supply their necessities. and 7. shipping conpetlitors large quantities of mhitcrlals known at the time of shipment to be defective. without attempting to review the evidence submitted in your report. it is sufficient to say that the evidence submitted supports to a greater or less extent the aboverecited complaints of the competitors. and especially is this clear and convincing in respect to the repeated shipments of defective inaterials. known at the time of shipment to be defective. this became so common and so flagrant as to call forth renonstrances from mr. fulton. of the chicago office of the company. on july 28. 1920. lie wrote the company. giving the letters. then the attorney general concludes* it is apparent. therefore. that during the time covered by yoir report the aluminum co. of america violated several provisions of the decree. that with respect to some of the practices complained of. they were so frequent and long continued the fair inference is the conpany cither was indifferent to the provisions of the decree or knowingly intended that its provisions should be disregarded. with a view to suppressing competition in th aluminuin industry. there does not appear to be much in your report touching the methods of the company since the year 1022. in order that the department may act with full knowledge of the course of conduct of the company up to the present time. i have instructed that the investigalion of tihe facts be brought down to date by the. department of .ustice. this will not interfere in any way with any further investigation wlch the federal trade commission may find it proper to make. very truly yours.","clerk. on page 1. line 10. strike out \"18\" and insert \" 16.\" so as to read: the congress shall have power to limit. regulate. and prohibit the labor of persons under 16 years of age.","of course. we can theorize about the matter. but a couple of years ago. when we had this question before us. i took the trouble to read the german statutes. and i did not find anything in them which would justify what the senator from nebraska has just said. i may not use the exact ilanguage. but i believe there are provisions in those statutes 1which do not allow the railroads to reduce their rates to within 120 per cent of the rates of the waterways. water carriage is *cheaper than railroad carriage. and the law does not allow .the railroad to come down beyond a certain point and drive the water carriers out of business. there can be no question about the water transportation being cheaper. when you can load on one barge as much as you can carry in two trainloads and when the barge does not cost as much as the engine of the train. and you start it down the river loaded. and it floats. or has a little tug to pull it. to say that it costs more to transport by water than to transport by rail. where you have to build miles of steel rails and carry the road through a country. pay enormous taxes. and great labor pay rolls. which you do not have in the water transportation. is really absurd. as it is to say you can not carry heavy freight cheaper by water than by rail. there is no question about it. it has been so since the beginning of rail transportation.","mr. president. both the senator and i are laboring under this difficulty: we have a bill before us. we have not a given state of facts to which it is applied. we are bringing forward hypotheses. and perhaps not having before us all of the facts. one of the difficulties i see here is this. and i. think it applies to both bills: in the preparation of the house bill as well as in the preparation of the senate bill. it has been sought to limit dividends to s per cent per annum on the stock or membership capital. it is an easy thing. of course. for those who want to enter into a conspiracy or combination to get around a provision of that kind. it is easy enough to say to the members: \"we are limited in our profits which may be distributed by way of dividends to 8 per cent on the capital stock. but that is not going to prevent us from fixing the price which this association shall pay to the individual members so that you can get 20 or 25 cents a quart for your milk. and then you will be benefited in a dual capacity. you will have the exorbitant profit as an individual producer and seller to the association. and then you will have the profit derived from the dividends in the association up to s per cent.\" that is one of the difficulties. if you can arrange some kind of an association here which is going to eliminate the expense. i am with you wholeheartedly in that matter. if it is really the intention of those who are sponsors for this bill to limit the profit to 8 percent. i think i am wholeheartedly in favor of that provision. but i do not want to impose a limitation of that kindin other words. close up one little placeand leave the door wide open so that there can be unlimited profits in fact when the profits as an individual are added to the profits of the association. if i am wrong about that. i should like to have it pointed out to me. i have felt all the while that i wanted to favor this. legislation if i could. and i want t6 do it yet. but it seems to me that we could improve this entire situation if we had some provision in the senate substitute somewhat akin to that which is in the house bill. which apparently prohibits the undue enhancing of the prices.","it will destroy them hereafter. and the process of destruction will begin right now. from the date the amendment may be adopted. why do the possessors of the vast capital which is invested in the jointstock land banks consent to have the interest which they may charge as the profit they make upon the investment .of their money fixed by th.e federal government and limited to 6 per cent? why is private capital today investing money and ready to invest more money in the jointstock land banks with the united states saying to them. \"you shall charge but 6 per cent interest\"? it is for but one reason. and that reason is found in the fact that the government says. \" in consideration of your agreement to put your money into this venture. in consideration of your promise and assurance that you will help the farmers and provide them adequate money with which to cultivate their crops to enable them to feed the worldif you will agree to do that and agree that you will not charge a rate of interest in excess of 6 per cent per annum. we will exempt your bond interest from the income tax and from the excessprofits tax which the federal government imposes.\" that is the reason capitalists invest money in such enterprises. can senators conceive of any reason why they should desire to invest in such banks. in view of the limitationon the amount which they maycharge as interest. and the fact that they are subjected to all sortsof federal supervision. unless it.be to get the benefit of this exemption? the money was badly needed in order to help the farmers. an institution adapted to tle farmers needs and the farmers requilrements was essential. and so the government created these banks. it said to those who might invest their capital. \"if you will furnish the money and agree to have your interest rate fixed at 5 or 6 per cent. then we will give you this exemption.\" of course. if we now take that exemption away from them they will -retire -from the business. mr. president. i am not defending generally the privilege of tax exemption. i think. with the senator from utah. that just as soon as conditions will permit. it is the imperative duty. of this government to do what may be done constitutionallyif necessary. to amend the constitution for that purposeto put an end to the tax exemption benefit enjoyed by certain securities. such securities axe piling up day after day. montl after month. and year after year. assuming all the time a more and more menacing volume. with the movement among the states and among the municipalities of the country to issue bonds for roads and all other kinds of public improvements. for industrial. educational. charitable purposes. all of which bonds are tax exempt under the present law. with the demands upon the federal government making it necessary that it shall go into the market from time to time in order to borrow money to carry on the great projects that in the near future it is going to be called on by the people to carry on. either itself or in cooperation with the states. no man can tell. if that movement continues. what enormous amounts of the capital of this country are going to be locked up in taxexempt securities. thereby casting a heavier burden upon those who do not enjoy the privilege of clipping coupons. but right now i can not see why this one instrumentality. devised and provided by law to. help the farmer. and which i have -shown if destroyed will leave a certain class of farmers in this country without the help that the congress intended to extend when it adopted the federal farm loan banking system. should receive the lirst blow. why do we begin this process of reducing the number of tax securities with the farmer as the first objective. the man who is in the most distress. the man who is in the direst need of help.. the man who can not stand upon his own legs. the man who is appealing to the government for help and who has a right to appeal to the government for help. because his present distressful condition is due very largely to the usurpations of power by an agency of the government. creating a deflation just at the time -when he was about ready to market his crops. and involving him in a- loss in six months of $8.000.000.000. thereby reducing him to poverty? i have no hesitation in saying that the narrow policy of the federal reserve board with respect to agriculture and agricultural loans in the -matter of deflation and in the matter of restriction of credit at the wrong time. and going too far in. both directions. coupled with the fact of their taking the lid practically off of the interest rate charged by the federal reserve board. is largely responsible for the condition in which the farmer finds himself today. now. when one agency of this government contributes so powerfully to the farmers embarrassments and to the predicament in which he finds himself. will you start in this process of destroying these taxfree securities by laying the a.x to the tree which alone bears the monetary fruits that lie now so badly needs? mr. president. i do not want to go into details in the discussion of this question of the farmer and our financial prices and system as .they affect him and his interests. it is a big question. and one that i want a little bit later to -discuss with. some degree of elaboration and after some preparation. :and notl in the offhand way in which i am speaking today. while under some circumstances i might agree with the senator from utah. i should regard the success of his amendment as destroying one arm of the farm loan system at a time when it .needs both. cutting off all hope of supply from this direction to at least onethird of the farmers of the south. and i believe i might say onethird of the farmers of the west as well. mr. president. i hope the amendment of the senator from utah will not prevail.","doubtless this case. as explained by the senator. is meritorious. butis it the policy of the conuitlee on claims. or is it the policy of the senate to be established by this precedent. to allow contractors compensation for work done under such circumstances. where the cost of labor and material has gone up after the awarding of the contract?","it does not do so expressly. but as a necessary consequence the commission would have that power just exactly as it has it now. the commission is not obliged in fixing rates to accept the wages which have been agreed upon between carriers and their employees.","i am quite hopeless of being able to convince the senator from pennsylvania that the phrases which i have read. which seem to me to be perfectly clear. do not mean what he has construed them to mean. i do not know that it is worth while for me to try further in regard to that. the only desire i have in regard to this matter having been to correct a misapprehension under which i think the senator is laboring about the meeting of the committee. the action which they have taken. and the very full consideration that they gave this subject or tried to give itas full consideration as i know of any measure of this character having ever received by any committee of which i am a memberi think it would be perfectly proper to vote on the motion of the senator to refer the resolution to the committee. i shall certainly vote against it. however.","no. there are certain lines of experimentation with reference to plant diseases and certain of them with reference to insects affecting plants in which certain plots are left deliberately unprotected and untreated n order to determine as quickly as possible the resistance of those several varieties to these troubles. for instance there is one block of seedling pear trees there under test. they have been grown by systematic crossing of relatively blightresistant pears with our best pears. such as the seckel. bartlett. and pears of that type. which are planted there and left exposed to pearblight infection without attempting to protect them in order to determine through natural selection whether there is any one of those hybrids which is resistant enough and good enough to constitute a commercial pear that would -be relatively free from blight. and in the case of the insect work. although that should he discussed by the bureau of entomology. certain blocks have been planted specifically with reference to the determination of their relative immunity or relative resistance to this attack. and certain of them also for the test of spray mixtures. to ascertain the strength and character of. mixture that the tree would endure. it is felt better to risk trees that are owned by the department in these tests than it is to go into a commercial privately owned orchard and risk damaging the trees. the strength of those has to be determined somewhere by actual test. and a good deal of that is being done at arlington farm. it does not represent demonstration work. and should -not be so regarded. in fact. there is little of the field planting at arlington farm that should be regarded as a demonstration of just how to do a thing. it is rather a testing place. an outofdoor laboratory.","mr. president. i should like to ask the senator from georgia a question for information. is it not a fact that georgia has a 60houraweek limitation or provision in its law. and is it not also a fact that in its operation it allows 11 hours a day labor. because of the fact that it is the custom in that state to work only five and a half days a week. saturday afternoon being an actual holiday. and if. under the law of georgia. children do not work 11 hours a day in factories ?","i suppose it would be fair to say that the gentleman has insisted before the committee and also before this house that there should be an investigation by a competent body to see what the preparation should be. now. it seems to me. gentlemen. that we do not need any great increase. perhaps no increase. in our standing army beyond the 100.000 men that are now authorized. i do believe that we should have a navy capable of making it so difficult for an invading force to land. that whilst they were landing here a large army. from whatever source they might come. we could be organizing and training our own troops. a gentleman the other day on the floor suggested that they had enough of squirrel shooters down in arkansas to pick the eyes out of any invading force that might come here. well. i suppose he had not thought of shrapnel fire at a range of 6 miles. these forts that we have would not stand in the way of any invading force. i do not suppose that the commander of any invading force would select a fort to go up against with his fleet. his warships would convoy his transports with his -troops to any one of one hundrtd places where they could land without opposition. except from the military force. unless we had a navy to prevent the lauding. and 1915.. 2069\" for that reason. mr. chairman. i believe the expenditur- of money -in preparation for- defense should be expended largely on the navy. i do not believe that it is necessary at this time to increase the military force. because a proper and reasonable increase of our naval force would.make a foreign invasion so difficult as to be improbable. and thus.we would have no use for increased military force. except probably to garrison the pananma canal. -mr. chairman. i have introduced a bill into this house that has been lying in the committee room for some time. i have never been able to..get any consideration of that bill there..but i want to take this opportunity to call the attention of the committee to a suggestion that is made in the bill that is just in line with the preparation or the training of citizenry for the national defense. that bill would provide that the president.of the united states might enlist a force. to. be called the public service corps. the number not named in the bill. of young men from the ages of 16 to 25. who should be drilled hnd subsisted and disciplined as soldiers. armed and equipped as soldiers in campaign. the private soldiers being paid $30 per month. double the pay of regular soldiers. and that force would be employed in the building of roads or other public works. they would serve one year. not eligible for reenlistment. but the corps would be kept filled with new men . the officers to be appointed by the president. such a corps--officers and menwould get training in actual military life. the officers especially. would get training in the handling of supplies and materials. the -handling of. large bodies of men. and the administration of subsistence and quartermasters stores. something that they do not get either in the national guard or in the regular army itself when scattered.in a multitude of.small posts. that would train officers in actual military life and would fill the country in a few years wit li a large number of young men who had had actual military training. i submit this matter to the house as a contribution to a subject that i think is of very great importance. and it seems to me precisely along the lines suggested by president wilson in his address. suggesting that our defense must be by a \"citizenry trained to arias.\" this corps would not be subject to military duty. it would not be a part of the army. it would be a body. of men employed at useful work under military discipline. providing work for the unemployed at fair wages. and in a few years the country would have a great number of young men trained in military life. who in an emergency would volunteer for the defense of the country. and i :might say that incidentally we would get about two miles of public road built for what we now pay for one. i know there are a lot of fellows in the army who.would say that that would be soldiers work. and soldiers do not like to work. a good many of them think it is derogatory. the sooner they get that idea out of their heads the better. but. at any rate. there is no room for professional jealousy. because this corps would not be a military force. it would provide in a- few years a large body of \"citizenry trained to arms. upon which the country could depend in time of need to fill the ranks of the regular army and the organized militia. mr. chairman. i yield back the balance of my time.","mr. president. the senator from michligan has stated that he thinks this bill is as good as any that has been considered since he has been a member of the senate. of course. he was not present during the discussions and deliberations. any river and harbor bill involves an amount of detail that it is almost impossible to master all its features. but that statement impresses me with the necessity of arguing this bill thoroughly before the senate. there are items here that are legacies from prior years. i do not claim to be free from blame for projects for which the government of the united states bad been appropriating. the house committee. when i .was chairman. made mistakes. a different idea prevailed at tha.t time as to what could be accomplished -by inland watelray improvement from that which the intelligent sentiment of the country now sanctions. but i do say that this bill is the climax of injudicious appropriations. i want to call attention to a few projects briefly and as introductory to a more elaborate consideration hereafter. and as an indication of what we are doing in this bill if it passes. in the first place. i will mention a minor item in the bill. the red river below fulton. ark.. to the mouth of the atchafalaya has a length of about 475 miles. this bill came to the house with no appropriation for that stretch. it had been ridiculed somewhat in the past. i had attacked it myself on the door of the senate in the year 1910. and that element which acts as a sort of censor over us. the magazines of the country. had taken up this case and exploited it to some extent. but the senate has made an appropriation of$100.000 for that stretch of the stream. now. let us see what that appropriation would accomplish. the total traffic for the year ended june 30. 1913. on this pqrtion of the river was 44.967 tons. included in this there were floated logs. wlich need no improvement. anountingto 42.540 tons. and lumber. 1.100 tons. which also need no improvement. leaving a balance of miscellaneous freight. made up of grain. hay. etc.. of 1.227 tons. for the facilitating of the carriage of that 1.227 ions congress is asked to ..ppropriate $100.000. this is an absurdity. the figures do not differ nmaterially fron what they were one. two. three. four. and five years ago. there was a time when there was traffic on this stream. now it has practically disappeared. the floating of logs and lumber is practically all that is left on that waterway. which in the days of the civil war and after assumed some prominence as an agency of transportation. the anmount expended during the year ending june 30. 1913. was $86.938. or more than $70 a ton. and it is now proposed that we appropriate $80 for every ton of freight that would be aided by this improvement. mr. president. is the senate ready to stand up against the censure and obloquy that will be incurred by including this kind of an item in this bill? there is another part of the river that is worse than that. and that is the upper portion290 milesfrom fulton. ark.. to denison. tex. there is an appropriation in this bill of $50.000 for that stretch. the amount of freight for the calendar year of 1912 was 13.832 tons. of which logs floated were 13.250 tons. leaving a balance of 5s2 tons of miscellaneous freight. the total value of the 13.832 tols was $45.250.","i am glad the committee is of that mind. for this is the first time they have displayed any religious feeling since this discussion began. but. mr. chairman. not desiring to delay the committee further. i wish to say that the printers and pressmens and binders unions. and union men generally. are opposed to this transfer of books to the free list. they are also opposed to the reduction of duty from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. i shall extend in the record some things they have to say on that subject. i think this paragraph is decidedly against the interests of union labor. of which we have so many champions on the other side of the house.","in order to make an effective campaign in superior and in douglas county. it was necessary to have a good many workers. he had been in politics for a good many years. he knew a great many men. he knew to whom to go to get the necessary assistance to work up the sentiment necessary to get out the vote for the senator.","will the gentleman allow me. on that matter. to ask in good faith. for information. what this legislation will accomplish? i see that the gentleman. or his committee. in section 2 proposes an amendment: that nothing in this act shall apply to contracts for transportation by land or water. or for the transmission of intelligence. or for such materials or articles as may usually be bought in open market. except armor and armor plate. they propose as to armor and arnor plate thatin all respects the labor that enters into the making of that armor plate shall be under the eighthour law.","mr. president. i am not responsible for that. and i shall not discuss individual cases. because i am not familiar with them. but the senator must understand the proposition that. although lie is laboring. according to his statement. under a great hardship at the present time. if the rate be raised from the coast cities on our lumber. which is a mere sampleof what it would be on other things. then the burden under which he rests today must thereby be increased. and. instead of aiding his people in getting lumber at a reduced rate. his vote will elevate the rate to the people of that section of the country.","i think there will be no trouble about showing the senator from south dakota that there is a difference in the cost of production on the pacific coast anyhow. owing to the different conditions of labor there. not so much the white labor. but on account of the employment of large numbers of oriental hborers on the british side. we shall show that to be the fact when we come to consider this schedule.","not under this bill. this compensates only the civil employeethe artisan or

\"gentleman from wisconsin\" has not made any \"discovery.\" except to have found on the front page of the chicago tribune what purported to be a statement of a member of the state board of health. and also a statement of a professor of the northwestern university as to the pollution of the water at lake bluff. caused by the gluten that came from the glucose factory. the only glucose factory in that vicinity. at waukegan. 4 miles distant. it is not a discovery of the \" gentleman from wisconsin.\" but a plain statement of two unbiased. professional experts as to the pollution of the water at lake bluff. it is not a discovery on my part. but a statement of facts by chemists. so that the gentlemans eloquent. elaborate. and profound discussion of the constitution and the law. when he alluded to me. was merely an airing of his own wisdom in reference to this matter. and wholly irrelevant.","every detail of the expenditures in regard to the collection of revenue is now kept in the treasury department. as i understand. this is in the direction of what the senator from maine and i in this body have always requireddetailed estimates. so that congress may know precisely what is being done. how the money is to be expended. and then appropriate for it. that is the general rule applying to nearly every other expenditure. i submit to the senator from maine whether this is not a provision which upon its face seems to come within the right rule. and one. i think. which ought to be enforced more rigidly than it now is. i am very glad to see the proposition come here. it is a mere matter of bookkeeping. and the labor of preparing the statements that come to the treasury department monthly. it seems to me. ought not to involve a very great change in the system of bookkeeping. of course i have no desire to interfere with the senator from maine. who. i know. is very rigid in his views of requiring detailed accounts to be presented to congress preceding the making of appropriations. if. however. the senator from maine believes on examination that it will be prudent to have this matter go into conference i shall not object. but it strikes me on its face as being a very proper provision.","very well. i gathered the opinion that these were practically charges and suspicions against the president or against the postmastergeneral or against high and responsible public officials of the government. i am. for one. glad to say and to believe that even in the heat of partisan malice no such suspicions have been engendered in any quarter. and that the public confidence in the high and responsible officials of the executive departments of the government have been untouched even by the breath of suspicion. there is no sense. no reason. in my judgment. for supposing that the postoffice department itself is at a moral disadvantage in conducting investigations of the transaction of its own subordinates. in fact. that great department and all the other great departments of the government are specifically equipped by law with the exact machinery required for such investigation. take. for example. these charges against the former chief of the division of salaries and allowances of the postoffice department of dividing the profits of contracts with the parties with whom they had entered into contracts. by what possible means could a congressional investigation have entered into a question of that sort? they could investigate the accounts. but the accounts were all .right upon the books. they could investigate acts. but the public acts of those officials were presumably correct and according to the best standard. the defect lay in the fact that. secretly and corruptly. officials charged with the transaction of that kind of business had divided the profits of contracts with the parties with whom they were authorized bylaw to enter into contract. i have never been able to see how any committee of congress could have made any impression upon a situation like that. it requires an elaborate effort of the most expert detective force existing. i believe. in the united states. public or private. to make the slightest impression upon a situation like that. the postoffice department is equipped with inspectors trained in the business of criminal detection. the whole corps of postoffice detectives was put at the service of the fourth assistant postmastergeneral. as. patiently and quietly and secretly and by the most approved methods. he entered into an investigation of these matters.","mr. chairman. the pending bill is the result of the popular demand for some further legislation to correct and restrain the trust evil in this country. more than twelve years ago the sherman antitrust law was enacted. and although we have been repeatedly informed by the distinguished gentleman from ohio. general grosvenor. and others on the republican side of the house. that this law afforded an adequate remedy against the existence and growth of those monoplies which the people. by common consent. have denominated trusts. the president and this republican congress admit its inadequacy and propose at this late day to supplement the provisions of the sherman law. i take it the republican party is proceeding upon the idea. \"better late than never.\" this construction of republican action is more lenient than the conclusion that the republican party has been forced to abandon its inaction by the fear of defeat and the rising storm of popular indignation at its policy of favoritism toward and toleration of the combinations of capital which oppress the masses. destroy competition. and endanger the free institutions of the greatest republic in all history. whatever may be the motive for framing and presenting this legislation to this congress. it is true either. first. that the sherman act of july 2. 1890. and the subsequent amendments thereto in the wilson tariff act of august 28. 1894. expressly preserved in the dingley act of 1897. have not been enforced by the republican administrations since their enactment. or. second. that they are ineffective. in whole or in part. to curb and restrain monopoly. additional legislation is necessary and is demanded by the people of the country. i shall not attempt in this debate to discuss the economic questions involved in the formation and growth of trusts or the legal aspects of the sherman law and pending measure of the committee. i am sure these matters have had the full and careful consideration of the judiciary committee. and the whole subject as adjudicated in the courts and from the standpoint of political economy presents a vast field of thought. study. and investigation. the national and state antitrust laws. the decisions of the united states supreme court. and the recommendations of the president doubtless have received the consideration of the committee. the interstate and foreign commerce clause of the constitution of the united states (art. i. section viii. clause 3). and the decisions of the united states supreme court. enumerated in the reply of the attorneygeneral. dated january 3. 1903. to the communication of senator hoar. chairman of the senate judiciary committee. from the knapp case down to and includingthe addystone pipe and steel company case. show that the power of congress to legislate upon the question is ample so far as interstate commerce is concerned. invoking this power at the last session of this congress. democrats introduced many bills. among others. bills providing forfirst. publicity. second. placing trustmade goods on the tariff free list. third. making trustmade goods liable to state antitrust laws when they enter the states having such laws. fourth. placing upon the free list trustmade goods sold cheaper abroad than at hofeat a less price to the foreigner than to the american citizen. none of these measures were adopted by the republican ma.jority. but all were buried in the committee. one republican. the distinguished and able gentleman from maine . introduced one bill to amend and strengthen in a very mild form the sherman law. but since the election. and since the republican party has had some greater manifestation of the popular opposition to trusts and the feeling of the people upon this great question. at this late day and hour they now propose this measure of slight relief to the people. which will doubtless meet the usual fate of all republican antitrust bills originating in this house. namely. a lingering death upon the senate calendar. but. mr. chairman. does this legislation yet go far enough. does it strike at the root of the evil. does it eradicate and cure the trust cancer upon the body politic? will it do more. if it does that. than to alleviate temporarily the evil and restrain the cancerous growth while monopoly still exists? the real danger to the country lies in the formation and the overcapitalization of the 287 corporate trusts of the country. 200 of which are benefited by and owe their formation to the tariff laws of the republican party. henry 0. havemey6r. president of the sugar trust. said on the mother of all trusts is the customs tariff bill. it is the government. through itstariff laws. which plunders the people. and the trusts are merely the machinery for doing it. the national democratic platform of 1900 declared: we condemn the dingley tariff law as a trustbreeding measure skillfully devised to give the few favors which they do not deserve and to place upon the many burdens which they should not bear. mr. babcook. chairman of the national republican congressional executive committee. in 1901 said: by the aid of the tariff. manufacturers can fix exorbitant prices in the domestic market. and. as has been tersely said. \"the dingley law ties the hands of the american consumer while the trusts pick his pockets.\" under the republican protective tariff trusts have increased and flourished as never before in the history of the united states or the world. the only other countries having trusts comparable to ours are the protected countries of continental europe. especially germany and austria. mfore trusts have been formed since the dingley law was enacted than ever before in our national history. out of 287 of these industrial combinations. according to an accurate list. more than 200 are directly or indirectly. in whole or in part. benefited and fostered by the dingley tariff law. these have monopolized for their private benefit nearly all the necessaries of life. and levy tribute upon the people from the cradle to the grave. they control competition. regulate production. fix prices. from the moment the dingley law was passed trusts sprang up as if by magic. competition was destroyed. industrial enterprise stifled. russell sage. speaking of the danger to business and to our institutions from the destruction of competition and the overcapitalization of the trusts. said. in an article in the north american review. the destruction of competition must lead to \"retaliative legislation: we had better remain content with the oldfashioned system of honest competition. under which we have grown great as a nation and prosperous as a people. the consolidations of today begin at the very outset with capitalizations which cast all past experiences in the shade and which almost stagger the imagination. the steel combination. with its capitalization of $1.400.000.000. a sum more than onehalf the national debt. oneseventieth the entire wealth of the united states. is the giant combination of them all. this companys issue of securities will represent practically onehalf the entire volume of money of the united states. in the combination of capital of this colossal organization the stockholders received three shares of stock in the new corporation for one in the old. by a stroke of the pen what was $1.000.000 is converted into $3.000.000. besides the steel trust. towering over all. we have seen organized under the mckinley and roosevelt administrations. and since the dingley law. trusts which control nearly every necessary of life. nearly every product and business industry of this country. with the dingley law dawned upon the nation the trust era. mr. chairman. we may pass restraining statutes. but as long as our absurdly high tariff standsa tariff enabling the manufacturers and trusts to sell their goods cheaper to the foreigner than to our own citizens. a tariff the highest known in the history of our governmentthe trusts will continue to flourish. they will increase in numbers. and will grow in power and influence. in spite of this legislation. for great accumulation of wealth in the hands of a favored few under the tariff laws makes easy the formation of great industrial and transportation combinations. we are now in the stage of trust development when the tariff. combined with other special privileges. permits the trusts to extort from consumers. reform the tariff in those schedules which shelter monopoly. and you strike at the root of the trust evil and eradicate it. because you restore competition. make the concentration of wealth difficult or impossible. and thereby destroy monopoly. -mr. chairman. the greatest danger to the country today is in the growth of monopoly. which is contrary to the genius and spirit of our free institutions. builds up special classes. and leads to constant conflicts between the two great american forceslabor and capital. says lloyd. in his wealth against commonwealth. \"monopoly is business at the end of its journey.\" \"the concentration of wealth. the wiping out of the middle classes. are other names for it.\" \"liberty produces wealth. and wealth destroys liberty. for liberty and monopoly can not live together.\" this has been the history of the world since time began. under this irresistible law of the decay of free institutions with the growth of wealth and its concentration in the hands of the few. the greatest and freest nations of the world have been doomed to destruction. the invocation of every power of congress to resist this tendency to monopoly is. therefore. the patriotic duty of congress. and not only should the commerce clause of the constitution be invoked. but those tariff schedules which shelter monopoly should be reformed or repealed. illustrations of trusts maintained or fostered by the high protective tariff of the republican party are numerous. the largest trust of all is. of course. the mammoth steel trust. to which i wish again especially to refer. this trust embraces most of the great steel and iron plants and companies of the country and controls practically all the steel and iron outputat least 85 per cent of it. it absolutely dictates the prices of all the immense number of articles included in these steel and iron industries. and also dictates wages. it is capitalized at the enormous sum of $1.400.000.000. and its dividends are about 10 per cent. or nearly $150.000.000 per annum. fully twothirds of this enormous profit is gained directly from the tariff. the average tariff protection on articles controlled by this trust being about equal to 50 per cent. this 50 per cent represents all extra profit to the steel trust over and above the legitimate profit which it would make. or which its constituent companies would make. if there were no such tariff protection. it may be said. as the protectionists always maintain. that if there were no such protection the american manufacturers could not make anything at all. recent developments have proved the falsity of this claim. it may have been true at some time in the distant past. when our \"infant industries \" were infants indeed. it is not true now. when the cost of production and of raw material in the steel industries and in many of our other industries is no greater than abroad. if this be denied. the denial is refuted by the actions of the trusts themselves in selling their products abroad in foreign markets at the same prices. or lower prices. than the foreignmade goods of the same sort command in their home market. that the trusts of the united states have been and are doing this right along there is abundant and conclusive evidence. mr. schwab. the president of the steel trust. confessed it to be true of his trust before the industrial commission and said it was the general practice of the trusts. other trust magnates have borne similar testimony. the export price lists of the exporting firms prove the charge. so do the records of sales made abroad. mr. schwab nonchalantly said when business was in a normal condition nowadaysin these days of trustmade tariffs and tariffmade trustsexport prices were \"always\" lower than home prices and that to the best of his recollection americanmade steel rails had been sent to europe and sold there for $23 a ten at the same time when they were selling in the american market for $28 a ton. in other words. the tariff gives the steel trust a chance to charge the american customer $28 a ton for steel rails. and the trust naturally accepts this opportunity and does charge the american customer $28 a ton. while at the same time the trust sends its rails abroad and sells them there for $23 a ton. and makesaprofit on them at that. and thus literally robs the home customer out of at least $5 a ton. and it is on the profits of this robbery that the steel trust grows so rich. it thrives by wringing extortionate profits out of our citizens. while remaining content with reasonable profits from foreigners. and it is the high tariff that enables it to do so. the story of one trust is the story of all of them. with slight variations. there is no need to amplify details. but a few more will be pertinent. the oil trust is protected by a duty equal to 17 per cent on refined oil. and declares dividends of 40 or 50 per cent annually. the windowglass trust is protected by a duty equal to 59 per cent. on an average. and declares dividends of about 15 per cent. the sugar trust is protected by an average duty equal to 85 per cent. and pays dividendsof from 14 to 22 per cent. the biscuit trust is protected by a duty equal to about 20 to 32 per cent. or an average of. say. 26 per cent. and pays dividends of 10 per cent. the match trust is protected by a duty of 29 per cent. and pays dividends of 10 per cent. the cement trust is protected by a duty equal to 23 per cent. and pays dividends as high as 33 per cent. the salt trust is protected by an average duty equal to 39 per cent. and makes at least 7 per cent annually. the copper trust and brass trust are protected by a duty of 46 per cent on manufactures of those metals. and they both make at least 8 per cent annually. some of the other trusts. all of which declare handsome dividends. on stock. too. that is at least onehalf fictitious and \"water.\" are protected as follows: the various chemical trusts. by an average tariff of 27 per cent. the rubber trust. by an average tariff of 32 per cent. the leather trust. by an average tariff of 36 per cent. the various paper trusts. by an average tariff of 29 per cent. the woolen trust. by an average tariff of 91 per cent. the various tobacco trusts. by an average tariff of 115 per cent. the modest borax trust may be allowed to wind up the procession with a tariff protection of only 158 per cent. a few more discriminations in favor of the foreign markets may rofitably be cited. it has been discovered. for example. that our orax sells at home for nearly 8 cents a pound. abroad at 24 cents a pound. our wire nails sell at home at $2.05 per 100 pounds. and abroad at $1.30. our handsaws sell at home at $18 per dozen. and abroad at $15. our bessemer tin plates sell at home at $4.19 per 100 pounds. and abroad at $3.19. our galvanized wire rope sells at home at $9.70 per hundred feet. and abroad at $3.12. our table knives sell at home at $15 per gross. and abroad at $12. our oil machinery. our agricultural machines. our sewing machines. our typewriting machines. almost all kinds of machinery and of our other manufactured articles. can be bought much lower abroad than at home. is not that a humiliating. an exasperating condition for a true american to reflect upon? if american citizens continue to endure such extortion on the part of the trusts they will sacrifice their manhood and must eventually become mere serfs and slaves to these great combinations and corporate monopolies. pass not only the pending bill but the amendments thereto recommended by the minority of the judiciary committee in their -report upon this bill. reform your tariff schedules in so far as they shelter monopolyat least in so far as they enable the trusts to sell their goods cheaper abroad than at home. break down this tariff bulwark which enables the trusts to practice extortion upon our own citizens. restore competition in part in this way. and you strike at the root of the evil and benefit the people. this can be done. mr. chairman. without affecting any legitimate industry north or south.","mr. chairman. this proposition. with the change made necessary by the fact that utah has since been admitted as a state. is the fruit of the labors of a special committee appointed in the fiftysecond congress to investigate the subject. and it proposes what i consider a foundation for a rational and reasonable system of irrigation if the states and territories avail themselves of the grant. it was elaborately reported upon by the gentleman from texas and his committee. and it presents in a concrete and careful form the proposition to cede to the territories and states the lands within their borders. to permit them. with the aid of private irrigation enterprise thereby encouraged. to irrigate these lands and these sections and states asking for legislation.","now. i wish to say. mr. chairman. that there are three members of this house on the committee on printingtwo republicans and one democrat. in the presence of these gentlementhe chairman now sitting just in front of mei wish to say that i have not in the slightest or the most remote degree interfered with those gentlemen in making any report on any resolution pending before that committee. and i have done nothing whatever here or elsewhere to stop the publication of this work. i go further and say. to no human being inside of this house or in the united states of america have i made the slightest effort to prevent congress from printing this book without limit. further. i state here that i have no interest on the face of the earth in the messages and papers of the presidents. full six months ago whatever interest i had of a pecuniary nature in it. which was a simple royalty on the sale of the books. i parted with by a sale to the publisher. i have no sort of interest. direct or indirect. in the publication of this work. i think upon that statement the gentleman must see i have no interest in the work and he should not say that i have interfered with the publication of it. the publisher is a gentleman formerly from new york. now of the state of indiana. he does not belong to my party in politics. but there is no politics in this. and should not be. he is a gentleman. so far as i know. as to what his agents did in some places i do not know. i am not responsible. and i presume nobody else would want to be held responsible. for what canvassers or sales agents may say either of books or any other wares or merchandise when they are trying to sell them. i do not know how that is. but my declaration. mr. chairman. is that which i rose to make. and that is that i have not interfered in any form or fashion in the publication or nonpublication of this work. the gentlemen of the printing committee are present. two of them republicans. and they know i have not done so. the gentleman a moment ago said that i \"took the plates from which the work was published that were in the possession of the government. that i took them by authority of congress. and that there was no intention to deprive congress ot the use of the plates thereafter.\" i am glad the gentleman referred to this. of course. there was no such intention. but the gentleman is mistaken in his supposition that i ever took the plates from which congress published the work. the plates given me by congress were only duplicate plates. the original being retained by the government. i had nothing except duplicate plates. which cost the government. in round numbers. about $3.000. this is all the compensation ever made to me by congress for the four or five years labor on the compilation and the index thereto. except that 1 was given some extra copies of the books. i think the gentleman now. in common fairness. ought to say that i have not stopped the publication. and that i should stand acquitted of his charge.","mr. chairman. i move to strike out /she last word. i will not detain the committee long. but i want to call attention to a statement made last monday by the gentleman from ohio . who challenged the correctness of a statement made by the gentleman from tennessee . that the democratic partyand presumably lie meant every member of the democratic partyhad offered nothing in the way of legislation to promote the interest of labor."]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>year<\/th>\n
