curator of the pimeria alta historical society museum. teresa passed away on may 1. 2016 in nogales. arizona at the place dearest to her. the museum at which she proudly worked for over 20 years. teresas roots are every bit as eclectic as our nation as a whole. with lineage tracing back to mexican. chinese and opata native ancestors. born in navojoa. sonora. she was raised in tucson. arizona. and attended catalina high school. teresa was only sixteen years old when she joined the united farm workers to educate female cotton workers on the risks they faced at their jobs. as a young girl. her mother. isabel leal. was a chef to the united states ambassador to the court of st. james in great britain. lewis douglas. who later became teresas friend and mentor. growing up. teresa was fortunate to meet important figures in the reconstruction of the postworld war ii world like john mccloy. the postwar high commissioner of germany. after graduation she enrolled at the university of san carlos in guatemala where she studied social anthropology. teresa later came back to nogales. sonora where she spent the rest of her life. in 1986. teresa founded the womens group known as proyecto comadres. where she addressed labor. environmental. and civil rights issues concerning women who labored at the \"maquiladoras\" in nogales. sonora. as the groups membership grew they expanded their efforts to include women who faced domestic violence and economic or family struggles. at the same time she served as a substitute teacher in mexico. teresa also worked with the binational health council to examine health issues affecting both sides of the nogales border. as well as the nongovernmental organization gente de iitoi in sonora. where she trained indigenous women as health educators throughout the yaqui. seri and tohono tribes. teresa was the grantee recipient from the southwest network for environmental and economic justice and also a member of the national advisory council for the north american commission for environmental cooperation. teresa was also a freelance journalist. working with la voz del norte newspaper in sonora from 19841989 and the nogales international newspaper. among several other publications. teresa ended her career as the curator of pimeria alta historical society museum. where family. friends. and colleagues remembered her as a selfless person committed to keeping local history alive. southern arizona and the borderlands will miss teresa leals passion. sense of justice. and love of her community. teresa leaves a living legacy of leadership. empowerment. and a commitment to social and economic justice. this legacy will continue to make all of us better and our community a better place.","mr. president. i thank senator enzi and members of the budget committee for the 2016 budget conference agreement that we are currently considering in the senate. included in the budget conference agreement are policy provisions that i believe begin to move this country in the right fiscal direction. including balancing the budget within 10 years without the need to raise taxes on the hardworking american taxpayersomething the administrations budget fails to do. in addition. the budget agreement provides a pathway to repeal the failed policies of obamacare. i am pleased the resolution does provide some relief from sequestrations devastating cuts to our national defense. the good news is that there is some relief. providing additional resources for defense through the overseas contingency operations account. known as oco. is a good one. but it is temporary and it is a bandaid. again. i thank senator enzi for the great job he has done. but the fact is that this body and this congress is guiltyis guiltyof not repealing sequestration. which is devastating our military and destroying our ability to defend this nation in these most perilous and difficult times. before the senate armed services committee on january 29. former secretary of state henry kissinger testified: as we look around the world. we encounter upheaval and conflict. the united states has not faced a more diverse and complex array of crises since the end of the second world war. what are we doing? we are slashing defense year after year through something called sequestration. which was never intended to happen. that is a devastating indictment of the congress of the united states in our first priority. which is protecting this nation. gen. mark welsh. the chief of staff of the air force. stated: we are now the smallest air force weve ever been. when we deployed to operation desert storm in 1990. the air force had 188 fighter squadrons. today. we have 54. and were headed to 49 in the next couple of years. in 1990. there were 511.000 active duty airmen alone. today. we have 200.000 fewer. w.. we currently have 12 fleets of airplanes that qualify for antique license plates in the state of virginia. general odierno. chief of staff of the army. said: in the last three years. the armys active component and strength has been reduced by 80.000. the reserve component by 18.000. we have 13 less active component brigade combat teams. weve eliminated three active aviation brigades. . . . we have already slashed investments in modernization by 25 percent. he went on to say: the number one thing that keeps me up at night is that if were asked to respond to an unknown contingency. i will send soldiers to that contingency not properly trained and ready. we simply are not used to doing that. admiral greenert. the chief of naval operations: [d]ue to sequestration of 2013. our contingency response force. thats whats on call from the united states. is onethird of what it should be and what it needs to be. gen. joseph dunford. commandant of the marine corps. now nominated to be chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. testified: were investing in modernization at a historically low level. we know that we must maintain at least 10 percent to 12 percent of our resources on modernization to field a ready force for tomorrow. to pay todays bills. were currently investing 7 percent to 8 percent. i asked every single one of our service chiefs and our area commanders the same question: if we do not repeal sequestration. will it put the lives of our men and women who are serving in the military in greater danger? the answer by every single one of these uniformed leadersnot just civilian leaderswas. yes. we will put the lives of the men and women who are serving in the military in greater danger unless we repeal sequestration on defense. i say to my colleagues of the united states senate. this is not acceptable. it is not acceptable for us to ask the young men and women who are serving in our military in uniform to put their lives in greater danger because we copped out. we failed to address the issue of increasing an unsustainable deficit. we are making them pay the price. thirteen percent of the budget is allocated to defense. defense is taking 50 percent of the cuts. the ryanmurray agreement was something that was welcomed. we need another ryanmurray. we need the men and women who are serving as members of congress to understand that we have no greater responsibility than the defense of this nation. i can assure my colleagues that. working with my friend senator reed of rhode island. the ranking member on the senate armed services committee. we will be working. we will reduce waste and mismanagement. we will address acquisition. we will reform acquisition and the terrible cost overruns that plague our ability to do business in the defense business. we will be cutting the size of these huge staffs that have grown and grown. we will be making significant reforms in the way the military does business. but these reforms will not have the impact that is necessary in the short term. and that is that we are putting the lives of american soldiers. sailors. marines. and airmen in greater danger. i come to the floor to thank my colleague from wyoming. senator enzi. for the great job he has done on this budget. but i would tell my colleagues that we must work together in a bipartisan fashion to fix the damage sequestration is doing. i will only add one other point that is very important. some of us have forgotten that in the days after the vietnam war. the military was in terrible disarray. ronald reagan came to the presidency on the slogan \"peace through strength.\" we rebuilt the military. we put it back in the condition of being the greatest military and effective force in the world. and we won the cold war. right now. if you look at a map of the world in 2011 and look at a map of the world todayin 2011 when we enacted sequestrationyou will find that henry kissinger. george shultz. madeleine albright. brent scowcroft. and every person who is respected on national security in this country will tell you that we are in grave danger. whether it be from isis. whether it be from iran. whether it be aggressive behavior by the chineseno matter what it is. there are severe crises. no matter where it is in the world. we are in the midst of serious challenges to our national security. and the last placethe last placewe should continue to cut is on our defense and capability to defend this nation. i yield floor.","mr. president. i wish to call for new aid to eastern europe to strengthen our allies in the face of russias annexation of crimea. some of my colleagues have suggested that we can do this by immediately increasing our export of domestically produced and processed liquefied natural gas. i have been cautiously optimistic on the domestic production of this energy source. relying heavily on the need for the environmental regulation of such activities. but in the case of eastern europe there is little that we can do domestically to quickly help their situation. for more than a century. americas real power has been exporting the keys to economic growth and security. therefore. it is time to do something real to bolster europes energy security by helping them develop eastern europes substantial natural gas reserves and reduce the leverage russia has over its energy dependent neighbors. the most powerful tool the united states can give eastern europe is not exported natural gas that will not get to europe for years. if ever. it is empowering our european allies to develop their own energy resources. like the major shale gas deposits in poland. it is clear that energyand natural gas in particularis at the very heart of russias influence over that part of the world. europe is dependent on russia for nearly onethird of its natural gas. and while countries in western europe have had some success in diversifying their energy supplies. as former state department special envoy and coordinator for international energy affairs david goldwyn testified yesterday. eastern europe is still heavily dependent upon russia for energy. russia is not above using that dependence as a hammer and has been eager to remind us of that fact. for instance. moscow shut off the gas lines in 2006 and again in the winter of 2009. leaving millions temporarily without heat. in 2013. when the country of moldova sought to pursue stronger ties with europe. russias deputy prime minister issued a barely veiled threat to the moldovans. saying \"we hope you will not freeze.\" as i noted. some have suggested the answer to this problem is to automatically approve natural gas exports from the united states. this position simply ignores the facts about how the gas market actually works. u.s. lng facilities are not slated to come online until the end of next year. at the earliest. while any new approvals would not provide any natural gas exports for at least several years. further. unless congress directed exports to go to ukraine. the gas would go to the country paying the highest price. which would likely be in asia. i support the energy departments current. measured process for considering export requests. the energy department has already approved more than 9 billion cubic feet per day of exports. which exceeds what most analysts believe is the current international market for u.s. natural gas. it is helping our european allies bolster their energy security by developing the major shale gas deposits in poland and elsewhere. united states entrepreneurs triggered the shale revolution with a combination of innovation and technical knowhow. this created tens of thousands of jobs and produced stable energy supplies that are 50 percent cleaner than traditional fossil fuels. it helped us with our energy security and it can do the same for europe. that is exactly what we should be doing to help nato allies that are justifiably worried following russias illegal actions in ukraine. so what i am proposing today is to increase funding for a state department program that helps spur natural gas development abroad. my commonsense amendment would direct $10 million within the economic support fund toward the unconventional gas technical engagement program to help eastern european countries develop the regulations and technical expertise they need to access their own gas. let me be clearthis assistance would go to countries. like poland. that have asked for american help to harness their own gas reserves. i am aware that europe is having its own debate about shale gas. and this amendment would not force any nation to participate. in doing so. it will help our european allies throw off the yoke of dependence on russian gas. i want to be clear that this amendment cannot free eastern europe from russian influence. russia has other ways of bullying its neighbors economically. moscow temporarily banned imports from ukraine. for example. and it also banned imports of moldovan winea very significant part of moldovas economy. this is clearly only one step of many needed to send a message to president putin. but as the former chairman of the energy and natural resources committee i know that a stable energy supply is the lifeblood of any economy and a very important component to a secure nation. i believe there is bipartisan support for america to give our allies the tools they need to become more secure and less dependent on the whims of mr. putin.","mr. chairman. i yield myself such time as i may consume. today we are considering h.r. 761. the socalled national strategic and critical minerals production act of 2013. now. despite the bills title. it has almost nothing to do with national strategic and critical minerals production. in fact. under the guise of promoting the development of minerals critical to the united states national security. this legislation would reshape mining decisions on public lands for almost all minerals. mr. chairman. the bills classification of \"critical minerals\" is so broad that even sand and gravel and other such things can fall under its definition. critical and strategic minerals? the democratic amendments we will consider today will attempt to tailor this legislation to cover only minerals that are truly critical and strategic and will address the egregious provisions that would truncate important environmental review. make no mistake. this bill is a giveaway. it is free mining. no royalties. no protection of public interest. exemption from royalty payments. near exemption from environmental regulations. near exemption from legal enforcement of the protections. and its unnecessary. there is a real debate that we could be having about the mining laws in this country. it should start with reforming the mining law of 1872. which is as archaic as its name suggeststhe mining law of 1872. we should be discussing abandoned mine reclamation. we should be discussing ensuring taxpayers a fair return on industrial development of our public lands. mr. chairman. in the natural resources committee markup on may 15 of this year where h.r. 761 was reported out on a nearly party line vote. the committee also reported two other bills on a bipartisan basis. two other bills that would lay the groundwork for developing critical and strategic mineral production. those bills. h.r. 1063. the national strategic and critical minerals policy act of 2013. and h.r. 981. the rare act. were unanimously reported out of the natural resources committee and legitimately would be worth debating here in the house as part of any serious effort to improve our understanding of critical strategic mineral deposits and to aid in their development. we reported out bills on a bipartisan basis that would do what this legislation purports to do. we could be discussing those bills. instead. were taking up legislation which is a giveaway. the legislation we could be dealing with would actually deal with strategic and critical minerals. now. if the majority were to bring it to the floor. im sure it would pass in an overwhelming. bipartisan way and would likely be passed by the other body and signed into law. in fact. in the last congress. the national strategic and critical minerals policy actnot to be confused with the production act that we are considering todaywas supported by the national mining association. the president and ceo of the national mining association issued a statement when that bill passed out of committee last congress. and he said: \"the house natural resources committee took important bipartisan action today to ensure u.s. manufacturers. technology innovators. and our military have a more stable supply of minerals vital to the products they produce and use.\" he went on to say that legislation. \"will provide a valuable assessment of our current and future mineral demands and our ability to meet more of our needs through domestic minerals production.\" we could be considering legislation like that. we should be able to work in a bipartisan fashion when it comes to improving our supply of rareearth minerals and other strategic minerals and ensuring that we are not dependent on china and other nations for their supply. but the majority seems to be not interested in that. evidently. they dont want to work in a bipartisan fashion to produce legislation that all sides out there in the country. in industry. people who look after public lands and the environment could agree on. instead. theyre moving this bill. h.r. 761. which has almost nothing to do with strategic minerals. is really about giveaways to the mining industry. this bill would be a trojan horse if it were to become law. however. it has no chance of becoming law. maybe the american people should be grateful we wont pass this giveaway. that the american peoplei say. those american people who dont stand to get rich by this mining giveaway. but can the american people really feel good that were wasting time and actually not looking after the critical and strategic minerals that american products. american defense depends on? why are we playing these games? why. i should say. are they playing these games with our legitimate needs to develop strategic minerals? we should be working in the kind of fashion that led to last years bill. the majority should shelf this giveaway to the mining industry and bring to the floor serious proposals that we could honestly debate as part of a legitimate bipartisan discussion regarding rareearth policy and supply. i reserve the balance of my time.","mr. president. hearings on the environmental protection agencys regulatory agenda will be held in kentucky this week. one hearing will be held today in frankfort and another later this week in pikeville. since congress is in session this week. i will not be able to attend these important hearings in person. but i will have a representative on hand at each hearing. and i wish to express my thoughts on the matter on the senate floor. similar to most of the country. kentucky is suffering from very difficult economic times. far too many kentuckians are unemployed. and the prospect for future employment remains daunting. that is why it is especially irritating that this administration has blindly followed ideological policies that eliminate jobs in our communities. the people of kentucky are amongst the hardest working people on the planet. but how can they be expected to compete if our own government is actually working against them? simply put. my constituents are under siege from the obama administrations regulatory agenda. and the epa is the worst offenderthe very worst. perhaps the clearest example of this administrations regulatory assault is its war on coal. since being sworn in. president obamas epa has set out to circumvent the will of congress and the american people by turning the already cumbersome mine permitting process into a backdoor means of shutting down coal mines. mr. president. 18.000 kentuckians work in coal mining. and nearly 200.000 more. including farmers. realtors. and transportation workers. rely on the coal industry for their jobs. coal brings in more than $3.5 billion from out of state and pays more than $1 billion in direct wages every year. attacking an industry so important to kentucky will only succeed in putting people out of work. impeding future job growth. and increasing energy prices. a former senior epa official under the obama administration recently summed up the regulatory philosophy of the agency with respect to those working in the coal business by saying it wants to \"crucify\" them. let me say that again. this was a regulator. with respect to those working in the coal business. saying it wants to \"crucify\" them. with this radical environmental anticoal agenda. it is no wonder the administration has failed to answer the call of the american people for greater domestic energy production. the realworld impact of their fantasy world energy policy is that people are losing their jobs and energy prices will rise even further. it is high time the obama administration stop treating the kentucky coal industry as the problem and start recognizing that it has been and will continue to be part of the solution. mr. president. i yield the floor.","first of all. i want to be clear that i support the funding to protect the citizens of the midwest from flooding. and. in fact. louisiana has gotten more money than probably anybody else. i come from florida. we have disasters. natural disasters. all of the time. but the reason there is no funding for flood protection is because the republican leadership cut the funding and the republican members supported it. let me be clear. i support the funding for the disaster. as the ranking member of the transportation subcommittee on rail. i find that these funding cuts which would block all of the remaining unobligated highspeed rail funding approved by the economic stimulus entirely unacceptable. and i am sick and tired of members coming to the floor saying that the stimulus money was a disaster. it is not a disaster that we put people to work in florida and throughout this country. and. in fact. if it wasnt for the stimulus dollars. teachers would have lost their jobs. in one area. we kept firefighters and police officers employed. and that is a job while this economy is turned around. and lets not forget how we got in this mess. institutional memory is in order. when you have your head in the lions mouth. you pull it out. you ease it out. what happened? how did we get here? when bill clinton left. we were operating with a surplus. but we had 8 years of bush and two wars. and do you think this mess started 18 months ago? no. it did not. we have been practicing what i call reverse robin hood for 8 years. nobody remembers that. when you kept giving tax breaks to the rich and billionaires. what happened here in december? almost $800 billion that you gave to the not just millionaires. billionaires. and yet you come up saying in june and april. we cant send the pension checks. yes. were spending money up here. but its the priorities you have. you dont have the priorities of taking care of the elderly people. you want to cut medicaid and medicare and social security while you give billionairesbillionairestax breaks. and millionaires. and now you want to cut money for highspeed rail. but we know for every billion dollars that we spend for highspeed rail. it generates 44.000 permanent jobs. but yes. we have some governors that are shortsighted. like my governor rick scott of florida that sent back almost $3 billion. we have 11 percent unemployment. what was he thinking about? i guess he was thinking he didnt want to see those people going to work and making barack obama look good. even though we have the most congestion in that area. and that our competition is there. if you look at spain. if you look at france. you look at germany. 200 miles. 1 hour and 15 minutes. that is the future of our country. but we have some shortsighted people here. people who only want to see. you know. well. we need to balance the budget. well. where were you when they were giving tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires? and you do it over and over again. thats the sad thing. if you put it on the board. put it on the board today. you would have the same vote. you would have the exact same vote. and every opportunity you have to vote. you vote to give millionaires and billionaires tax breaks. so. you know. we started the rail system. and we are now the caboose. and we dont even use cabooses any more. i am hoping that the american people will wake up. it is shameful that over and over again in the peoples house. in the peoples house. we attack the people who do not have lobbyists on capitol hill. and so i yield back the balance of my time. but i do know that elections have consequences. the american people are watching you. i have voted five times to raise the debt ceiling. why did i do it under bush? because i knew it was in the best interest of this country and not the politics of the time.","mr. president. i rise to express my concern that the senate may adjourn this week without extending the 2001 and 2003 tax relief provisions which are slated to expire on january 1. these tax laws include important reforms such as the 10 percent tax rate. relief from the marriage penalty. and the child tax credit. they provide tax relief to nearly 90 percent of all mainers. if they are not extended. virtually every maine family and manyindeed. mostof our small businesses will see their taxes increase. if these tax relief provisions are not extended. the typical american family of four with a household income of approximately $50.000 will see their taxes increase by about $2.900 next year. that is right. coupled with tax increases that are included in the new health care reform law. which i opposed. the result would be one of the largest tax increases in our history. many economists contend this is the worst possible time to increase taxes because our economy is so fragile. i fully agree. i cannot imagine anyone even contemplating increasing taxes in the midst of a recession. the consequences for small businesses would also be dire. higher taxes would take critical investment dollars away. leaving less for innovation and expansion. not to mention employee wages and benefits. raising taxes when the economy is still weak would make it difficult and in some cases impossible for small businesses to start. grow. and create jobs. peter orszag. president obamas former omb director. recently penned and oped for the new york times in which he argued that this is no time to raise taxes. as he pointed out. the failure to extend existing tax relief would \"make an already stagnating job market worse.\" he went on to say: higher taxes now would crimp consumer spending. further depressing the already inadequate demand for what firms are capable of producing at full tilt. i hope president obama will heed the advice of his former budget director and abandon his plan to raise taxes at this critical time. it is important to understand that many small businesses are passthrough entities such as sole proprietorships. partnerships. and s corporations. these small businesses must report their earnings on their owners individual income tax returns. the joint committee on taxation has estimated that there are some 750.000 passthrough small businesses in the top two tax brackets. i wish to share with my colleagues examples of a couple small businesses in maine that would be hurt by this tax increase. they are representative of many others. of course. this august. i toured several remarkable businesses in my home state. their products are diverse and their histories vary greatly. but they share the traits of ingenuity. energy. and a commitment to excellence. the employees and the owners of these small businesses work so hard. an example is d&amp;g machine products of westbrook. its name and products may not be familiar to the general public. but it is internationally known and respected throughout the pulp and paper. high technology. power. petrochemical. food processing. aerospace. and defense industries. its precision design machining and fabrication operations put maine on the cutting edge of innovation. as is so often the case. success started small with this small business. d&amp;g was founded in 1967 by dave gushee and fred loring in a onecar garage behind daves home. they specialized in producing custom tooling and dyes for equipment manufacturers in the portland area and soon added fabrication and welding services. d&amp;gs founding principles of quality. attention to detail and delivering unsurpassed customer satisfaction paid off. within a few years. this young company outgrew the tiny garage and expanded into sophisticated design and engineering services. today d&amp;g has more than 100.000 square feet of shop space and more than 130 highly skilled and dedicated employees. i met many of them during my tour last month. duane gushee. who now runs the company. tells me he is very concerned about the impact higher taxes would have on his companys ability to compete. duane pointed out to me that his company does not compete primarily against other maine firms or even against other u.s. companies. it has to compete successfully with companies all around the world for markets and customers. without constant innovation and investment in cutting edge technology. d&amp;g will lose its customers. and its employees will lose their jobs. if we dont act. the tax increase that will hit d&amp;g on january 1 will take money out of its bottom line. money that is needed to upgrade equipment and stay ahead of foreign competition. another small business i visited is pottles transportation. a trucking company headquartered in bangor. this company was founded in 1972. and it has grown to more than 200 employees with 150 trucks. pottles now provides service throughout the continental united states and canada. although it concentrates its efforts in the northeast. it is known for maintaining an impressive ontime delivery record without sacrificing safety. in fact. it has received award after award in recognition of its safety record. pottles is also known for its commitment to the environment. pottles is a member of epas smartway program and received the epa environmental merit award in 2008. the past few years have been very tough on the trucking industry. barry pottle. who runs the company. tells me that 1.100 trucking companies around the country have gone under so far this year. his company is in the black right now. but it is a real struggle to generate the capital needed to keep his trucks on the road. pottles needs to buy 25 to 30 trucks every year just to maintain its fleet. new trucks used to cost the company about $100.000. but in the past few years. the cost has gone up by another $25.000. barry tells me this is due to an excise tax on heavy trucks passed in 2006 and new environmental regulations that require $13.000 in emissions equipment on each new truck. together. these changes have raised pottles annual cost of doing business by about threequarters of $1 million. on top of this. barry has to worry about the tax increases his company will face if the 2001 and 2003 tax relief laws expire at the end of this year. visiting these businesses and others. reading what economists such as peter orszag have said. has confirmed my belief that the administration must reverse its present course. which is stifling job growth. discouraging entrepreneurship and risk taking. and hobbling the economic recovery. americans should be proud of the spirit. the drive. and the determination that has produced small business success stories such as d&amp;g machine products and pottles transportation. we in washington must recognize that the policies we adopt or the tax laws we fail to extend have an impact on whether these companies can start up. grow. prosper. and. most of all. create good jobs. so what i have suggested we do as a compromise is to extend these two important tax relief laws for another 2 years. that will get us through this recession. it will send a strong signal to the business community. i cannot tell you how many businesses have told me they are holding on to capital right now. they do not dare invest to create much needed jobs because of the uncertainty of what is going to happen on tax policy. we know we need to revamp our tax code. we need to make it fairer. we need to make it simpler. but for right now the best thing we could do would be to extend those two lawsthe 2001 and 2003 tax reform lawsfor an additional 2 years to provide certainty to businesses and to send a strong signal that we get it. we know we should not increase taxes in the midst of a recession. one of the most startling conversations i had during august was with a small businessman who owns a small community grocery store. he told me he had an opportunity to buy a second store in another rural maine town. he said he had the financing in place to make the purchase. and he would like to create more jobs and keep this small business going serving the needs of the community. i said to him: well. why dont you just do it? interest rates are low. so it seems like a good time. is the uncertainty about what is coming out of washington keeping you from acting? he said: you know. senator. it is not so much the uncertainty. it is the certainty. the certainty of higher taxes. of more regulation. of having to pay more for health insurance for my employees. it is the certainty of more spending. that is what is discouraging me. so i hope we could come together right now. and before we go home pass a 2year extension of the current tax law. to provide some certainty that we are not going to impose higher taxes on the american people and our small businesses.","i would simply close by making the observation that the gentleman talks about other parks. but we are a society. taxpayers in northwest indiana pay for projects that potentially reduce flooding in a city like dallas. texas. the taxpayers in the state of illinois may pay taxes to make an investment at oak ridge in the state of tennessee that. at first blush. may have nothing to do with their interests but enure to the benefits of everyone in the united states. the fact is that this is a national park. it enures to the benefit of every citizen of the united states. and i ask for my colleagues to oppose the

community in minnesotas 3rd congressional district which has played a crucial role in the history and development of our region and state. bloomington is our states 5th largest city and this special city will celebrate its 150th birthday on may 11. the same day the state of minnesota was admitted to the union. if remarks e827 madam speaker. we salute bloomington for its remarkable success. pioneering spirit. record of public service to help people in need and role in positioning both minnesota and the u.s. for a prosperous future in the global economy. bloomington is a place of historic importance situated near the confluence of the mississippi and the minnesota rivers. and in close proximity to historic fort snelling. completed in 1825. the soldiers of fort snelling mediated disputes between minnesotas dakota and ojibwe indians. in 1843. the first european settlers built a cabin near the current 10th avenue circle and taught farming methods to dakota indians. the territory to the west opened to settlers in 1851. bloomington is a city with tremendous historical pride and patriotism and we honor all of bloomingtons courage6us members of our armed forces who have

bloomington. minnesota!","mr. president. this morning and in the days leading up to today. we have seen and heard a great deal of discussion. particularly by the media. describing the issue of the presidents .speech tomorrow evening and all of the discussion in the political system as a political tug of war about iraq. it is not that. this is not a political tug of war. it is a serious moment for this country to try to evaluate what to do about something that overlays almost everything else we are considering these days. that is. the current war in iraq. what do we do about what is happening there? it is about the lives of our soldiers. it is about our countrys future. it is about how to make change in iraq. how to create the kind of change that will give us the opportunity to do the right thing. i intend to listen carefully to what the president says in his speech to the nation tomorrow night. i am not going to prejudge what he says. but let me suggest what i think the president has to answer for us. for me. for the american people. there is considerable discussion about the fact that the president will likely call for a surge or an increase in american troops going to iraq. there is also discussion that perhaps he will call for additional funds that would be sent to iraq for reconstruction or other things americans would contribute. one point the president will have to explain is the testimony that was given less than 2 months ago before the senate by general abizaid. the top military commander in iraq. i am talking about the top military commander of american troops in iraq. here is what general abizaid said in november. less than 2 months ago. he said: i met with every divisional commander. general casey. the corps commander. general dempsey. we all talked together. and i said. \"in your professional opinion. if we were to bring in more american troops now. does that add considerably to our ability to achieve success in iraq?\" and they all said no. the reason is because we want the iraqis to do more. it is easy for the iraqis to rely upon us to do this work. i believe that more american forces prevent the iraqis from doing more. from taking more responsibility for their own future. this is testimony before a congressional committee of the top u.s. military commander in iraq saying he has asked all of his top commanders. if we were to bring in more american troops now. does it add considerably to our ability to achieve success in iraq. he said: they all said no. that is something i believe has to be reconciled. has that changed? has something changed in 2 months? with respect to the amount of money that is sent to the country of iraq. i observe this: this country has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on the iraq war. between iraq and afghanistan. we are now approaching $400 billion. we appropriated separately roughly a $20 billion pot of money for reconstruction in iraq. that is in addition to the reconstruction which has been done by american soldiers. that $20plus billion was pushed out the doora massive amount of moneyin a short time. i held a good number of hearings as chairman of the democratic policy committee on that issue: contracting in iraq. i think it is the most significant amount of waste. fraud. and abuse this country has ever seen.* let me show one poster that describes a part of it. which was shown at our hearing and we discussed this: a $243 million program led by the united states army corps of engineers to build 150 health care clinics in iraq has. in some cases. produced little more than empty shells of crumbling concrete and shattered bricks cemented together into uneven walls. a company called the parsons corporation got this money. they were to rehabilitate. i believe. 142 health clinics in the country of iraq. twentywere done. and the rest didnt happen at all. the money was spent. all the money is gone. the american taxpayers found that all their money was gone. but the fact is that the health clinics were not rehabilitated. there was a doctor. a physician from iraq. who testified. he said: i went to the health minister of the new government of iraq. i said: i want to see these health clinics that were supposed to have been rehabilitated for which some $200 million was appropriated by the u.s.. taxpayers. by the u.s. government. i want to see these health clinics. he said the health minister of the new government of iraq said: you dont understand. they dont exist. they are imaginary clinics. well. our money is gone. this is an example of the waste. fraud. and abuse in contracting. the halliburton corporation. custer battles corporationit is unbelievablethe stories. this photo shows some american officials with $100 bills wrapped in saran wrap the size of a big brick. this fellow testified at a hearing i held. this man in the white shirt. he said: look. we told contractors in iraq: bring a bag. we pay cash. he said it was like the wild west: bring a sack. we pay cash. this $2 million in $100 dollar bills wrapped in saran wrap actually went to custer battles corporation. custer battles corporation got over $100 million in contracts. among other things. it is alleged they took forklift trucks from the baghdad airport. took them over to a warehouse. repainted them. and then sold them to the coalition provisional authority. which was us. it is a criminal action at this point. my point is this: whatever we do in iraq. i want to be effective. we owe it to the troops. we owe it to the men and women who wear americas uniform. at this point. we have americas troops in the middle of a civil war. yes. most of this is sectarian violence. we see the reports. january 7: 30 dead in baghdad. bodies hang from lampposts. the government said saturday that 72 bodies were recovered around the city. most showing signs of torture. we see these day after day after day. our heart breaks for the innocent victims of this war. the question for us now is. should american troops be in the middle of that civil war? should we send additional troops to that circumstance? if so. for what purpose? and if so. why do we do it less than 2 months after general abizaid said the commanders do not believe additional troops will be effective? we have done what is called a surge in baghdad starting last july. i believe it was somewhere around 15.000 additional troops were sent to baghdad. the fact is. the violence increased. more soldiers died. i am going to listen to president bushs speech. this ought not. and i hope will not and should not be political. it is about all of us. republicans and democrats. the president and the congress working together to find a way for the. right solution for this country to support our soldiers. make the right judgments for them. make the right judgments for our countrys longterm interests. yes. we have a fight against terrorism that wemust wage. and we must do it aggressively. but most of what is going on in iraq at this point is sectarian violence. and it is. in fact. a civil war. the question is. what do we do now? it seems to me that if we are going to keep american troops in iraq for any length of time. we ought to consider partitioning so at least we separate the combatants and the sectarian violence. it only seems to me. in a civil war. that works. but i will listen intently tomorrow with my colleagues to -hear what the presidents new plan is. i hope we can work together in a way that begins to do what is in the best interest of this country. i am very skeptical about this issue of deciding that we are going to surge additional troops into iraq. even as the top military commanders in iraq say that should not be done. i mentioned iraq first because it overwhelms most of the other agenda here. but there are so many other issues with which we must deal. lets deal with iraq and get that right. support our troops. do what is necessary. do what is best for our country. lets work together. republicans and democrats. lets work together. the president and the congress. and find the right solution and do what is right for our future. then lets turn to other issues. how about energy? it is interesting. we are held hostage by foreign oil. over 60 percent of the oil that runs the american economy comes from off our shores. when we talk about energy independence. we need energy independence. and i support fossil fuels. we are going to use oil. coal. and natural gas. we always have and we always will. and i support that. but let me say this: in 1916. this congress put in place tax incentives for the production of oil. longterm. robust. permanent tax incentives to incentivize the additional production of oil. think how different it is with what we have done with renewable energy. we decided about 20 years ago to give some tax incentives to incentivize renewable energy development. but they were temporary. short term. the production tax credit for the production of wind and other renewable energy has been extended five times because it has been short term. it has been allowed to expire three times. that is not a commitment to this country. this is n6t a commitment to renewable energy. this is not a commitment to energy independence. the fact is. we are just babystepping our away along in all these areas. we didnt do that with oil. we made a robust. longterm commitment in 1916. and it remains today. that said: lets produce. how about doing the same thing for renewable energy? yes. the biofuels. but also wind energy and hydrogen fuel cells and all the other ways that can make us more secure from an energy standpoint. lets stop babystepping. lets have a 10year plan. we cannot do this with a 1year plan or a 2year plan. we need to deal with that issue. we need to deal with the issue of health care costs. i wanted to. but i dont have the time this morning. to respond to my colleague from iowa who twice has come to the floor to talk about why our government shouldnt be allowed to negotiate drug prices in the medicare program. it is preposterous that we have a provision in law that prevents the federal government from negotiating lower drug prices. especially because our consumers in this country pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in the world. and that is unfair. i relish that debate. and i wait for that debate. jobs and tradethe fact is. we have lots of issues we need to sink our teeth into. i am going to come back and speak about many of these issues at great length. first. we have to deal with this situation in iraq. that is very important. that is about the lives of men and women who wear americas uniform. but it is more than that as well. it is about what we are doing around the world. it is about. yes. our lives and our treasure. and we need to get that right. i mentioned when i started that i think the press. if one listens to all the programs. tend to portray this as a political tug of war. it is deadly serious. much more serious than a political tug of war. it is about trying to get this right for our countrys future. i hope that in the coming several weeks. we can come to a conclusion about this very important issueyes. the war in iraq. the larger war on terrorism. deal with some of these issues. such as homeland securityand then move on to begin to address the issues i just talked about as well. that is. the issue of energy security. health care costs. jobs. trade. and a series of issues that are important for this countrys future. mr. president. i yield the floor.","mr. speaker. i thank the gentleman from pennsylvania for yielding. and i am delighted to be here on the floor with two of my colleagues who have been tremendous advocates of this free trade agreement and of the concept of free trade. the principle of free trade internationally and in our country. i want to make two general points. i am sorry that i wasnt able to be here earlier. and i do not want to repeat what my colleagues have said. but there are two important overall points that i want to make that. even if you have made them. are worth thinking again about. first is why free trade is important. retirees simply do not. by definition. buy enough consumer goods to drive an economy our size. we are accustomed to a standard of living that is. frankly. the highest in the world. our children expect to grow up and participate as adults in an economy that is thriving. in wellpaying jobs that can provide them with a standard of living that my generation has enjoyed. yet as the number of retirees explodesand the number of young people in the workforce contracts. our own nation cannot provide the demand for goods that can produce the overall gross national product that will assure the standard of living we are accustomed to. so future generations are going to be more dependent on trade than we have been. and we must open markets for their goods. the american -population will not be able to buy the amount of stuff that would drive an economy that can produce thle standard of living that we have enjoyed. so if we do not have consumers around the world. and. remember. the great majority of consumers are outside the united states. if we do not cultivate them. if they do not open their markets to our products. then we cannot sustain the level of economic wellbeing. the standard of living to which we have been accustomed. and we thereby disadvantage our children. this small agreement with one small country will allow consumer and industrial goods to enter that country 100 percent duty free. one hundred percent duty free. and agricultural products will enter 87 percent duty free and over 10 years reach 100 percent duty free. this is a small market. but we are making these agreements with country after country after country. and most startling. our exports are growing most rapidly and the majority of our growth in export goods is with those countries that we have negotiated trade agreements with. now. that stands to reason because if you sell your goods into a country where there is no duty. they are going to do better than if you sell them into a country where there is a 20 percent. 30 percent. 40 percent. 50 percent duty that pushes that price right up. so in the big picture. our children. our grandchildren cannot do well unless we lay the foundation by opening markets for* american products all across the world. so our economic wellbeing depends on free trade agreements. those free trade agreements. and the gentlemen here on the floor with me tonight have been strong advocates of fair trade agreements. these free trade agreements address labor standards. environmental standards. we are the only nation in the whole world that pushes those issues in the negotiation of trade agreements with other countries. and we are reaching new standards as we move forward and gain more experience. now we do. not just require labor standards. we help nations build institutions to enforce those standards. so we look at do you have a department of labor. we look at does the department of labor have sufficient staff to enforce the law. we look at do the regulations take seriously the responsibility of enforcement. and we literally help nations not only understand how labor standards help them deliver the benefits of world trading to all in their society. but we help them understand that just having the standards to support all their people is not enough. you do have to be able to enforce those standards. you do have to be able to take action against the exploitive employer. so these trade agreements are good for our kids. they are good for peoples of the world. and that brings me to my second major point. our security depends on agreements like that we have negotiated with oman. the 9/11 commission report cited our middle eastern free trade agreements and call for action on \"a comprehensive u.s. strategy that should include economic policies that encourage development. more open societi~s. and opportunities for people to improve the lives of their families and enhance the prospects of their childrens future.\" in other words. the 9/11 report was saying if you do not address the causes that are creating terrorism and the willingness to be terrorists in other societies. you cannot solve the problem. and i want to just conclude by saying how very impressed i was when ways and means committee members a little less than 2 years ago made a trip to the middle eastern nations that were interested in trade agreements and whose other trading agreements were about to expire. . 2100 we knew that they would need to think about this in advance carefully. we know that participating in trade agreements means other countries have to modernize their law to meet high international standards. we knew it would take time. and we wanted to be sure to alert these other countries to the challenges that lay ahead for them in negotiating these free trade agreements and to the enormous benefits that would accrue to their people in not only the present but future generations. i must say. i was extremely impressed with the sultan of oman. he understood exactly what this was going to mean to his people. he is one of the middle east leaders who understands that oil is a limited resource and he must prepare a broader base for economic success for his people in his own country. and he is doing some of the work in the more advanced areas of desalinization. thinking about the importance of water to his people and the demand in the world economy. particularly in the middle east. for potable water. he is a very forwardlooking man. he is very committed to participation in the political process by women as well as men. he has appointed successful women to his top council. they do things slightly differently because they are coming from a different path. but he was very proud to have started worker committees. that was his initiative. because he knows workers have to have a better voice. they have to be free to talk about the problems. to work with management. to work with owners for everyones success. in this agreement. he has moved light years ahead. looking at the labor laws of other countries. understanding what it is going to take to provide the kind of support and protection that working people need in order for the benefits of trade to affect the lives. the quality of lives. the hopes and dreams. the opportunities of all the people in each society. so when you look at not only the way this agreementopens markets and what that means for our people. when you look at what this means for our security as this great friend of ours. for over 170 years. and a leader in the region in economic and governance re-. forms. what they accomplish by moving forward into new thinking and new institutions to modernize their economy. all embodied in this trade agreement. you know it means not only greater prosperity for his country and for our country. it means greater peace for the world. free trade is about peace and prosperity. it must be fair trade. it must help all take part in the benefits of the trade agreement. this is a remarkable agreement. and i very much appreciate the two gentlemen on the floor here. mr. ryan of wisconsin and mr. english of pennsylvania. for their diligent participation in all the consultative processes. because congress is a part of developing these free trade agreements. that make these agreements possible. your knowledge and expertise is truly a great service that you have given this country and that you have given our friend. oman.","mr. president. one of the most striking things about the devastation caused by hurricane katrina is that the majority of stranded victims were our societys most vulnerable memberslowincome families. the elderly. the homeless. the disabled. many did not own cars. many believed themselves unable to flee the city. unable to forego the income from missed work. unable to incur the expenses of travel. food and lodging. some may have misunderstood the severity of the warnings. if they heard the warnings at all. some may have needed help that was unavailable. whatever the reason. they were not evacuated and we have seen the horrific results. this failure to evacuate so many of the most desperate citizens of the gulf coast leads me to introduce today a bill to require states and the nation to consider the needs of our neediest citizens in times of emergency. it appears that certain assumptions were made in planning and preparing for the worst case scenario in the gulf coast. after all. most of those who could afford to evacuate managed to do so. they drove out of town and checked into hotels or stayed with friends and family. but what about the thousands of people left behind because they had special needs? how many of us will forget the tragedy that occurred at st. ritas nursing home in st. bernard parish. la. where an estimated 32 of the 60 residents perished in the rising floodwaters in the aftermath of hurricane katrina? our charge as public servants is to worry about all of the people. i am troubled that our emergency response and disaster plans were inadequate for large segments of the gulf coast population. i wonder whether the plans in other regions are adequate. perfect evacuation planning is obviously impractical. but greater advance preparation can ensure that the most vulnerable are not simply forgotten or ignored. thats why the bill i am introducing today. along with cosponsors senators","mr. president. today i introduce legislation that keeps the small business administration and its financing and counseling assistance available to small businesses. small businesses need us to act now to keep critical assistance available to our nations biggest job creators. there should not be any objections to this bill. it has broad support in the small business and the lending communities. the lending provisions of the bill have the support of small borrowers that testified before congress over the past few weeks and the support of a coalition of small business trade associations. including the trade associations of 504 lenders and of 7(a) lenders. the american bankers association and the independent community bankers association. as well as the national small business alliance and the u.s. chamber of commerce. and the womens business center provisions have the support of womens trade associations such as women impacting public policy and the association of wombns business centers. this bill authorizes the sba and most of its programs through the may 15. 2004. which will allow time for the house to complete its work on the sbas 3year reauthorization bill. passed by the senate in september 2003. in addition. this bill addresses several urgent issues that are critical to keep sba programs operating and helping small businesses across the country. let me outline these for you. the first provision authorizes the continued operation of the sbas 504 loan guarantee program for the rest of fiscal year 2004. unless we act. the authority to operate this program will expire on march 15. next monday. and small businesses in need of financing for fixed assets will be turned away. these loans are for growing small businesses that need loans with long repayment terms and fixed interest rates to afford a new building or perhaps land to expand their business and their workforce. or equipment to improve or increase production. the lenders who make these loans serve a unique role in our economythey develop economic opportunities where conventional lenders are not willing to take a risk. they are not a shy group. and care deeply about the communities where they live. i am sure most. if not all. senators have received numerous calls and communications from them over the past few weeks. it is my hope that extending authorization will provide some stability to the industry so that they continue to fund our growing businesses. and then in the near future. the house will consider our more comprehensive sba reauthorization legislation. bill number s. 1375. that we passed in september. to enact other important 504 program improvements that are supported by the small business community. this loan program requires no appropriations because it is funded entirely by fees that borrowers and lenders pay. the second provision keeps open the doors of our most experienced and successful womens business centers. again without added cost to the treasury. this bill contains a small adjustment to the womens business center program that updates the current funding formula. the adjustment changes the portion of funding allowed for womens business centers in the sustainability part of the program to keep up with the increasing number of centers that will need funding this fiscal year. in short. this change directs the sba to reserve 48 percent of the appropriated funds for the sustainability centers. instead of 30 percent. which will give the most experienced centers the greatest opportunity to receive sustainability funding. while still allowing for new centers and protecting existing ones. currently there are 88 womens business centers. of these. 35 are in the initial grant program and 53 will have graduated to the sustainability part of","mr. president. i thank the democratic whip for his concern and his words. - i want to correct a couple of things. the senator from missouri pointed out that catalytic converters are fire hazards. that may be true with some. but virtually every automobile. every pickup truck. every sport utility vehicle driving on the roads and highways of california today is equipped with a catalytic converter. it has been that way for a substantial period of time. catalytic converters are nothing new. secondly. i want you to know that honda has said that they would increase their u.s. production of these engines even with the california regulation. so. in other words. there are other companies manufacturing these engines in the united states that have said they would adhere to these new regulations and produce cleaner engines. thirdly. i want you to know that briggs &amp; stratton has already moved some of its operations to china. i very much doubt that this california regulation has much to do with it. i am told they have been manufacturing in china since 1986. and in april of this year they increased their ownership share of two factories in china from 52 percent to a controlling 90 percent. i am also told that california regulators have incorporated briggs &amp; strattons own recommendations into its final rule issued in september. the air resources board relaxed the regulations exhaust emissions standard. relying instead on controlling evaporative emissions. as recommended by briggs &amp; stratton. so i dont know why this is being done. but i will tell you one thing: everybody who votes to sustain this will be also voting to put 70 more tons of smog into californias skies in 2010. that is how important this issue is to our state. i yield the floor.","mr. president. the recent debate shows the challenges our country faces in balancing environmental protection with our nations energy security. containing nearly 95 percent of our countries surface fresh water. the great lakes. are a natural treasure which we must work to protect. today i offered an amendment which would request that the secretary of energy. in consultation with representatives of the appropriate federal and state agencies and the national academy of science. conduct a study of the transmission of natural gas and electricity across the great lakes and report back to congress within 365 days regarding the impacts of such lines and recommendations for minimizing their environmental impact. as the cleanest fossil fuel. natural gas will play an increasingly important role in addressing our nations energy demands. even today. natural gas consumption is forecasted to increase at over 2 percent per year. however. the infrastructure for transporting natural gas is already strained. to address this problem. a number of companies have applied for permits to place pipelines and electric transmission lines across the great lakes. one such project is a pipeline which would transport up to 700 million cubic feet of natural gas per day to new york and the northeast. the pipeline would cross the bottom of lake erie for 93.8 miles. from port stanley. ontario to ripley. ny. this pipeline will be constructed using a new technique called jet trenching. which will suspend two and a half million cubic yards of sediment in lake erie. much of this sediment may be contaminated and the effects of its redistribution are at best. unknown. further. no one has analyzed the capacity of the lakes to handle suspended sediments. it is obvious that energy transmission infrastructure is important. but it is critical that we understand the impacts of placing this infrastructure across the lake beds. it is also imperative that we develop a long term strategy for their placement. this amendment would require the department of energy to examine these questions and make recommendations on how to assure that these incredible bodies of water are protected for future generations. this amendment is simple. but its role in addressing the challenges we now face is essential. i want to thank my colleagues in supporting this amendment.","mr. president-. i rise to introduce the water adjudication fee fairness act of 2001. this bill would require the federal government to pay the same filing fees and costs associated with state water rights adjudications as is currently required of states and private parties. to establish relative rights to waterwater that. is the lifeblood of many states. particularly in the weststates must conduct lengthy. complicated. and expensive proceedings in water rights adjudications. in 1952. congress recognized the necessity and benefit of requiring federal claims to be adjudicated in these state proceedings by adopting the mccarran amendment. the mccarran amendment waives the sovereign immunity of the united states and requires the federal government to submit to state court jurisdiction and to file water rights claims in state general adjudication proceedings. these federal claims are typically among the most complicated and largest of claims in state adjudications. and federal agencies are often the primary beneficiary of adjudication proceedings where states officially quantify and record their water rights. however. in 1992. the united states supreme court held that. under existing law. the u.s. need not pay fees for processing federal claims. when the united states does not pay a proportionate share of the costs associated with adjudications. the burden of funding the proceedings unfairly shifts to other water users and often delays completion of the adjudications by diminishing the resources necessary to complete them. delays in completing adjudications result in tho inability to protect private and public property interests or determine how much unappropriated water may remain to satisfy important environmental and economic development priorities. additionally. because they are not subject to fees and costs like other water users in the adjudication. federal agencies can file questionable claims without facing court costs. inflating the number of their claims for future negotiation purposes. this creates an unlevel playing field favoring the federal agencies and places a further financial and resources burden on the system. for example. in the snake river basin adjudication. which is in idaho and is probably the largest water adjudication proceeding in the country. the united states forest service filed more than 3.700 federal claims. the idaho department of water resources expended thousands of dollars giving notice to all other claimants. additionally the state of idaho and private claimants spent over $800.000 preparing objections to. the federal services claims. on the eve of the objection deadline. the us withdrew all but 71 of the claimsthe department of justices explanation: litigation strategy. this example is not an isolated incident. at best. the .taxpayers and states should not be forced to incur these costs simply because the agency does not take the time to seriously evaluate its claims. at worst. the taxpayers should not bear the brunt of the federal governments machiavellian tactics. i recognize that the federal government has a legitimate right to some reserved water rights. however. the federal government should play by the same rules as the states and other private users. the water adjudication fee fairness act is legislation that remedies this situation by subjecting the united states. when party to a general adjudication. to the same fees and costs as state and private users in water rights adjudications. this measure has the full support of the western states water council and the western governors association. i ask my colleagues to join me in supporting water users. taxpayers. the states. and welcome their cosponsorship. i ask unanimous consent that a copy of this legislation be printed in the record.","mr. president. i rise today to talk about something closer to home for me. perhaps one of the most important things that has ever been known or understood in the economy of missouri is the missouri river. it is part of thd lifeblood of our state. it transports commerce from one part of the state to another and from our state down through the mississippi to the gulf of mexico and around the world. there are some troublesome issues regarding the flows in the missouri river. they relate to the energy and water appropriations bill which includes specific measures relating to language in this years bill that is identical to language found in previous bills. under normal senate procedure once a committee acts and reports out a bill. the bill comes to the floor. and if a senator does not like a certain provision in the bill. then that senator has the right to move to strike that position. that is a guaranteed right. however. it appears that one of the provisions. which is totally consistent with language that has been in previous bills regarding flows in the missouri river system. is not to the liking of some individual senators. in particular. the minority leader has indicated his opposition to section 103. senator daschle has done what he could to prevent debate on this section. and has worked to make sure the bill does not come to the floor at all. that is a harsh and inappropriate way for us to act. if any senator does not like a provision. then that senator can move to strike theprovision. and the senate can vote on such a motion. unfortunately. this election to stall. to interrupt the progress and business of the senate. to say we do not wantto allow a bill to come to the floor as it was reported by the committee and as it has come year after year is a way to interrupt the business of the senate. is inappropriate. i was pleased that earlier this afternoon the majority leader filed a cloture motion on the energy and water appropriations measure. but it is unfortunate that he had to do so. i regret the majority leader had to take such action. but because the democrats insisted on stalling the normal legislative process. such action was necessary. the missouri river and the mississippi river are the two most valued treasures of missouri citizens. they are essential for not only transportation in our state but about 40 percent of all the people in our state get their drinking water out of those rivers. they are important for irrigation and for costefficient transportation. i have had the privilege through the decades of fighting to protect that resource. not only for human consumption but for transportation as well. as attorne3 general. i was involved in litigation that went all the way to the supreme court. i was pleased to be part of that. to be a moving factor in that litigation which protected our waterflows at that time in the river. i watched as the missouri river. when it had inadequate flows paralyzed a community. i remember years ago when i was governor. an ice bridge developed. this was a natural impairment of the flow north of missouri in the river and north of the city of st. joseph. instead of the water flowing down. the ice jam backed up the water. the river levels fell and a great city such as st. joseph. mo. was. without water. when i went to look at the water intake facility for st. joseph. i noticed the water was a foot or two below the intake. we worked night and day to get a new pump and a new system of drawing water out of the river. proper river flows are essential to the wellbeing of our state. in the committee report of the energy and water appropriations bill. section 103 prohibits the expenditure of resources to diminish the flow or to otherwise tamper with the flow of the river because the river flows are so essential to the wellbeing of our state. the corps plan for rewriting the way the river will be managed is known as the missouri river master manual. it would send additional surges of water down in the spring. which would cause flooding. and withhold additional water in the fall. which would cause low levels in the river. if you make the level of the river low in the fall. the crop which has been grown cant be shipped as efficiently when there is inadequate river flow for transportation. of course. you may not have a crop to ship if in the spring you release so much water that you cause widespread flooding. this flooding potential concerns many of our communities. i have worked closely with the rest of the missouri delegation in the congress. the missouri farm bureau. and the midamerica regional council 2000. we uniformly oppose management of the river in a way that would cause flooding in the spring. and then a restriction of the flow of the river in the fall which would make impossible the kind of transportation upon which our farm. agricultural. and other industries must rely. the u.s. fish and wildlife service has recently recommended to the army corps of engineers a spring pulse or spring rise on the missouri river. this recommendation is irresponsible and dangerous. the u.s. fish and wildlife service wants to do this because it is interested in improving environmental conditions for certain species of fish and birds. we all are concerned about fish and birds. the shorebird. the piping plover. and the sharklike pallid sturgeon fish. but this protection should not come at the expense of the lives of thousands of people living downstream. section 103 to h.r. 4733. forbids any funding in the bill from being used to revise the missouri river master water control manual to allow for an increase in the springtime water release program during the spring heavy rainfall and snowmelt period in the states. this spring release. or spring rise. or spring pulse would be dangerous for all citizens living and working downstream from gavins point. located on the border of nebraska and south dakota. it normally takes about 12 days for water to travel from gavins point to st. louis. during the spring. weather in.the midwest is especially unpredictable. it is usually said if you dont like the weather. just wait a bit. if it is that unpredictable. especially in the spring. it is very difficult to correctly predict the weather for a 12day period. and if you are going to send a big pulse of water down the river and then. as you are in the process of. doing so. there is a substantial rainstorm or series of storms that develop. the very purpose of restricting flooding and providing a basis for reasonable flow in the river is defeated. if you are already sending a charge of water down the river that is closer to the capacity of theriver. any additional rain from nature would create widespread flooding in the downstream communities. the combination of a spring rise and a heavy rain during the 12day period would increase greatly the chances for downstream flooding. the spring rise would come at a time of the year when downstream citizens are the most vulnerable to flooding. the corps plan provides less flood control and less navigability than the current plan. thus it should not be imposed. i oppose the corps plan for rewriting the missouri river master manual. and i call on the corps to adopt a plan that better suits a balance among water uses. if the president decides. after we have passed the bill with this same provision in it that we have had in it for the last several years. to veto it. it is his prerogative. but what that tells the citizens of the lower missouri basin is that the clintongore administration is willing to flood downstream midwestern communities. it is that simple. section 103 provides the necessary protection for all citizens downstream from the gavins point dam who live and work -along the banks of the missouri river. in closing. each senator is entitled to his or her opinion on any piece of legislation. but the senator should understand that that opinion should be reflected in the legislative process with opportunities to strike. that opinion should not be expressed by keeping legislation reported by committees from coming to the floor. we simply want to debate section 103 and any motion with regard to this commonsense provision. we are willing to live by the will of the senate in determining what should be the outcome. we believe the availability of this legislation should not be curtailed. especially since it includes identical language found in the last several years of this same energy and water appropriations. as a matter of fact. it is the will of the committee which has sent it to the floor. with that in mind. i look forward to working to protect the interests of missouri citizens. to protect them against flooding in the spring and to protect the output and available water resources for a flow which will support navigation in the fall. i yield the floor.","mr. chairman. thank you for bringing this important bill to the floor. i wish to thank also chairman packard for his leadership and work in crafting this bill. a bill that will directly help the residents of the 11 th congressional district of illinois. mr. speaker. the energy and water development appropriations bill is a good bill. and i ask that all of my colleagues support it. : two specific projects are funded in this bill that are important to the citizens of illinois. both the thornton reservoir project and the kankakee river feasibility study have been given significant and important funding under this bill. the thornton reservoir project continues funding for the tunnel and reservoir project known as tarp. tarp is an intricate -system of underground tunnels and storage reservoirs that provide flood relief and control combined sewer overflow pollution into lake michigan. the source of drinking water for a large portion of the chicago metropolitan area. to the projects merit. the completed segments of tarp have helped to eliminate 86% of combined sewage pollution in a 325 square mile area. the energy and water development appropriations bill will provide $4.5 million dollars in construction funding for the mccook and thornton reservoirs. this funding will go toward continuing construction of the reservoir portion of tarp. once completed. these reservoirs will provide a storage capacity of 15.3 billion gallons and will produce annual benefits of $104 million. the kankakee river is a very important river for residents of the 11th congressional district. as well as the residents of congressmen ewing and buyers districts. the river provides scenic. recreational. and commercial opportunities for many. unfortunately. the river does experience flooding and sedimentation problems both in illinois and indiana. the appropriations committee has been very generous with funding in previous years. providing funds for the army corps of engineers to complete a corps reconnaissance study and begin a feasibility study. for fiscal year 2000. the appropriations committee has provided $295.000 in funding for the army corps of engineers to continue the feasibility study. this is an important project and that will improve the quality of life for those who use or live near the river. i am very pleased to see this continued funding. and thank you again for bringing this important bill to the floor today.","mr. speaker. for the purpose of debate only. i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from ohio . pending which i yield myself such time as i may consume. during consideration of this resolution. all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only. mr. speaker. house resolution 501 is an open rule providing for consideration of h.r. 4194. the va. hud and independent agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999. the rule also includes a customary waiver of section 306 of the budget act relating to the prohibition on including matters within the jurisdiction of the committee on the budget in a measure not reported by it. h. res. 501 provides for one hour of general debate divided equally between the chairman and ranking minority member of the committee on appropriations. the rule provides that the amendment printed in the committee on rules report accompanying the resolution shall be considered as adopted. this amendment. offered by the gentleman from mississippi will require studies on issues related to flame resistant standards and firerelated deaths. the rule waives points of order against provisions in the bill for failure to comply with clause 2 and clause 6 of rule xxi. except as specified in the rule. the rule also makes in order the amendment printed in the congressional record numbered 12 which may be offered only by the gentleman from iowa or a designee. shall be considered as read. shall be debatable for 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by a proponent and an opponent. shall not be subject to amendment and shall not be subject to a demand for division of the question in the house or in the committee of the whole. the rule waives all points of order against the amendment. the rule also accords priority in recognition to members who have preprinted their amendments in the chairman to postpone recorded votes and reduce to 5 minutes the voting time on any postponed question. provided voting time on any first in a series of questions is not less than 15 minutes. these provisions will facilitate consideration of amendments and guarantee the timely completion of the appropriation bills. house resolution 501 also provides for one motion to recommit with or without instructions. mr. speaker. house resolution 501 is an open rule providing members with every opportunity to amend this appropriations bill. as i stated earlier. the committee on rules has made in order an amendment to be offered by the gentleman from iowa consisting of the text of h.r. 2. the united states housing act. which passed the house by an overwhelming 293 to 132 vote last year. this bill will reform failing public housing authorities. impose professional management standards on projects receiving federal money. and impose a rational housing policy reforms. while this legislation passed the house last year. we have allowed it to be offered on this bill because it is necessary to advance this important housing reform legislation before the end of the legislative session. h.r. 4194 appropriates a total of $70.89 billion for fiscal 1999. i want to mention a number of important provisions in this bill. first. as i mentioned. the house will have the opportunity to consider a comprehensive housing reform amendment. however. in addition to these critical reforms. the appropriations bill amply funds housing programs for the nations elderly and the disabled. homeless assistance grants. native american housing. the home program. and increases funding for severely distressed housing. regarding appropriations for our veterans. this country has a commitment to our men and women in uniform and we. as americans. owe these dedicated men and women a debt of gratitude. under this bill. medical care for our nations veterans is funded at $17.1 billion. an increase of $39 million over the presidents request. and veterans medical research is funded at $310 million. $10 million over the presidents request. overall. the department of veterans affairs discretionary programs are funded at $19 billion. $168 million above the presidents request. finally. h.r. 4194 also continues this congress efforts to protect americas environmental resources. this bill provides needed funds for safe drinking water state revolving funds. clean water state revolving funds. state air grants. and a number of programs that will ensure clean water for our citizens. we do not often get credit for our efforts on environmental protection. but this bill is yet another example of the strong environmental protection efforts we have made. the committee on appropriations has balanced a wide array of interests and has ensured that all funding is spent efficiently and where it is needed most. i commend the gentleman from california . chairman. and the ranking minority member. the gentleman from ohio for the bipartisan manner in which they constructed this appropriations bill. h.r. 4194 was favorably reported out of the committee on appropriations. as was the open rule by the committee on rules. i urge my colleagues to support the rule so that we may proceed with general debate and consideration of the merits of this important bill. mr. speaker. i reserve the balance of my time.","mr. speaker. i rise today to mourn the loss of max lyon and karl mueggler. two constituents of mine who were both tragically killed in an avalanche during a skiing trip to utah earlier this month. max and karl will be missed by many. especially by their students at the chadwick school in palos verdes. max served as the schools outdoor education program director since 1990 and was nationally known for his work in teaching youngsters about nature. karl was an outdoor education instructor since 1991 and worked withmax to keep chadwick students in touch with our environment. max and karl touched the life of every chadwick student. whether it was on one of their kayak trips to baja california or on one of their rockclimbing adventures in joshua tree. max and karl taught chadwick youngsters how important it is to preserve and protect our environmenl max and karl understood that unless todays children take an active role in environmental protection. future generations will never be able to enjoy our countrys outdoor heritage. in the words of nathan reynolds. chadwicks headmaster. \"max and karl taught so many of us to better love and appreciate the world. they affected us all. we are the better because they touched our lives.\" mr. speaker. i ask my colleagues in the house of representatives to join me in extending heartfelt condolences to the lyon and mueggler families.","mr. president. 2 years ago my colleagues. senators kennedy. pell. simon. wellstone. and kerry joined me in asking the general accounting office to study the condition of americas schools. since then. the gao has surveyed 10.000 schools in over 5.000 school districts. they have visited 41 schools and interviewed state officials responsible for school facilities in all 50 states. they have now written six reports documenting the condition of americas schools. today. mr. president. i am pleased to present the final two reports in the series. the first. \"americas schools report differing conditions.\" documents crumbling school facilities in every state. in every region of the country. in every type of community. and in every type of school serving every kind of american child. the second report. \"profiles of school condition by state.\" presents all the information that the gao has compiled on the.condition of school facilities in each state. building conditions and readiness for computers. as well as state funding needs and the level of state support for school facilities. mr. president. these reports document a problem that transcends geographic and demographic boundaries. crumbling schools is not just an innercity problem. it is not just a problem for poor children or for minority children. crumbling schools are everywhere. it is an american problem. and it relates directly to our future ability to maintain the quality of life that americans expect. i have charts here that paint the picture of the schools conditions in the four regions of our country. in every region. the gao reports that whole buildings are inadequate. that building features. like roofs. walls. and windows. are inadequate. and that the environment for learning. like the lighting. ventilation. and indoor air quality is inadequate. in the northeast. 30 percent of the schools report inadequate buildings. 59 percent report inadequate building fea\"tures. and 57 percent report inadequate environmental conditions. in the midwest. 31 percent of the schools report inadequate buildings. 57 percent report inadequate building features. and 57 percent report inadequate environmental learning conditions. in the south. 31 percent of the schools report inadequate buildings. 53 percent report inadequate building features. and 54 percent report inadequate environmental conditions. and in the west. 38 percent of the schools report inadequate buildings. fully 64 percent report inadequate building features. and 68 percent report inadequate environmental conditions. mr. president. crumbling schools span our country. in the urban areas. 38 percent of the schools reported at least one inadequate building. in rural areas. it is 30 percent. in the suburbs. it is 29 percent. this problem is not just confined to urban. rural. or suburban schools. it is across the board. inner city schools are in disrepair. but so are suburban schools. as well as rural schools. my home state of illinois is a microcosm of the nation. we have chicago. farmland. wealthy suburbs. and the poorest slums. schools are crumbling across my state. mr. president. 31 percent of illinois schools report at least one inadequate building. 62 percent report at least one inadequate building feature. 70 percent report at least one inadequate environmental condition. in illinois wealthier communities. schools are full of computers and are designed to meet every students and teachers needs. the situation is different in all too many other communities. there. computers sit idle because the electrical power to run them is not available. or because there is nowhere to put them. or no one who knows how to use them. five years ago. in his book. \"savage inequalities.\" john kozol described the unbelievable conditions of some of illinois schools. he reported schools \"full of sewer water.\" without playgrounds. science labs. or art teachers. he went to schools where the stench of urine permeated the halls. he wrote of schools that were. in his words. \"extraordinarily unhappy places.\" today. mr. president. the gao reports that these conditions still exist. in all 50 states--in states that place a high priority on education. as well as those that do not. i point out that these facility problems are not cosmetic. a study released last month found a direct correlation between crumbling schools -and student achievement in the north dakota schools. this study is the latest in a string of reports that consistently prove that students cant learn if their schools are falling down. when we send our children to crumbling schools. we subtract from their opportunities. a generation ago. a college graduate earned about twice as much as a high school dropout. today. the ratio is nearly 3 to 1. the income gap between educated. americans and uneducated americans is growing. gone are the days when strength and hard work were enough to raise a family. in the information age. education is a prerequisite to employment. a good education has become a form of currency that buys quality of life. according to the department of labor. by the year 2000. half of all new jobs will require an education beyond high school. when we send our children to crumbling schools. we subtract from americas opportunities. education benefits the nation as much as it benefits the individual. when students do not learn. we all contribute to the costs of remedial education. we pay for governmentsponsored health care. welfare. child care. job training. we pay for crime prevention to house millions of prisoners. more than 80 percent of whom are high school dropouts. every year the federal government spends nearly half a trillion dollars on antipoverty. crime prevention. and health care programs. investing in education would save much of these costs and much of this money. yet we have neglected the needs of our elementary and secondary schools. and it has shown up in our childrens test scores. it affects their ability to concentrate and to learn and to receive the kind of education they need to keep america competitive in the 21st century. the time has come for a new school facilities paradigm. local school districts are simply overwhelmed. the local tax base often cannot itself keep up with routine maintenance costslet alone the. costs of upgrading schools for 21st century learning. or to ease overcrowding. of course. local bonds issues fail regularly. state governments. the gao reports. are not fixing the problem. in 1994. they spent only $3.5 billion all tolda far cry from the $112 billion need that the gao has documented. i believe that the time has come for a partnership between all levels of government. the national interest compels us to support elementary and secondary educational opportunities on a consistent national basis. and in ways that do not interfere with local control of education. just as the federal government pays for the interstate highway system. but the construction decisions are made at the state and local levels. the federal government can support education infrastructure without getting involved in the kinds of decisions that belong at the state and local levels. i have sent every senator and governor the gao results for their state and for the country. i welcome their input. it is time for us to open a dialog about this issue becausez i believe that together we can address this problem and we can fix our schools. when america was faced with a challenge of adapting to the industrfal age. we did. and we emerged as the worlds economic. military. and intellectual leader. now. we are moving into the information age. we have to adapt again. investment in the infrastructure needed to support the technological change the world has witnessed is an inefficient and appropriate place to start. these reports today complete the first comprehensive school facility survey in over 30 years and the most exhaustive study ever. their work provides the foundation for the new kind of federal. state. and local partnership that we need to make our schools work for the 21st century. mr. president. crumbling schools is a ticking time bomb. in this global economy. in the information age. we should be able to devote some small measure of our national resources to prepare our children with a chance to learn.","mr. chairman. i rise in strong support of the stokesboehlert amendment. these riders are an allout assault on environmental law. it is not to be considered simply reform. but rather. in toto. these would eviscerate environmental enforcement throughout the united states. it is also an abuse of the legislative process. in my subcommittee on commercial and administrative law of the committee on the judiciary. we are beginning to consider one of the provisions contained herein. and that is recognizing state environmental audit legislation. we have not proceeded to any conclusion. we .have more questions and comments. in fact. the only consistent element we have found in considering this environmental audit language is the opposition. almost a total opposition. of law enforcement officers throughout the united states. the national district attorneys association is against it. the attorney generals of new mexico. minnesota. california massachusetts. arizona. new hampshire. new jersey. tennessee. the new jersey state attorney general. the new york district attorneys association. all these law enforcement officials condemn a rider which is included in this legislation. this is not the way to reform environmental laws in the united states. this is the way to destroy environmental laws in the united states.","mr. speaker. today i have introduced legislation to enhance the recycling of rechargeable

of mr. babbitts confirmation. mr. president. in the past 25 years. the role of the secretary of the interior has changed dramatically. the secretary is no longer the guardian of narrow western regional interests. now. under laws enacted by congress. the secretary is the steward. for all americans. of much of our national land heritage. including our national parks. wildlife refuges. and public lands. the secretary is manager of nationwide programs for outdoor recreation. restoration of lands affected by coal mining. historic preservation. and mineral and water resources. his decisions on energy and environmental matters affect the interests of every american. the old days of few users and little or no constraints on the secretarys decisions are gone forever. this is particularly true with respect to use of the federal lands. the secretary of the interior and the entire department are challenged to provide for needed development without sacrificing vital environmental interests. this effort will require a high degree of competence. careful planning. constant effort to achieve a balance between development and preservation. and complete integrity in the decision making process. in this regard. i believe that there are certain principles established by congress which should guide the seoretary. first. decisions should be based on comprehensive planning and professional judgment with ample public participation. second. maximum protection of the environment should be one of the highest priorities. third. the federal government should receive fair market value for private use of public resources. and. fourth. the secretary should cooperate to the maximum extent possible with state and local governments. and local citizens. many of the recent complaints from traditional users about federal resource management stem not so much from new rules of the management game. but from the fact that there are many new players. increasing scarcity of basic commodities. a rapid shift of the urbanized population center of the nation to the west and south. and a growing appreciation for environmental values have increased pressures for such competing purposes as energy production. urban growth. recreation. and wilderness preservation. as a result. there are new definitions of public interest. new constituencies to be served. and new claims on the resources of the federal lands. mr. president. bruce babbitt is well qualified to fill this challenging assignment. i commend president clinton for choosing mr. babbitt. and look forward to working with him as secretary of the interior.","mr. speaker. for purposes of debate only. i yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from california . and pending that. i yield myself such time as i may consume. during consideration of this resolution. all time yielded is for the purposes of debate only. mr. speaker. house resolution 576 is the rule providing for consideration of the conference report on h.r. 2194. the federal facility compliance act. under the rules of the house. conference reports are considered as privileged. the rule waives all points of order against the conference report and against its consideration. the rules waived include those requiring a 3day layover of conference reports filed in the house. scope. and germaneness. as the committee on rules heard in testimony. h.r. 2194 enjoys strong bipartisan support. indeed. the house accepted the bill under suspension of the rules by a voice vote. and the senate approved it 94 to 3. despite the overwhelming bipartisan support for the legislation in the house and the senate. the president. however. has not publicly announced that he has changed his intention to veto the bill. for those reasons. the rule under consideration today would ensure that. should the president veto h.r. 2194. the congress would have the opportunity to respond to the presidents action. h.r. 2194 ends the hypocritical double standard that exists today because of the federal governments practice of assessing civil penalties against private companies. municipalities. and state agencies for violations of the very same environmental laws that the federal government itself violates with impunity: the result is that the federal government is among the nations worst polluters. it is past time that we end this immunity to penalties under the nations solid waste laws. mr. speaker. we would like to thank the gentleman from ohio . the gentleman from washington [mr. swiar]. and the gentleman from colorado for their hard work on this important environmental legislation. their persistence has paid off. we finally have the chance to require the federal government to comply with the same environmental laws and regulations it imposes on private businesses and states. mr. speaker. i urge my colleagues to adopt this rule and the conference report. mr. speaker. i reserve the balance of my time.","mr. president. as chairman of the subcommittee on superfund. ocean and water protection. i was concerned about the impact of the original amendment on our environmental laws. consequently the amendments authors agreed to modify their amendment. i have reviewed the environmental provisions of this modified amendment. and believe that it is designed to assure full compliance with both the superfund law and the solid waste disposal act. the amendment is designed to assure such compliance. and to assure an epa determination of such compliance. this means that both the federal environmental laws and state laws will apply.through the mechanisms in .both superfund and the solid waste disposal: act. which guarantee the. application of such state laws. in addition. the state role in applying these laws is fully protected by virtue of the provisions both in superfund and the solid waste disposal act. which define. the role. of states in applying these. laws and in participating in epa and other:federal compliance determinations.","mr. president. i thank the distinguished senator from tennessee for those very kind remarks. and i do not want this to be a bouquetthrowing contest here. but we really appreciate what he has done. there is another point i think we ought to make. and i know we are not trespassing on those who follow after us on their time. there are two points i would like to make. first. indeed. it is right for the united states to take this leadership. call it moral leadership. as the senator from tennessee did. in eliminating these disastrous chemicals from our country. and that leadership will echo around the world. i am confident other nations will follow us. and certainly it will be a big incentive to strengthen the montreal protocol. that is the first point. the second point is a distinct upside to all of this. the united states. by moving ahead in this area. is going to come up with substitutes that will have no chlorine in them that will do no damage to the ozone layer. and thus we will be ahead of the curve. we will be prepared with these substitutes to market them elsewhere in the world. other nations. which i am confident are going to want to rule out their use of cfcs. are going to say. what are we going to use as a substitute. and the united states. by moving forward. will have developed both the equipment and the gases or the chemicals. or whatever it might be. to fill the gap that the absence of a very. very effective agent. the cfcs will have caused when we have abolished them. there is no question that the cfcs are an extraordinary chemical. they are not flammable. they fulfill all these cooling factors that we have discussed previously. the only trouble is it was discovered that they are destroying the ozone layer. as has been pointed out by the senator from tennessee. so there are many reasons for moving ahead: one. the moral leadership. and two. we are going to be ahead of the rest of the world in having the substitutes developed. and. of course. the third reason. obvious reason. the basic reason we are doing all of this. is the united states produces onethird of all the cfcs in the world. if we get out of the. business. we will take a long step toward reducing the destruction of the ozone layer. and a fourth and final reason sthis is a twoferwe get a double punch out of this. not only do we not destroy the ozone layer. but cfcs contribute beween 20 and 25 percent of all the factors involved in the global warming. and the other factors are far more difficult to deal with. dealing with banning the burning of coal and the carbon dioxide that is created there. that is a very. very difficult step to take. but this is-:of all the measures to stop the global warming. to contribute to the cessation of thatthe easiest of all we can take. the banning of the production and the use of cfcs. i thank the chair and i thank the senator from tennessee. mr. president. i suggest the absence of a quorum.","mr. president. one thing that we have learned about environmental issues in the past decade is that local concerns often have a profound impact on a regional and global basis. global warming is one of those issues. global warming is as local and personal as the sugar bushthe maple treein my front yard in vermont. scientists testifying before the agriculture committee told me that if the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles. maple trees may no longer grow in the united states. some predict this may happen by the year 2030thats just 41 years from now. well within the lives of my children. global warming also has profound worldwide implications. these same scientists warned that a 4degree rise in average temperature could cut rice production in half. because rice is the staff of life for 70 percent of the worlds population. global warming could devastate the worlds food september 12. 1989 cols supply and result in widespread hunger and famine. other crops could be affected too. dramatic warming would probably decrease average yields of wheat. corn. and soybeans. major changes in the southeast united states could turn substantial woodlands into grasslands. because of the seriousness of this problem. i am introducing comprehensive legislation addressing global warming as it relates to agriculture and foresty. the bills. the global climate change prevention act of 1989. and the international climate change prevention act of 1989 have .three basic components: first. agriculture must help prevent global warming. a major cause of global warming is increased carbon dioxide in our atmosphere from automobiles and powerplants. trees and plants can absorb carbon dioxide. but the projected drariatic increase in emissions threatens to overwhelm the natural balance. my bill will provide for massive reforestation of at least 3 million acres of tressenough to fill the entire state of connecticut. the bill will also contain incentives to plant more trees in urban areas. second. agriculture must not be a victim of global warming. we still do not know emough about the iinpact of global warming on agriculture and forestry. my first bill will direct the department of agriculture to take an active role in reducing the effect of global warming on our food supply and forests. this bill will also seek ways to insure that agriculture not only survives in a warmer world. but continues to provide the quantity and quality of food that we and the rest of the world need. third. the united states is part of a global environment. global warming is not limited to vermont or the northeast part of our county. it stretches beyond our nations borders. carbon dioxide emissions from other countries can affect our climate just as our emissions can affect theirs. my second bill mandates that we focus our foreign as. sistance in the areas of tropical deforestation and energy efficiency to minimize. not aggravate. global warming. these actions are just one part of my legislative package addressing global warming. s. 333. the global environmental protection act of 1989 which i introduced in january. is a comprehensive plan to reduce hazards that cause global warming and ozone destruction. it sets a tough phase out schedule of chlorofluorocarbons [cfcsl. sometimes the most profound issues are both local and global. global warming is such an issue. its potential impact is devastating and broad ranging. from the maple trees in vermonters front yards to famine in the third world. its a problem we can no longer wait to address. these bills do something about that problem.","i thank the chair. what is likely to happen today. as i understand it. mr. president. is that there will be a motion to table the weicker motion to insist upon the senate amendment. as i understand it. the distingished senator from florida will make that motion. and i will wholeheartedly support it. i hope other senators will as well. let us get to the basic underlying question of what is at issue here. this senator is exceedingly glad that the house of representatives has rejected what is know as the exon amendment. if the exon amendment should become law. it will weaken. if not destroy. the 7yearold restrictions on federally funded abortions which the hyde amendment has wisely provided. i felt obliged to oppose the amendment of the distinguished senator from nebraska when it was approved by the senate some weeks back. then it went to conference with the house. and the house conferees refused to agree to the exon amendment. if the house position prevails. which i pray it will. the hyde amendment will continue to be the law of the land. this past friday. the full house rejected the exon amendment by a vote of 166 to 216. mr. president. i support the hyde amendment and always have. i have off .ed it on this floor a number of times. it has been the law of the land for 7 years now because so many senators and members of the house oppose federal funding of abortions for a number of reasonsthe most important of them being thpt despite denials to the contrary. scientific research continues to show that an unborn child is not just a glob of tissue. but a human being. separate and distinct from his or her mother-. pve. growing child. a human being. with its own heartbeat. brain waves. and responsive to sensory impressions. mr. president. if i may inject a personal note. back in april. my daughterinlaw and son were blessed with the birth of a little girl. amelia jean helms. who was born a little more than 3 months prematurely. she weighed 2 / pounds. i might add that she now weighs more than 9 pounds. she is home now and doing well. if the chair will forgive a bit of grandfatherly pride. she is a precious little thing. during the recess i held her in my arms. she smiled. and she perceives things going on around her. i went to see her. back in april. at the premature intensive care division of baptist hospital in winstonsalhm when she was about 4 or 5 days old. there she was. lying on her stomach with all of the little tubes and monitors. and so forth. the doctors and nurses scrubbed me down. put a gown on me and a mask. took me over to the little incubator and sat me down on a little stool beside it. then they opened a little window. and the doctor said. \"senator. stick your hand in there and love that child. see if she doesnt respond.\" i did. i rubbed her tiny head. i patted her back. little legs. and arms. the doctor said. \"now. then. put your forefinger under her hand.\" when i did that. that tiny hand grasped that forefinger. she also grabbed my heart forever. the point is that there is a widespread predisposition in this country to suggest that little ones like amelia. or smaller. or sometimes larger. are not human beings. i reject that. i offer as exhibit a. amelia jean helms. the right to life. mr. president. is an inalienable right of all mankind. from one end of the age spectrum to the other. innocent human life should not be destroyed because of the circumstances of the childs inception. whether that child is conceived by force or consent. the child does not deserve to be put to death. the hyde amendment. which is now present law. stipulates that the taxpayers should not be required to pay for the deliberate. intentional termination of innocent human life. at this point. mr. president. let me reflect upon a book that i wish all senators would read. it is a poignant book. a biography. the name of it is \"his eye is on the sparrow.\" this book provides an excellent illustration of what we are debating today. a woman years ago became pregnant from a rape. immediately. when she discovered she was pregnant. there were voices all around her saying. \"get an abortion. get an abortion.\" and she said. \"no.\" she insisted that the child she was carrying was innocent. the child she was carrying was a human life. and she was not going to destroy it. she insisted that the child she was carrying deserved to live and to love and to be loved. and she was not going to destroy it. now. mr. president. just suppose that mother had followed the advice and exhortations given her. suppose she had gone ahead and. as a matter of convenience. had the child destroyed. none of us would ever have been blessed with the remarkable life and the perfectly beautiful voice of ethel watersthat splendid. talented. black lady about whom the biography i have just mentioned was written. now. mr. president. the exon amendment would ensure that this nation would not be blessed with thousands of other human beings who could contribute so much to the betterment of mankind during their lifetime. i am not a lawyer. but i have often heard lawyers say that hard cases make bad law. i think if there ever was a perfect example of what that really means. it is the proposal to change the hyde amendment. that is what we are talking about today. the exon amendment which the house has rejected. and which the senator should now abandon. let me say very quickly. for the women who conceive a child as a result of rape. my heart goes out to them. they deserve compassion and help. and they are going to get every bit i can give them. notwithstanding the hyde amendment. federal funds continue to be used to provide adequate treatment for victims of rape or incest including des. other nonabortion procedures are provided. so we are not talking denying medical treatment to women who have experienced the disgusting crime of rape. so. we are talking about the deliberate destruction of the most innocent. most helpless of humanity. the unborn child. we are not talking about an epidemic of pregnancies resulting from rape. because there is no such thing. contrary to what is so often published and broadcast and orated by politicans who want to add to or take away from the hyde amendment. pregnancies in fact resulting from rape are exceedingly rare. back in 1984. i believe it was. senator denton reviewed a few of the studies. there was a washington. dc. study that indicated only one pregnancy resulted out of a total of 300 rapes. there were no pregnancies from confirmed rape in buffalo. ny. over a 30year period. there were no pregnancies from confirmed rape in st. paul. mn. for more than 10 years. a chicago study showed that there were no pregnancies from rape for more than 9 years. other studies. mr. president. showed overall less than 2 percent of rapes resuited in pregnancy. so describe it as you may wish. the shameful truth is that enactment of the amendment of my good friend from nebraska. mr. exon. will simply open the floodgates for taxpayerfunded abortions far beyond the few pregnancies that actually result from rape. mr. president. if you want to know somebody who has in fact verified what i have just said. it is gloria steinhem. in an interview in usa today. she candidly acknowledged that making \"abortion legal only in cases of rape and incest would force women to lie.\" mr. president. two leading law enforcement associations have opposed the exception for this precise reason. in a letter dated july 18 of 1977 the director of the bureau of governmental relations and legal counsel for the international association of chiefs of police wrote the following: if this senate provision ultimately becomes law. the federal government will have oweated a situation whereby a woman wishing to obtafn a free abortion at government expense would be required to report that a crime of rape or incest had occurred. obviously. if the reporting of a crime becomes financially profitable. we can expect innumerable false reports. each such report would have to be investigated requiring considerable manhours of already overburdened police departments. in any case. mr. president. the exon amendment will not resolve these problems. it will simply exacerbate them. under the exon amendment. to obtain a taxpayerfunded abortion a woman would simply report. to law enforcement or to a public health service. that she has been raped. she must make that report \"promptly.\" whatever that means. the word is not defined. mr. president. may i inquire how much time i have remaining?","mr. chairman. today the house is considering appropriations for the department of the interior. i would like to express my appreciation to the chairman of the subcommittee. mr. yates and the members of the interior appropriation subcommittee for their consideration of the continuing concern of members from some coastal states over the department of the interiors fiveyear plan for oil and gas leasing on our outer continental shelf. the committees report recognizes that the affected states have serious reservations about the potential environmental impact of the plan on their coastal resources. it urges secretary hodel to work with coastal states representatives to try to resolve the many remaining problems associated with the plan. this program. which becomes effective at the end of this week. presents serious problems for states such as florida. during the last year we have tried to work out many of these issues. unfortunately. despite these efforts. the proposed final plan reflects only some of our recommendations while major issues remain unresolved. as the program progresses. lease salebylease sale. i know that representatives of affected states will be giving full consideration to all possible alternatives. such as moratoria. for making modifications to the plan. in the interim. prior to the plans effective date. i have once again submitted my recommendations to the secretary along with resolutions adopted by the florida legislature. the governor. and the cabinet in opposition to the plan. i have included these here for the information of my colleagues.","mr. president. as ranking minority member of the senate environment and public works transportation subcommittee. i am pleased that the senate floor has under consideration reauthorization of the 4year highway program. during this congress. the committee held 10 days of hearings on the federalaid highway program. testimony was received from members of congress. the congressional budget office. industry representatives. environmentalists. citizen groups. professional associations. and federal. state. and local officials. efforts were made to accommodate many of the suggestions provided by the hearings to improve the bill before the senate today. s. 2405 continues to apportion onehalf percent of the $3 billion authorized for distribution under the interstate program to each state that has completed its portion of the interstate system or has less than onehalf of the national cost of completion remaining. continuation of the minimum onehalf percent apportionment is a fair\" method to deal with states that took seriously the national directive to place top priority on construction of the interstate system and who concentrated their limited resources on that system early in the programs history. often at the expense of other roads. state highway agencies are anxious for congress to pass legislation prior to the program lapsing on september 30. i hope that we can meet this deadline. though the differences between the house and senate are large. members are familiar with the positions taken by each house. staff on both sides are setting up working arrangements to immediately proceed with conference activities. if the deadline passes. and it appears that congress cannot resolve its differences before adjournment. it can release already authorized interstate funds. states will be able to spend these funds along with their unobligated balances. this approach. though. will not help the 25 states which benefit from the onehalf of 1 percent provision. this provision is not part of the authorized interstate construction program and it lapses on september 30. congress should extend this provision along with the release of interstate funds in order to guarantee each state a minimum amount of federal highway dollars until a full program can be enacted into law. another issue of considerable important is the discussion of doubling the federal gasoline tax to 19 cents a gallon to help meet the deficit reducation target under the grammrudmanhollings budget law. the national highway program has profoundly changed the transportation patterns of this country. especially since the highway trust fund was created 30 years ago. if revenues generated from highway users are no longer dedicated for highway purposes. the basis of support for such taxes and level of funding for transportation needs may decline. any real move to increase the gas tax to defray the deficit will raise a storm of protest by states and the highway industry. they are already leary of the administrations and congresss practice of unfairly capping the actual dollars states can spend each year from the highway trust fund. prior congressional action of placing the obligational limitation far blow authorizations has created a program imbalance. this imbalance may trigger the byrd amendment criterion of unfunded authorizations not exceeding 2 years worth of revenues. even though the highway trust fund has a $9 billion to $10 billion cash balance. according to cbo. there are two basic ways to redress this imbalance. first. future authorizations could be set below future obligation ceilings until the current backlog is reduced. a difference of about $800 million a year for the next 4 years would be necessary just to offset the gap that has developed over the past 4 years. second. selected authorizations from previous years could be rescinded. this second option probably would not be popular because it may force states to adjust construction plans made on a previous commitment of federal funds. this bill selects the first option of reducing authorization levels in order to correct this imbalance. however. if congress separates the highway program from the unified budget to avoid application of the budget deficit reduction law. more funds could be provided. i. along with many state officials and some congressional colleagues. believe that these spending constraints are no longer defensible. however. efforts to increase the obligational limitation or to remove the highway trust fund from the unified budget have failed under various circumstances in both the house and senate. in previous highway bills. the senate floor. has included special purpose projects for selected states. because of budget limitations and overwhelming national highway needs. such projects no longer can be funded at the expense of the overall program. this bill allows congress to designate priority projects. additional flexibility is provided to state by permitting them to use any funding category with the applicable match to build such a designated priority project. no new federal funds are provided. this is the best accommodation that can be provided senators on their individual requests for special purpose projects. if the senate and house overrides this approach and provides specific funds above a states regular program share. other states will be hurt. the limited federal dollars available will be simply redivided to accommodate the interests of a few states. because of the few remaining days available for enactment of a highway bill. i would urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill and refrain from any amendments which delay or alter current law distributing funds from the highway account.","mr. president. i rise today to join my distinguished colleagues from the environment and public works committee. sponsoring the \"groundwater protection act of 1985.\" this legislation represents a responsible approach to coordinating state and federal programs in ground water management. i share my colleagues hope that this bill will focus greater attention on ground water resources. a subject which i have been interested in for many years. may i note. the sponsors of this bill represent the east. midwest. and west. i trust that this broad support portends a national consensus on the need to address ground water problems. i first introduced the sole source aquifer protection act. designed to protect underground sources for drinking water. in 1982. many provisions of that aquifer protection bill are now incorporated in the safe drinking water act amendments. which. i am happy to report. are about to be considered in conference. in addition to the safe drinking water act. a number of federal laws affect ground water management. including the clean water act. superfund. and the resource conservation and recovery act (rcra). these laws overlay a complex of state statutes. which differ markedly in their treatments of ground water resources. the groundwater protection act would define the role of federal government. in terms that will most help the states develop ground water strategies tailored to their individual needs. for example. many eastern states have shallow aquifers with indistinct boundaries. while in the west. many states have deep and distinct aquifers. some states rely heavily on ground water for drinking supplies. others less so. on long island. 3 million new yorkers rely on one aquifer for their drinking water. and this aquifer is now threatened by toxic chemicals. in nassau county alone. 119 of 389 public wells have detectable levels of synthetic organic chemicals. these chemicals come from diverse sourcessolvents from industries and residents homes. pesticides from farms. nitrates from law fertilizers. and numerous chemicals which have leached from landfills. officials of the state of new york and of long island have made significant progress in protecting this ground water resource. in 1978. the new york state legislature stated that preventing the pollution of ground waters and -protecting ground waters for use as potable water. would be the states ground water quality goals. to guide the department of environmental conservation in establishing and updating water quality standards and classifications. long island has since been designated a sole source aquifer by the u.s. environmental protection agency. and is developing a ground water management plan. this bill would recognize that different states have different needs and find themselves at different stages in ground water planning and management. we have heard repeatedly from state officials. asking that epa provide basic research into ground water contaminants. so states can determine how to classify their waters. our bill would direct epa to establish criteria for 100 contaminants and provide states with documents specifying the physical. chemical. biological and radiological properties of contaminants. as well as analyses of the contaminants risk to human health at various concentrations in ground water. our bill directs the epa administrator. whenever possible. to make use of research developed under other environmental statutes and cooperate with other agencies that hold toxicological data. armed with a common set of federally developed data. the states will set their own ambient ground water standards. in general. ambient ground water standards must be at least as stringent as those for drinking water in the safe drinking water act. but the states are free to designate \"special ground water systems\" with standards imore or less stringent. depending on the use of the water and the threat to human health and the environment. the bill also would require that states develop an assessment or inventory of ground water resources. in consultation with the u.s. geological survey. and finally. the groundwater protection act would mandate that states develop management strategies to ensure federal. state. and local coordination to protect ground water resources and guarantee compliance with state regulations. this legislation would authorize $25 million a year for 3 fiscal years. on a 75percent federal. 25percent state costsharing basis. for states to undertake ground water assessment. in addition. the bill would provide $50 million over 5 fiscal years. on a 50percent matching basis. to assist states in setting states standards. developing state management strategies. and operating protection and monitoring programs. i enthusiastically support this legislation. as a reasoned balance of federal and state roles in ground water management. i urge my colleagues to support this bill. by mr. bentsen (for himself.","mr. president. i rise in support of h.r. 999. the american conservation corps. at long last. the senate will turn to this issue. i joined the.senator from new york. senator moynihan. by cosponsoring this legislation when he introduced it in 1983. i am very pleased we will have a chance to pass this bill and send it to the president before adjourning for the year. the idea embodied in this bill to put our young people to work on projects for public improvements. is not new. in the 1930s. president roosevelt created programs to employ our young people to construct public works and make other improvements. h.r. 999 will likewise give our young people vital work experience while improving our natural resources. it will provide assistance for unemployed youth to work on soil conservation. urban revitalization and flood control projects. unemployment among young people in our cities is still tragically high. estimates are that fully onehalf of black teenagers cannot find work. h.r. 999 promises to provide not only work. but an educational experience for participants. all over the nation we see the last. ing value of the civilian conservation corps of the 1930s. rare is the area not touched by a ccc project. the projects undertaken by the american conservation corps promise similar benefits. mr. president. alumni of the old ccc have been some of the most vocal supporters of this legislation. this bill was brought to my attention by new jersey assemblyman george otlowski. who introduced legislation to establish a state conservation corps in new jersey. mr. president. i urge adoption of the bill.","mr. president. as i stated last night during the debate on my amendment concerning many of the natural resources policies of the reagan administration and former secretary james watt. i intend to vote to confirm judge clark to be secretary of the interior. but. as i also stated -at that time. th at should not be construed as either an endorsement of all of the policies of secretary watt. to the contrary. on the firs~t score. judge clarks stated plan of action as the secretary of the interior can properly be called a tabula rasa. that is. a totally blank sheet upon which very little is written. we sent. for example. some 200 questions to judge clark. i think the chair can see these. i have here a stack of paper about 3 or 4 inches thick. every place there is a paper clip is a place in the answers to those questions where he said he would review those policies. in effect. hie has said only that he would review policies and has taken virtually no stand on any issue on matters to come before him. now this. in my judgment. is nol a reason not to confirm mr. clark. because i agree that he is a man of integrity. a man of personality. and he is certainly the presidents choice and i for one have virtually always. if not always. given a president his choice of a cabinet member. after all it is his policy. he is elected and i think he is entitled to have his choice. nevertheless. it is hardly a reason to elect mr. clark to say we know what he is going to do because we have no idoa what he is going to do. in my judgment. many of those policies of this administration should be changed. the resolution of last night pointed up in particular what policies should be changed. tihe distinguished senator from idaho said. \"which policies wvouid you change?\" invited the question. and i gave a partial answer on the question of national parks. i would like to go into that in detail. mr. president. in fiscal year 1981. this administration attempted to rescind $250 million already appropriated for the land and water conservation fund which is of course the chief source for revenue for the purchase of parkland. the congress agreed to rescind only $90 million of that. so in fiscal year 1981. the administration asked for a huge rescission of park money. in fiscal year 1982. the administration requested a land and water conservation fund appropriation of about $39 million. which was only the amount necessary to cover obligatory court awards and administrative costs. the housesenate conference appropriated $151 million. which in turn was less than the senate appropriations committee had approved. if i recall the figures correctly. now. mr. president. again in fiscal year 1983. the administration requested $69 million for the land and water conservation fund. the housesenate conference appropriated $227 million for the program. including $75 million to be allocated to the states. an aspect of the program that secretary watt had wanted abolished. the $69 million in the land and water conservation fund was appropriated in the fiscal year 1983 supplemental appropriations bill. this money will be used in part to purchase 42 additions to the park system. even through the secretary and the administration had repeatedly said that they wanted no new parkland purchased. for fiscal year 1984. the administration proposed about $65 million for the land and water conservation fund. the housesenate conference appropriated $225 million. including $75 million for the states. now. the point is this. mr. president: this administration. beginning in 1981. when it

it repeatedly and they have done it again in 1984. now. this administration to now claim credit for everything that the congress has in effect forced down their throats. i think is hardly a recommendation for great performance in the field of resource management and in the field of park acquisition. now what i would like to see. since the distinguished senator from idaho. said. \"what policy would you change?\". i would put the policy. if i had my choice. i would tell. and i have told. judge clark. they ought to change that. quit being in constant adversarial relationships with the congress withi respect to national parks. flow with the flow. as they used to say. the congress. the american people. gives national parks a much higher priority than does this administration. we have thousands upon thousands of acres of land which. if not acquired timely. will either cost much more for future generations if they get around to acquiring it. or will be developed into subdivisions or into other uses totally inconsistent with national parks and refugees. and other conservation purposes. mr. president. as i have stated. i will vote to confirm mr. clark. but i do indeed hope he will change those policies. i offered an amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill yesterday evening which would have given the senate an opportunity to go onl record regarding the need for a change in some of these policies. this amendmenit was identical to a resolution i introduced earlier this week that was cosponsored by 41 of my colleagues. unfortunately. my amendment was tabled by a vote of 4842. while it is unfortunate that the amendment was tabled. we were in good company as the senate proceeded to reject all nongermane amendments to this measure. i firmly believe that had the senate had an opportunity to vote on this matter up or down on its own. it would have passed. in any event. i think that our efforts to bring this matter before the senate have served to put the president and judge clark on notice that some of the natural resource policies of this administration need more than the review judge clark has pledged to give them. many of these policies and programs need to be changed. and i hope that our efforts in this regard will send that message loud and clear. mr. president. at his confirmation hearing judge clark embraced the following statements of the late senator henry m. jackson regarding the role of the secretary of the interior. in the past two decades the role of the secretary of the interior has changed dramatically. the secretary is no longer the guardian of narrow western regional interests. now under laws enacted by congress. he is the steward. for all americans. of much of our national land heritage including our national parks. wildlife refuges. and public lands. he is manager of nationwide programs for outdoor recreation. restoration of lands affected by coal mining. historic preservation. and mineral and water resources. his decisions on energy and environmental matters affect the interests of every american. today. with the growing need to develop: the energy and mineral resources of the public lands and the outer continental shelf. the secretary of the irtcrior and the entire department are challenged to provide for wise use without sacrificing vital environmental interests. this effort will re-

introducing legislation which is designed to promote the development of our many hydropower resources in the northeastmidwest region of our country. in 1979. according to army corps of engineers figures. the capacity of 1.251 existing hyropower facilities nationwide was 64.000 megawatts of electricity. this represented approximately 13 percent of the nations total generrting capacity. there is tremendous potential for growth in the hydropower industry. according to the corps \"national hydropower resources study.\" development of hydro potental at sites with existing dams could increase total capacity by 250 percent. further development of nearly 4.500 potentially feasible. but undeveloped sites could increase total capacity by ud to 500 percent. clearly. we can no longer afford to neglect our hydropower resources. and the vast potential they afford for reducing our dependence on oil imports. and yet. major obstacles remain to thwart hydropower development. one of the main obstacles is the lack of finance capital. once constructed. hydro facilities are relatively inexpensive to operate. however. startup costs. which include the costs of complying with necessary federal environmental regulations. can be substantial. to help meet the costs of feasibility studies. which can take between 3 and 4 years to complete. the department of energy administered a lowinterest loan program between 1977 and 1980. discontinuation of this program in 1981 has made financing more difficult. especially for municipalities and smaller utility firms. the problem is especially acute in the northeast and midwest. which are the only regions of the country which lack access to federal support for hydro projects via one of the five federal power marketing authorities. to correct this inequity. i am introducing legislation to create the northeastmidwest states federal hydropower financing authority. under this legislation. midwestern and northeastern states would have the option of joining this regional power marketing authority. thereby becoming eligible to apply for lower cost loans and loan guarantees to cover up to 10 percent of the costs of hydropower development. interest rates on loans would reflect the governments cost of borrowing. state and municipal power authorities. rural electric cooperatives. interstate river commissions. and consumer and stockholder held utilities in member states would be eligible for financing. according to corps studies. the northeastern and midwestern states contain half the feasible hydro sites. and 20 percent of the potential generating capacity nationwide. i urge members from these regions to investigate the hydro potential within their own districts. such information is available simply by contacting the army corps of engineers. if you feel that hydroelectricity has the potential to aid your district. states. or region in meeting its longterm energy needs. and if you feel that it is unfair that the northeast and midwest are the only regions without access to the financial resources of federal power marketing authorites. i would urge you to consponsor my legislation.*","mr. chairman. i thank the chairman for yielding. i thank my distinguished colleague. the gentleman fran -new york for permitting me this time. i rise to express my strong support for the community health center program. congress created this program specifically to meet the health needs of medically underserved areas of this country. today. these centers serve over 5 million americans. during the past 8 *years. i have worked closely with the four health centers in my area and i know first hand how critical they areto the population they serve. without the centers. medically underserved families would not have access to the basic human need of health care. furthermore. these centers focus on preventive. comprehensive care. clearly. this kind of care is far less expensive than sometimes unnecessary hospitalization. nationwide. these centers have proven to be highly effective and efficient when costs for health services are compared to other providers. for example. these centers reduce hospitalization between 25 percent and 50 percent which saves public and private expenditures. comparing the costs per visit for health center patients to that of a medicaid patient or other insured patient. health center costs are 41 percent less. without a health center these people will flood hospital emergency rooms and outpatient departments where costs are 50 percent higherand someone will foot the bill. or they will go without health care until the condition is serious enough to require hospitalization where costs will be at least 500 percent higher. health centers are an extremely reasonable -investment and particularly significant in light of our attempts to save tax dollars and contain overall health care expenditures. the fiscal year 1981 appropriation of $323 million supported 850 different center projects. although the subcommittees recommendation is $15 million over the presidents budget request. it is $26 million below the au-. thorization level contained in the budget reconciliation act and $65 millionthat is 20 percentbelow the fiscal year 1981 appropriation. a cut of this size is going to have a devastating impact on projects and their patients all around the country. in addition. the senate appropriations committee is recommending only $243.8 million. in light of this. i fieel it is absolutely vital that the house approve a higher level of funding and insist on this in conference. in addition. i am extremely concerned about the decision in the senate to p~rovide $2 million for primary care block grant planning grants to the states. this seems particularly inappropriate at a time when we are cutting back substantially the funding for health services. furthermo re. it is outrageous that federal funds should be spent to build state bureaucracies in order that they be able to take over this program. the house did not provide a similar appropriation for state planning grants and i believe this is the correct position and hope that the house members will stand firm on this point. this $2 million is desperately needed to continue health services. i know that the gentleman from kentucky has been a leading advocate of community health centers as a costeffective way of delivering health care services to the poor. i hope we can count on his continued efforts to seek the maximum possible funding level for this program and to reject the senates primary care planning grants for the states which. in view of the drastic federal cutbacks. seem totally inappropriate.","mr. speaker. i move that the house resolve itself into the committee of the whole house on the state of the union for the further consideration of the senate bill to assist the electrical consumers of the pacific northwest through use of the federal columbia river power system to achieve costeffective energy conservation. to encourage the development of renewable energy resources. to establish a representative regional power planning process. to assure the region of an efficient and adequate power supply. and for other purposes.","mr. speaker. today i have introduced legislation which amends section 503(c) (1) of title v of the trade act of 1974 to add chromium. manganese. and silicon ferroalloys and related metals to the list of products exempt from the generalized system of preferences (gsp). in effect the bill repeals the present duty free treatment given eight special productslow carbon ferromanganese. medium carbon ferromanganese. high carbon ferromanganese. siliconmanganese (ferrosilicon manganese). 60 to 80 percent ferrosilicon. ferrochrome silicon (ferrosilicon chrome). chrome metal and silicon metal having a purity between 99 and 99.7 percent. second. the bill would prevent future inclusion under gsp of certain other ferroalloys. namely low and high ferrochrome. manganese metal. grades of ferrosilicon other than 60 to 80 percent grade and silicon metal whose purity is between 96 and 99 percent. these various ferroalloys and metals are additive materials produced from various ores by electrometallurgical reduction. they are essential to the production of alloy and stainless steel. and almost all specialty steels and superalloys. for example. no steel at all can be made without a manganese ferroalloy. silicon is necessary to produce iron and aluminum castings and many special steels and all silicon chemicals. in other words. the steel. iron and aluminum industries reouire ferroalloys and cannot produce without them. because so much depends on ferroalloys. not the least of which is our national defense. our strategic and critical material stockpile contains substantial quantities of ferroalloys and ores. yet as a result of an incredible surge of foreign imports into this country. the domestic ferroalloy industry faces the very real prospect of collapse. since 1976 much of the injury to u.s. producers has come from imports exempt from duty under gsp. ferroalloy imports have grown from 143.000 tons in 1960 to 373.000 in 1970. and to an annualized total of 1.275.000 tons in 1978. imports have climbed from 17 percent of u.s. consumption in 1970 to a level of 41 percent in 1975 and 52 percent in 1978. imports of gsp products from gsp countries have increased from some 40.600 tons in 1975 to 88.100 tons in 1976. to 179.500 in 1977 and to an annualized level of 197.400 tons in 1978. the share of u.s. consumption of these gsp imports has risen from 3.2 percent in 1975 to 13.8 percent in 1978. this post1975 increase in gsp imports has come at a time in which u.s. production of gsp ferroalloys has fallen in spite of a 12.1percent increase in that period of u.s. consumption of these products. the explosive growth of dutyfree gsp ferroalloys at the expense of domestic producers has not served the purpose of the gsp program. the principal beneficaries of american generosity have been countries with well established. growing ferroalloy industries. in other words. we are not talking about dutyfree imports from develooing nations with \"infant industries.\" what we have. for example. are four beneficiary nations of gsp statusbrazil. mexico. portugal. and yugoslaviawhose striving and competitive ferroalloy producers have reaped a bonanza in the american market. moreover. the u.s. industrys situation is made worse by the fact that the united etates alone is extending gsp treatment to these products. the failure of japan and the eec to match americas gsp generosity on ferroalloys compounds the already damaging disparity between relatively low u.s. duties on ferroalloys and the relatively high duties assessed by the japanese and europeans. congress in approving the 1974 trade act said that gsp was not to be extended to any product which is import sensitive. yet time after time the administration has rejected the ferroalloy industrys exemption petitions which detail its injury from the removal of normal duties. i submit that the record is conclusive that ferroalloys are indeed import sensitive. that gsp imports have surged dramatically and that consequently u.s. producers have been severely damaged. the u.s. ferroalloy industry has a unique and serious gsp problem which at this time only the congress seems capable of resolving. section 503(c) (1) of the trade act specifies other products which are exempt from gsp. indeed. one of these is the steel industry. the principal consumer of ferroalloys. it would be consistent with the intent and provisions of the 1974 act to add ferroalloy products to the list of products exempt from gsp.","mr. chairman. i strongly support the gentlemans amendment. the value of the annual congressional appropriations procedure is well illustrated by the fact that this year we have an opportunity to review the illconceived project to increase the diversion of water from lake michigan into the illinois river. the project. which is projected to cost over $3 million. wastes money. decreases vital hydroelectric energy production. and poses a flood threat to communities along the illinois river. any economic benefits from the project are at best marginal and accrue primarily to the rich. responsible illinois state officials verify that increased water diversion would have no appreciable effect on lowering the water level of lake michigan. the political pressure for the diversion project comes from the affluent \"gold coast\" along the lake north of chicago. col. richard d. slife of the detroit office of the army corps of engineers wrote to me on june 7. just 1 week ago. that the level of lake michigan has been dropping steadily since 1974. to the point where it is now only 4 inches above the long term average. if it falls below that average. increased water diversion is prohibited by law. colonel slife told me that although the corps may be able to initial diversion early next year. by march 1979 the level of lake michigan will have fallen below the long term average if the present trend continues. any increased diversion \"thereafter is very problematic\" according to colonel slife. thus. congress is being asked to recommend money to prepare for a demonstration project likely never to take place. such a ridiculous wasting of federal tax dollars is unconscionable. finally and most importantly. is the danger of increased flooding. this danger demonstrates most dramatically the folly of increased diversion of water from lake michigan. inevitably. the extra inches of lake michigan water added to the annual spring flood crest on the illinois river could well make the difference between success and failure for the sandbag crews working to reinforce levees. and the pumps struggling to keep ahead of levee leakage. in authorizing the lake michigan water diversion project congress buckled to political pressure and created a reverse robin hood monster that robs from the poor and gives to the rich. hardworking residents of downriver communities will suffer for a slight and probably never to be realized benefit to the wealthy on lake michigans shore. congress should correct the mistake by adopting this amendment.","the senator from west virginia has been diligent in encouraging the expanded use of coal in environmentally sound ways. he is correct in his interpretation of the conference report in this respect.","i thank the senator from florida and i appreciate his questions. i think he and i are in total agreement on how we ought to proceed in this air qualityenvironmental matter. i assure the senator from florida that as long as i can i will stand on this floor and insist that we have that opportunity to deal with the legislation so that we have a study and have that information before we write into law. before we cement in. the ceilings and the requirements that are set forth here in section 6. mr. president. what i was talking about is the class ii designations. it is in addition to the national parks. wilderness areas and memorial parks exceeding 5.000 acres. which exist on. the date of enactment. that would automatically become class i. the class i no significant deterioration increments for particulates in the committee bill are: five micrograms per cubic meter on an annual basis and 10 micrograms per cubic meter in a 24hour period. this compares with 75 micrograms per cubic meter on an annual basis and 260 micrograms per cubic meter in a 24hour basis. respectively. for the national primary standard. and 60 micrograms per cubic meter on an annual basis and 150 micrograms per cubic meter in a 24hour period for the national secondary standard. the class i no significant deterioration increments for sulfur dioxide are 2 micrograms per cubic meter on an annual basis. 5 micrograms per cubic meter on a 24hour basis. and 25 micrograms per cubic meter on a 3hour basis. the national primary standard is 80 micrograms per cubic meter on an annual basis and 365 micrograms per cubic meter on a 24hour basis. and the secondary standard is 1300 micrograms per cubic meter on a 3hour basis. these are areas where individual states. working with their citizens and with private industry. have made the effort to clean up. is the reward for the huge expenditure of dollar resources and human resources and skills that if you have attempted to comply with the letter of the law and even go beyond. that you will now be forced to go even stricterat a tremendous economic penaltyin terms of limited industrial expansion. potential job loss. and potential lost revenues to a states tax base from expansion that cannot now take place under no significant deterioration? my colleague the junior senator from florida raised the very valid question on the floor of what air sheds in his state would fall under this classification. his question was dismissed out of hand as irrelevant. i say it is relevanthighly relevant. florida ranks eighth in the nation in population. do not its citizens have the right to know how their homes and livelihood will be affected? florida is also one of our most prestigious states where retired people have chosen to livefor the good life. these are people living on fixed incomes. what will the economic consequences to them be individually if utility rates do in fact increase as a result of no significant deteriorationthe florida public power co. estimates that its costs to serve customers will go up by $120 to $300 million. what will be other potential price increases applied against their fixed income? gentlemen. individual maps of all the 50 states have been drawn showing the areas in your states that are now meeting the required standards under present law for particulates and sulfur dioxide. and which would therefore be subject to the new more strict class ii standards. these are placed on your desk for reference and you may find it of interest to look over these maps. it may be noted that these are not \"buffer zone\" maps. the committee advises that their bill is a no bufferzone billthough how in the world you achieve protection of pristine areas without some sort of buffer around them is beyond my comprehension. with respect to the fact that the class ii increments established in the committee bill are far more restrictive than present law. i think it is important to make note of the difficulty of. some areas in attaining the current particulate levels. if nonattainment at the high levels prescribed by law is a compliance problem. how much greater will the problem be compounded by enacting even stricter standards? in a followup letter from administrator train to the committee dated may 12. 1975. let me quote on the problem of attaining particulate standards for the ambient primary and secondary standards: dear mr. chairman: your letter of february 28. 1975. raised important questions related to progress in implementing the clean air act. at this time. i would like to provide additional information on this progress and present some of the problems. as well as suggested solutions. that have emerged during the last four years of implementation. the enclosed information provides an assessment of our status in relation to the standards set pursuant to the act. summarizes problems encountered in attempting to achieve statutory goals. and provides our assessment of possible solutions to these problems. this material will amplify my testimony at recent clean air act implementation oversight hearings. first of all. i would like to point out that significant progress has been made in improving the nations air quality under the provisions of the act. air quality trends show continued decreases in air pollution across the nation. however. a number of air quality control regions will not meet the ambient air quality standards by the statutory deadlines. in many cases due to circumstances either beyond the reach of regulatory action or controllable only at a cost unforeseen at the time of the acts amendment in 1970. specific problems are discussed in the context of the status of efforts to meet the national ambient air quality standards through the state implementation plans. legislative amendments that we have proposed to the congress for solving some of the problems encountered are mentioned in the discussion on progress and impediments. the topics generally follow those set forth in your letter. if i can be of further assistance. please let me know. sincerely yours.","it is my understanding that the reason we get into the program of subsidizing shipbuilding in large part is because we build ships which have features built into them which make them safer. to make them less potential for spillage. or for accidents. which can cause environmental problems. is this correct?","mr. speaker. there are 42 nuclear powerplants licensed to operate in the united states today. the capacity of these plants is 25.000 megawatts. however. there are 56 more plants being built. and 101 additional axe on order. these 157 additional nuclear plants will have a capacity of 163.000 megawatts. almost 20 percent of this nations electric production capacity when they come on line. one of the problems that this nation faces in responding to the energy crisis is the need to reduce the long leadtime in getting these nuclear plants operating. at present. the leadtime required from the moment a utility commits itself to build a nuclear plant until the power is on line varies from 8 to 10 years. this includes the tragic loss of from 2 to 4 years in totally unnecessary delays that have nothing to do with public safety or with protection of the environment. to understand the impact of these delays. it is instructive to compare the amount of energy that will be produced by these 157 plants that are already ordered or being built. we would have to burn 5 million barrels of oil per day to produce this much electricity. at only $10 per barrel. the saving from getting these nuclear plant on line 1 year sooner would be $18 billion. obviously it is essential that we enact appropriate legislation to eliminate needless delays in getting nuclear powerplants on line. while still protecting public safety and the environment. on february 14. i introduced h.r. 12823. a nuclear power plant siting bill designed to accomplish these ends. joining me in cosponsoring this legislation march 7. 1.974 were chairman mel pri c of the joint committee on atomic energy and congressman chet holifield and craig hosmer of the committee. on march 3 the identical bill was submitted with the cosponsorship of all the house members of the joint committee on atomic energy. the purpose of this legislation is to eliminate duplication and unnecessary delays in approving sites for nuclear powerplants. preserve states rights. provide a greater degree of local participation in decisionmaking. and maintain the maximum standards for protecting the environment and the public. i anticipate that if such a siting bill is adopted. and if the atomic energy commission establishes a program of licensing reactors simultaneously with site selection by individual states. we may reduce the time required to get a nuclear powerplant on line by from 1 to 2 years. the entire emphasis on this legislation is to transfer as much authority as possible for siting nuclear reactors to the individual states. however. each participating state must agree to meet all of the safety and environmental standards of the aec. and to act promptly and decisively on requests by utilities for nuclear powerplant sites. i believe that the incentives that are included in this proposed legislation should attract broad support. it provides: first. for industryincreased reliability in the expansion of utility systems. second. for the statesa preservation of states rights. an opportunity for responsible and constructive involvement with maximum autonomy. and an orderly process for handling problems that have. in many cases. seemed insurmountable. third. for all responsible environmentalistsan opportunity for local participation in working out the environmental factors involved in siting nuclear reactors. without the expense of hiring legal counsel. a builtin assurance of continued high quality environmental protection. an opportunity to help develop and plan integrated regional power programs. including the thoughtful consideration of alternate sites and transmission corridors. fourth. for the publica vast savings of money through lower electric rates. a significant economy in time in getting need electricity on the line. local participation in siting plants. and protecting the environment. an increased reliability in utility systems. and an increased assurance that electric energy will be available on schedule. fifth. for the congressa clean and simple bill. unencumbered by endless involvement in nonnuclear industrial siting decisions. an opportunity to offer the states a partnership plan in solving their problems. rather than the threat of coercion. a greater efficiency in the use of technical manpower. a guarantee of environmental protection. and. above all. action now to help solve the energy crisis. mr. speaker. i invite the serious consideration of all members of congress to this legislation. and i invite the consideration of it by the administration. the electric industry. and all persons seriously concerned with helping to solve the energy crisis while protecting the environment. i am convinced that if we all unite behind this legislation we can this year make significant progress in this matter.","administrator. national highway traffic safety administration. department of transportation. washington. d.c. dear mr. toms: in july 1972. the national highway traffic safety administration released its longawaited evaluation of the handling and stability of the 19601963 corvair. as you know. interest in the safety of the corvair has been widespread and it was hoped that the national highway traffic safety administrations study would conclusively settle the ongoingcontroversy. i have recently received a technical evaluation and letter from mr. ralph nader challenging several aspects of testing procedure and process utilized by the national highway traffic safety administration in its analysis of the corvair suspension system. mr. nader raises four major concerns: 1. alleged suppression of data from tests: why was the existence of data from corvair tests utilizing lightly loaded vehicles conducted at the texas transportation institute withheld from both the public and the panel until six months after the release of the completed nhtsa handling report (december 1972) ? does the recently revealed data invalidate the test procedures and controls described in the july report? to what do you attribute the inconsistent results of the recently revealed test data and the results obtained by the highway safety research institute? does the nhtsa believe that the difference between the recently revealed tti test series and the hsri test series are due to very subtle differences in the two vehicles tested. and if so. what is your conclusion with regard to the safety of corvair actually operating on the highways? what is the basis for nhtsas determination that the recently revealed data was not valid for the purpose of your investigation? 2. technical competence of the tests: why were the vehicles tested in only their fully loaded configuration? why were no tests carried out with human drivers under normal conditions (such as uneven road surfaces. reduced traction. wind. etc.)? why didnt the nhtsa pursue the effect of carbon monoxide from the defective heater on the drivers ability to control the vehicle? 3. potential conflicts of interest: has the administration determined to its satisfaction that no nhtsa officials assigned to the corvair handling and stability study were in conflict of interest by the holding of stock of the general motors corporation? 4. unquestioned adoption of general motors test results: did the nhtsa merely adopt general motors unsubstantiated rationale that numerous gm rollover tests conducted in 1959. 1962 and 1963 were not fairly representative of production corvairs in ordinary use? similarly. why did the nhtsa accept general motors discussion of drivervehicle interaction without substantiation for the particular case of the corvair? i solicit your comments and the analysis of the engineering panel on mr. naders letter and evaluation of the nhtsa study and i have enclosed copies of these documents for your information. i am looking forward to your response by february 15. 1973. my purpose in seeking your comments is not to prolong the corvair controversy. upon receipt of your response. i will evaluate your comments to determine whether the senate commerce committee should take direct action to assure timely and technically competent defect investigations by the nhtsa. sincerely yours.","over 3 years ago we made a socalled voluntary agreement with japan. at the time special steel in the united states was producing 99

upon the explanation of this bill. just offered by the gentleman from colorado . however. i would like to take just a moment to call attention to the importance of this measure to the state of idaho. idaho ranks second among the states in lead mine production. we produced 59.667 short tons last year. and that represents nearly onefourth of the entire national production. as a producer of recoverable zinc. idaho always ranks among the top three. the production figure for 1970 was 40.457 short tons. we know the relationship between stability in the mining community and the economy of idaho. several years ago. a prolonged strike in the lead mines had a disastrous effect on the economy of the wallacekellogg area and all of the idaho panhandle. but my interests in this measure are twofoldone is necessarily parochial. but the other national. today. the leadzinc industry has its back to the wall. threatened by cheap foreign labor and increased attention to environmental matters. allegations against the industry and proposed solutions for admitted problems are not at issue as far as this bill is concerned. suffice to say. the lead producers in this countrybeleaguered as they are by various domestic problemsshould not be expected to suffer at the hands of unfair foreign competion as well. the national security demands that the instability which has characterized so much of the mining industry in recent years be minimized. this bill takes an important step in that direction. i commend the chairman of the committee on interior and insular affairs for spearheading the effort which culminated in the introduction of this measure today. it is a pleasure for me to add my name as a cosponsor.","mr. chairman. i rise in support of the bill. s. 578. what we are doing here today. mr. chairman. is nothing new. the congress for many years has recognized that there are certain groups of federal employees who are engaged in hazardous occupations. from time to time we have included additional groups of these employees into that category and have provided retirement benefits which are a little more liberal than provided under the regular civil service retirement system. this is not only necessary but also desirable for people who are engaged in hazardous occupations. when they get a little bit older. they find there is a greater threat to their security and even to their lives by being engaged in this type of operation. then again. if we provide more liberal retirement. this will encourage younger people to come into this type of occupation in the federal service. what we are doing here today. mr. chairman. is including into the hazardous employment system for retirement purposes 11.000 federal fireflghters. i do not think there is any question that the facts will show that federal firefighters are every bit as qualified for these special retirement benefits as the other 14 occupational groups. mr. chairman. the fatality rate in firefighting is 275 percent higher than it is in other industries. the injury rate in the federal service for federal firefighters is three times greater than for all other federal employees. as was pointed out by the gentleman from maryland . these employees have to work a 72hour week. they have to work in the heat and in the cold and all hours of the day. they are subjected to the dangers of carbon monoxide and poison gases which unquestionably cause damage to the heart and to the cardiovascular system. and which contribute a great deal to the shortening of the lives of these people who are engaged in this occupation. the federal form for application for a position as a federal firefighter provides for a medical examination for hazardous and occupational duty. the same type of medical examination required for the other 14 positions. so what we are doing here today. mr. chairman. is adding one additional group to the 14 categories which have already been granted a special retirement benefit. i do not mean to imply that the 14 groups that we are already providing special retirement benefits for are not qualified or eligible. but i do feel that firefighters certainly are more entitled to this special retirement benefit than many of these 14 groups for which we have provided this special benefit: for example. the fish and wildlife service. the u.s. customs service. the internal revenue agents. investigators. immigration and naturalization service. there is no question that the federal firefighters are engaged in a more hazardous occupation than these other particular groups. and what we are doing here is to provide additional benefits for these people. they would average at least 13/4 percent compared to 1 1/a percent under present law. what we are providing is a 2percent formula retirement after 20 years of service and 50 years of age. i would say the average firefighter in this country has a much more liberal retirement system than that which we are providing today for our federal firefighters. i hope the committee and the house will adopt this legislation.","mr. speaker. last year. california was proud to provide the nation with another gem for its string of superlative national parks. now we want to do more about meeting the nations need for wood for new homes at a reasonable cost. also. what i am suggesting today. i hope will shed some light on the current lumber price situation and offer some constructive suggestions that will lead to a stabilization of lumber prices throughout the nation. at the outset let me say. that i believe we must now demonstrate that we can house our growing population while we preserve and enjoy our new redwood national park. information that has recently come to my attention shows that this can be done if the congress meets its responsibilities to assure sound management of our national forests. the information to which i refer is a statement ptesented in december of last year by mr. paul e. neff at the western forestry and conservation association meeting in san francisco. a copy of which is offered herewith for the record. mr. neffs statement. in my judgment. suggests specific opportunities for increasing the harvest of commercial timber from that area located in the counties of humboldt. del norte. and mendocino which are contiguous to the site of the redwood national park in california. it provides some of the details not available in the forest services statement made earlier this week to the house banking and currency committee. very briefly. mr. neff points out that. with the addition of just 12 employees. the forest service could increase the annual cut in three national forests by more than 73 million board feet. this timber would come from the salvage of dead trees that are normally lost to use and can be reached now without major road construction. with the completion of needed access roads. these three forests could provide each year more than 400 million board feet of mortality salvage. this timber. alone. would accommodate the building of more than 40.000 new homes each year! such timber losses as we are now experiencing are intolerable and our performance as the custodians of this great renewable natural resource leaves much to be desired. for this reason. i believe the congress should promptly give the forest service the tools it needs to expedite the movement of this lumber into the construction of homes. over the years. we who represent major timber regions have been urging congress and the executive branch to accelerate the forest service access road development program to permit intensified timber harvest and forest management programs to go forward. as a member of the house roads subcommittee. i can report that my colleagues have supported our request to the $170 million level. as recommended by the forest service as the required amount. regrettably. the previous administration and the appropriations committee funded only* $100 million toward this goal. i was also the principal author of the log export restriction bill that ultimately cleared the 90th congress as an amendment to the foreign aid bill. i say this only to remind my colleagues that those of us familiar with forestry and lumber products. have done everything possible to alleviate the log supply problem which is partially respon sible for the excessively high lumber prices. had our recommendations been followed fully. i do not believe we would have this problem today. for several years. however. the forest products industry and the economy of most lumber regions have been in a very depressed conditionits either \"feast or famine.\" many are just now recovering from some very lean years. and this is particularly true of the small mill owners and lumber operations. now for the first time in years. we have the opportunity to recover following a long period of adjustment. we can now look forward. i believe. to a leveling off of lumber prices and this. of course. will greatly benefit everyone concerned. therefore. i urge this congress and the administration to do everything possible to avoid a decline in our lumber economy at this crucial time. in summary. our goal must be: first. to construct more forest access roads. second.. to institute better forest management practices on public lands. and third. to create and maintain firm and stable timber prices. in conclusion. mr. speaker. i submit that the tight lumber prices of the past have contributed to the tight money policies of the present. if this nation is to adequately house its people. supply the jobs needed in forested areas. and properly manage our national forests--we. in the congress. must first make additional funds available for forest roads and other forest management practices and. secondly. develop a longrange method of finance and funding for the managers of our national forests that is sound. feasible. and certain to yield the revenues needed to constitute an \"investment\" in this great natural resource. the statement mentioned follows:","mr. president. i rise in support of the amendment offered by my senior colleague . so far as i know. no one in this body opposes the purpose of providing large amounts of money for recreational areas and to provide better development of the recreational areas we already have. the amendment offered by the senior senator from louisiana makes it clear that we favor an authorization of such amount as may be necessary to proceed with the full and complete development. as rapidly as funds can be made available. of the recreational facilities of this country. so the amendment. offered by the senior senator from louisiana . would make it clear that we would authorize the amount of funds requested by the sponsors of s. 1401 to be appropriated for the purposes that the sponsors of that measure request. where we take issue with the sponsors of that bill is that we believe it is bad legislative practice to attempt to earmark the revenues to be derived from exploration of the outer continental shelf to a recreation program. in that respect the bill would be very bad law. it would set a bad precedent. it would mortgage the future of the coastal states for programs having no relation to the origin of these funds. on that basis. mr. president. we feel that the bill should be amended to provide for authorization. as one member of this body. i would expect to vote for the appropriation of funds to support the authorization to provide for the purposes set forth in the bill and the purposes indicated in the committee report. as one who is chairman of the committee on finance. if need be i would even be willing to vote for a tax to provide the funds to advance the needs of recreation. as well as other purposes that we find to be desirable. if the funds for them should not be adequate for the purpose. but. mr. president. there are some things that are seriously wrong about the bill. particularly when it comes to earmarking these revenues for a recreation program. the legislation purports to dispose of funds which are presently subject to judicial proceedings before the supreme court of the united states. in a case to which the united states and louisiana are parties. the court is. at this time. attempting to determine the location of louisianas coastline. the resolution of the question of just where this coastline begins is essential to the ultimate determination of which party owns what part of the offshore lands. pending the final decision of the court on this question. as senators are aware. the funds yielded from the disputed area are deposited in an escrow account. this escrow account has now grown to a billion dollars and increases every day. while. to be sure. not all of the outer continental shelf revenues are held in escrow. a substantial part of these proceeds are so encumbered and will remain so until released by a decision of the court. despite this. the bill before us would include these impounded funds to the extent to which the federal government is determined to own them. i submit. mr. president. that it is not sound policy to legislate the disposition of property rights the ownership of which is still subject to judicial determination. a second objection which i have to the method used in this bill to derive the needed revenues is that the normal appropriating process is largely bypassed and instead a procedure which. if not exactly \"back door financing.\" is what we might call funding through an unlocked side door. s. 1401 dedicates approximately $100 million a year for the first 3 years and $200 million a year for the following 2 years from the outer continental shelf revenues to the land and water conservation fund. which is primarily a fund to provide additional recreation facilities. this is a total of $700 million over a 5year period. this money. once deposited in this fund. would be subject to appropriation by congress before it could be spent for the purposes set forth in the land and water conservation act of 1965. the fact remains. however. that subjecting of this money to the control of congress before leaving the fund is an empty gesture. since the truth of the matter is that congress will be compelled to either appropriate the full amount in the fund or see the money accumulate and remain unused. i cannot believe that congress wishes to hamstring itself in this way. i cannot believe that we want to tie the hands of our appropriation committees by passing to them a locked strongbox that only one key will open. i doubt that. at a time when the nation is at war and faces the greatest budgetary deficit in its history. with urgent and justifiable demands for more and more funds to cure the plethora of domestic ills we face. vi- should proceed to deny congress flexible access to this $700 million for use as prudently set priorities demand. for example. if our boys. who are fighting a war in vietnam. needed to be provided with weapons to fight that war. i doubt if congress would want a law on the statute books which provided that we could not use revenues derived from the outer continental shelf to provide for that war or to provide weapons for the men to defend themselves because we had locked that fund up for other purposes. or if someone wanted to be paid for performing a contract for the federal government. i doubt that we would want to say. \"we cannot pay the bill we owe you. because. while we have the money on hand. we have the money locked up to provide for more land for parks and recreational purposes.\" i doubt that congress would want to do that. when someone presented his government bond and asked to be paid the principal and interest owed by the federal government. i doubt that the federal government would like to establish a procedure which said. \"i am sorry. we cannot pay the interest on the federal debt because we have locked the money up in a fund far beyond its immediate needs to be used exclusively for recreational purposes.\" in other words. recreation. like the poverty program. the urban development program. the flood control program. the navigation program. the program for development of our resources. a great number of fine programs which i could list here. should be considered on its merits. the priorities should be judged. and the extent to which federal resources could be devoted to its purposes. as well as others. should then be determined. i notice that the sponsors of the measure. in the committee hearings. and to some extent in the committee report. made a great deal of the fact that congress has not appropriated enough money for recreational purposes. as indicated by the land and water conservation act. that is not the fault of the junior senator from louisiana. if more money had been asked for. the junior senator from louisiana would have been willing to vote for it. and i think a number of the rest of us would have been willing to vote for it. but if congress. in its judgment. did not think enough of the program to vote the amount of money the sponsors of the bill believe we should have voted. if congress did not place that high a priority on the program. at a time when we have a deficit of more than $20 billion. at a time when we are having to cut back on programs for health and welfare. at a time when we are being asked right now to vote a big tax increase for the people of the country. can it be said that we have such a surplus of funds that we can dedicate the resources of the outer continental shelf to recreation? can we justify doing this when we cannot find funds to provide for greatly needed and essential activities in this country? i doubt that congress would want to hamstring itself in that fashion. may i say further that to buy the argument of the sponsors of this bill that we must dedicate a huge portion of the revenues from the outer continental shelf to recreational purposes. and to the purchase of more land in pursuit of such purposes. because congress has been too niggardly in appropriating funds for that purpose in the past. is. in effect. for congress to vote a condemnation of itself. \"we did not vote enough money for this purpose.\" congress would in effect be saying. \"and. that being the case. we want to dedicate the whole of the resources to be produced in the outer continental shelf to be used for no other purpose but this very worthy purpose of recreation.\" some time ago. some senators wanted to dedicate the resources of the outer continental shelf to education. and they mustered a very substantial vote in support of that view. that happened when we were debating the tidelands bill. or the outer continental shelf bill. it was felt by congress that the resources of the area should go into the general fund of the treasury of the united states. and. as part of the general revenues. congress could then decide the best use to make of the income from the resources of these lands which constitute the outer continental shelf. i must confess. mr. president. that i have received the impression from time to time that some people view the revenue from oil produced beyond a state boundary as just a pot of gold that somebody has found out there at the end of the rainbow. for which no one paid anything. they would like us to regard it as sort of like gold coins dropping from heaven that nobody knew what to do with. and that therefore it would be desirable to dedicate them to this or that use. mr. president. why should not these revenues. presently accruing to the government of the united states. be spent the same as other revenues accruing to the government of the united states? why should they not be used in whatever manner congress may please. to meet all national needs. all national priorities. in whatever amount congress may find to be useful for this purpose? an argument that can be made to the contrary is that there is sometimes a connection between a particular purpose and the funds that come to be dedicated for that purpose. we have seen such special connections. it was contended. when we undertook to build a national interstate highway system. that we should increase the gasoline tax. that tax is. in effect. a user tax on those who use the highways. and so it was argued. with good logic. that that money should be dedicated to building highways. people who paid that gasoline tax would know that they were then paying for more highways and for better highways. that kind of dedication can be well understood. it is more understandable to a taxpayer when he is called upon to pay a high tax on gasoline. since he knows that he is paying the tax for the highway he is driving on. and it is found to be more acceptable. in some instances. on that basis. the committee seeks to find a connection between the outer continental shelf and the national parks and recreational activities in its report. it says. on page 2 of the report: the committees recommendation regarding the use of a portion of the receipts from outer continental shelf lands as an additional source of revenue to finance the outdoor recreation programs authorized by the land and water conservation fund act is based on the fully tenable proposition that the revenues from one natural resource which belongs to all the peoplenow. get this. mr. presidentthat the revenues from one natural resource which belongs to all the people of the united statesin this instance a depleting resourceshould be reinvested in outdoor recreation areas and developments which become a part of the permanent estate of the nation for the use. benefit. and enjoyment of all its citizens of this and future generations. mr. president. on that committee serve a number of very able senators who come from states where the federal government owns large amounts of land. the revenues from those lands. from the timber resources and the oil and gas beneath those lands. can equally be regarded as a natural resource belonging to all the people of the united states. but in years past. congress has found a higher use for the revenues derived from the minerals under those federally owned public lands than to put them to recreational uses. the higher use. in the main. has been to take the depleting resources that have been developed from those lands. and use the revenues thus derived to build power facilities. to capture the waters of the streams that flow through or within the areas. to build irrigation structures. and to make arable arid lands which would otherwise be nonproductive. so that when the resource is depleted. there will be something there to take its place. people can then live on the land. farm it. and make income from it. they can make it productive. a federal program of that sort is directed toward those states where large amounts of federal land are located. this is a better use. because it takes the depleting resource and uses the income from it to develop the same geographical area that is being depleted. i suppose it never occurred to the sponsors of this legislation that the outer continental shelf itself is a vast resource of the federal government. it can be claimed to belong to all people of the united states. should not be damaged or destroyed. it should be used constructively for development of its resources. so that when those resources are gone. we may have not just a polluted site or an eyesore for the country. but instead a great national asset that may continue to produce. and from which people can make their livelihood when they can no longer work it to produce oil. gas. phosphates. sulfur. and other minerals from the sea. some day. those resources will be gone. some day. i have no doubt. we will succeed in convincing the majority of both the house of representatives and the senate that the enormous resources of the ocean. those on the continental shelf of the united states in particular. should bedeveloped. and that the precedents set by the reclamation laws. that took the revenues of that development and reinvested them in providing resources that would last for many years. if not hundreds of years and indefinitely into the future. if they were developed and properly used. should be followed in seeking to find higher purposes for these revenues than to dedicate them to recreation. that is something. however. that would have to depend on the judgment of congress. and. if such a decision should be reached. at least it should follow the sound conservation principle that we would first use revenues from those resources to repair the damage done to it by exploiting it and. second. would use the revenues to develop something that could be put there when the resources that are being depleted have been taken away and are gone. in that way we will have something that people can use indefinitely into the future to provide income and opportunity for the people. in other words. the resources of the sea do not constitute merely a pot of gold that somebody locked onto. they are a godgiven asset. they were intended to be used by mankind. mr. president. the bill as written is a wrong step in the right direction. to accomplish an altogether salutary end. it would. in an unnecessary way. make meaningless our normal appropriating process and would absolve congress of its responsibility to plan and carry out an active and direct role in the fiscal processes of the federal government. i will not dwell further on this point. since my senior colleague from louisiana . a member of the appropriations committee. has already addressed himself to this point. i do want to emphasize strongly. however. that the method proposed here to finance this fund is imprudent. unwise. and wholly unnecessary. there is no valid reason for linking the outer continental shelf revenues to the needs of the land and water conservation fund. and should the sponsors agree to an amendment severing this illconceived connection and proceed through normal channels to fund this worthy program. i would be happy to support their good cause. there are other and perhaps more compelling reasons for refusing to link up offshore mineral revenues with the land and water conservation fund. there can be no valid argument for tying the two together. as i understand the argument advanced in the committee report accompanying s. 1401. there is clearly no justification in terms of sound fiscal planning for bypassing the normal appropriations committee procedures of this body. as a result. the argument of the sponsors of the bill rests entirely upon the creation of a fictional connection between the outer continental shelf and the need of our citizens for recreational facilities. the proponents attempt to justify the tapping of outer continental shelf receipts and the dedicating of them by maintaining that this connection represents sound conservationist policy.","mr. speaker. today i am reintroducing two bills designed to attack the flood of pornographic mail which pollutes our postal system. a recent report from the attorney general of my state of california reveals disturbing facts about the amount of obscene and pornographic material which is produced in our state. the smut industry grosses more than $20 million a year from the sale of its offensive matter. and the disturbing thing is that most of this smut is delivered through the services of the u.s. postal system. the decent citizens of my state are appalled at this situation. they are taking steps toward halting production of this pornographic material on the state level. but they need the strong arm of federal law to stop the flow of obscene matter through the postal system. the attorney generals report cites los angeles as a central source for obscene matter mailed throughout the nation. the johnson administration has completely ignored this major problem facing lawenforcement agencies. the president recently proposed a series of major anticrime bills to the congress. but not one word was said about the rising tide of pornography. because efforts to combat obscenity have been stymied in the courts. i believe that the congress must give to every american the weapons to protect his family against the smut being dumped into his mail box.","mr. chairman. i rise in opposition to the amendment. mr. chairman. it will not be necessary for me to take more than a few seconds in opposition to this amendment. of course. mr. chairman. it is the same amendment that the gentleman from texas has offered to title i. i believe it is necessary only to point out that. of course. there are no requirements contained in the bill. as the gentleman seems to believe there are. mr. chairman. i might say that the gentleman is flailing at windmills. and inasmuch as we have covered this ground before. not longer than 2 hours ago. i would hope that we could dispose of this amendment and that the members of the committee would join me in voting it down.","mr. president. i regret very much what took place in wisconsin. minnesota. and other areas of the country. but at the same time i cannot help remembering that there was another quite serious flood in that area of the country several years ago. the appropriations subcommittee on public works took up the question of providing. not relief. but ways and means to prevent such floods. we asked the corps of engineers to survey the problem to find exactly what would be required. the local people were at first very cooperative. then the sun came back out. and for some reason the local interest died away. the assurances of local cooperation were withdrawn. mr. president. i would like to insert at this point in the record a memorandum on what was experienced in regard to projects on the minnesota river at mankato and north mankato. it points out clearly that if the corps had been able to proceed with its work. we would not now have to be faced with a request to liberalize the federal governments policies with respect to emergency and disaster aid.","mr. speaker. today marks the fourth anniversary of the independence of nigeria. on this memorable occasion. we wish to take opportunity to extend warm felicitations to his excellency the president of nigeria. anamdi azikiwe. and to the charg6 daffaires ad interim. godwin a. onyegbula. it is with pride and pleasure that we salute the government and people of nigeria on this occasion. nigeria. the ninth most populous country in the world. is an effectively functioning democracy. a land of rich and varied resources. and a nation of industrious and educationconscious people. . nigeria is physically a land of contrastsfrom its semidesert muslim north of ancient highwalled towns to the tropical coastal region of the west. to the forests of the east. the diverse regions of nigeriaeastern. western. midwestern. and northernare united in a federal system of government in which each region has its own parliament and executive with fairly extensive powers. the nigerian economy has been achieving a steady rate of growth in this stable political climate. over the past decade the average annual increase in national output has approximated 4 percent. keeping comfortably ahead of the annual estimated population increase of 2 percent. the economy is based heavily on agriculture. but contrary to many of the african economies. crops are widely diversified. thus. nigerias prosperity is not dependent on the success of a single crop. most observers are confident that the economy will continue to grow at an average rate of 4 percent. crop production reached record levels in 1963. resulting in an estimated 6 percent gross national product increase during that year. significantly above the 4percent average over the past decade. another promising aspect of the nigerian economy is the existence of rich fuel and energy resources. as yet largely unexploited. a recent aid special research report on sources of energy in nigeria notes that nigeria has ample volumes of petroleum. natural gas. coal. lignite. wood. and hydroelectric power. the report points up eight specific investment possibilities for the consideration of private investors. including carbonization of coal. construction of lead and aluminum smelters. resin manufacture. and production of petroleum coke. the existence of these energy resources provides the key to nigerias future economic development. energy is a prerequisite to industrialization. and industrialization is essential to support a continuing upward trend in the economy. as yet industry contributes only a small portion of nigerias gross national product. but encouragement of private foreign investment for industrial development has already yielded some promising results. perhaps most important. the nigerian government is intensely aware of nigerias need for foreign capital and is determined to do everything possible to encourage and reassure private foreign investors. a national development plan for the years 196268 calls for private foreign capital investment of $100 million a year. a special section on nigeria in the new york times of january 20. 1964. included a fullpage advertisement listing incentives for private foreign investment. the same section contained a message from prime minister abubakar tafawa balewa assuring potential investors that oversea capital under mutually satisfactory conditions is most welcome in the federal republic of nigeria. and that the interest of investors will always be safeguarded. we commend the approach of the nigerian government to its economic development problems. we congratulate nigeria on achieving a democratic. federal system of government. we salute you. prime minister balewa and the people of nigeria. on the fourth anniversary of your independence and express our sincerest wishes for the continued successful development of your country. nice name on a bad bill","mr. chairman. i have listened intently to the debate on h.r. 5279 and read the report of the committee amounting to some 46 pages. but i still have many reservations. i understand that no record vote was had because many do not want to go on record on this bill. this i do not understand. i appreciate the fact that the committee has cut out $92.818.800 worth of fat from this bill. i am glad to join with my colleagues in supporting amendments which have cut another $6.600.000 from the bill. i also supported the amendment of the gentleman from virginia and the gentleman from florida. which would have eliminated another $11 million had they passed. this bill as amended still is almost $31 million over the current appropriation. mr. speaker. in my opinion. the department of the interior and the related agencies have not suffered for lack of money in the current budget. included in this $31 million is 796 new civilian federal employees. the cost of which i cannot accurately determine from the report. the titles and groupings in the report make it impossible to determine all the fat in this appropriation. but some of it is indicated to me by comparison with this current years authorization. i cannot in good conscious support the expenditures of $310.000 for planning of the fish aquarium which will ultimately cost the taxpayers $10 million. it is said it would not cost a centbut a third of a million is being spent todayand it is the taxpayers money. i must agree with judge smith that $10 million for the creation of wetlands for duck refuges. while admirable. is not essential. could not the department of agriculture quit paying for draining such lands and alleviate the problem? apparently this congress is more interested in ducks than peoplein fowls than taxpayers. people in my state could use some flood control projects rather than this \"bird money.\" there is already $4 million available for this work from the sale of federal hunting stamps. let us get our fiscal affairs in order and spend our moneyif we muston our people. not the birds and foreign enemy countries. this $10 million for the birds is an increase of $3 million over the current year. i see salaries for the office of saline water are up $2.400.000. while operating expenses are down $150.000. it appears to be more and higher paid employees to do less work. salaries of the office of the solicitor are up $138.000. salaries of the office of the secretary are up $301.000. salaries of the commission of fine arts up $8.000. salaries of the national planning commission are up $25.000 and the salaries and expenses of the smithsonian institution up $2.055.000. mr. chairman. i ask why this appro-. priation cannot be cut further. sir. if this is an example of a hard budget. i would hate to see a soft one. i suppose that without a record vote which i desired that this statement is indicative of my stand. i am willing to be counted.","mr. speaker. the storm of march 6 and 7 which ravaged the atlantic coastal areas caused tremendous damage. this damage would have been infinitely greater except for the extensive work of the corps of engineers in constructing. in cooperation with the states. vital beach erosion projects which have been authorized over the years by the house committee on public works. one hears from time to time the arguments that rivers and harbors and flood control legislation is mere \"pork barrel.\" the savings not only in millions of dollars of property damage from these projects. plus the even greater probable savings in human lives and the resulting misery from this storm damage as a result of the existence of these engineering works. is certainly proof to the contrary. in this connection i would like to insert in the record at this point an article from the highly respected engineering newsrecord dated april 5. 1962. which clearly points out these facts:","mr. chairman. i yield myself such time as i may consume. mr. chairman. in the committees consideration of the fiscal year 1962 military construction program it has continued several policies to the fullest extent practicable in determining the projects and the funds to be approved. these policies are listed on page 2 of the committee report. but let me reiterate them to you at this time. first and most important is the disapproval of projects not clearly essential to the military posture of this nation at the present time or in the foreseeable future. we are constantly being reminded of the effect of breakthroughs in scientific and technological fields. the present world situation. and crises breaking out in various and sundry trouble spots. all of which can change the direction of our military effort and consequently the amount of spending of military funds on a short notice. yet in times like these the department of defense continues to propose business as usual in the military construction program. including projects which are planned around obsolete or marginal requirements. already we have seen installations at which capehart housing has recently been constructed declared excess to the needs of the military. needless to say the federal government and the taxpayers will have to pick up the bill for the remaining costs of this housing. i have no doubt that announcements of further closings will eventually be made where the same situation exists. the committee does not feel that it can accept as essential the construction of officers clubs. additional commissaries. the needless transfer of functions. or facilities in support of research and development programs which can easily be performed by private institutions or other government agencies. second. the committee has always insisted that maximum utilization be made of existing facilities. the services are still requesting funds for the replacement of facilities while planning at the same time to continue to hold the facilities to be replaced for socalled mobilization reserve or less important purposes. the committee has taken the attitude that if the facilities are good enough to hold in standby reserve or for other purposes that there is no reason for new construction. third. projects have been deleted where the costs were excessive or plans were not solid. your committee has again recommended against appropriation of funds in several instances involving complicated structures where the architect engineer to do the planning and design work had not yet been appointed or where plans were in the beginning stage. we believe the congress is entitled to firm and realistic cost estimates before funds are appropriated. the committee has deleted the various requests for hospitals for the department of the air force and reduced the request for army hospitals because of these excessive cost factors and because the requirements submitted in support of the estimates were entirely unrealistic and improperly reviewed. fourth. the committee has insisted that maximum utilization be made of funds appropriated in support of prior year programs and remaining uncommitted or unobligated. the nature of the military construction program is such that changes in technology. changing requirements. and highly competitive bids constantly result in overall savings. the committee does not feel that sufficient emphasis has been given by the departments to the recoupment of these funds and their application to the military construction program for fiscal year 1962 in lieu of requesting new funds. there seems to be a growing tendency on the part of the services to build up socalled slush funds to be used to cover mistakes or perhaps request projects of a lesser priority than those included in the regular military construction program. needless to say the committee will expect the department of defense and the services to make marked progress in this field in the immediate future. in other words. mr. chairman. the committee insists on a firm realistic military construction program based on sound requirements. sound planning. and supported only by the funds needed to accomplish the construction in an efficient and economical manner. those estimates which do not meet the standards i have outlined have either been deleted or reduced. with these policies in mind the committee considered budget estimates totaling $1.035.568.000 and recommends appropriations of $886.768.000. a reduction of $148.800.000 in the estimates. a detailed tabulation of the projects approved by the committee will be found at the end of the report and in certain portions of the committee hearings. the specific reductions will be found in the body of the report accompanying this bill. the program approved by the committee places emphasis on the construction of facilities to strengthen and modernize essential operating forces. for example. $323 million or approximately 40 percent of the program funded for the active services relates to essential missile facilities. these include facilities in support of operational squadrons of the solid propellant minuteman. intercontinental ballistic missile. additional training and support facilities for the navy nikehercules and hawk missile system. the construction of facilities in support of the research. development. test and evaluation activities of the military services requires another large portion of the funds. for example. the committee has included $17.500.000 for the construction of an advanced aerospace environmental test chamber at the arnold engineering development test center. in tennessee. this test chamber is designed to permit the testing of full scale models of space vehicles and satellites. the chamber will be available. not only for programs of the department of defense. but for the national aeronautics and space administration programs as well. another large segment of the program relates to facilities in support of worldwide communication requirements. many of which are vitally tied in with the intelligence functions of the department of defense. one of the largest communications programs approved is an additional $36 million for the naval radio research station. sugar grove. w. va. the fiscal year 1962 program sees a reinstitution of the use of appropriated funds for the construction of family housing. i am personally heartily in favor of this change and believe that it will not only force a closer review of housing requirements by the services and the department of defense. but will result in saving of funds and in the construction of better housing. the committee has recommended the approval of the complete military housing program approved in the military construction authorization act and requested by the department of defense. a total of 5.000 units. total cost of this program including both the appropriated fund housing and capehart housing support is $38.100.000. many of you have asked questions about armory and other construction projects for the reserve and national guard components of the services. i","mr. president. i desire to pay tribute to the members of the committee who spent so much time in the hearings on this bill and in preparing the bill and bringing it to the floor of the senate. i wish to pay a special tribute to the chairman of the committee. the senator from new mexico . and also to the senator from michigan . the chairman of our subcommittee on public roads. in addition to carrying that load. the senator from michigan also was most diligent in his work on this bill. i also wish to pay special tribute to the distinguished senior senator from west virginia . the chairman of the subcommittee on public buildings and grounds. whose contributions to this bill were substantial. in fact. mr. president. i should like to pay a tribute to each member of this committee. in that regard. i wish publicly to express my appreciation of. and my friendship for. the distinguished senator from south dakota . he and i have been members of this committee ever since i have been a member of the senate. i cannot recall when there was ever any substantial difference of opinlon between the senator from south dakota and myself with reference to the principles which should be recognized and embodied and developed in the omnibus rivers and harbors bills and in other publicresource development bills which our committee has brought to this floor. for action by the senate. the senator from south dakota referred to the fact that. two years ago. he and i jointly sponsored title iii of the flood control act of 1958. directing the recognition by both the bureau of reclamation and the corps of engineers of the evaluation of water storage space and multiple development projects for municipal and industrial water supply. even in the brief time that act has been the law. it has demonstrated again and again the justification for that title and the wisdom of the congress in enacting it. title iii of this bill is another milestone in the preparation and enactment of legislation to develop our natural resources and in bringing about recognition of the economic value of the recreational features of multiplepurpose projects. all through the development of this bill. mr. president. there has been a spirit of cooperation. mutual respect. and dedication by the members of our committee. both in the preparation of the particular provisions and in the development of a bill which would do justice to the needs of the nation for an accelerated program of waterresource development and the building of projects to make that possible. on the committee. there was no partisanship in reference to this bill. the members on both sides of the aisledemocrats and republicansgave equally of themselves and of their ability and their efforts to make a success of the bill. i am happy to have had a part in that work and. particularly. with reference to the provisions which directly affect my state of oklahoma. but i should like to say here. as i have often said in the committee. mr. president. that. to me. waterresources development is a matter of the highest national interest. and of the greatest value in contributing to the national security and safety and to the national economic growth and development. and it has have been completed at a cost of $25 been in the spirit of that belief that i million. 12 additional projects are now. and the other members of the commit- or soon will be. under construction at a tee have developed this bill and have cost of $95 million. and 4 more estibrought it to the floor. mated to cost $30 million are now under mr. president. i urge that the senate design. pass the bill. \"this total of 29 flood control projects","i quite agree that we are demanding of the veterans more interest than we demand from purchasers of farms and other things which the government finances. certainly we are not giving the veterans anything. those who think we are have not looked at the figures. a veteran can borrow from the va. under the proposed increase. at 5%/. percent. or he can go to the fha. which conducts a companion operation. and borrow for 514 percent. as of today. historically there has always been a difference. by statute requiring that gi rates had to be onehalf of 1 percent lower than fha rates. this bill would wipe out that statutory difference. are we giving the veteran anything? today we are lending money to the nonveteran. or to anyone else. at the same 514 percent of fha rate. that is the same rate which is proposed in the bill for loans to veterans. as interest rates reach outer space. it is having the effect of giving priority to private investment rather than the financing of the $280 billion debt. which must be rolled over in huge amounts almost every other month by the treasury. when we again start interest rates up. the man who has money to invest on a longterm basis will wait for the next raise. and an increase of onefourth of 1 percent or onehalf of 1 percent will accomplish that result. when the bill was before us 10 months ago my very dear friend the senator from utah said on the floor: by raising the interest rate onehalf of 1 percent. a flood of money was brought to bear on the veterans housing problem. a similar realistic facing of the interest problem of 1958 could bring about the same kind of result. where is the flood? it went down to a small trickle in about 3 months after the passage of that act. my dear friend the senator from connecticut said on that occasion: what we are seeking to do in the bill is to provide the veterans. as the american legion so urgently requests. with the same possibility of attracting money as is afforded other citizens. and at a differential of onehalf of 1 percent * * *. the committee bill would establish a ceiling. not a floor. ten months ago there was the promise of great results. throughout the debate we were told. \"give them this added money and we will be able to release a flood of private investments that will meet the need for gi housing.\" the senator from pennsylvania pointed out that the mortgage rate decline was being delayed by a relatively small number of mortgage lenders. who can hold up the rate long after the general money market has loosened. i took occasion to point out that there was no wisdom in throwing a baby off the sleigh to the wolves. because every time we throw a baby off the sleigh the wolves will follow the sleigh for another baby. we threw one baby out. in the form of an additional onefourth of 1 percent interest. the wolves are back looking for twins. onehalf of 1 percent interest. the capehart mortgages are as good as a government bond. why should they bring 5 or 51/2 percent interest. which is the proposed ceiling in the bill? what effect would breaking the ceiling have? it seems to me that when we increase the rate we are bound to increase the cost to the government borrowing generally. i took occasion to check the capehart financing. we have outstanding. under construction today. $1.139 million worth of housing. and the federal national mortgage association has commitments for $424 million of this money. $660 million is in private commitments. using that as a gage. if we raise the interest rate on capehart housing. by threefourths of 1 percent. it would mean that in 30 years it will cost us $196.375.000. that is one example. fnma has a considerable portfolio of government insured mortgages. a total of $3.244 million. a substantial proportion of them represent capehart housing. at 4 percent. if we raise the rate to 5 percent on capehart housing. we shall lose many millions of dollars in the resale value of these older issues. something will have to be done to keep from breaking the private contractors. i have talked to some of them. and they are very much concerned. they are relying on private financing for $660 million. and they have standby commitments on 41/4 percent mortgages. if we raise the rate to 5 percent. what will it do to those people? they are under firm contracts. the result will be that their 4/4percent mortgages will be worth 95 instead of 100 percent on the market. therefore they will have to further discount the bonds.","mr. speaker. i wish to join wholeheartedly with the gentleman from mississippi and to commend him for his statement. the entire nation and particularly my state of california has a tremendous stake in the passage of the rivers and harbors bill. s. 497. i wish to specifically commend his statement on hidden and buchanan reservoirs in the san joaquin valley of california. which were two of the projects used as a basis for the veto. i have just returned from inspection of flood damage in northern and central california estimated to be $32 million. these two dams would have substantially reduced this damage. and the need for their construction has been even more firmly established. the army engineers have reported the necessity for these projects. as has the state of california. it is regrettable that the administration has failed to recognize that its original objections made 10 years ago have long since ceased to have any validity. if indeed. they had then.","mr. president. my colleague earlier today discussed a joint letter which a number of democratic senators from the columbia basin states have received from the administration. supplementing what my colleague said. i wish to make these brief remarks. on may 8. the 7 democratic senators from the columbia basin states wrote to the president requesting a joint conference to discuss the utter confusion within the administration on columbia basin resource development. yesterday each senator received a reply from a presidential assistant saying. among other things. \"the president asked me to say that he believes such a meeting would be premature at this time.\" this is an amazing comment. the various executive agencies and the fpc are hopelessly at odds about power. flood control. navigation. and irrigation development. the voters of the area made very clear their dissatisfaction with the administrations policies. but the president believes a meeting on the subject would be premature. yet only a few lines later the white house letter expresses the hope that the congress and all agencies of the executive branch will join together to seek solutions which confront the columbia river basin as a whole. how are congress and the executive to join together if the representatives of the region are told that a presidential conference with them would be premature? as the letter we sent points out. the various executive agencies and the federal power commission are going off in all directions. it is quite clear that the confusion stems directly from the administrations scuttling of high hells canyon dam because the loss of its 4 million acrefeet of water storage for power and flood control would disrupt all basin planning to date. as in 1954. the administration holds out hope of vast new storage at libby dam. yet libby dam. a highly desirable project. is not an alternative to hells canyon dam. furthermore. it is snarled in disagreement with canada on the sharing of benefits. due in large measure to administration bungling. for example. in 1953 this administration broke off negotiations with canada on the subject. and the republican chairman of the senate public works committee introduced a bill to rescind the authorization of the libby dam. since 1953. negotiations have been complicatd by strange and legalistic arguments put forward by the united states representative. len jordan. former republican governor of idaho. and an outspoken foe of federal development. as i have predicted for years. loss of the hells canyon dam would mean administration attempts to substitute undesirable projects elsewhere. already the senate has passed a limited authorization for bruces eddy dam. now the white house letter puts forward a revival of plans for penny cliffs dam. which has an even greater adverse effect upon fish and conservation. furthermore. the white house acts as if the interior departments studies of pleasant valley dam and the federal power commission staff recommendations for nez perce dam are consistent. they are not. indeed. secretary seaton. according to press reports not denied. has been put under wraps in respect to a higher pleasant valley dam. and the federal power commission is sailing along as if seaton never informed it of his study. if anything is premature in this situation. it is nez perce dam. fish studies are fine. but it is fantastic to hold out nez perce dam as a reasonable expectation for the future. at every turn the administration is scuttling full. comprehensive river development. why. for example. is there no mention in the white house letter of development of the magnificent paradise dam site? it is because a private utility combine has marked it for really insignficant development. why is no mention made of administration failure to request funds for the great john day damthe only major multipurpose dam ready for construction? it is because the administration has not given up its delaying tactics in the hope of fostering its private utility partnership scheme. the white house reply will be read with disappointment and chagrin in the pacific northwest. furthermore. mr. president. it is my prediction that it will teach the conservation groups the importance of their proceeding without any delay whatsoever in making clear to the administration that they intend to do everything they can to stop the anticonservation program which has come to characterize the naturalresources program of this administration. mr. president. i turn now to another subject.","if i correctly understand the senators response. i think i am completely satisfied as to the point i have in mind. do i correctly understand that his amendment has no relation at all to drainage which is incidental to floodcontrol projects?","mr. speaker. the sertoma club of washington at its luncheon meeting on may 3 heard an address by wendel b. barnes. administrator of small business administration. and because of the informative nature of his presentation. i would like to include his comments in the record under leave to extend my remarks: basic programs or sba an outstanding fact about the small business administration is that it is a service organization100 percent. the agency is dedicated to service to the smallbusiness concern. it operates on the principle that onthespot assistance. through its field offilees. is more valuable than remote analysis. the small business administration does not operate in an ivory tower. we take a realistic approach to all of the problems of small business and we operate on the community level insofar as that is possible. we like to meet the businessman on his own ground. today i want to bring you a few examples of how the small business administration operates its various programs. i want to give you concrete examples of the service to small business provided every day. in our approach to the problems of small business. the small business administration always tries to be humane. considerate. and sympathetic. this. of course. is the decent way. it is a pattern of conduct that was established by president eisenhower himself. in an address in denver a year ago. the president. speaking of the program of his administration. had this to say: \"now. this program at home can be defined best. i think. by saying this: that it has been a liberal program in all of those things that bring the federal government in contact with the individual. when it deals with the individual and his problems. in this field. the government tries to be humane. considerate. and sympatheticand that is true liberalism.\" that is what the president said. and the small business administration. i can assure you. is striving hard to live up to this high concept of public service. in creating the small business administration about 2 years ago. congress and president eisenhower recognized that in these changing times small firms have special problems. and it is desirable to have an independent agency in the government where these problems can be taken up and where solutions can be worked out on a cooperative basis. to carry out this assignment. the small business administration has developed programs of giving financial counseling and assistance to small firms. of helping small firms get government contracts and subcontracts. of providing them with managerial and technical assistancp. and providing products assistanceincluding product development and improvement. let me explain these basic programs in more detail. the agencys financial specialists have counseled with thousands of proprietors of small firms. and have helped many of them arrange loans from private lending sources. or have shown them how. by making some changes in their methods of operation. they could continue to operate satisfactorily without the necessity of a loan from either government or private sources. in the loans made the emphasis is always on helping the small firm develop a line of credit at his home bank. let me cite briefly a couple of examples: a little more than a year ago. the proprietor of a small firm in coral gables. fla.. came to our field office in miami seeking financial help. his firm was engaged in manufacturing rattan and other types of furniture. and was a pioneer in the field of offering employment to physically handicapped persons. it had received recognition from the presidents committee on employment of the physically handicapped. it had been written up in the local newspapers and in a national magazine. well. the proprietor of this firm came to the small business administration and asked us to share in a $20.000 bankparticipation loan to help him increase his production. the firm was then employing 23 persons. most of them physically handicapped. and the proprietor wanted to expandto provide employment for 17 more physically handicapped persons. he had already been to see his bank. we require applicants to seek the loan from their banks first. since we do not wish to compete with private banks. the banker wanted to make the loan. but it was against the banks policy to make loans for such a long termin this case 4 years. however. the bank would take half of the loan. if the small business administration would take half. our investigation was favorable. and a short while later the funds were disbursed to help this firm remodel and expand. and provide more jobs for physically handicapped persons. in this type of loan the bank advanced all of the funds. and we agreed to purchase our share later. if called upon. no funds were withdrawn from the united states treasury. that is the story of one of our bankparticipation loansthe story of a service we were able to provide. let us take another case. the operator of a popcornprocessing plant in a small maryland town wanted to build a similar plant in a nearby delaware community to meet the needs of farmers growing popcorn on restricted acreageland that could not be used for growing governmentsupported crops. this enterprising smallbusiness man located an abandoned building. but he needed drying crips to store the corn. conveyor belts to move it. machinery to shell. clean. and package it. that would take $150.000 that he didnt have. the man went to his bank. and the loan looked good to the banker. except for one thing. it was a small bank. and its legal maximum for a loan was $15.000. the banks bigcity correspondent wasnt interested in a term loan. they specialized in commercial loans that could be paid back in 90. or 120 days. so the local banker sent the businessman to see us. we found that he was eligiblehe had a sound business proposition. the result was a $150.000 loanour limitat 6 percent for 10 years. the local bank took 10 percent. or $15.000. of the loan. as a result. nearly 500 farmers in the area served by this new business now save $5 a ton in costs they formerly had to pay to get their popcorn to market. a new business has been established in a community. providing employment where it was badly needed. through this loan we helped the entire community. another example of service. the small business administration also has a disasterloan programa purely humanitarian function. we provide financial assistance to individuals and to businesses that need help because of losses suffered in natural catastrophes. such as hurricanes. tornadoes. floods. or other disasters. so you can see that the small business administration is a service agency. all of our programs are to provide service to the business community. let us now consider our program to help small firms get government contracts and subcontracts. again i want to cite actual examples. the small business administration has representatives stationed in the principal procurement centers of the military department across the country. here. all individual proposed procurements valued at $10.000 or more (except those classified as confidential or higher) are screened jointly by the small business administration representatives and military procurement officers. those found suitable for performance by small business. if jointly agreed to by the small business administration and the military. are earmarked and reserved exclusively for competitive award to small firms. here is an example of the help we gave to one small firm. i quote from a letter we received from the firm. it says: \"you will be pleased to know that as a result of the excellent cooperation you have given us in the past. this company has been awarded * * * united states navy contract for $188.076. please extend to your entire organization our heartfelt thanks.\" another example of service. our assistance in helping firms get government contracts also extends to subcontracts let by prime contractors performing work for the government. here is an example of this type of service. officials of a small firm visited the small business administration regional office at kansas city seeking work because their tool department was operating at only 10 percent of capacity. the regional office studied the firms capabilities. recommended it to a large manufacturer. and arranged a meeting between the two. the small firm later reported that as a result of this assistance it expected to receive sufficient work to keep its tool shop operating at full capacity. another program we have is that of providing small firms with managerial and technical assistance. we publish three series of practical. helpful. leaflets called management. technical. and marketers aids for small business. these leaflets cover a wide range of management and production problems. telling how to recognize and deal with them. they are available free at all of our field offices. they have been in great demand. regarding these publications. a manufacturers supply company in indiana said: \"the management and technical aids are excellent. the ideas obtained from one aid alone enabled our company to make a saving of more than $1.000.\" regarding these same publications. a trust company in new york state said: \"we use your aids as a part of a business reference library for the use of small business cona3373 cerns in this area. the commercial banks of the area recently held a 10week course for owners of smgil firms. and among the text and reference material used by each of the 100 participants were all of your aids published to date.\" one of our newest programs is that of products assistance. it is designed to meet the problem faced by many small business concerns. of keeping abreast of product and marketing developments. this program has a twofold goal: to assist in strengthening the independent small firms of the nation. and to help in developing the actual and potential capacities of small businessthus increasing the contribution of small firms to the national economy and to themselves. perhaps the best way to tell about this new program is to mention some problems that are common to many owners or operators of small firms: how to make something. how to eliminate a costly process. where to find a substitute. where to sell a byproduct or waste product. how to determine the market for a product. you will note these are all types of services that we offer to small businesses. the owner of a small business is usually occupied with many varied duties in operating his plant or business. we therefore seek to help small firms find answers to their specific problems. we bring to their attention the availability of information on new or improved products. processes. and inventive ideaswhich may ultimately mean greater sales. business expansion. more profits. and more jobs. it has long been recognized that one of the most urgent needs for small businesses is to keep up to date on production and marketing techniques. they need to do this so they can diversify their lines and keep pace with the changes which occur in our everexpanding economy. we get information of this type to pass on to small firms. from other government agencies. large private concerns. and from inventors and developers of commercial ideas. there is a tremendous wealth of this information available on product research. utilization and development. marketing techniques. and related subjects. the problem in the past has been to channel this information into one spot where business firms can obtain it easily and without cost. that is why the small business administration is making the information available through its field offices. we are now distributing a products list circular. which will be issued periodically. it lists and gives a brief description of the product. invention. technique. or commercial idea. along with the name and address of the owner. it should be emphasized. however. that the small business administration does not endorse or guarantee success of items or ideas listed. the agency. as a service organization. operates as a clearinghouse. we are always willing to help small firms gain access to technical and research data. and to aid them in applying this type of information or knowledge to a particular problem. how successful is this program? on a national basis. the small business administration has already received more than 2.000 individual requests for products assistance. and interest in the program is growing by leaps and bounds. these. very briefly. are the basic services we have developed to help small business. i have tried to show that the small business administration is an agency with a conscience. we make every effort to offer services that are needed by small firms to help them increase their employment and grow and prosper in these changing times. we try never to lose sight of the injunction president eisenhower has laid down for us. to be humane. considerate and sympathetic in dealing with the indivdual and his problem. signs of real accord missing","mr. chairman. i yield myself 2 minutes. mr. chairman. this bill ought not to take very much time. it has already passed the senate. my recollection is that it was reported out of the committee on public works of the house unanimously. what it does is to take the federal government out of a project to the extent of $32 million. the total cost of the project is about $38.5 million. the other $6.5 million is for flood control. which will be the federal governments part or contribution to the entire project. the state of oklahoma. through its authority mentioned in the report. will complete the rest of the project. i believe the project is located in the district of the gentleman from oklahoma a member of our committee. i do not intend to take the time of the committee of the house. but i yield part of it to the gentleman from oklahoma so he may describe the project in detail.","the gentleman is not now talking about a river flood in albuquerque?","mr. speaker. last week we had under consideration the army civilfunctions bill. at that time. i took the floor and protested the action of the subcommittee in cutting down on the funds for one missouri basin dam to a mere $700.000 and cutting another out completely. neither one of these dams came under the \"new starts\" formula. i speak of oahe. s. dak.. and gavins point. nebr. the saying \"as ye sow. so shall ye also reap.\" came to my mind as i read this mornings papers from south dakota. an inundation of the missouri basin is taking place in south dakota today. flood stage has been reached. the great flood of 1943 reached a peak of 19.6 feet at pierre. s. dak.. and 22 feet at bismarck. n. dak.. that spring. today. the water is at 17 feet at pierre and 25.8 feet at bismarck with the crest due to come tonight or tomorrow morning. last week. we had the opportunity to use \"the ounce of prevention.\" let us hope the \"pound of cure\" is not necessary as it was in missouri and kansas last spring at a tune of $25.000.000. not counting over. a billion dollars damage. frankly. we would have a hard time convincing the people of my district that we were trying to \"roll the pork barrel\" here last week. i should like to call your attention to the fact that these floods are the result of only tributary streams below the garrison. n. dak.. project. it is not the full sweep of the missouri river as were the floods lact year in missouri and kansas. however. they are just as dangerous. residents of pierre. s. dak.. have been sandbagging their places of business. they have prepared their cellars for the onslaught. they have placed sandbags around tneir nomes ana they feel that congress has sandbagged them. i am inserting an editorial from the pierre capital journal written by robert hipple. an authority on the missouri river. i feel that his statement is especially cogent at this time:","mr. speaker. i want to express my personal appreciation as well as my thanks on behalf of the floodtricken people of kansas for the prompt attention given by members of the appropriatons committee o. the house to the appropriation of funds presently being considered. i express my appreciation especially to the members of the subcommittee on civil functions for holding a special hearing on saturday in order to obtain the facts in support of the immediate need of the funds provided in this bill. i likewise want to express appreciation to the committee in the other body. who also held hearings on saturday on this subject matter. the situation and conditions resulting from the flood disaster is almost indescribable and the need for assistance is imminent. the disaster that has hit our section of the country is described by army engineers as being the worst with respect to damage to property. it carries with it a worse tragedythe loss of human life. mr. speaker. you may be assured that funds appropriated by the federal government in whatever amount may be allowel will be expended judiciously and will be utilized for the purpose outlined in the bill. that of alleviating suffering and assisting in providing food. clothing. temporary shelter. prevention of spread of disease. and other critical requirements in the floodstricken area. it would be almost out of order for me to attempt to recount the damages incurzed in the various communities in the fourth congressional district and in other places in ..cansas. you may be assured that the unfortunate people of our great state appreciate the assistance granted ly this legislation.","i had understood it was 70.000.000. if it is 110.000.000. that would indicate that the portion of these reservoirs to be devoted to maximum flood control is relatively slight. not more than 8 to 10 percent.","there is one other phase of this which i think we should bear in mind. i do not think the committee has been able to demonstrate clearly the gains which will accrue financially to the country as a result of the passage of this bill. that is rather in a conglomerate mass. as you will see in this record as you get to read it. i think there is one phase of this thing we ought to think about. i remember when the draft legislation was before this congress. and i voted against it. i was one of those who contended that it was unnecessary. that we would raise an army if we paid them sufficient. do you remember that? man after man stood in the well of this house and said. \"you provide suitable emoluments for the services and you will get all the men you want.\" we did raise the emoluments and we got a flood of enlistments. this selective service thing is as dead as a dodo. and we no longer hear anything about compulsory military training. that has gone out the window. when you measure up the cost of those two organizations and figure the cost of selective service. we have to balance that and measure it against the cost that may be involved in this bill. which will enable us to continue to maintain an efficient and a proper military organization. i confess that this bill has given me a lot of concern. i voted against the pension bill. i am now asked to vote for $406.000.000 of pay increase here. you will have to make some pretty decisive answers to your constituents when this thing gets out. and you cannot be guided alone by the exigencies of the situation as they may be presented by the armed services.","similarly. proceeding with the story of the ohio river project units. local protection works in the ohio river basin prevented damage estimated at $15.875.000. of which $14.815.000 accrued to urban areas along the main stem of the ohio river. $320.000 to urban areas on tributary basins. and $740.000 to rural areasalong tributary basins. the total reduction in damages in the ohio river basin. the one basin during the current flood attributed to the operation of completed. or partially completed. floodcontrol projects. therefore. total $47.775.000. i desire to comment briefly on the hydroelectric powergenerating feature of some of the projects included in this bill. at the present time. mr. president. the entire country. with a few exceptions. is operating on a reserve power generating capacity which is dangerously low and which a few years ago would have been considered foolhardy. by interconnections and other interim arrangements it has been possible to keep our power supply intact without compulsory curtailment of use except in critical situations. such as the recent california drought. we are now engaged in revitalizing our national preparedness program. and one of the basic parts of such a program must be the construction of hydroelectric power projects such as are included in this bill. everyone knows the vital part which our great power pools from hydroelectric power projects played in aluminum production and aircraft manufacture during the recent war. less spectacular. but nonetheless important. is the part which the electric power industry. supplemented by hydroelectric power projects. performed in the war effort throughout the entire country. should another emergency arise. we shall need more electric power than ever before. but we shall not have it unless we start now to tap the power potentialities of the streams of our own united states. as contemplated by this bill. mr. president. those who are opposing this bill are basing their opposition on a plea for economy. i can see no economy in an angry river goneberserk. sweeping away forever millions of dollars worth of property. i can see no economy in an unproductive swamp or an arid plain. i can see no economy in a halfdeveloped navigation system. i can see no economy in a stillborn powerdevelopment program. in short. mr. president. i can see no economy in failing rapidly to develop and protect our natural resources. the large majority of the senate committee on appropriations considers this bill as an investment that will bring dividends far and above the sacrifice necessary to make the appropriation now. dividends will come in the form of decreased suffering by floodedout families and industries. increased returns in the form of agricultural production. increased numbers of farm homes. increased use of hydroelectric power that will obviate the use of irreplaceable petroleum needed now for generating electricity by diesel engines. which. all together. are necessary in the defense of the united states and will go a long way toward increasing our defense potential. speaking for 16 of 19 members of the senate appropriations committee. i heartily recommend that house bill 5524 be passed in the form recommended by the committee.","mr. chairman. i move to strike out the last word. mr. chairman. i am very glad that both the legislative committee and the committee on appropriations have acted so promptly in this very important and vital matter of floodcontrol protection. it shows that the house of representatives can act speedily in an emergency. this matter coming up recalls to my mind the fact that at the present time the subcommittee on the war department appropriations is considering the very subject of floodcontrol appropriations for the fiscal year 1948. i do hope that the committee will take to heart the lesson that is here before us today on how much damage floods can do not only to the homes and farms and industry of the country but to the very lives of the people. i do hope the subcommittee on appropriations for the war departmeqt. having this matter under its jurisdiction. will not follow a policy of false economy by trying to cut down on floodcontrol appropriations. if we do that. i am sure it will not be for the best interests of the country. the whole country will be aroused next year if floods reoccur and if many projects which could have been completed are not completed because the committees were too economyminded. i hope they will keep this in mind. again i say i am glad that the committee acted expeditiously and wisely in this matter.","mr. speaker. i am not out of sympathy with the feeling of the gentleman from michigan in regard to the need for greater economy. yet. the bill before us was the best bill we were able to get as a result of our conference with the senate. i have no doubt but that the great majority of the projects are meritorious projects. there are many hundreds of other projects in america that ought to be constructed tomorrow. there is no doubt about that. this is no waste of money. in any sense of the word. as i see it. american land and resources are wasting away at a rapid rateat a rate of loss totaling hundreds of millions of dollars per year. we are not ahead in flood control and river and harbor improvements. we are behind schedule. i dare say we are several generations behind schedule in harnessing and conserving the land and water resources of our nation. so. we have here the best bill we could get. some of the work might possibly have been delayed. in fact. some of the work should be delayed. in my opinion. but the final details of the bill were a result of compromises. as is always the case in legislative matters. but we present the bill without apology. and it is $5.000.000 below the budget. some are disappointed because the bill contains so many projects. others are disappointed because projects in their districts were not included. it will be noted that the sums approved for individual projects were considerably reduced in most instances.","mr. president. i invite attention to the concluding section of the bill. which seems further to fortify the senators construction of it. section 27. the concluding section of the bill. provides in part. as follows: this act shall be liberally construed to carry out the purposes of congressand so forth. the purposes. as explained near the beginning of the bill. are to strengthen the national defense. promote navigation. control destructive floods. promote interstate commerce. and aid in the general welfare of the united states.","here is what the bill is likely to do: when two distinct authorities are given the right to interfere it is likely to caure conflict that would be to the detriment both of the tennessee valley authority and the flood sufferers on the lower ohio. the lower mississippi. and the tennessee. for that reason i wish the gentleman from mississippi would leave that provision out or else accept an amendment to clarify the matter and show that it is not intended to interfere with the operation of the tennessee valley authority.","mr. chairman. it is my purpose to confine my remarks to section 3 of the pending bill. this section purports to abolish all subsidies in the following brave words: sec. 3. no funds appropriated to. borrowed by. or in the custody or control of any governmental agency (including any governmentowned or governmentcontrolled corporation) shall be directly or indirectly used by or made available to the commodity credit corporation or any other governmental agency to make any subsidy or other payment. or to pay or absorb losses. on any agricultural commodity or any commodity processed or manufactured in whole or substantial part therefrom. including milk and livestock and the products thereof. mr. chairman. the language there is clear to barring subsidies and i never saw anything more direct than that. of course there is a reprieve of the subsidy principle to december 31. 1943. then follows a lot of verbiage about maximum prices not being established below support prices. said support prices not being subsidies only because they are not called subsidies. but. after all these brave words about abolishing subsidies. on page 5. ine 23. we read these weasel words: provided further. that none of the foregoing provisions shall apply to any payments or losses incurred in transactions with respect to competitive domestic vegetable oils and fats and oilseed. of course. soybeans. peanuts. and cottonseed. at least. the last two products. are important crops in alabama and other adjacent states. so. my friends. we have a bill that abolishes subsidies for the consumer. but continues subsidies for the farmer. of course what the farmer is to get is not called a subsidy.: it bears various camouflage names. sometimes it takes the form of a loan. at other times parity payment. or it may be called soil conservation. supportprice payment or incentive payments. but all these payments have one common characteristic. they are all paid out of the treasury of the united states. so we have the $64 question. \"when is a subsidy not a subsidy?\" it is not a subsidy when congress in its wisdom calls it. for political expediency. something else. so we have section 3 of this bill masquerading as a section to abolish subsidies. to me it is a backscratching. logrolling piece of political chicanery. in other words a legislative fraud. which by trick and device purports to abolish subsidies on the one hand while establishing them on the other. i am just wondering what farmers or farm representatives are thinking about when they get into a stew about subsidies. let us just take a looksee. since 1933. the cotton farmers alone have received in subsidies $1.350.000.000. other farmers have received since 1933 approximately $6.000.000.000 under the name. not of subsidies. but as parity payments. cropallotment and soilpractice payments. every dollar of the money came from the treasury. when we read this record of subsidies in one form or another. amounting in the aggregate to so many billions of dollars. is it any wonder if we nonfarmers fail to understand this newborn rugged individualism of the farmer. who. for 10 years. has been the recipient of the treasurys bounty. i would also like to call your attention to the fact that those who oppose consumer subsidies point out that these subsidies will be paid out. of borrowed money and that. therefore. the next generation will be paying the present generations grocery bill. since. however. the money that is still to be paid in subsidies under section 3. under the guise of support prices and incentive payments and all the other camouflaged subsidies that will still remain in force. all comes from the public treasury and is. therefore. borrowed money. these sums will also be paid by the next generation. if this vicious section 3 becomes a law. and the inflation floodgates are opened. as they will be. the billion or two spent for consumer subsidies will not amount to a drop in the bucket. but the misery and disaster that will result will damn this congress forever.","mr. speaker. this congress will adjourn today. i am numbered with those who fell outside the breastworks. and will not be in the seventyeighth congress. this will be my last opportunity to address the house. i was elected in 1926 and became a member on march 4. 1927. along with the gentleman from oklahoma. jed johnson. i was closely associated with jed in school. in the state senate. and in congress. we have agreed in practically all our views upon public questions. now he alone remains of the oklahoma house delegation when we came nearly 16 years ago. the entire oklahoma delegation have been especially kind to me and have honored me for 8 years as their chairman. i have served under six distinguished speakerslongworth. garner. byrnes. rainey. bankhead. and rayburnfour of whom have passed to the great beyond where there is no dividing aisle between the democrats and republicans. all were capable and worthy gentlemen. in my humble opinion speaker rayburn possesses all the essential qualifications to occupy the highest office in the gift of the american people. i look back with satisfaction upon my service in the house. the membership is truly a cross section of the united states. ninetynine percent of those whom it has been my pleasure to know. have been honest. conscientious. capable. hardworking men and women. i shall ever cherish their memory. it has been great to have been a member of congress during such an interesting period of american history. i have written a book entitled \"sixteen years in congress\" covering the highlights of this period. i suggest you read it for your own personal aggrandizement. as soon as it is off the press. and now as i sever old ties i admit there is a touch of sadness. but defeats and disappointments are the fortunes of war and politics and i feel that we must be prepared to gracefully take the bad with the good. i probably have been more fortunate than i deserve. so: heres a sigh for those who love me a smile for those who hate. and whatever skys above me. heres a heart for every fate. there is no bitterness in my soul at this chistmas season. it is in that spirit that i have asked for this time today in order to express to you and through you to the people of the third congressional district of oklahoma. my profound gratitude for the many courtesies and favors i have received at the hands of the people i have endeavored to represent. as well as by my colleagues in congress. i shall not take the time at this late hour to attempt to recount my accomplishments in congress for my people since my first election to office. i i came here. mr. speaker. with a burning desire to do something worth while for the farmers of the district. as well as thousands of other worthy citizens who have been forced to live on scant incomes and who have not had the actual necessities of life that were really needed to keep body and soul together. although i have not been satisfied with what this administration has been able to do for either group. i have never failed an opportunity to work and vote for legislation to improve living standards of what we call the common people who are. after all. gods chosen people. it was abraham lincoln who said: god must have loved the common people because he made so many of them. w. p. a. at one time. i regret to say. there were more citizens of the third congressional district on the w. p. a. rolls than in any other district in oklahoma. this situation existed through no cause of the people of that area. but because of drought. floods. boll weevils. and conditions over which the people had no control. now that the w. p. a. is folding up because of the fact that economic conditions have vastly improved. it is a popular pastime in some quarters to criticize that organization. but the facts are that with the help of the w. p. a. there were constructed more schoolhouses. roads. bridges. and other improvements in my district than in any other district in oklahoma and. i dare say. in any other district in the entire united states.","mr. president. by reason of the action of the finance committee. as announced by the chairman of the committee. there was removed from the bill this afternoon one item which it is estimated would produce approximately $50.000.000 or $60.000.000 of revenue. the amendment which i have offered would restore approximately that amount to the bill. the amendment submitted by me for myself. the senator from alabama . and the senator from mississippi is an attempt to provide or increase protection of certain branches of american agriculture against competitive. imports from tropical countries. to stimulate production of dependable supplies of certain foods and raw materials within our own boundaries. and to raise revenue to meet the increased costs of our defense program. by the terms of this amendment duties are levied against four main groups of commodities. namely. oils and fats. jute and jute products. tropical starches. and fish and marineanimal scrap and meal. in addition. the amendment attempts to systematize the rather complicated and patchwork set of protective devices against foreign fats and oils by bringing existing duties and excises together into a somewhat more orderly arrangement. the fatsandoils section of this amendment may seem complicated. although the net result of the changes p.oposed is to bring about a simplification. legislation embodying these provisions has been under consideration in the house since april. and the rates have been rather carefully worked out and checked by tariff experts. briefly. this title would bring the combined duty. plus excise. plus processing tax. on most competitive fats and oils to a uniform level of 6 cents a pound. levies on imported oil seeds would be scaled in proportion. to bring about this uniform arrangement it is necessary to raise some duties and lower others. although the general level of duties is. of course. raised. it is expected that the duties prescribed in this amendment would result in exclusion of substantial quantities of competitive oils and oilseeds. though not necessarily all competitiveoil imports would be kept out. if a foreign oil were distinctly superior for any purpose to any domestic oil which could be produced. it could be imported over the 6cent duty. which is hardly enough to cover the difference between the cost of production and the standard of living in this country and those in the tropical foreign countries in which such oils are produced. such oils as might come in would thus help to defray the increased costs of our defense program. the result of exclusion of these oils would be to improve the. domestic market and domestic prices for butter. lard. cottonseed. soybean. pearut. and other oils. it is expected that better prices for domestic oils would stimulate production of some of them on idle acres in the united states. thus relieving the pressure of surpluses of such crops as wheat and corn. the duties on jute are expected to result in displacement .1 jute by cotton in many uses and in the collection of considerable revenue for the national treasury on the jute and jute manufactures for which cotton or other domestic fibers are not suitable substitutes and which therefore continue to come in. the duties on tropical starches are expected to result in increased utilization of domestic raw materials. such as corn and sweetpotatoes. for starch. instead of the tropical products at present imported. duties on fish and marineanimal scrap and meal would also be levied by this amendment. since these products are competitive with our domestic tankage and other domestic feeds. mr. president. i am sure that many senators. as well as others interested in the progress of the defense program and in the national economic welfare. must have come to realize during the last few months the perilous position in which we have placed the national welfare by continuing to depend on foreign sources for so many of the raw materials and foods vital to our national welfare. we have discovered in the past few months just how vulnerable is our national economy as foreign sources of supply are cut off and as shortages begin to appear in one commodity after another. in many cases ample supplies of some commodity may be piled up on the docks at some distant foreign port. but the ships simply are not available to carry the goods here. and there is no probability that the ships will be available. either soon or for several years to come. if the wars continue. in determining which products shall be brought here in the few ships available. the maritime commission must naturally put first things first. and shipping which might be used to bring starch. for example. or tropical oilseeds or jute. must be diverted to the carriage of those commodities of which such a severe shortage has already occurred that industry is rationed. and of which it appears there may not be enough even for direct defense needs. to say nothing of indirect defense needs and civilian consumption. rubber. tin. copper. and many other commodities might be cited as products of which we are sorely in need and for which we simply cannot get the shipping to supply ourselves. in fact. members of this body know that the commission has been severely criticizedand i believe justly sofor permitting ships to continue to carry even restricted quantities of agricultural raw materials which we. ourselves. could produce. but as time goes on and as the shipping shortage grows more and more acute. while our needs for foreign metals and the like expand. there will be no possibility of bringing in even restricted quantities of agricultural raw materials which we can possibly do without or which we. ourselves. can produce. it is therefore essential that we begin to prepare for the future. we shall have to expand production of domestic oils and fats. fibers. and starches. we have no alternative. but the production of agricultural commodities cannot be expanded overnight. before lard production can be increased pigs must be raised. it takes time to introduce crops like peanuts and soybeans into new areas. in some cases new processing plants may have to be built. or old ones reorganized or provided with new machinery. for the same reason it is impossible to cut down productive capacity suddenly. particularly in the case of agricultural commodities. once the farmer has increased his swine numbers. or has expanded his acreage of some oil or starch crop it is equally difficult for him suddenly to restrict again if the threat of competitive imports returns at the conclusion of the war. the necessity for protection against these imports is perhaps temporarily less. but we cannot expect the farmer to grow the larger crops to meet our needs unless we give him some kind of assurance that after the war is over the greater quantities will still find a market. that is what this amendment proposes to do. many senators remember what happened after the last war. when farmers who had plowed up new acreage to meet war demands were suddenly confronted with the fact that their war markets had disappeared and that they had no place to dispose of their surpluses. prices dropped disastrously. bringing a flood of bankruptcies in their train. and the agricultural problem. as we have lived with it ever since. was first created on a large scale. we do not want that to happen again. this amendment is not a sectional bill. it is not designed to help only the farmer in nebraska or in the middle west. it is intended to improve the prices and markets of crops in every section of the country. and to help farmers. who have had to curtail production. to find alternative crops in every part of the nation. i shall not burden this debate with a great many figures. i have prepared statistical tables covering. i believe. every important phase of this question. which i ask to have inserted in the record at this point.","mr. president. i have an amendment which i desire to offer. and i wish to say in explanation of the amendment that while it does embrace a multipleuse project. it has for its primary purpose flood control for the city of augusta. ga.. a city of 70.000 people. it was included in the bill which was reported by the commerce committee of the senate last year. and which was recommitted to that committee for further consideration. it is not included in the bill now reported by the committee because that bill. as i understand. is confined to navigation projects. i offer this amendment. mr. president. because it is similar to and identical with certain other amendments which have been placed in the bill.","mr. president. to follow what the senator from illinois has said. i will make merely one suggestion as to something which has recently happened in my state and in the state of wyoming. word went out officially as to the number to be dropped from the relief rolls in each of those states and subsequently notice was issued reducing the number by onehalf. in the state of wyoming notification was given that something over 600 were to go off the rolls. while the last notice is that some 300 or so would go off. in colorado it was stated that 5.000 must go off. even though congress passed the $100.000.000 appropriation. when the tabulation furnished us by colonel harrington shows that only 2.400 are going off the relief rolls. the country has been flooded. senators. with misleading statements as to the disaster that would come from the administration of this act under the appropriations we made. there has been a deliberate. determined effort to build up a false impression in the country as to what was being done in congress so as to put pressure upon senators and members of the house.","on page 7. line 20. after the numerals \"$875.000\". it is proposed to insert the following: for an additional amount of salaries and expenses of the federal power commission. fiscal year 1939. including the same objects specified under this head in the independent offices appropriation act. 1939. $150.000: provided. that the limitation under this head in said act upon the amount that may be expended for personal services in the district of columbia is hereby

or political subdivisions thereof. such funds as may be contributed by them to be expended in connection with funds appropriated by the united states for any authorized floodcontrol work whenever such work and expenditure may be considered by the secretary of war. on recommendation of the chief of engineers. as advantageous in the public interest. and the plans for any reservoir project may. in the discretion of the secretary of war. on recommendation of the chief of engineers. be modified to provide additional storage capacity for domestic water supply or other conservation storage. on condition that the cost of such increased storage capacity is contributed by local agencies and that the local agencies agree to utilize such additional storage capacity in a manner consistent with federal uses and purposes: and provided further. that when contributions made by states. or political subdivisions thereof. are in excess of the actual cost of the work contemplated and properly chargeable to such contributions. such excess contributions may. with the approval of the secretary of war. be returned to the proper representatives of the contributing interests.\"","i will be very brief. i may say to the senator. mr. president. my distinguished colleagues in the senate. the senator from louisiana and the senior senator from arkansas . have so fully discussed the pending bill. and are so familiar with its provisions. that it is unnecessary. in my opinion. to say anything further. but i am so much interested in the enactment of this proposed legislation. that i would feel untrue to myself and unfaithful to my people if i did not say something. so it is more with a desire to impress upon the senate two or three features that have already been touched upon. and with no desire to impose upon the patience of the senate through reiteration. that i am going to speak at all. few bills. mr. president. coming before this body. carry greater import to the people of the lower mississippi valley. than does the pending measure. it provides for the expansion and enlargement of the flood control act of 1928. substituting the eudora floodway for the boeuf floodway. and providing for the atchafalaya floodway and floodcontrol works along the st. francis and the arkansas and the yazoo rivers. none of the levees or other floodcontrol works constructed under the act of 1928. which were provided for under the recommendations of the socalled markham board of army engineers. are to be discarded. but all works done will be used and will be necessary in the modified project. :every dollar heretofore spent for the control act was wisely and economically spent. and the modifications carried in this measure. if enacted. will add to the safety and protection of the valley against loss of life and property. it is an erroneous impression that levees along the lower mississippi river have failed. they have not. but because of the enormous developments in the northern area drained by the mississippi and its tributaries. such as soil conservation. and large utilization of lands. denuding of forests. inauguration of drainage districts. and innumerable other factors. the waters from the north. finding their way through many tributaries into the mississippi. have caused the flood waters to move in larger volume and at accelerated speed. thereby making it necessary that levees in the lower valley be enlarged. heightened. and strengthened. in the beginning. years ago. before the transformation took place in the upper valley. it was believed that smaller and lower levees would suffice. but they have been found to be inadequate. and engineers now all agree that. while adequate levees are necessary and imperative. other means of impounding the waters. such as reservoirs. must be provided in order to solve the whole problem. the corollary is true. that. no matter how many reservoirs might be built along the tributaries of the mississippi. adequate levees are likewise imperative and necessary. it must not be forgotten that in the great construction work in the lower mississippi valley. people of that section have made a heroic fight and have done their part to solve this problem. long since it has been declared a national policy. but. as a matter of fact. local interests still provide rightsofway for levees and must maintain them. this item in itself requires large local taxes. prior to 1928. the local levee boards. according to the chief of engineers. had expended $292.000.000 to build levees along the lower mississippi river. large amounts of bonds are now outstanding against these local levee boards. and taxes must continue to be levied for years to come in order to discharge the bonds. in my own state. where there are two levee boards and about 4.125.000 acres of land in the delta. there are now and have been for 75 years heavy taxes. amounting in the aggregate to more than $50.000.000. imposed upon the people for flood protection. we have another problem there. which results from the hill waters of southern tennessee and northern mississippi flowing into the mississippi delta. the yazootallahatchiecoldwater rivers system is about 520 miles long. it is navigable. more than 100 local drainage and levee districts have been constructed along this river system. according to the chief of engineers. $20.000.000 have been spent in that area alone. the results have been unsatisfactory. the chief of engineers recommends that the yazoo river system. protecting onehalf of the delta. be included in the expansion of the program. he recommends seven reservoirs. as a cost of $48.000.000. to be constructed. the local interests will be required to maintain the reservoirs and to provide for road and highway relocations. it may be stated in this connection that the yazoo river in mississippi and the st. francis river in arkansas are located in levee districts that have paid for floodcontrol works along the mississippi river. they lie some distance away from the river. but notwithstanding that fact they have for 75 years borne a burden of very heavy taxes to maintain the levees along the mississippi river. substantially onehalf of the mississippi delta is subject to overflow from the yazootallahatchiecoldwater rivers system. these lands are being taxed for flood control along the mississippi river. and in addition they have incurred an obligation of $20.000.000 for local levees. that is not true with reference to other tributaries outside of the alluvial valley. and they do not pay taxes for protection from the mississippi river. the mississippi river drains twothirds of the states of the union. its watershed extends from new york to montana. it is the drainage ditch of the nation. and it is gratifying to those of us who come from that section now to realize that the people of every section recognize it no longer as a local but as a national problem. the fuse plug. or boeuf floodway. has never been satisfactory. this bill. when enacted into law. will cure that unsatisfactory condition by providing for the eudora floodway. which will give more relief. provide a more definite floodway. and remove the uncertainties in connection with the boeuf floodway. of course. it carries with it compensation to the property owners for damages to their lands. as has been fully analyzed and discussed by the senior senator from arkansas. as to the eudora diversion. i may say that it will not increase the backwater levels of the yazoo basin but will give greater protection to the yazoo delta. the mississippi river commission closed the cypress creek area in the boeuf division in 1921. in my opinion the government made a mistake and it should reopen the diversion. the chief of engineers recommends the eudora diversion. only a comprehensive plan such as suggested in this legislation will solve the floodcontrol problem in the lower mississippi valley. the yazoo river is the principal tributary of the mississippi on the east bank between cairo and the gulf of mexico. it is affected by backwater. in 1933 excess headwater floods covered 600.000 acres of land. in 1932. 993.000 acres were overflowed. when the works are constructed under this proposed legislation the reservoirs constructed in my own state will reduce flood heights at vicksburg on the mississippi river about 6 inches. it is not necessary for me to remind this body of the many people who will be affected by this proposed legislation. fully twothirds of the cost of the project is for labor. and the social safety and wellbeing of that great section of our country will be promoted thereby. and likewise in varying degree all along the river south of that point. it is a wellconceived. thoroughly investigated. and wellworkedout general plan. and i sincerely hope that the measure can be speedily passed and enacted into law.","for instance. the following language: \"highways. roads. streets. and gradecrossing elimination. * * * rural rehabilitation and relief in stricken agricultural areas. * * * rural electrification. * * * housing. * * * civilian conservation corps. * * * public projects of states or political subdivisions thereof \". and a tremendous sum appropriated. $900.000.000. and \"sanitation. prevention of soil erosion. reforestation. forestation. flood control. and miscellaneous projects.\" it would seem to me that those comprehensive words would include all that the senator has in mind. and would cover the useful public projects to which the senator is directing our attention.","mr. speaker. under the leave to extend my remarks in the record. i include the following address of congressman william p. connery. jr.. of massachusetts. over station wol. of washington. d.c.. june 7. 1934. on the subject of social insurance. ladies and gentlemen. the problem of social insurance has commanded the attention of the american public for a great many years. and it has been only in recent years that any marked degree of progress has been evident in this particular field. during the period of prosperity. unemployment was not such a serious menace. as work was more abundant. and wages were higher. we were riding on the crest of a wave. so to speak. and in the midst of this period of progress and prosperity there were no prevalent circumstances to warrant an interest in social insurance. except by thinkers who have foresight and see the necessity of planning ahead. the history of the oldagepension movement dates back over a number of years. and there have been many worthwhile and laudable efforts made to secure the enactment of this type of legislation. not only in the several states of the nation. but also by a federal oldagepension statute. conditions in industry and other vocations in years past were not so strained and taxed as they are now. and tenure of employment was more or less certain. it was not unsual for an individual to be employed even at the advanced age of 60 or 65 years. but as the problem of unemployment became more serious. there developed a tendency to supplant the older worker with the young man and the young women. certain industries and establishments adopted policies of not employing persons beyond a given age. and this age was generally set at 45 years. and in some instances. the age limit of employment was as low as 40 years. it is not difficult to ascertain just what sort of a situation this created. many of the persons thus deprived of means of earning a livelihood for themselves and their families were left to cast about as best they could in search of work. and bear in mind. fully 90 percent of this group were persons with family responsibilities. the government itself maintained an age limit of employment. and it became increasingly difficult for a person of recognized middle age to secure a job. as the unemployment wave gained momentum. the manifest hardship occasioned by discrimination in employment gave rise to a new and added activity in the interest of social legislation. several states. seeing the absolute necessity of promoting legislation to care adequately for the aged. adopted oldagepension laws. in most cases the age requirement was fixed at 70 years. and it was specified in the law that the applicants property holdings should not exceed a certain figure. generally $2.500. some states further provided that no person would be eligible for relief whose relatives were able to provide support. the average rate of benefit paid under the oldagepension statutes now in force in the 28 states which have passed this legislation is $30 per month. the present record of oldagepension legislation shows that 28 states have enacted these laws since 1924. efforts were made during this period from 1924 to the present time to secure the enactment of a federal old age pension law. and although the interest in and the public support of this legislation has developed materially. it has not yet been possible to get such a measure through congress. it would not be far amiss. however. to say that public demand for this legislation has grown so strong that it is more than probable that a federal bill will be enacted during the next congress. as the unemployment situation became more and more tense. and there was seemingly not offered any proposal which would either stem its tide. or abate the stranglehold which it had fastened on the american people. it became obvious that other legislation would be necessary to bridge the gap between employment pxnd unemployment. at one time during the late days of 1932 and early 1933 it was estimated that there were some fourteen millions of people out of work. and while this astounding and alarming figure was constantly mounting. modes of relief were not keeping pace with this rapid increase. business conditions in general were claimed to be the cause of the unemployment. but the underlying and contributory factors attendant to the wildfire spread of dismissals were. in great part. due to the machine replacing the man. with progress in every conceivable line of industry. the machine has constantly and steadily played havoc in the ranks of labor. speed in production and quantity output have been the first concerns of business. and as a result of this emphasized machine production. hundreds and thousands of employees have been thrown out of work or reduced to parttime employment. a very simple illustration may be cited of the effect of machine development and its consequences if we consider the case of the ordinary steamshovel used for excavating purposes. this appliance now performs in the usual workday the same amount of work which was formerly done by a hundred men. and this is characteristically true of all laborsaving devices which have been introduced in our manufacturing. farming. and other pursuits. from the basic thought that the machine has displaced untold numbers of workers. it is not a serious task to determine how some of the unemployment has resulted. one remedy. of course. is to shorten the hours of labor. reduce to 6 hours the workday and to 5 days the work week. but that is only one step. the next step is to create through some agency a balance between conditions of employment and unemployment. the american people cannot be expected to live forever under private or public charity. and they cannot be expected to endure forever the conditions of privation and misery which have beset them during the last 3 or 4 years. the only real and sensible method or manner in which we can meet this challenge to the maintenance of decent standards of living and conditions among the people is to provide some type of social insurance which will guarantee our citizens against the sufferings and hardships of periods of depression such as we are experiencing now. i firmly believe that it is incumbent upon the states and the federal government to see to it that american citizens are adequately and properly cared for during the crises in employment over which they have no control and for which they are in no manner responsible. the general scheme would be that every employee who has been working regularly for a given period of time should receive benefits during any enforced layoff which he might suffer. in this manner we can easily do away with the prolonged stretches of depression as it affects the people. unemploymentinsurance bills have been introduced in congress to do this very thing. the real and important factor is that american citizens shall not live in want. the saddest and most pathetic aspect of any employment crisis is the effect it has on the young generationlack of confidence or loss of confidence in government. increase in crime. destruction of health and morals. and a general undermining of american ideals and institutions. the history of the progress of labor is an old one and a painful one. it would be futile in a discourse of 15 minutes to try to go back through the centuries and trace the gradual rise of man from slavery and peonage to what we know today as liberty and freedom of action under the constitution of the united states. when the barons forced king john to sign the magna carta at runnymede with the battle cry of \" give us back the laws of the good king edward \". they were but taking up the sword again in the seemingly neverceasing conflict between those who seek only power and money and citizens of any country who love liberty and freedom. we are facing today the same old crisis. in these relations between capital and labor. which were fought out during every century in the past. since men were changed from slaves into freemen. it is a strange quirk of human nature that many employers of labor apparently would prefer to see their firms or their corporations lose millions of dollars in a strike rather than pay onefifth of that amount to the worker for decent living wages. thereby avoiding strikes. their cry seems to be all down through the ages. \"i am to be the master. you are to be the man. i will give you what i think you ought to get in wages and hours. and not what you think you ought to get. or even what the general run of mankind thinks you should get in wages and hours. and unless you acknowledge my power. i will fight you with all the weapons that money can buy. whether it be in the press. on the radio. or through other propaganda. and i will take advantage of every interpretation of the law to shoot you down and starve you and your family under the plea that i am protecting my property and that property rights come before human rights.\" such a state of mind in financiers can never. of course. result in peace between capital and labor. neither i nor any other person who has a knowledge of conditions in our country would state that labor. organized or unorganized. has no faults or makes no mistakes. and that all of its leaders. great or small. are 100percent honest and simon pure in every respect. that would be saying too much for human nature. but a careful analysis and study of the great struggles of labor and capital in this country since the beginning of the republic will show that. with the exception always proving the rule. in 99 out of every 100 cases labor has always been fighting for a decent living wage and the right to breathe freely as american citizens and not merely exist under the domination of wealth as exemplified in our big trusts and corporations. labor has seldom received its just deserts. today in the fierce antagonism by the big moneyed interests to the wagnerconnery bill. which legislation is a sincere endeavor to bring about adjustment of labor disputes and prevent serlous labor disturbances. we find that old story of master and man: \"i will not deal with you because you belong to a labor union. i will form my own company unions. i will dominate the leadership of those company unions. control them by special favors such as paying them for spreading propaganda during working hours while pretending to find out what the workers want. and then. through these company unions. i will have absolute security and protection when i refuse any demands that free and independent workers in my employ may make. incidentally my company union will aid other company unions in other concerns. thereby building up an army of company unions to smash organizations such as the american federation of labor and the railroad unions. which i have tried unsuccessfully to control.\" that apparently is the attitude which is taken by big business today. with the knowledge which i have gained during my 12 years in congress as a member of the committee on labor. and for 4 years as chairman of that committee. i feel it my duty in talking to you tonight to say frankly that i believe that the great industrial leaders of the united states are fooling with dynamite in resisting all attempts of their workers to obtain shorter hours and decent pay. and to obtain their inherent right to bargain and negotiate collectively for that pay and for those hours. just a little application of the golden rule would help a great deal at this time. if these great employers of labor could place themselves. if only for an hour or two. in the position of the man working before the blast furnace. in intolerable heat. or of the telephone operator. sitting for hours in a nerveracking occupation. endeavoring to satisfy all of the whims of a sometimes erratic public. or of the miner. working deep down in the bowels of the earth. shut off from all light and sunshine. or of the workers in all occupations requiring mental and physical strainif these employers could put themselves in the positions of these workers. and forget for a time the almighty dollar and the love of power and glory. we might then see a different attitude on their part. and we would see an era of good will. prosperity. and happiness such as we have never seen before. not only among the workers but among the employers as well. some sayings are used so often that they become trite. but when we reach the time that the great holders of wealth realize that it is more blessed to give than to receive. we will see harmony between capital and labor. until then i fear we will see nothing but the trouble. chaos. violence. and bloodshed which we have seen during the strikes of the past few weeks. i am still hopeful that we have some men in control of industry today who are big enough. sane enough. and patriotic enough to have a love for their fellow man. and that these men will brush aside those in their midst who through greed would crush anyone who stands in the path of their quest for goldeven women and helpless little childrenand will make plain to these exploiters of the weak that honest industry has no place for them. we have recently lived through an experience in the united states which has taxed to capacity all of the imagination. thoughts. and resources of the american people. and we have not yet provided all of the necessary means to insure a just protection to our citizens. a protection which every citizen rightfully deserves. if we hope to relieve wholly and effectually the conditions which have cramped enterprise. cut wages. and caused suffering to the people. and further. if we hope to prevent. at least in some measure. a recurrence of this blight in our future civilization. we must immediately proceed with the enactment of not only oldage pensions. shorter workweek legislation. and the labor disputes bill. but also unemployment insurance. this. and only this. is the means through which we can establish a balance between employment and unemployment. no one would attempt or wish to stifle inventions. the machine age will continue with us and we will continue to have unemployment unless we plan ahead. and it is principally against this unemployment that we must prepare ourselves for the security and wellbeing of our future generations. man must be master of the machine. not the machine master of the man.","let me say to the senator further what the senator from nevada has saidthat all our silver money today is on the basis of $1.2929. all i am asking is that we open up the mints and continue the free and unlimited coinage of silver on exactly the same basis at which every silver dollar we have today is coined. let me say to the senator from alabama that i called attention to the fact that since the war we have been a creditor nation. and by reason of the fact that we are a creditor nation there is not any question at all but that we could maintain the ratio even upon an unlimited basis. we would create an unlimited demand if we opened up the mints to the free coinage of silver. just as we have to the free coinage of gold upon the ratio of 16 to 1. it seems to me that there cannot be any question about it. the senator from pennsylvania said upon the floor of the senate. \"why. if we coin silver we will get all the silver. this country will be flooded with silver.\" he said. \"there are 250.000.000 ounces of surplus silver in the world.\" well. suppose that were true. and suppose we got the 250.000.000 ounces that the distinguished senator from pennsylvania says we could getwhat would we get it for? we would get it in return for manufactured goods or products produced in this country. that would put men to work in our factories. and if we got it for anything else it would be a mere bagatelle. if we should get only 250.000.000 ounces of silver it would not inflate our currency very much. as a matter of fact. it would not go far enough. and mr. brownell. who is probably one of the greatest experts upon the silver question in the world. has said in his testimony before the house committee. as i recall. that over a period of 5 years the most we could possibly expect to get or hope to get would be. as i recall. about 650.000.000 ounces.","mr. speaker. i ask unanimous consent to extend my remarks on the bill amending the flood control act.","as indicated. this measure amends the law known as the general leasing act of february 25. 1920. so as to permit what is known as unit development of oil or gas leases on the public domain. this policywas expressed in the act approved july 2. 1930. but was terminated on the 31st of january. 1931. at the time this law was enacted the policy was considered doubtful. therefore. a limitation was placed in the law which automatically terminated it on the abovementioned date. however. it is now desirable that we make this policy of unit development of oil or gas leases permanent. a large number of leases are given within a certain geological structure or area which is gas or oil producing. under the present law each separate locator or lessee or permittee is obliged to drill within the bounds of his particular lease. and if another drills adjacent to him he is obliged to put down offset wells. thus. a very large and unnecessary expense is incurred in the drilling of the needless wells for the working of the entire claim. the provisions of this bill will reduce the cost of carrying on the development necessary to take oil out of the claim. under the provisions of this proposed measure the secretary of the interior is authorized at all times either to extend or restrict the amount of oil or gas which would prevent an excessive supply from flooding the market. at the present time when an enormous production of both oil and gas is encountered. so that for the immediate future the market is glutted. an arrangement to have the work done systematically and to put the material out as the market demands is impossible because those lessees or permittees adjoining can limit production. this bill gives the secretary of the interior authority to restrict or extend production in such cases. this measure further authorizes the approval by. the secretary of the interior of operating. drilling. or development contracts by.-permittees or lessees. regardlessof acreage limitations. whenever the policy of conservation or the public necessity or convenience will be promoted. this departure is intended to permit pipeline companies to enter into contracts with .permittees or. lessees in number sufficient to justify the constructionof such pipe lines and to finance the same.","mr. president. there is a menace to domestic sugar production that has developed through the evident determination of cuban sugar producers to deluge the united states market with their output. whether or not they sell it here for less than cost. competition of such a character is similar to the assault of mana who has decided that he will inflict injury on his opponents regardless of coincident injury to hhi self. orditary protective measures do not effectually guard an industry against such competition. all the protection which congress gave the domestic sugar industry in 1922. on the assumlp tion that costs of production were being equalized. has been nullified by this insensate and sacrificial assault on the united states sugar market. it must be apparent that a tariff on sugar 1298\" adequate to protect the american -industry when the duty equalizes the difference in costs of production. must prove disastrously inadequate if the foreign. competitors disregard their costs and dump their sugar into this country as they. are doing today. congress has been called together in special session to formulate legislation of benefit to the farmers of the united states. this special session represents a conscientious attempt on the part of president hoover to fulfill his most important -campaign pledge. and a similar pledge was made -by his opponent. governor smith. in accord with the platform of his party. in a direct sense the sugar producers are farmers. i represent. in part. several thousand louisiana cane growers. with whose problems i am familiar. my father was a sugar planter. and in my young manhood i assisted in the cultivation of cane and the manufacture of sugar. some of these farmers cultivate large acreages. most of them are men who cultivate small areas in sugarcane. who work in the fields with their own hands. and so do their sons. they are absolutely typical of that industrious. inarticulate farming element in our country that is recognized as entitled to relief at the hands of congress. a policy that coddles the cubans on the one hand. and. on the other. leads our united states farmers to grow surpluses with all the difficulties attendant upon the disposal of such surplus production is indefensible. illogical. and uneconomic. why the wishes of the cuban sugar producers should receive the distinguished consideration they obtain is beyond my comprehension. the island of cuba is as completely a foreign country as is the island of java. the cubans pay no taxes in the united states. they are bound by no united states laws in restraint of their exploitations. through the enjoyment of a low. inadequate. and preferential tariff cuba pours its sugars into this country and throws out of employment our laborers and farmers quite as effectively as if their lowgrade workers of all hues and shades came in here themselves and did the work of production in the united states. they stultify our immigration laws. they appear before our congress and plead for themselves as against american farmers and producers. by preventing sugar production in the united states and thus encouraging production of crops of which. we have a surplus. they involve us in intricate problems of legislation so difficult that the skeletons of efforts at their solution mark the congressional trail of the past 26 years. what cuba has cost the people of the united states since we gave it freedom from the spanish yoke at the cost of our blood and treasure is beyond computation. unless cuba expects to throttle the domestic sugar industry there is no just basis for its opposition to the rates which are proposed in this measure. cuba. as everyone in this chamber knows. is granted a reduction of 20 per cent under the rates of duty which are imposed against other sugarproducing nations of the world. under the fordneymccumber rates this preferential amounts to 44 cents a hundred poundsperhaps a fraction more. under the rates carried in this bill the preferential is extended to 55 cents a hundred. in short. the virtual monopoly which cuba exercises in the import sugar market is strengthened still further. except. possibly for java. this island already pr6duces sugar cheaper than any other country in the world. she could compete with profit even if the entire world rate of duty were levied against her product. but we make no such proposal. we make no attempt to cripple cuba or her industries. on the contrary. it is proposed to enlarge the measure of solicitude which we have bestowed upon the island for more than a quarter of a century. cuba .has been receiving preferential treatment at the hands of our government since 1903. during that time she has reaped a harvest of gold through our policy. but should she arrogate to herself the right to monopolize the american market she may shut in her own face the floodgates of that golden harvest. the same power which placed cuba in her present favored position may remoye her from it. rumblings of such a sentiment were heard in this body recently when a motion was offered by the senator from colorado to recall our reciprocity agreement with cuba. it is well known that such a bill. if offered under appropriate circumstances. may receive favorable consideration. i submit. mr. president. that cuba can object to the rates embraced in this schedule only if she has evolved some sinister plan to dominate not only the world import market but the american market as well. to put it briefly. cuba can object only if she intends to kill the domestic sugar industry in the united states. mr. president. i desire now to mention some features of the sugar industry which seem to have been overlooked in the con-. troversy raging around the sugar schedule. they relate to the industrys value to the railroads of the country-","mr. president. i would like to ask the senator from washington one or two more questions. if he will bear with me. will the senator tell us whether any member of the committee on commerce knew that this flood control act of 1928 called for the repayment to california of what she had spent?","mr. chairman. inasmuch as the gentleman from cnmnecticut [mr. tilso.n] did not feel he had the time to yield. i have. more or less itgainst my will. taken this opportunity to reply to the few statements he has made. le has stated that flood control is necessary. i think he is right. he has stated that it can be given either by the construction of a low dam. which will produce no power. or by the construction of a high damn at boulder canyon. which will produce not only flood control but also. as he contends. something useful. his first statement is erroneous. a dam 100 feet high at mohave will produce approximately 200.000 horsepower. and i refer the gentleman to the report made by the united states geological survey.","two or three years before the dam was completed there would be considerable regulation. senator pirwrs. putting it the other way. then. in from four to five years after tile commencement of the work we might expect flood control? mr. weymoutii. some. not complete. there has been also a floodcontrol dam suggested at the mohave site. but tlnt would cost about $28.000.000 for just a floodcontrol dam. that eight or ten million acrefeet floodcontrol dam at the black canyon site would cost practically the same. so the difference between a dam just to control the floods and of a high dam for flood control. irrigation. and for power would be about twelve or thirteen millions of dollars. senator phipps. was there any test of the practicability at mohave or topock to determine what foundation is to be secured there?","mr. chairman and gentlemen of the committee. this bill is brought in to iron out an old situation on the canadian border which has been troublesome to the american people living on the american side for many years. the lake of the woods is a highly irregular body of water on the boundary between minnesota and canada. it is about a hundred miles wide and a hundred miles long. but there are several long irregular arms. the larger part of this lake is located across the line in canada. it drains north via the winnipeg river. the land along the sides of that lake have been a dense forest and marshland. largely uninhabited for many years and not thickly inhabited now. some years ago. beginning in 1893. as the record shows. certain corporqtions. power interests. operating on the canadian side. built what is known as the norman dam in the winnipeg river. that dam was completed two years later. in 1895. and in 1898 it was raised to a higher level. so that it would impound more water by putting in stock logs. these dates have some bearing on the present controversy. the land prior to 1898 was unallotted indian land. so far as the actual title was concerned. but there were very few indian occupants. and some white settlers had moved in. taking physical occupation of the land by squatters right. very much as they did in the middle west in the early days. it was very shortly discovered that thbir lands were subject to floods at irregular intervals. and these farmers thought that the damming of the winnipeg river by the norman dam caused the floods by raising the level of the waters of the lake. they made complaints to washington. and for a considerable time our government engineers scouted the theory that the construction of the norman dam or the putting in of these stop logs a mile from the outlet of the lake did have the effect of raising the lake level. in 1898 the land was formally opened to settlement. and those who had been previously occupying the land by squatters rights acquired regular title under the land laws of the united states. in 1909 we made a general treaty with canada. or a treaty with great britain. on all matters concerning the dominion government in regard to the boundary waters. and under that treaty a commission was appointed to make a survey of boundary waters. that commission made extensive investigations and found that. the building of the norman dam and the putting in of these stop logs did have the effect of raising the level of the lake of the woods. many farmers had complained that in the growing season their crops have been ruined and even their improvements submerged. at one period of this earlier history we insisted that the lake be kept not below a certain level in the interest of navigation. at other times we seemed to be concerned with the interests of the farmer. the matter dragged along from bad to worse. you might say. until finally. in order to straighten the whole thing up. our state department arranged a meeting with the commissioners from the dominion of canada. and a new treaty was made which is known as the treaty of 1925. this bill is for the purpose of carrying that treaty into effect. now. that treaty provides that the level of the lake of the woods shall be maintained at a certain point. that the united states shall condemn land and acquire easements and flowage rights for 2 feet above that point for the purpose of protecting that level. that level being as high as any that had previously been complained of. and that protective works shall be built on the american side to prevent further damage from the increase of this flowage. canada has agreed by this treaty to pay the sum of $275.000 for the erection of these protective works and for the acquisition of flowage rights on lands under condemnation.","mr. chairman. i believe that an understanding of this amendment will obviate any objection to it. and- for this reason i wish briefly to explain it. the helium project is operated on a 5050 basis by the army- and the .navy. there are two problems in the helium project. one is the problem of the conservation of helium. and the other is the problem of current supply. by this amendment it is sought to make the provisions in this bill applicable also to the navy department. in view of the fact that the two departments are jointly interested in the development of this great project. it is thought. by newly discovered economies in the extraction of helium and the consequent reduction of cost that is foreseen. that likely it will be possible to save a part of the money here appropriated. that is the hope of those in control if this can be done the * adoption of this amendment will enable the two branches of the service. through this saving. to take some steps toward insuring an adequate current supply. the field from which we are now getting our supply. that at petrolia. tex.. 104 miles north of the city of fort worth. where we have our plant. is being considerably reduced. the indications are that it may be relatively a very short time until gas from that source will not be adequate for our current helium needs. the government owns a pipe line from the city of fort worth to this petrolla field. a new field has been discovered at nocona. situated about 22 miles from this pipe line. bearing a gas with a slightiy higher percentage of helium and less carbon dioxide. which has to be removed before the helium is extracted. for these reasons this gas seems quite available for production purposes. and it may be acquired. it is estimated. at a cost considerably less than we are now paying for the gas from. which we get our helium. a constant current supply is menaced unless we take advantage of some such opportunity as is thus afforded. and here fortunately is a field close by to which a slight extension of our line will give us access. the period of probable use of the available supply of this new field is estimated variously at from 10 to 25 years. in other words. this amendment. in view of the fact that the army and the navy operate the project on a 5050 basis. is simply to lend facility in the operation. the amendment provides that the provisions herein contained: shall apply also to the navy department in order that the two departments may have the same authority and work hand in hand for the better development of the project. and the economies contemplated in extraction may make it possible. if this amendment prevails. to use these provisions forincreasing our source of current supply with the appropriations available.","mr. president. i rise to a question of high personal privilege. exalted personal privilege. and on that question i wish to say that i discussed the mellon taxation plan here about three weeks ago. since that time i have received a great flood of letters. in fact. i received one morning a packet of letters from my state. all addressed on the same typewriting machine. all the envelopes bearing the return card of the same company. excoriating me for presuming to put my humble opinion into the scales against the opinion of secretary mellon. in reply to those excoriating letters i have sent out the following letter on the mellon plan :. i am heartily in favor of the adjusted compensation (bonus) bill for exservice men. i am opposed to the issuance of taxexempt securities. security holders should pay their fair part of the taxes. the benefits and burdens of government should be distributed to all persons with as near an approach to equality as may be possible. the sixtyseventh congress repealed the excessprofits tax and reduced the surtaxes from a maximum of 65 per cent to a maximum of 50 per cent. which is a reduction of the tax on wealth of over $500.000.000 annually. the same congress passed the fordneymccumber tariff bill. which brings $500.000.000 annually to the government and $3.500.000.000 annually to the protected industries. it seems. therefore. that these same interests ought not now to seek for a reduction in their taxes disproportionate to the reduction proposed to be granted to the citizens of relatively small or modest incomes.","mr. president. before proceeding with the bill that is under consideration i wish to submit a few observations with reference to the situation in the ruhr valley. the supreme council met in january. 1921. in paris. to consider reparations proposals. the french claim was then asserted to be 112.000.000.000 gold marks. it was stated. also. that the french share of the total claim against germany was 52 per cent. making the total demand on germany 215.000.000.000 gold marks. the interest and other claims would make it nearly double that. if charged and allowed. germany proposed to make it 50.000.000.000 gold marks. a number of conferences were held. subsequently. and resulted in reducing the amount of reparations until finally the irreducible minimum was reached about may 5. 1921. and the amount fixed at 132.000.000.000 gold marks gross. on may 11. 1921. germany accepted this ultimatum in a note to the supreme council. she has paid on account. until on august 1. 1922. her rep.aratlons debt was brought down to 120.000.000.000 gold marks. germany started her printing presses going. with the result that the value of the mark collapsed. she evidently intended to bring that about. and deliberately flooded the country with paper marks. she has brought ruin on her professional and middle classes. she no doubt expected to pay obligations by the use of these paper marks. and repudiation must necessarily follow. she received gold from people of this country to the amount of nearly a billion dollars for some of those marks now worthless. of course. the more money she makes by the printingpress method the less she has in fact. one dollar in gold will buy today 50.000 marks. the number in circulation is increasing at the rate of 20.000.000.000 per day. it is estimated that there are in circulation 2.000.000.000.000. april 24. 1921. germany offered to place with the reparations commission 150.000.000 marks gold in the form of gold and silver coin and 850.000.000 marks gold in the form of drafts on the treasury. this was when she proposed to make her total engagement 50.000.000.000 marks gold. she had gold then and she has it now. since her failure to meet her obligations. as agreed on. attributing her plight largely to the decline in the value of the mark. which she deliberately brought about. she has offered to pay what she could in kind. and some payments of that sort were made to some of the allies she offered to furnish labor and material to rebuild destroyed towns in france. but no definite decision was reached in that regard. the situation has gone from bad to worse. until france has felt obliged to proceed. substantially. as set forth in the note of the supreme council to the german ambassador. dated may 5. 1921. to wit: failing fulfillment by the german government of the above conditions by may 12. to proceed to the occupation of the valley of jiuhr and to take all other military and naval measures that may be required. such occupation will continue so long as germany fails to comply with the conditions summarized in paragraph (c). we are not in possession of all the facts and circumstances. therefore. it seems to me. respecting the justification or the wisdom. from an economic or other point of view. of the course pursued by france may reasonably be questioned. appreciating this. i venture to say it is believed that france is acting within her rights. if so. what she is doing is a question of expediency. and that france alone should determine. in the absence of full information regarding all that has taken place and is taking place. no criticism is warranted. and i feel quite certain our advice is not wanted. so far as i have heard there has been no intimation from those in authority that our counsel was desired. if we can not be helpful. which those directly concerned do not seem to believe. we certainly should not volunteer in a situation where more likely we would do harm. there are a few things we do know. we know that germany is responsible for bringing on the most disastrous war of all time in 1914. her ambition was to make herself a master of nations. and her purpose was conquest. we know that she was the aggressor in attacking france with sword and every conceivable means of destruction. we know that she wantonly. wickedly. without cause. violated the pledged neutrality of belgium. we know. because we have seen it. we had occasion to know it. that she ruthlessly destroyed whole cities and towns. churches. homes. mines. and fields in belgium and france. extending over vast areasas much as four of our states. we know she enslaved and slew and starved women and children and is responsible for the death of millions of men. we know that germany invaded belgium and france with ler armies. employing every engine of destruction conceivable. and was guilty of such atrocities as to arouse the indignation and horror of all civilized people until our own outraged sense of liberty. decency. and justice cried out to stop it. we know that germany deliberately and with malice aforethought put the supremacy of right in jeopardy and \" imperiled free government everywhere.\" and by her intolerable aggression showed she respected neither right nor obligation. it is true that happened under the autocratic power of the hohenzollerns. her then imperialistic rulers. who flouted the rights of the citizens. that thought merits consideration. it is now claimed the german people were not responsible for the doings of the militaristic regime in control. but. on the other hand. it is quite generally observed that we have not seen much evidence of regret. nor many admissions of wrong. nor many offers of apology on the part of the german people. they see their buildings. their homes. their lands. canals. railroads. mines. and industries all intact. and their attitude seems to be rather selfsatisfied. with a feeling not of guilt but a sort of consolation that while they did not make a success of the venture they really lost but little. and they see no good reason why they should be held to restitution. they seem to be perfectly willing to evade doing honestly what they have agreed to do. president wilsons policy led to the armistice. and that made it unnecessary for the allied armies to go to berlin and saved gernmany from the effects of an invasion by opposing armies. but he only got abuse and the vilest denunciation from germans at home and in america afterwards. his broad liberality in dealing with the whole subject toward germany was rewarded by their total lack of appreciation and violent animosity. the manner in which german officials and people treated president wilson might well cause us to pause before tendering our good offices in the present situation. the truth is i do not believe that germany. england. france. or italy attach very much importance to the united states. they look upon us as new. inexperienced. and incompetent to deal with large problems. i rather suspect we have an exag: gerated notion of our supposed influence in europe. .they believe we have resources and some financial strength and may grow up some day to where ourtopinions may be entitled to some respect. but we are now youthful. and it would not be well to put our young heads along with those of mature years and wisdom gained by centuries of experience and achievement. i do not believe they would really welcome. and i am quite sure they would not appreciate. any assistance we might perchance render. particularly in dealing with sharp differences where no element of cooperation can be brought into play. let us proceed a little further with the things we know. the time came. following some of the events i have mentioned and without discussing the reasons further. when. on april 6. 1917. we went in as champions of right. we raised armed forces totaling 4.800.000 men. we: sent 2.086.000 of them across the sea. we raised internal loans from the people amounting to $22.228.118.400. we reloaned to the allies $9.641.882.204. we gave $400.000.000 to the red cross and $700.000.000 for the relief of belgium. we know that october 10. 1918. our military forces held 23 per cent of the western front in france. we know. too. that of our soldiers 77.118 were killed in battle and 221.059 were wounded. we can not forget that. we have already expended through the veterans bureau and public health service. as one of the consequences of that war. over $2.000.000.000. and the average monthly payments amount to over $14.000.000. we know of the dead and wounded of france and the other allies. we know of the destruction and devastation in france. and i would not now dwell on details. because i would not kindle the fires of hate or revenge. i wish we might get away from those emotions. we sought no special reparations for ourselves in the- settlement of peace. we stood firmly \"for the restoration of right and the assurance of liberty everywhere.\" france has expended over 9.000.000.000 marks in restoring the wasted and ruined areas. germany has only paid to her 2.500.000.000 marks on account of reparations and has made. !first partial then complete. default. justice and right require that germany should pay the sum finally fixed by the commission after months of inquiry as to her ability to pay and in the light of all the facts and conditions. when she made demand on france in 1871 and set her own terms. france never whined nor bluffed. she went to work and paid in full before. it was duestupendous as the sum was. the amount as determined germany should pay is not onethird enough to cover the damage to frances property. to say nothing of the loss of life. for which there never can be compensation. the aggressor. the wrongdoer. was guilty of no ordinary tort in this case. germany committed a wanton. deadly assault upon belgium and france and continued it with barbarous frightfulness to the limit of her resources and strength. she did all the damage and committed all the injury she could. the high court. the arbitrament of arms. the finding of the world. the course of events. resulted in judgment being entered against her. she fails and refuses to pay. she seems to hold that frances claim was one of damnum absque injuria. the evidences of her ruthless destruction are. in plain sight. the traveler has no difficulty in realizing. when going easterly from paris. when he passes from france and reaches germany. there is nothing to do but issue execution and levy the fieri facias. germany took alsacelorraine in 1871 as part of her spoils. france takes the ruhr valley temporarily to recover the damages decreed to her as her just due in addition to the return of alsacelorraine and other incidental and pro rata settlements. it is not a case of giving vent to a military spirit or the exercise of military power. it is not a case of dictation by those in authority arbitrarily and irrespective of the opinions of the french people. prime minister poincar6 realizes that the people of his country have reached a point where their patience is exhausted. and they do not propose to longer submit to the dilatory methods. the frivolous excuses. the sullen indifference and studied attempts to avoid payment. and the evident purpose to escape the penalty which germany has adopted. the force behind the authorities is the public opinion of france. and if poincard hesitates. he would go as did briand. when germany understands that france is going to stand on and have her rights. germany will perform her engagement and meet her obligations. not before. france is evidently endeavoring to impress that understanding on her late enemy now. by the only process open to her. there will be squirming. loud cries for sympathy. shouts of oppression. propaganda to arouse protests. all of which ought to have been thought of in july. 1914. and before november 11. 1918. the german people look out upon their own country and see it is not scarred or hurt materially. they have the impression the conflict was a draw. that there was no victory. they appear to think france is lucky to escape capture and complete destruction. they will have to be taught that they lost the war. end although they suffered no damage to their property. france and belgium did not so escape. and a partial restoration of what germany ruthlessly destroyed must be made as agreed upon when her grip on the throats of france and belgium was loosened and she was forced to her knees. her people engaged in agriculture have their farms and homes unharmed and are now generally free from mortgage or debt. her capacity for production. her recuperative powers. are very great. they can understand the language france now speaks to them. they appear deaf to any other. she is talking to them. not in temper. not in violence. but as calmly as the situation permits. she is telling them to pay up. meet their just obligations. satisfy the judgment recorded. and if they refuse. she must take sufficient property upon which she can realize the amount due her. the duty of the united states in such a case is to recognize that it is not our affair. we are not directly involved. we are on friendly terms with both parties. it would be meddling and impertinent for us even to make a suggestion to either. unless solicited according to the practice in such cases. there was a time when the united states was in a position of leadership for the establishment of world order and peace. that time has passed. we threw away the opportunity for usefulness and influence in such situations as threaten europe today. more is the pity. we see plainly now. we retired in the face of small difficulties. and shirked our responsibilities. we are now a rank outsider. anything we might do or say now would be regarded as voluntary interference in affairs that we declined. when we were needed. to concern ourselves about. whereas in the past we asked for no favors or rewards. and could stand out as the only disinterested party n any european controversy. today our action would be suspected. our motives questioned. and the place likely to be assigned to us would be that of a selfserving. ubiquitous meddler. the only course open to us now. especially unless our good offres are requested. is to devote our attention to our own affair and let other countries settle their ownproblems in their own way. one other thought: i have always contended that under the constitution of the united states. with respect to foreign relations. the president is charged with the responsibility of leadership. i have always believed that in the discharge of that high duty and the exercise of that clearly expressed authority he ought to move unhindered. and that those in office and out of office owe him loyal support. i shall expect him to point the way. and. so far as my judgment and conscience will allow. which i hope will be the whole distance. i shall accompany him. certainly i shall not undertake to embarrass him or impede his progress. on the contrary. as he moves in the solution of those mighty questions peculiarly within his province. i shall endeavor to go with him. he is not the president of one political party alone. he is the president of the whole country and of all the people and as such his course in these matters of foreign relations i feel it incumbent upon me to make my course if i can. and at least throw no obstacles in his way. i felt the same way during the administration of his immediate predecessor in office. and i imagine troubled dreams must now come to those who obstructed and thwarted his conclusions and purposes.","mr. chairman. as a member of the committee on rivers and farbors. i participated in the preparation of this bill. i come from a section of the country that is not interested directly in the projects involved in this bill. this. as you understand. is an authorization bill. it does. not appropriate any money. but it adopts the projects and authorizes the appropriations committee to provide the funds. all of the projects in this bill are. in my judgment. most meritorious projects. and. being in a position to discuss the bill in the main impartially. i will say to you frankly that. having gone over in detail the various projects involved. i do not think you will find any project that is included in the bill that is not a meritorious project. the only item in which my section of the country is directly interested would be the galveston harbor. there is an item of $500.000 for building it sea wall at galveston. most of the money that is authorized in the bill is for projects on. the pacific and atlantic coasts. some are on the gulf coast. and a few items along the lakes. i desire to discuss for a moment. however. the galveston seawall question. btoause i assume there are members present who are more familiar with the various other items in the bill and who are more ov less interested in these sections. and for that reason have the information and will discuss those various items. \"the government undertook some years ago to build a sea wall to control the floods at galveston. the primary object was to protect the city of galveston. we are authorizing in this bill an appropriation of something like two and a half million dollars at galveston. two million dollars. approximately. of the amount is provided for coping with the situation confronting the bay ports back of galveston. we have built a great many hundred feet of sea wall at galveston. but there are approximately 2.800 feet. as i remember it. not completed. the wall has been built out beyond the city of galveston. but in order to get the ocean steamers back into the harbor of galveston and into the various harbors of the bay back inside the government has constructed a channel that goes from the gulf into the bay at galveston. the purpose of the sea wall is to extend it out to the jetty. which helps to form the channel. and until that is done there is always danger. the engineers say. that when the flood comes it will fill up the present channel and thereby prevent ocean steamers from entering galveston and other harbors around the bay. it is not the -incoming effect of the flood that does the damage. but. the water from the wind iressure out in the gulf that piles the water up back in the bay until dtring a big storm the water is piled up about 14 feet just inside the channel and about 28 feet back at the upper end of the bay. then when the storm subsides the water comnes rushing out. but instead of it going through the channel. which is not in a straight line in the way the water wants to go. but is at a sharp angle. the water rushes across the sand bar where the additional sea wall is needed and cuts out holes. and silt settles in the channel and fills it up. 0 the result is that- if we have another storm on the gulf we fiill lose the use of the sea wall that now extends far beyond the city and all the money that has been appropriated and expended on harbors inside tue bay. in this connection i want to. read an extract from a letter written by the chief of engineers. dealing with this project: this channel is absolutely dependent upon the jetties. which have made it possible to maintain a depth front the sea of 33 feet. where formerly only 12 feet existed. the port of galveston serves the country as far inland s iowa and nebraska. and a loss of this port would be a national calamity. furthermore. the present conditions would not be restored for probably some two or three years at least if the south jetty should be destroyed. this brings home to us the question that it is not merely the locality where a project is located that is interested in a proposition of this kind. you take the wheat and other farm products that are exported from kansas and the western part of missouri. and up in the dakotas. and all that section. all these farm products now go down by railroad to galveston and then out to sea. sonic of it goes down the mississippi river and out through new orleans. but the great portion of it has been going by rail to galveston and thence abroad. now. if a storm comes and stops up the channel for two years it will close galveston and other harbors on the bay. and the chief of engineers says that will be nothing short of a calamity. it shows that we of the middle west are all interested in keeping galveston port open. there is another question. much discussion has been had in this house about the improvement of inland rivers. and in this subject i have been especially interested. in my candid judgment there is not a river in this country the use of which will more thoroughly justify the improvement than the missouri river. why do i say that? i am discussing the missouri because an amendment will be offered here. which has been approved by the committee. providing for the survey of the missouri river from kansas city to sioux city in order to determine whether or not that improvement is practicable. i want to discuss. first. what i think has been a bad policy of this congress with respect to river improvements. we undertake a project: we adopt it and spend millions of dollars on it. and after we have done all that we fail to complete it. so that we can get the benefit of the investment. take. for instance. the ohio river. i have heard a lot of criticism about the money that has been spent on the ohio river. because we are not getting any substantial use out of it. and to the man who does not understand that situation that is a perfectly natural criticism. oil june 25. 1910. this congress adopted the project of improving the ohio river from pittsburgh to cairo. the mouth of the river. or to the mississippi. at a cost of $63.731.000. insuring a 9foot channel. they called oil the engineers to make a survey and report in order to determine what it would cost to insure a 9foot channel front pittsburgh to the month of the ohio. and when the survey was in they found the work could be done for-$63.731.000. and the bill provided that that work should be completed in a period of 12 years. the 12 years will be tip on the 25th of next ilonth. and the congress during that 12 years time. instead of completing the project has appropriated the net suin of $43.624.000. but the work is not completed. down at time mouth of the river there are four or five locks and dalls that ought to be built. but are not complete([ because congress ihas not appropriated tie moilney. we have $43.000.000 invested on the upper ohio river. because that much has been expended. and yet you can not utilize it except in flood tines because congress has never completed that project. suppose the ennsylvania railroad undertakes to open up transportation between st. louis and new york city. you know as well as i do that they call not utilize the investment until the last tie has been laid and the last rail nailed down. and likewise we (all not utilize the loney invested in the ohio project until the entire project has been completed. and you have $43.000.(0 tied up now o1 tle ohio. al you can not utilize it. and the great territory from pittsburgh to cairo is not getting the benefit of that investnment. and the government is not getting the benefit of it. because congress has not carried out the plan it adtopted to make the appropriation aid complete the improvement within a given time. we adopted the mississippi river project between cairo and the alouth of the missouri on june 25. 1910. congress wrote into the law that that section of the river should be completed in 12 years. the report at that time estimated that it would cost $21.000.000. that 12 years will be up on the 25th of next nmonth. and this congress has appropriated on that project only $1.970.000 antd the project is not comlpleted. and yet tile mississippi river is operating the best it can oer that unimproved section and making a good showing. the trouble is we do not complete anything. we invest nilliois but fail to complete and the projects are criticized because they are not used. take the mississippi river from st. louis to milnleapolis. on june 25. 191(l. in the same bill in which tile congress adopted these other projects they adopted one to make a 6foot channel the year around from st. louis to minleapolis to be conpleted in 12 years and to cost $27.000.000. this congress froim time to time has appropriated to the total extent of $12.260.000. and you can not use it because there are still sand bars and] bad places in that section of the river. oin july 25. 1912. congress adopted a project for the inlprovemient of the missouri river. from kansas city to st. louis. at a cost of $20.000.000. to insure a 6foot channel and to be coalpleted in 10 years. that 10year period will be up oil the 25th of next july. congress has appropriated and the engineers have expended $7.500.000 upon that section of the missouri river since the project was adopted. but that vast investment can not be utilized because congress has not appropriated enough money to complete the project. in other words. you have $64.730.000 invested in these projects that we can not use because you have never completed them. i want to call your attention tothis fact: there is no longer any question about the absolute necessity of using these rivers. rake tile condition il kansas. if you will. i got the figures the other day. i find that when the war was.over kansas farmers had about 150.000.000 bushels of wheat ready for the market. the price was good. members of congress front kansas appealed to the railroad administration in order to get cars allotted there to carry the wheat to the market. they could not get them. because the pressure was too high from other shippers. there were not cars enough. so the wheat laid i the granaries and was held there until they could get cars sufficient to carry the wheat to the market. and by that time the price had gone down about a dollar a bushel.","well. that is a matter that has been in controversy for years over certain swampland selection. of course the conditions are not the same in many locations as when these lands were granted to the states. because the act says lands unfit for cultivation. but for carrying out the purposes of the act for levee construction. flood protection. and drainage they are subject to and fit for cultivation.","suggestion has been made that germany is so crippled from lack of raw materials and labor conditions. deprived by a reparation commissiofi of 50 per cent of her outputwhich i shall refer to laterthat we need have no fear of german competition in the immediate future. i i am not convinced of the soundness of the argument of the statesmen who preach germanys impotence and weakness at the present time. i am not convinced of germanys inability to \"come back.\" england. france. and the united states underestimated germanys strength and her recuperative powers before the war. and as a result of this stupidity. neglect. and indifference there are 10.000.000 men in their graves and 20.000.000 wounded and crippled hobbling through the world. i am suspicious of germany yet. and whether i am right or wrong in that conclusion i believe it is a crime for us to take chances whether w6 have evidence or not of germanys present ability for industrial recuperation. what is germanys policy and what is her present position? i presentthe meager evidence at hand. the following report. dated november 5. 1918. has been received by the naval intelligence office from a reliable source in denmark and is interesting in shedding some light on the present condition of the dyestuff industry in germany: during the war competing firms have arisen everywhere in the neutral and enemy countries. we shall meet competition which. with government subsidy and protection. will endeavor to dispute the leadership in the worlds markets which we have obtained after years of labor and efforts. we must be armed for this fight. and it seems to me that there is no better way of doing this than by an amalgamation of our home industry along the broadest lines. in order to protect the improvements obtained through science and practice in chemicals. and above all in colors. one wellinformed expert suggests that foreign countries should not be given the newest colors for their own use for a long time. but that the german dye manufacturers should work hand in hand with the german textile industry and produce finished colored products. the imitation of which. at least for. a certain period. would be impossible abroad. i also wish to read from a letter of one of my constituents. mr. f. herbert chamberlain. now president of the heydon chemical co.. of garfield. n. j.. a former german concern. now americanized. and mr. chamberlain having become president. he wrote me on september 20. 1919. following his return from a visit to germany. i read this to counteract the impression that is being given out that germany is not industrially prepared to compete with the united states and to show that she is prepared. that she has large stocks of dyes which will be released. large stocks even beyond those that will be turned over to the reparations commission. mr. chainberlain said: during my vacation i availed myself of the privilege of visiting the chemical plants of the farbenfabriken vorm. frederick bayer at leverkusen. and badische anllin und soda fabrik at ludwigshafen. and beg to assure you that i was astounded at the magnitude of the plants in question. one had heard so much in regard to the unsatisfactory labor conditions in germany since the revolution. that damage had been done to these plants by the allied armies. and that these plants were under the control of the iuterallied council. that these three plants were carefully observed during my visit. in regard to the bayer plant. which covers between 600 and 650 acres. the management stated that they had 8.000 employees. 300 chemists. and a clerical force of 2.5o0\"men. it seems to be quite evident that this statement was fictitious. especially after our talk with the officials representing the british government. the indications are that they are employing double this numberapproximately the same number of men as the badische anilin plant referred to below. the badische anluin und soda fabrik plant covers 750. to 800 acres. the management stated that they were employing 16.000 workmen. 250 chemists. and a clerical force of between 1.800 and 2.000 men. the. prewar hourly rate for operative labor was m. 0 50 equivalent at a prewar rate to approximately 12 cents per hour. and the factory operated on 12hour shifts. today the hourly rate is m. 2.50. which is equivalent at the present rate of exchange to approximately 9 cents per hour. and their hours have been reduced from 12 to 8 hour shifts.. in walking through the various sections of the two companies one is impressed with the apparent satisfaction of the workmen. their industrious intent. and one can not see any outside indications of dissatisfied conditions. and from what i saw the companies are manufacturing dyes and intermediates on three 8hour shifts.per day. their stores are heavily loaded. and the only inference is that as england has barred the receipt of any of these dyes and. intermediates for the next 10 years. the germans are looking forward to dumping their products in this country. outside of the fact that the british army have one man stationed at the bayer plant. whose main function is to supply data to the interallied council: there is no apparent control of what this company is manufacturing. with the result that the plant is working at full force and there is no sign of any destruction caused by the war. at the badische plant my observation extended over a longer period of time and their dye and intermediate sections are working at full force. and i understand from the french officials in charge that their warehouses are full of dyes. intermediates. and pharmaceuticals. at this plant i also noticed that they were putting up new buildings. in talking with the. business men of the occupied areabankers.. merchants. and laborersi was greatly impressed with the general tone of satisfaction. the shops were well filled with goods. the people in fine p~ysical condition. with the exception that in the poorer quarters the children looked somewhat anemic. and i came back fully convinced that unless our government not only gives the chemical industry a proper tariff protection. but in addition some licensing method that will prevent the germans from dumping their commodities in this country. that it will be death to the industry and mean that the last four years effort. not only in time but investment. made by the chemical manufacturers and scientists of our country will have been of no avail. we do not seem to realize that the chemical industry has to compete with the low rate of approximately 9 cents per hour per day as. compared with our 40 cent to 50 cent rate. which you will appreciate is an enormous difference to overcome. and as near as i can ascertain from the french and british officials the feeling is most prevalent that the german chemical manufacturers themselves started this revolution with the main idea that while it would mean a small increase in wages which they- would be compelled to give their laborers. this would be a mere bagatelle compared with what they hoped to gain by such a method. and that they could use these artificial disturbances in wrenching concessions from the council of five in paris. in june there occurred a meeting between the management of an important chemical manufacturing concern near dusseldorf and a delegation of their laborers. the delegates asked for an increase of 50 pfenigs over the 2 marks which they are actually being paid. these figures were equivalent to 12 cents at the rate of exchange prevailing. at that time. it was. interesting to note the attitude of those men who were as deferential as they behaved before the war. they stated the reasons for their request. giving the price of food.. and altogether made a very good case for themselves. their management conceded half of what they asked for. whereupon the delegates expressed their profound gratitude. to the management for having yielded to them and promised to increase their efforts so that the company would not be the losers but the gainers by their concession. wherever i had opportunities of interviewing either employers or employees i found a similar situation. the men are willing to work at any wage which provides them with the bare necessities of life. and i was greatly impressed with the energetic manner in which they were working throughout the various plants i visited. you will realize. that the rate asked for by these men was only 121 cents per hour. at the rate of exchange at the time. at todays rate of exchange the rate asked for would be equivalent to the rate of 8 cents per hour. and this is the. situation the industry in this country. has to face today. reviewing the situation. we find that england is prepared to mannfacture not only practically all of the intermediates but also the bulk of the finished dyes and pharmaceuticals to cover both her industrial and surgical requirements. and. as you are aware. has put into practice legislation that will prevent the dumping of dyes. intermediates. and pharmaceuticals in the british domain. this protection. is vested in a licensing committee. which has full power to grant or refuse licensing and fix charges on such licensing. there are large stocks of dyes and pharmaceuticals ready to be shipped out of the country. with the united states as their destination. as appeared from a statement made by the united states consul general in zurich. who pointed out the large number of agents making all necessary negotiations with the object of shipping to america such goods as soon as the requirements of the certificate of origin were removed. and that the consulate was flooded with applications for the groper certificates to cover such shipments. this situation. i assume e has already reported to our government. mr. president. at this point i ask leave to -insert a petition signed by over 4.500 workmen of the du pont factory in- salem county. n. j.. urging that legislation be enacted in order that the industry may be continued.","i know. but that act was passed long before the act of 1917. my contention is. mr. chairman. that this appropriation is the result of a specific and particular act. approved by the president march 1. 1917. for floodcontrol work. we have thrashed out on the floor on one or two occasions the question whether this was river and harbor work. it is the work of another character that does not bring it within the terms of the existing law. this is a subsequent statute and you are attempting to make an appropriation available until it is expended.","flood control. as iunderstand it. and as we understood it when that committee was create(]. meant the abnormal flow of time water. not the norml flow affecting navigation. so far as this paragraph reads. it may be regarded as a matter to protect navigation. n matter of improvemient of the channel. which would certainly coie under tile jurisdiction of tile committee oil tivers nnd harbors. what is there in the paragraph to indicate that there is a flood there? it is a normal condition. not an abnorinal one.. it is a nritter of the natural flow of ilie water. which may cause erosion on one bank or the other. but there is nothing to indicate that it is a matter of flood or flood control. the iississippi river is ain uncertailn quantity. it is t river ill which the flow changes. it cuts in oni this bank and it cuts in oni that bank. that is the norial condition. then there are certain seasons when tie rier rises and there are freshlets which result in floods. and great dainger ensues to surroundling property. then it lecomes a niatter of flood control. there is nothing on tile face of this paragrapi to indicate tiat it is a matter of flood control but everythilng to indicate that it is a matter purely of the normal regulation of the flow of a rivei. i beg the pardon of tile gentleman from mississippi for making that statement in his time.","in just a moment .i will yield. this .is the language .of the bill: that the secretary of the interior is .hereby authorized. it -does not tstop there-:and directed. under such xules -and regulations as be -may prescribe. to grant to any applicant who is a citizen of the united states. an association of such citizens. or a corporation organized under the laws of any state or territory thereof. a prospecting permit which shall give the exclusive right to prospect for chlorides. sulphates. carbonates. borates. silicates. or nitrates of potassiumon the public lands of the united states:. and deliberately. upon the amendment .of the senator from utah. the bill has been so framed that the public lands of .the united states. as there expressed. will include the 2.400.000 acres spoken of -in the letter of the secretary of the interior which are already known to contain these minerals.","well. 1.500. i care nothing about that. but when it is made a public document. two things result. first. it goes out to the general public as n document of such dignity and importance and truth that the senate of the united states has solemnly concluded that it ought to be furnished to the public under the sanction and authority of the government itself. hence. instead of going to the people as a mere pronunciamento by an interested party it* goes out with the brand of approval by the government upon it. the second prop6sition is that there is no limit upon the number of copies that can be printed in the government printing office. provided somebody pays for it. and there is no limit. upon the number any senator may send out or permit to be sent out under his frank.. so \"the bug under the chip \" is the franking privilege which this private corporation has this morning gained the right to use by the unanimous consent of the senate. and we are told that a unanimous consent is like the laws of the medes and the persians. it can not be altered. mr. president. \" sugar at a. glance\" went out as a public document. i doubt wn~hether the senator who introduced that document had the slightest idea it would be used in the manter it was. butthe country was literally flooded with it. other documents that i need not refer to have been sent out. i think in one instance over. t million copies of a document were franked. this has already been said by other senators this morning. the document now in question is made a public document. first that it may have the franking privilege. so that this enormously rich private corporation shall enjoy the right to send its literature and its message and its appeal to the country without paying a penny of postage. while every farmer and every mechanic and every merchant and every private citizen must pay the full postage for everything lie sends. second. that it mny appear that the governments satction has been put upon this ex parte statement. and that some people will be led to believe.it to be an official statement issued by the government itself. i say so for the reason that the document has already been printed. printed as you will observe in all sorts of fancy type upon elegant paper and in sufficient numbers. so that members of congress to whom it professes to be an appeal have already been furnished with it. there was. therefore. .no necessity for making it a public document in order to bring it to the attention of congress. there was no necessity for making it a public document in order to bring it to th3 attention of the country. because it is already printed. all that this beneficent and kindly institution. that by its own confession has plundered it for 29 years. can gain by the franking privilege is to escape the postage. for if it wanted to pay the postage. the document already being printed. all it has to do is to put a government stanp upon it and put it in. the mail. i understandi do not know that i am accuratethat the postage upon this particular document costs 56 cents. although that may be a mistake. the senator from new jersey . however. gives me that information.","what is your official

interpretation has been put upon the language of chief justice white in the standard oil case. reference has been made to it in a number of instances by the senator from nevada . by the senator from new hampshire [mr. hollisi. and by some others here. under what was the prosecution in -the standard oil case and in the tobacco trust case? the sherman law. section 2 of the sherman law prohibits monopoly and attempts to monopolize. in the opinion by chief justice white discrimination in price under certlin conditions was mentioned as one of the instancesof a monopoly or an attempt to monopolizeby thus securing the market or trade away from a competitor. that is all. it does not at all follow from that that this or that act or conduct will be unfair competition under the terms of section5 of this bill. . *. . in the stress of competitionanother practical consideration herein the methods adopted by the ambitious to succeed as they reach out after business. it will be found that while individuals and corporations keep within the law and do not coimbine in restraint of trade. nor quite create or attempt to create a monopoly. yet in their advertising methods. in puffing their own. in depreciating the like commodities of others. in the wages paid. in the quality of their output. they will be just on the border line between the fair and the unfair. and it is easy to see that amid such conditions the commission will nbt be lacking in business. as to the possibly varying views of different commissioners at different times regarding what would constitute unfair competition. it being to such an extent an ethical question or an economic question. i am sometimes reminded of the saying of the old commonlaw lawyer. john selden. who had his misgivings in regard to what the chancellors might do in their decisions. you will remember he said: t is all one as if they should make the standard of measure we call a foot a chancellors foot. what an uncertain measure this would he! one chancellor has a long foot. another a short foot. a third an indifferent foot . and t is the same thing in the chancellors conscience. when you come to consider the different elements and considerations involved in many cases likely to be brought before the commission. and the temptation there will be to bring cases of alleged unfair competition before the commission. the burden that will be imposed upon it can be seen. uncertainty in the law. mr. president. relating to any of the relations of life. whether they are personal. whether they are domestic. whether they are public. is bad enough. but there is trade-\" trade. the calm health of nations \"-to be subjected to all the uncertainties which may arise from the administration of this uncertain law. i can not contemplate the result .with quite a serene mind. we must concede. i think. that business has suffered severely in the past because of uncertainty in the law. at least in the meaning of the law. which is the same thing. and as business has suffered. so has the public. happily. however. both the interstatecommerce law and the antitrust law have at last. in their main and most mooted features. received certain and reasonable construction and interpretation. their administration is wholesome and more effective than it was once thought it ever would be. through these great acts of legislation as now understood the peoile of this country have demonstrated their capacity to govern. the instriumentalities of production and commerce can be permitted to live. compete. and at the same time be subject to reasonable control. but business has no sooner understood and adjusted itself to the situation than we are threatened with an act which will open the floodgates of conjecture and speculation as to what lusiness may depend upon. the difference between the other acts to which i allude and this is that they more nearly define something. and this. too. in terms of the law. so that under given conditions it is not difficult to say whether the law has been violated. but here we tn it over to a commission. to a nonlegislative and a noii..udicial body with all the latitude of prohibition against unfairness in competition that the boys at school used to impose on each other when they -went into a fight. where \"no. scrachin. no kickin. no bitin. no pulling hair. no gouging\" was allowed. which will the commission declare is pernissible under the rules of the game prescribed by the commissibners. or will they bar all these and limit the war to a straight standup and knockdown and out? it is understood. of course. that they are not to prevent the fight. a waiting and expectant public insists that that shall go on. no. mr. president. we overload this commission. instead of giving them something reasonable. tangible. certain. or even in the language of the law \"capable of being made certain.\" we give them something to keep them guessing. to keop business guessing. to keep the public guessing. to the injury of both business and the public. business now frets and hesitates under the uncertainties of this bill and the panding antitrust bill. and no wonder. when we consider all that they involve. as i look at the language of that portion of this bill relating to unfair competition. i think if it stood alone i would be tempted to entitle it \"a bill to perpetuate uncertainty in business.\" i think it clear that the powers conferred upon the interstate commerce commission are not analogous to the powers proposed to be conferred by this bill on the trade commission.","mr. president. is a survey intended to find the extent of the area that would be protected by a levee or that would be endangered by the absence of a levee? there is not a mississippi plantation darkey who could not tell thle extent of territory in his section that would be flooded by a great overflow of the river. you do not need a survey for that. all that is the merest chaff.","mr. president. the senator is under a misapprehension about the language of the bill as well as the scope of the bill. the flood is an impending flood. the danger has not at all passed. no part of the appropriation is intendedeither to aid flood sufferers or to repair present crevasses in levees. the flood is almost at its crest. there are about 1.100 miles of levee line. and this money is an additional appropriation to the $350.000 appropriated within the past week. of which $310.000 has been expended. it is to fight the high water and try to preserve the government levee.. which are in peril. a peril which has not passed at all. but the peril increases with the length of time that the river at flood presses against the embankments. the river at cairo is today 2 feet higher than the highest flood ever known. and it is higher down the entire levee system than was ever known before. it is a life and death fight to. preserve those levees. it is for that purpose that this appropriation goes and not for any permanent levee work. and it does not belong in the river and harbor bill.","when i entered the sixtyfirst congress i was assigned to the committee on indian affairs. -where i was introduced to the subject of this imperfect memorial. then an influential member of that important committee. i was attracted to lilm immediately. as all were who knew him at all. by his gentle courtesy. by his quiet dignity. by his modest demeanor. by his obvious sincerity. by his patient industry. by his inflexible integrity. and by his exceptional efficiency for the performance of the duties which -devolved upon him. as. in the lapse of time. i was admitted more informally into the privileges of his friendship. i grew more and more to recognize his unusual ability. which i think was scarcely understood here. and more and more to reverence his admirable chaxacter. which i am sure was acknowledged everywhere. he was born of obscure and honest parentage on march 17. 1837. and died an american representative. commanding the confidence and good will of an intelligent and enlightened constituency. on february 13. 1911. his life was singularly busy and remarkably useful. his early career was characterized by a constant struggle for an education which should equip him for the serious and severe labors of the world. he always underestimated his own capacity. and he was one of the most unmssuming men i -ever encountered in official or private station. fortunately for his district. for his state. for his country. his people were not slow to discover his extraordinary aptitude for the public service. and almost from his youth to his death he occupied some position of trust or responsibility or distinction or honor. it can be truthfully said of himand more need not be said of any manthat he retired from every relation with the esteem and love of those whose interests his activities affected. we know how uniform was the affection cherished for him by his colleagues in the house. and how general was their regret when his decease was announced. with a profounder intensity the same affection was displayed and the same regret suffered by his humbler neighbors in maine. i was extremely impressed by the funeral oration delivered at alfred by his old pastor. the rev. c. w. bradlee. of bath. me.. and i undertake now to reproduce it as a part of my remarks: life is a constant revelation. to the open eye every moment is luminous. but there are critical periods in human lives. seasons of special revelation. a: strange path has opened at our feet. some great blessing has come into our lives and flooded our souls with sunshine and hope. or some sorrow has fallen upon us and so changed everything that we walk in a different world and seem to be different men and women. most of us understand this truth. life lia bieen filled with varied experiences. joyous and sad. we have been called again and again to walk along darkened ways. needing sorely the comfort of others. where at other times it has been ours to comfor:. we have met experiences which seemed uncertain and unreal. we have passed a rugged corner in life. our outlook has changed. and we have changed with it. thus are we brought into sympathy with the trying lot of others. and in the darkest hours hands are held out to those in need. because we have passed through the loneliness and weariness of affliction. we are touched most deeply by the affliction of others. and so we are here. this large company of men and women. in the middle of a busy day. heart to heart. soul to s with this bereft circle. practical sympathy has been and will be shown . but now we are gathered to express. if only by our presence and in silent communion. the yearning desire we each and all have to console and comfort and bless. human speech seems almost an intrusion in an hour like thisthe ministry of spirit. human and divine. is more appropriate and eloquent. yet i would. if i may. voice the feelings of those present and absent who were friends of the departed. i would also be a minister of consolation this hour. and the more because of the sympathetic and personal relation existing between myself and family and this shadowed home. it is not easy for me to speak here this afternoon. the departure of this man. whose body lies here in the stillness. brings to me and mine a sense of personal bereavement and loss. i am. indeed. a mourner at his bier. for more than 30 years i was honored with and enjoyed his friendship. our acquaintance began in 1878. when i became his pastor. and what a royal parishioner he was! not only a liberal contributor toward the expenses of public worship. not only a constant attendant and inspiring listener to my youthful preaching. but ready to cooperate with me in every worthy enterprise for the peoples good. i saw much of him during these two years. both in public and private. and came to know him intimately. i was made welcome in his home and have enjoyed its hospitality at my will ever since. but he opened his heart to me. and i learned what manner of man this was. who. honored so far above the majority of his fellows. remained ingenuous and unostentatious to the last. it is not necessary that i repeat the biographical facts which have been published in all the leading rapers of the country. his public life is well known by you who sit before me. neither am i expected to attempt a memorial oration. such as will doubtless be delivered at a future day by some colleague at washington. but mine is the humbler privilege of offering a simple. affectionate tribute from my heart to the memory of this man. whom i greatly respected and genuinely loved. it was good to have him for a friend. you know that. how genial lie was. his laugh was infectious. how companionable and sympathetic. he shared your joys and sorrows. he helped you when he could. his friendship was true. it could be depended upon. it never betrayed its trust. that made him an ideal member of the fraternity to which he belonged. he not only took the vows of brotherhood. but practiced the spirit of brotherliness and the law of mutual help. but he not only loved his neighbor and recognized the brotherhood of men. but he loved his country. he was patriotic as well as philanthropic. he was a conscientious public servant. hle was true and faithful in every relation of lifedevoted to his family. kind to his relatives. and a friend in need to many who were of no relation to him. he was as generous as tenderhearted and liked to bestow his benefactions secretly. though plainspoken and unaffected. he was a coirteous gentleman. showing deference to the aged and attracting the young around him. he was charitable of mens motives and disposed to put the best construction on their words and actions. he had decided convictions on every moral question. and i never knew him to hesitate to declare them when a declaration of his standing was called for. i have talked with him alone of the eternal verities. he was a believer in the christian religion and had a personal faith in the lord jesus christ. the other world and life seemed to him a logical sequence of this world and life. though a quiet man. he was one of strong feelings. with his intense nature he must have seen and heard and felt more than the ordinary man in this world. what must it have been to him when he found himself so suddenly in yonder world of god? a retired captain of the british army. fond of relating his worldwide experiences. he was describing some of his most surprising adventures. when. stopping suddenly in the midst of his stories. he exclaimed. with emotion and solemn earnestness : \" but. gentlemen. wonderful as these things were. i am expecting soon to see something far more wonderful.\" the company were much surprised and mystified at this sudden exclamation and altered manner. the veteran soldier was 70 years old. and as he was retired from service and his traveling days were over. they wondered what lie could mean. when they asked his meaning be was silent for a moment and then replied: \"during the first five minutes after death.\" may we not believe that not only was that a great wonder. but a sweet surprise. to this our friend who has preceded us on the unknown journey. however much one has thought about and prepared for and expected it. unspeakably wonderful must it be to suddenly find oneself in the other and better world. the other day when the message came he heard the call of the unseen that those around him could not hear. and went over. he did not die. out from the castoff tenement of flesh he went to god. out from the night of earth he passed into the eternal morning. to the land of the unclouded day. where the lords tired ones rest and are never sick any more. nor worn. nor weary. nor ever know again the heartaches of earth life. for \" god shall spread his tabernacle over them. they shall hunger no more. neither thirst any more. neither shall the sun light on them. nor any heat. for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto fountains of waters. and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.\" his daughter. in a personal communication to a friend of the family. said: \"his ability to serve others and keep silent was one of his strongest points. his sudden death revealed to us many secrets of his being a friend in need to many. i would not wish to multiply words as to my fathers true worth. but i know that whatever estimate is put on his public career he was a faithful public servant. honest and sincere in every act.\" and his son: \"as i look at his life it was one of serviceableness in the best sense of the word.\" and from far off mississippi a gentleman writes: \"in my dixie home i shall teach my children to reverence the memory of the man who once helped their father in time of sore need.\" service! mr. speaker. it is the principle inculcated by the great master who surrendered his life on calvary to illustrate it. service! it was finely exemplified by our departed friend. and we know beyond all doubting truly that when he crossed to the invisible shore his devoted soul was immediately admitted to companionship with the spirits of other just men made perfect on high.","mr. chairman. i desire to be heard for a moment. the gentleman from massachusetts has indulged in a great deal of wild talk in regard to the functions of the hydrographic office md the discourteous treatment which he says the committee on appropriations gave that office and the navy department in not calling them before it. if there is anyone who has cause for complaint of mistreatment it is the membership of this house. and especially the membership of the committee on appropriations. on account of the treatment they have received at the instance of the hydrographic office and the navy department. for the moment that our committee commenced to investigate the question of duplication of service in the hydrographic office and the weather bureau. that moment the wires were made hot by the hydrographic office. communicating with the branch hydrographic offices all over the united states. and also with the maritime interests of the united states and foreign countries. urging them to protest against the consolidation of the work of the hydrographic office with the weather bureau of the agricultural department. they did not know exactly what was going to be done. nor did they inquire. they imagined their bureau. being a civil and not a military bureau. that it was our purpose. in order to avoid this duplication in the publication of the pilot charts. to consolidate the bureaus. thereupon. or soon thereafter. the committee on appropriations and members of the house began to be flooded with protests against an imaginary consolidation. something that was not even in the mind of any member of the committee. our only purpose when we commenced this investigation was to find out the facts in regard to the duplication of the service of these two bureaus. we soon discovered that the hydrographic bureau of the navy department and the weather bureau of the agricultural department were preparing. printing. and distributing identically the same pilot charts. the chief of the weather bureau service. when he was before us. frankly and manfully said that this was a duplication of service. that his bureau was required by law to furnish to the hydrographic office the meteorological information printed on the pilot charts. and that if congress would provide that this work should be done exclusively by the hydrographic office he would cheerfully acquiesce. the information in regard to currents and in regard to derelicts and sailing routes is furnished by the hydrographic office. both were printing identically the same charts. and printing them monthly. and then they were distributing the same charts to the same observers who furnished these bureaus the information from which the charts are prepared. in that investigation we found that there were four naval officers detailed for service in the hydrographic bureau. there is an excuse for the hydrographer being a naval officer. because it is necessary to connect this civil institution with the navy and the merchant marine. but the hydrographic office is no part of the navy. the duties of those employed there are the duties of civilians. but notwithstanding that fact. we have four men in that office doing civil duty. doing the duty that $1.800 clerks are doing in other bureaus. and we are paying them from $5.000 to $5.700 a year. that is why the committee on appropriations. in reporting this provision. limited the number of officers to be detailed for duty in the hydrographic office to one. and that one the hydrographer.","mr. president..just a word or two before the vote is taken. i do not know much about carbonsabout the cost of production or the cost to the consumerand i doubt if any senator on this floor would assume or pretend to be an expert. but there are men in the country. manufacturers and dealers. who know all about the business. the senator from rhode island proposes by the amendment to increase the duty on carbons about 50 per cent. and the reason he assigns for it is that under the existing law a practical fraud. working as an evasion of the law. is perpetrated against the public treasury. however that may be. mr. presidentand i do not enter into itthere is a question whether the application of the present tariff law. under the decisions of the court. does not impose a duty ample. and more than ample. for the proper protection. so called. of the american industry. mr. president. i read a bit ago a brief extract from a letter written to me by the wesco supply company. of st. louis. the general manager of that company. in his letter. says this. among other things: the dingley tariff reads 90 cents per 100 pieces. which was absolutely prohibitive had it not been for the fact that carbons. instead of being made in the usual commercial length of 12 inches. 10 inches. and 91 inches. were then produced by foreign manufacturers in double lengths. in other words. this dealer. who i suppose is an importer. although as to that i am not advised. states that if the carbons had not been manufactured and imported in double lengths. but had been manufactured in ordinary lengths used in actual consumption. the duty would have been absolutely prohibitory. that the rate would not permit them to come in at all except for the fact that they were manufactured in double lengths. if that statement is true-","that is probably true at certain places. and especially true of deception pass. deception pass now has. during high and low tide. a current which will not only prevent the planting of mines. but also prevent the movement of ships. so that the only time there would be danger of the pass being used would be flood tide. when there would be no current to contend with. the statement as to any particular place i am not claiming as accurate upon my judgment. but upon that of the officers who appeared before the committee. now. as i have stated. we have provided for this additional torpedo planter. and the history of modern warfare shows that mine defense is a very great defense. it is a great defense not only in its actual effectiveness when tried. but in the moral effect that it has upon the foe. an opposing fleet is not going to hastily and thoughtlessly enter a harbor that is properly and scientifically mined according to the modern process. the committee have. as usual. followed the custom of making appropriations of lump sums without a designation of places. in doing that i think the committee has given expression. perhaps. to a fad of some of the officers of the department. i am thoroughly convinced of the need of giving some discretion to the department. so that it may adapt the moneys appropriated to the needs of the country as they appear from time to time. but i have no faith in that theory that there is any wonderful mystery connected with the fortifications of america or. of any other country that requires absolute secrecy. there was a time when i thought i would have been guilty of treason if i had mentioned the fact that certain guns that were to be put at a particular point were going to be 12inch guns instead of 6inch guns. but i have discovered that all that i have learned as a member of this committee. and infinitely more than i know or can hope to know. is to be had without the least trouble. and is printed and probably in the possession of every foreign nation on this globe. and most of our talk about secrecy in connection with the fortifications of america is mere nonsense. i hope to see the time come when the estimates made up by the war department in regard to the fortifications of this country will be made so in detail that we will know absolutely at what particular point the money is expected to be expended. the purpose for which it is intended. and just the condition which that particular unit of defense is in.","mr. chairman. i move to strike out the last word. now. mr. chairman. i have no desire to detain the committee beyond the five minutes time which i will have under the rules. but i feel it is my duty to the state of north carolina. which i in part represent. to add my support to that of the gentleman from south carolina in favor of the. appalachian forest reserve and white mountain jxinuary 29. reserve appropriation. in addition to the various resolutions which have been passed. mr. chairman. by the legislatures of the various states. mentioned by the gentleman from south carolina . and the various petitions which have come up to the house of representatives and the numerous newspaper articles in favor of this appropriation. representatives in congress from the states of maryland. west virginia. virginia. north carolina. south carolina. georgia. alabama. tennessee. and kentucky. all of whon are interested in the southern appalachian forest reserve. met in the capitol recently and adopted resolutions indorsing the passage of the bill establishing this and the white mountain reserve. which has been unaniinously reported by the committee on agriculture of this iouse. those resolulions were presented to the speaker of the house. there is not: the slightest disposition on the part of any member interested in the southern appalachian forest reserve. i am sure. in any way improperly or unjustly to criticise the speaker. i have no su(h disposition myself. and i have great respect for the speaker. but i feel it my duty as a southern representative ain every way ii my power to urge the passage of this bill. which has behind it not only the unanimous report of the committee on agriculture. but the sentiment of the people of those states vitally interested ii these forest reserves. now. my amendment proposes. in time event that the house of representatives does not see lit to pass this bill. which has ieen unanimously reported from the committee on agriculture and passed the senate. that at least we should have a survey of these forest reserves in order to get the facts with reference to the area and the extent of these proposed forest reserves as a basis for further action. one of the objections which has ieen urged. mr. chairman. to the immediate passage of the bill establishing the appalachian and white mountain forest reserves. either as a separate bill or as an amendinent to the agricultural appropriation bill. as proposed by the gentleman front south carolinai [mr. leveri. is that the area of land is indefinite and as yet unsurveyed. now. my amendment proposes that \"the sum of $50.000. or so much thereof as may be necessary. be appropriated. to be expended by the secretary of agriculture. vho is to have the assistance of the geological survey and the bureau of forestry. for the purpose of mappi)g out these forest reserves nd determining the acreage suited to * national forestreserve purposes. just what cleared lands the proposed reserves contain. what timber lands they contain. what mineral lands. if any. are included. how many acres are owned by corporations and individuals. and then rdport to congress. if we can not pass time main proposition this congress. we wiho are interested iu the southern appalachian reserve and white mountain reservei should say the the southern appalachian forest reserve. for i offer my amendment without conference vith the representatives froni new englandask that at least 1 irelimiina ry survey be made. ]i urge that the appropriation he made and that the bill reported from the committee omi agriculture be passed. but if that call not be done ii this congress. then. at least. we should have a preliminary survey of the proposed. forest reserves in whih twelve states are interested. the legislature of mny own state passea resolutions recently favoring tihe appalachian reserve. aiid our governor. lion. r. b. glenn. in person presented the resolutions to tile speaker. the idvaiit age and necessity. mr. chairman. of the creation of these forest reserves. to my mind. is very clear. i do not think any question of state rights is involved at -all. i do not think .ny question of the governient going into the lumber business is involved. first. the creation of these reserves is a vise piblic policy. with the increase of the population in this ceuntry has coie the increase ii the consumption of timber. and it has become imperatively necessary that deforestation should lie stopped. and there should be timber reserves for the use of the peyple of the country. the committee say it is in tile public interest that these reserves should be held as permnent sources of timber supply. second. i think the acquisition of these laids by tile governmuent is good business policy. because the tiniber ahich would be reserved for the use of the people of the country is increasing in value all the time. tie western forest reserves. under act of march 3. 1891. are l)roving profitable to the government. third. the creation of these reserves is a necessary policy now or later. the loss of flie forest is followed by that of the soil and constantly recurring floods. the headwaters of many iinportant rivers rise in the appalachian and white mountain ranges. the rainfall of both the appalachian and the white mountain region is heavy. and with the destruction of the forests great torrents of water sweep down from the mountains. which denude the land and convert fertile soil into barren rocks. and therefore it is to the interests of agriculture that deforestation should cease. and that these destructive torrents should be stopped. which have destroyed in the south $18.000.000 worth of property.","mr. speaker. while it may be a piece of indefensible arrogance for the committtee on insular affairs to recommend a proposition that has been turned down by the committee on appropriations. i nevertheless think. from a business standpoint. that this.is a very wise measure. the authority.contined in this bill ought to e granted. gentlemen .have wondered why. if this coal deposit is such a valuable one. private capital had not been enlisted before for its development. and have expressed the opinion that there will be no difliculty in securing private capital for its development in the future. mr. speaker. the very object of this bill is to prevent private corporations from securing control of this coal deposit. the united states government and the government of the philippine islands now buy about 400.000 tons of coal a year. and they are absolutely dependent upon australian and japanese sources for that supply. they are required to payfrom $5 to $6 a ton for an inferior quality of coal. now. suppose a private corporation should secure control of this coal field. holding the key to the situation as it does. in what respect would the government of the united states or the government of the philippine islands be benefited? the governments would be entirely at the mercy of the private corporation. and the very purpose of this bill is to give the government of the united states and the government of the philippine islands relief from that situationto put them in the situation where they can protect themselves against imposition. against monopoly. and against extortion. does anybody undertake to say that any private corporation would buy these coal deposits and develop them for the benefit of the government? the testimony before the committee on insular affairs showed. as my friend from virginia said. that this coal is of the best quality produced in the philippine archipelago. it is the only coal. i think. produced in the orient which can properly be classified as bituminous coal. it is better than the japanese or australian coal. because it contains more carbon and a smaller percentage of sulphur. it is better coal than can be bought elsewhere. we are now paying $5 or $6 a ton for coal used by the two governments. and if the federal government is authorized to buy this coal field and make a lease for its operation and development i think that there can be no doubt that they can get coal at $1.50 a ton and save $500.000 or $600.000 a year to the two governments.","mr. chairman. this is an amendment asking for an appropriation to improve the harbor on the missouri at kansas city. including the mouth of the kaw. now. something has been said in regard to the destruction done by the great flood of 1903 at that place. i want to call the attention of the house to this condition of affairs that exists there today. there were about nineteen bridges across that river in a space there of some 9 or 10 miles. some of these bridges had been authorized under -acts of congress. they all ought to have been constructed under authority of the secretary of war. because the river was a navigable river under the law as it stood. yet neither the secretary of war nor any of the authorities of the government had paid any attention whatever to them. so that the bridges not only were constructed low. but the piers were not sent down to bed rock. and the riprapping was thrown in around the piers. forming practically dikes across the bed of the stream. and this was one of the things which caused the great damage. when that flood came and these bridges were thrown over. nearly all being steel structures. the bridge and bridge trusses particularly fell into the bed of the stream and lodged there and formed great bars across the river and lie there today. forming obstructions in the bed of that stream. the situation is such today that any ordinary flood that comes down the kaw river. such as we have every spring. is bound to be the cause of millions of dollars in damage in that valley. and. as i said before. the valley is filled not only with the terminals of all the great railroad systems centering there. but with the heavy freight business. the warehouses. and the great agriculturalimplement houses that supply the trade of that section of the country. i submit. mr. chairman. that this damage was caused by the neglect of the government. and that the government ought to appropriate the money to at least put the river back in the shape it was before the damage was done.","mr. speaker. the proposition to create a congressional commission. composed of senators and mpmbers of the house. to gather facts and mold policies for our guidance and. incidentally. spend $20.000 is a transparent republican makeshift. designed to relieve a divided republican party from present responsibility. designed to tide over the election. to ease up anteelection promises to the shipsubsidy interests and postelection performance. designed to solace the supercritical official conscience before reelection and to pass the bill when that official conscience is dulled by individual electionii short. to tide over that which political cowardice prevents from being presented now. this is a miserable makeshift of political expediency. this matter has been before the country and the world for thirty years. we have had it in every form. we have looked at it from every point of view. history and statistics teem with its figures and tables. its operation. its rise and fall. the facts have been gathered. the arguments garnered. did the senate act without information when it passed a shipsubsidy bill in the last congress? did the house committee act without light when the democrats on that committee. aided by a few republican members who responded to the call of their constituents. defeated that bill in committee of the house? no one in that congress claimed that the flood of information was not full and enlightening. they did not have and did not need the aid of a mock congressional commission. either to unite the two branches of congress. which should act independently. or to aid them in a bipartisan inquiry. if the republican party wants to pass a shipsubsidy bill. let them introduce their bill and pass it. it has the machinery of the house and the rules committee. let them ram it through. but let it rlin the gantlet of consideration. let us have a roll call and let us see what republican members will stand for ship subsidy. give us your substantive proposition and see whether the states of indiana. iowa.. minnesota. michigan. and wisconsin and the other states will stand for it. and let those who vote for it take and bear the responsibility. for my part i will not permit the republican party unchallenged to shift the responsibility by this transparent subterfuge. or put off the evil day by resorting to this deception on the shipping interests. this duplicity on the voters. let the republican party come out in the open and face the shipping interests on the one hand and the voters on the other. let the members here fish or cut bait in regular order.","chairman of the ways and means committee of the house of representatives. on the 25th of march. 1897. said: mr. chairman. i would tell the house how we propose to reduce revenue when it becomes necessary to do so. but i can only hint at it now. as my reiraining time is so limited. we propose to take off five or six millions a year. of duty on the linen that we import by producing it in this country and not having to pay any duty upon it. because it will not be imported. we propose to raise beet sugar and cane sugar enough in this country to supply all our 73 000.0people. who must have the best in the world. and in that way we will take off $50.000.000 in the course of a few years. on the 19th of july. 1897. mr. payne said: what shall be done with the sugar trust? well. i will tell you what. in my opinion. is the best way of dealing with it. establish a beetsugar factory in every congressional district in the united states. give competition. and lots of it. everywhere. put the farmers over against the trust by passing this bill. and reduce the price of sugar so that german raw sugar can not be brought in to be refined here. gentlemen on the other side come over and help us. while we help the farmers out. [langhter and applause.] you grangers over there. come and help us. you populists that go up and down the streets day after day proclaiming your devotion to the interests of the farmers. help us out now when we are trying to help the farmers in this industry that we can establish so successfully. in this way you will do something toward demolishing the trust. you will accomplish more in this way than by mere invectiveby running windmills and all thht. why should we not produce all of our sugar in this country? why. it costs us. mr. speaker. about one hundred millions. we were looking around for proper subjects for taxation. we knew that sugar would produce an enormous revenue. and besides all that. we knew that an adequate protective tariff would build up the industry in this country. and as it was gradually built up the revenue from that source will be reduced. by and by the revenue will come in more largely from other sources. and when this industry is fully established and revenue from sugar ceases. the reduction will keep pace with the increase. the thing will regulate itself. we will not disturb our tariff in the next quarter of a century. i think i shall refer to that when i come to another feature of this bill. the pledge that you have made in it that there shall not be any change in this tariff business for five years. i believe at the very next session of congress from the committee there came in some proposition to change the tariff. mr. grosvenor said on the 24th of march of that year: there 4s not a principle involved in its formation. not a condition suggested in its ramifcations. not a rate or duty. not a principle of tariff taxation that has not been protested against by the sugar trust and fought to the bitter end before the committee on ways and means. upon the same day mr. grosvenor said: we propose that instead of sending $125.000.000 a year to the foreign countries of the world. most of which goes to pay labor in the production of sugar. we will make it possible for every pound of sugar that we want to be produced in the united states of america. [a)pplause.] the republican party comes and offers to the agriculturists of this country this magnificent boon. we will protect the industries of the country in al directions from further demoralization. and we ask you to turn aside hundreds of thousands of acres of the splendid lands of all of these states frous the production of corn. oats. wheat. potatoes. and cotton. to be put into an already overstocked market. to the production of sugar. and give to the farmers upon the farming lands of the country a better market. with less competition. than they now have. mr. steele. of indiana. on march 25. said: with regard to sugar. i predict that if the tariff fixed by this bill is unchanged for a period of ten years we will at the end of that time be producing not only enough for our own consumption. but as much as we care to export. and at very little additional cost to the consumer. mr. david b. henderson. in an interview published in a newspaper in the state of illinois. put himself on record as strongly in favor of the beetsugar industry. he said: one of the great questions before congress is. \"what are we going to do for cuba?\" those contending for cuba want a reduction of 50 per cent or a clean sweep of duties between us and that country. contending for this doctrine is. first. the american sugar trust. which is here in the person of its ablest managers. second. the money. the capital. that has been put into the construction of railroads in cuba. where a system of railroads extending along what may be termed the backbone of the island. with arms extending from the backbone into each part of it. is in process of construction. all the money in this enterprise. of course. is anxious to build up the commerce of cuba. third. there are millions of dollars that have gone into cuba buying up plantations. cheap lands. and. with large syndicates formed. are seeking to make fortunes out of the sugar industry. then. again. there are americans over there with vast sums of money in various enterprises who are all anxious for this. then. again. the cubans. themselvs who have the capital are anxious to have freetrade relations with the united states. these all touch elbows and are working together. on the other hand. the beetsugar industry of the united states and the canesugar industry are fighting most vigorously against any reduction. the beetsugar industry has developed to a wonderful extent. and so much so in the states of california. colorado. nebraska. wisconsin. and michigan that the delegations from those states have their faces set vigorously. firmly. and most determinedly against any reduction. their contention being that for the first time in the history of the country the farmer finds a most direct interest in protection. they stand upon the doctrine of protection. the secretary bf agriculture tells me that every acre of land in iowa is capable of raising the sugar beet. and this is true of every state throughout the west and in the mississippi valley. i have never expressed an opinion against doing something. whatever we possibly can. to strengthen the hand of cuba. i have stood side by side with the president and the ways and means committee. trying to devise some plan to do this without injuring the farmers of our country and at the same time give encouragement to cuba. the conten-. tion is brought to us from our own people that we have shed blood and money enough for cuba nowan iidependent government. so to speak without slaughteing the farming interests of our country. and the most intense feeling exists. i doubt if with all the combined influences we have to bring to hear we can dislodge or change the views of the states that i have named that are operating in the beetsugar industrywithout sufficient force to carry the house. it may be that we can hit upon some other plan and harmonize matters. (moline mail. arch 12.)","mr. chairman. an appeal. made. i have no doubt. in good faith. of the kind that the gentleman from arizona has made. is always effective. and sometimes runs away with the judgment by exciting the sympathies. that there are indians in arizona there is no doubt. that they are as well off there as the average in other territories. substantially. there is no doubt. better off in many respects than the indians way up toward the northern boundary. the fortyninth parallel. and not perhaps as well off as the indians are in new york. where for many generations they have lived with the humane white farmer all about them. but i never have understood that even with all that good chance and good provision for them that they are entirely selfsupporting or entirely the equal of the white farmer around them. now. i want the attention of the committee just for a moment to see what this proposition is. i hold in my hand water supply and irligation papers. issued by the united states geological survey. no. 33. ihave not been able to read it very closely. and yet i have dogeared it. i have done for this investigation what we are all compelled to do. with so many things to do. taken a hop. skip. and jump through it. and i find substantially the following facts to be true: this is to construct. i believe. if it should go on. a reservoir at a favorable point near the san carlos indian agency for storing the flood waters of the river. and so on. and so on. now i believe if this appropriation is made it is first proposed in the beginning to constuct what is called the san carlos dam. the san carlos dam. according to the estimate here. would cost $1.038.000 in round numbers. that is for the mere dam. without anything else now for irrigation. i read on a little further in this report and i find that this reservoir will last. when the dam is constructed. twentynine years in round numbers. thatis to say. that the silt from the river will fill it up in twentynine years.","swamp navigation. then. strange. startling. you have not water to run in the river until you dig artesian wells at the head of it. i will stay here until this time tomorrow night. if need be. to prevent that item from going on the statute books of the united states. and i think it is the duty of every senator in this chamber. measured by my view. to join me in the effort. mr. president. $4.000.000 for trinity river. starting in at the mouth with 3 feet of watera river full of logs. do not fail to remember that the first thing to be done with this river is to burn all the logs or destroy all the logs on the slopes leading down to the river. and. i suppose. cut the timber off. so that other logs will not bother you in the future. when you have done that. of course. you must burn the brush. because the brush might get in the river. would it not be necessary? of course. it is a narrow. crooked little stream evidently. in which logs jam readily. after you have taken the brush off the hillsides and piled them on the logs and burned all the logs on both sides of the stream for 135 miles. you must then start inno. i believe under the engineers report you take a rest at that time and wait until the stream goes dry and then burn the logs that you find on the bottom of the stream. as a senator behind me suggests. they would need about all the water in the stream to get up steam in the boilers. but let me not be understood as overstating this report. mark the statement of the engineer. he states thatfor the proper improvement of the river it will first be necessary to cut down and remove all timber along the banks which would be likely to be washed into the river in times of flood. that is one proposition. secondto remove. by burning during low water. all drift that has collected in the bed of the stream. and to remove all snags froni the stream. which work would give a clean river from dallas to the mouth. making it possible for lightdraft steamers to traverse the entire distance at high water. and for intermittent navigation. he then proceeds to say: but by canalizing the river by means of locks and dams. with the addition of an artificial water supply in the upper reaches of the river. to be obtained by storing surplus water during the wet season. or by sinking additional artesian wellsi assume they have some artesian wells there at present. and yet the stream goes dryso dry that this engineer thinks we could burn the logs in the bottom of it during the dry season. a slight computation will show that the $4.000.000 to be spent on this project. upon which we are to enter. would buy i do not know how many pounds of cotton. cotton is probably worth 10 cents a pound. i do not know what the market price of it is at the present time. but it is easy to compute that it would buy a very large amount of cotton. hence it will probably take the cotton crop of half a dozen counties in the state of arkansas to make up the tax that will have to be paid for this foolish and silly enterprise. it will take the wheat crop of a congressional district in the state of minnesota. it will keep a goodsized army of working men toiling day in and day out for a year to make the money to pay the taxes to build this trifling. silly improvement. mr. president. it is difficult to be patient with an item of this kind. i wish to give due credit to this honorable body. i wish especially to give thanks to the senate committee for striking out the item of $50.000 appropriated for this river. that was the appropriation to begin the work as it came to this body. the senate committee cut that item down to $12.500. and the limit was sought to be placed upon it for the aggregate work of $556.657. \"exclusive of the amount herein and heretofore appropriated.\" it would seem that that limitation of something over a half million dollars would protect the government. but such is not the case. it would until that amount had been spent. whereupon. with much force. indeed. some one would come up from that district and insist that inasmuch as we had spent more than a half million dollars cutting the logs off the hillside. burning the brush. cleaning up the bed of the stream. burning the logs there in dry time. it was eminently proper that we should follow up this half million dollars with the full amount estimated by the engineer as necessary to accomplish anything at this point. the half million dollar item here provided would. according to the engineer. barely clean out the river. he says \"for cleaning the river. $500.000.\" when you have spent the $500.000 you will have burned the logs on the bank. and probably you will have burned the logs in the channel of the stream. but the estimate goes on to say that is of no avail. you must have locks and movable dams. or else the $500.000 spent in cleaning the stream will have been utterly wasted. you can not afford to throw away the $500.000. here you have a great stream. trinity river. cleaned up. the logs taken from the banks and from the channel of the stream. then you must have 37 dams. and when you undertake to get the 37 dams you must spend $3.700.000. after you have the dams erected. you have not anything to put in them. so you must dig artesian wells up at the head of the stream to get some water to fill the space above the dam. then you have to have a hundred thousand dollars for bank protectionwhatever that may mean. then for dredging. $25.000. after we have dug the artesian wells. built the 37 locks.cleaned out the stream. and burned the logs. and have our four millions invested in trinity river. you will have saddled upon the government of the united states an everlasting expense in keeping it dredged and keeping the locks in repair. how much is it going to cost each year? on this one item alone this bill should fail. let us get down to the mouth of the brazos river: continuing improvement. $30.000. i suppose that is more of a river. let us see what the engineer says about it. he says: the river and harbor act approved march 8. 1899. contains the following item: \"mouth of brazos river. texas: for dredging and such other work as may be deemed most effective in the judgment of the secretary of war in improving and developing the harbor. $85.000: provided. that no part of said sum shall be expended until the brazes river channel and dock company shall file with the secretary of war a transfer to the united states of the jetties and auxiliary works. also a release of all rights and privileges conferred upon said company by its charter or by the act of congress approved august 9. 1888. to charge or collect tolls for the use and navigation of said river. and the secretary of war is directed to have an examination made of the mouth of the brazos and the jetties and report to congress the estimated cost of extending the jetties onehalf mile. and the estimated depth and width of the channel to be obtained by such extension. and the estimated cost of obtaining 20 feet of water and a channel 150 feet wide.\" this is a former item approved. and a contract was entered into. \"(a) estimated cost of extending the jetties onehalf mile. $1.100.000. in addition to $165.000 required under existing project for repairing and completing the present jetties. the estimate being based upon the supposition that the extension work can be placed under one contract. \"(b) the extension of the jetties onehalf mile would not of itself improve the channel. but if supplemented by dredging and a system of spur dikes to contract the channel to about 440 feet between jetties. estimated to cost $200.000. a channel depth of 20 feet and width of 150 feet could be practically constantly maintained by an expenditure of $30.000 annually. \"(e) estimated costof obtaining 20 feet of water and a channel 150 feet wide: 1) b ietty extension. spur dikes. and dredging. $1.300.000. and $30.000 annually or maintenance. or (2) by dredging alone. $375.000. and $40.000 annually for maintonance.\" in the opinion of captaii riehid. concurred in by the division engineer. the best method of improvement is by dredging alone. the report was transmitted to congress and printed in house document no. 652. fiftysixth congress. first session. also page 2426. report of engineers for 1900. now we have brazos river again. these millions roll up:","i rise. sir. not to address myself in a general way upon this river and harbor bill. but to speak specifically upon some phases of the improvement to the hudson river. in which the people of my district are commonly interested. no little pleasure has been mine. sir. as i sat in my seat during the past few days and listened to ridicule and irony heaped upon the merits and claims of river after river mentioned in this bill. and noted that none of my colleagues belittled the claims and merits of \"our beautiful hudson.\" though two of them sitting near me now. sir. are whispering to me. in the parlance of a popular song. that the hudson \"is getting more than is coming to it.\" were it not. sir. that these same two croakers at my elbow here are friends of mine and a little disgruntled because no money is appropriated to skunk creek in the district of one. and not a cent to muskrat pond in the district of the other. i would call upon them to entertain this house with the delightful minstrel performance of drawing a deadly parallel between their streams. upon whose waters no boats float save those of boys who sail toy ships at the end of a string. and the hudson. which is a vast estuary of the atlantic ocean. rather than a mere flow of purling waters or an outlet of mountain rivulets. it may be. sir. that my friends here have forgotten the geography of their schoolboy days. and if this be their sad condition i gladly remind them that the immense mississippi of which they have talked so verbosely the last few days. even at the great cities of st. louis and new orleans. looks insignificant when compared with the hudson at the small settlements of tarrytown and haverstraw. and. sir. if those congressmen who make allembracing claims for the mississippi would but turn back the pages of history they would find that hendrick hudsons trip up the hudson was but prophetic of its future. he was looking for a route to the pacific. true. he did not find it. but he did find the onlypass in the blue ridge through which tide water ebbs and flowsfor. men of the west. your studies in geology must have taught you that the highlands of the hudson are the eastern portals to the valley of the mississippi. and that the hudson points its index finger toward the west in commerce as well as in geological formation. every other route to the banks of the mississippi has mountains from 1.000 to2.000 feet toclimb. but through the valley of the hudson lies a natural highway. which governor clinton. of new york. completed by overcoming a few feet of grade to the level of lake erie above niagara. and which will be further completed some day in the near future by the construction of a ship canal. the importance. sirs. of the hudson river as a great waterway of commerce will be reflected in its naked truth when you remember. members of this house. that it absorbs all the traffic of the erie. champlain. and delaware and hudson canals. besides the great coal trade of the pennsylvania coal company at newburgh and the erie coal trade at piermont. why. sirs. the local com.merce of the hudson river in 1897 was 3.682.864 tons. in 1898 it was 4.045.895 tons. in 1899 it was 5.070.800 tons. and in addition to this local commerce it carries each year a through commerce of not less than 10.000.000 tons. that it is also a great avenue of travel is shown by the fact that in 1899 it carried 1.278.000 passengers. in the face of these facts and figures. is it any wonder that this bill carries an item of $200.000 for continuing the work of improvement? it would be a matter of greater wonderment if it carried any less sum. and it will be a matter of still greater wonderment if this house should refuse to pass this appropriation. to my mind the sum ought to be more than $200.000. and if any efforts of mine can bring it about. an additional sum for improvements in the hudson will be tacked on some other appropriation bill passed by this house during this session. in a plea for the missouri river one of the gentlemen from missouri has glowingly pictured the beauties of that stream. if beauty has any weight for an appropriation in this debate. i would like to remind this house that in his story of the virginians thackeray gives the verdict of beauty to the hudson over the rhine. and that in one of his essays george william curtis. in speaking of the hudson. says: the danube has in parts glimpses of such grandeur. the elbe has sometimes such delicately penciled effects. but no european river is so lordly in its bearing. none flows in such state to the sea. as the hudson. in a scientific sense. too. sirs. has the hudson its claim upon this house. for it was through its waters that the first steamboat on this side of the atlantic ever furrowed its way. inasmuch as the iesthetic has come to the front in this debate and a place has been given to beauty and science. we may as well go the gentleman from missouri a point or two better and take in literature and history. all students know that there is no stream in the united states around which poetry and romance so strangely blend with the heroic and the historic as they do around the hudson. no river where the waves of civilization have left so many waifs upon its banks. from its birth in the adirondacks to its marriage with the sea at new york bay the hudson river is a stretch of classic ground. sirs. it is the poets corner of this country. the authors paradise. the inventors inspiration. the artists source of soulthe home of morris. willis. and evans. the home of field. fulton. and morse. the home of church. cole. and audubon. of early historic lore the hudson has a wealth. it is needless to state here that at the beginning of the revolution new york was already among the foremost seaports. and the hudson valley the most populous and important highway to the interior north of the delaware. and had an especial strategic value from the fact that it furnished a direct water route between the southern seacoast and the english strongholds in canada. its possession. therefore. was of vital importance to the american patriots since. if they lost it. new england would be separated by the enemy from the southern colonies. during the who!e war a struggle for the possession of the hudson went on. and many of the most thrilling and important operations of both armies were conducted in this valley. beginning with the capture of forts ticonderoga and crown point in may. 1775. and continuing down to the defeat of burgoyne at saratoga in october. 1777. and the treason of arnold linked with arrest and execution of andre in 1780. so. sirs. if intangible accessories to rivers are to be listened to in this debate. you should hearken carefully to the eloquent words of utility. of commerce. of travel. of literature. of beauty. and of history for a constant improvement and a careful guardianship of the interests of the hudson river. these general remarks. sirs. but pave the way to the special target of my aim in this speech. as it is the duty of this government to foster the advantages of its great waterways for commerce. so comes it as a corollary to this duty that it is an obligation upon the government to prevent these avenues of commerce from becoming at any time a menaceto property and a destroyer of life. the force of this contention has been recognized by this government in its construction of levees along the mississippi. and in its efforts to keep other rivers from jumping their banks and spreading devastation in the course of their wild cavortings in realms where they belongeth not. what i intend to ask. sirs. is that this principle be applied in a mild way to the hudson at albany. nowhere in this bill is there any clause seeking to put an end to the wholesale destruction of property at the capital city of the empire state which has been caused for years by the hudson when its waters are swollen and turgid. almost impossible is it to count the thousands and thousands of dollars worth of property destroyed there last spring and the spring before by the waters of the hudson inundating the lower portion of the business part of the city. i know that some may contend that the government can not stop freshets. no. i know it can not. but i do know that this government is just as much under obligations to try to harness and check such performances on the part of the hudson as it is to do the same thing along the mississippi. albany is entitled. sirs. to as much consideration as any city on the banks of that great western waterway. and its property just as much deserving of protection. when things come to such a pass that a river so overjumps its banks as to tie up the street railways of a city. to deprive it of electric lighting. and to transform a portion of its business locality into a second venice it is time for the government to step in and try and put an end to such a condition of affairs. and. sirs. this duty becomes doubly imperative when the pilings which the government has placed in certain parts of the river to protect the channel contribute in a more or less degree to the effects which bring about these annual floodings. there is something wrong somewhere that causes this destruction of property. and it seems but fair that the government should take some steps to find this wrong and to right it. this is all i ask. mr. speaker. and at the proper time i intend to have offered an amendment to this bill. ordering a preliminary examination from troy to coeymans. with a view of finding a plan to prevent this wholesale destruction of property at albany. and i trust the amendment will prevail. last session i received assurances from official sources that such an examination. with this purpose in view. would be made. but. sirs. so important is this matter that i think it justifiable to make assurance doubly sure. and so i plead with you to make my amendment an organic part of this bill. justice asks that you should do this. the spirit of a fair field to all and special favors to none demands that you do this for the hudson at albany as a miniature reflection of what you have done in a larger way for other rivers with threatened cities on their banks. the voice of progress. always pleading for every movement to protect property. begs you to vote for this amendment and the good work which it proposes. the examination asked for by this amendment will cost the government but little. if it discloses that nothing can be done to better affairs. all well and good. as what can not be cured must be endured. but i hold that an examination will disclose that the government can put an end to this destruction of property at a very small expense. and for that reason i trust the amendment will be adopted wherein this house authorizes the examination to be made. last session. mr. speaker. it was my pleasure to work for an appropriation of $400.000 for the hudson river. and the excellent manner in which that money was spent for the benefit of commerce is ably shown in the report of the competent and conservative chief of engineers. that the $200.000 appropriated by this bill will be as advantageously expended for the interests of the government needs no assurance to anyone familiar with the able men who preside over the work done on that river. and now. mr. speaker. in conclusion. let me paya little tribute to that grand river that i and all in my part of the country love so well. and surely such a tribute is not out of place in a discussion of the river and harbor bill. the hudson has been well treated by this government in appropriations for improvements. but no better than its commercial worth and its manifold claims deserve. the hudson. sir. is a noble threshold to a great continent. in varied grandeur and sublimity it has no peer among the rivers of the world. alongside of its beauty. sunrise on the bay of naples and sunset at the golden gate of san francisco lose their luster and their charm. strip the banks of the rhine of their castles and there is no comparison between the two rivers. why. sir. from dusseldorf to manheim the rhine is only thirteen or fourteen hundred feet wide. while the hudson from new york to albany averages more than 5.000 feet from bank to bank. at tappan sea the hudson is ten times as wide as the rhineat any point above cologne. at bonn the rhine is barely onethird of a mile. whereas the hudson at haverstraw bay is over 4 miles in width. surely. such a river as this should at once be an object of care and devotion from this government. other congressmen have presented you with pictures and descriptions of their rivers. let me give you two of the hudson. the first is by willis. and runs back to the time when the days of chivalry were just giving way to the days of discovery: fancy hendrick hudson steering his little yacht. the flaalve man. for the first time through the -lighlands of the hudson. imagine his anxiety for the channel forgotten. as he gazed up at the towering rocks and round the green shores. and onward past point and opening bend. miles away into the heart of the country. yet with no lessening of the glorious stream before him and no decrease of promise in the bold and luxuriant shores. picture him lying at anchor below newburg. with the dark pass of the weygat frowning behind him. the lofty and blue catskills beyond. and the hillsides around covered with lords of the soil exhibiting only less wonder than friendliness. the other picture. sirs. is more modern. it is that of an october day on the hudson. by talmage: along the river and up and down the sides of the great hills there was an indescribablo mingling of gold and orange and crimson and saffron. now sobering into drab and maroon. now flaring up into solferino and scarlet. here and there the trees looked as if their tips had blossomed into fire. in the morning light the forests seemed as if they had been transfigured. and in the evening hours they looked as if the sunset had burst and dropped upon the leaves. it seemed as if the sea of divine glory had dashed its surf to the top of the crags and it had come dripping down to the lowest leaf and deepest cavern. the catskills and the palisadestongue can not tell or pencil picture their beauties. what one can fail to say about them can be dreamed of when seen. if not seen. they can not be appreciated even in dreams. and. sirs. as the gentleman from missouri fell back on a poet to tell about the glories of his river. i propose to give him a roland for his oliver. and let oliver wendell holmes speak for-"]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n
